<html><head><title>CES: Publications: Horace: 9-2: Lessons from Essential School Reform</title></head><body><hr><h1><center>What Works, What Doesn't: Lessons from Essential School Reform</center></h1><hr><center>Volume 9, Number 2     <br>November 1992</center><hr>                           What lessons have Essential School people learned after eight years in the trenches of whole-school reform?  Ask two dozen veterans, as we did--teachers, principals, district and state administrators, researchers, and organizers--and you'll get five times that many answers.  Like iron filings on a magnetic surface, the lessons they describe cluster and shiver and overlap, forming loose patterns made up of experience, strategy, and just plain advice.  Many of them have been learned in other contexts and other times, and are well documented in the literature of school change.  Others resemble hunches more than proven facts, their shapes emerging from growing observations as yet unquantified. <p>   We gather a few of these lessons here, intended not as graven tablets but as jottings from the field.  If you want to get over there, they say, this route worked for us.  Don't try that, we saw it backfire.  Stay away; there's a swamp in that direction.  That path looks hard but it gets better just beyond the hill.  Often ambiguous, sometimes downright contradictory, such gleanings remind us that on the journey of change, terrain and climate differ from place to place.  Common sense and improvisation sometimes get one farther than textbook strategies; taking bigger risks may well yield bigger gains.<p>   The only thing to do with good advice, Oscar Wilde once quipped, is pass it on. "It is never of use to oneself," he dourly added.  Maybe so.  The Coalition and Re:Learning, as Phil Schlechty of Louisville's Gheens Academy has observed, are on "the cutting edge of ignorance."  But it helps to share these things. If they complicate our thinking, then good; that is what Essential Schools stand for.  If they jolt us into new action, all the better.  In an effort that depends upon reflection, one cannot go wrong by pondering what colleagues have to say.  Their voices, distilled here into lessons large and small, are what follows.<p><hr><h2>Change efforts fail without the support of all key stakeholders from the     start.</h2><hr> Many schools have struggled with roadblocks put up by teachers, parents, and students with special interests in existing programs from AP courses to sports.  What comes out clearly, both in Coalition experience and in other educational research, is the strength an effort gains when all those actors have a fully legitimate part early on in the process of change.<p>   But even with these players on board, others must be drawn in equally early.  "We've learned to connect with <i>everything</i> that's going on in the state educational world, so the establishment cannot live without us," says Judy Duval at the New Mexico Re:Learning effort. Delaware's Robert Hampel, who has observed Re:Learning in that state since its inception in 1989, agrees. "You have to be politically savvy about boards of education, university admissions officers, every important political group," he warns.  "Don't get so busy with workshops that you lose touch with key people whose support is vital."<p>   Such a tactic must go beyond rhetoric and philosophy, notes Judy Bray, who works with Re:Learning at the Education Commission of the States (ECS) in Denver. "It's as hard for administrators in state and district systems to change as it is for teachers and schools," she observes. "Ideas and research aren't enough to change practices and policies at that level; you have to carve out resources and time for reflective work at every level." <p>        Only by working simultaneously from the bottom up and the top down, moving forward on many fronts at once, will change efforts take hold and deepen, observe Donna Muncey and Patrick McQuillan, who recently completed a five-year ethnographic study of Essential School change. "Piecemeal reforms fail," concludes CES chairman Theodore Sizer.  "No school is an island."<p><hr><h2>Get consensus on the <i>need</i> for change before you start--then begin working toward a common understanding of what that change will mean.</h2><hr>Do your crucial "whether to" work at the start, says CES researcher Rick Lear; but don't confuse it with the "how to" work that follows.  One is a decision about ideas and principles; once it's made, schools go farther when they don't revisit that decision.  The other is a fatiguing and often frustrating discussion about technique and structure, on which a school community may take years to reach consensus.<p>   Remembering that change is not politically neutral is a key part of this lesson, warn ethnographers Muncey and McQuillan.  Although the rhetoric of change may suggest that it's good for everyone, they observe, in practice some parties will be perceived as winning and others as losing.  If only a select vanguard of faculty participates in new ways, attention shifts from the ideas themselves to their political aspects, which can quickly swamp the momentum for change. Instead, schools do better if the entire faculty is talking about the same ideas, going through the same professional development experiences, meeting the same visitors, and making decisions together about how to proceed.<p>   "Whole-group learning is more powerful than splinter groups or individual teachers separately pursuing topics of interest," says Patricia Wasley, who heads CES's School Change Study. "The dilemma is how to provide the multiple points of entry that are especially important to a large high school faculty, at the same time working for a shared understanding of what the whole group is doing."  Agreeing what to focus on, though it may not be every teacher's first choice, helps a school move faster because it builds shared values and common ideas, she believes. Multiple entry points are natural and desirable, Rick Lear emphasizes, the product of different learning styles--as long as everyone remains actively committed to making the change happen.<p>   "If I had it to do over I would retrain <i>everyone</i> from the start, not begin with a small number and then expand," says Marian Finney, Essential School coordinator at Baltimore's Walbrook High School, one of the Coalition's charter schools. "It wasn't until three summers ago that we started setting up our summer offerings to train anyone who would come."  Joe McDonald, who directs CES's Exhibition Project, agrees.  "Schools shortchange themselves by trying to choose between breadth and depth," he says. "Getting the two in balance from the start has proved very important."<p><hr><h2>Don't be afraid to get conflict out in the open. </h2><hr> Schools that have learned to manage and negotiate conflict move further and faster than those who avoid a fight, Essential school veterans agree.  Conflict generated by naysayers is one of the key blocks to change, ethnographers Muncey and McQuillan soberly conclude, and ignoring it gets schools nowhere.<p>   The enemy, Muncey suggests, is hearsay, and the solution is unrestricted communication--common ground for faculty to talk about, and common expectations as to what they'll be held accountable for. "Gather perceptions constantly from all directions," she says. "Don't be afraid of people voicing and defending strong opinions."<p>   The manager of school change plays a key role inthis process, both within the school and between the staff and the larger system. "In the schools where change is zooming along," Muncey observes, "the principal shields the teachers from politics they don't have to deal with, and makes sure they understand the politics they do have to deal with." Too much direct exposure to outside criticism and bureaucratic roadblocks, for instance, can demoralize a faculty. Within the school, though, a good manager will quietly combat the notion that Essential school teachers are the only ones doing good things. <p>   "Focus on communicating across the factions, even if that seems very difficult," she urges. "It‘s a subtle thing--a coordinator might publicly praise a non-involved teacher, for example, for something she did in her class that reflected Essential school ideas."<p>   Ironically, the ethnographic study points out, communication between the vanguard for change and the outside community is often better than that within the school itself. Turn the same skills inward, observers say, and progress is more likely.<p><hr><h2>People can't take too much change in the midst of change.</h2><hr> The downfall of a fledgling Essential school can be a shift in leadership, especially if the effort has depended on a strong principal or superintendent for support.  Schools with a more collegial ethos withstand such changes much better, but getting to shared leadership presents its own problems: the old hierarchical model of principals' behavior dies hard.<p>   The most stable schools have provided authentic leadership roles for teachers, training the entire staff in shared decisionmaking. Extensive coaching for principals in the ideas and practices of Essential schools is also crucial, argues Dorothy Magett, who until last year headed reform programs for the state of Illinois and particularly for Chicago. "Principals must come to understand what the critical thinking process and its product look like," she says.<p>   Equally important, Magett notes, central offices must commit not to disrupt a school staff by unnecessary transfers as it works for change. "Once we dedicate money so teachers can sit down together and plan, they need a chance to stay together long enough to reap the benefits of the work they have done," she declares.<p>   On the state and district policy level, stability also plays a crucial role in Essential school success. Re:Learning's Judy Bray warns against establishing separate funding and administrative structures to facilitate only Essential schools; these policies prove fragile, she says, in the face of leadership changes, staff turnover, and state budget troubles. Because the aim is changing the whole system, Ted Sizer agrees, a "waiver mentality" can backfire; instead, state policies and practices must shift to support a range of reform initiatives including Essential schools.<p><hr><h2>Though changes at the individual classroom level do revitalize teachers, they     are not enough to drive schoolwide change. </h2><hr>Focusing on pedagogical changes like "student-as-worker" has the benefit of engaging teachers and students more fully in their work. But such efforts have little wider effect unless they are overtly linked at the outset with structural changes in the whole school--lowering the student load for teachers, instituting schoolwide exhibitions, revamping curriculum, or changing the schedule. Muncey's and McQuillan's ethnographic study concluded this in no uncertain terms, and seasoned Coalition people agree. "We've learned that everything important affects everything else important," says Ted Sizer. "You can't separate curriculum, assessment, instruction, and schedule."<p>   This lesson has many important strategic implications for Essential schools--foremost among them the "planning backwards" process the Coalition now strongly advocates. "Decide what you want students to know and be able to do, then reorient and integrate your systems as necessary," says Joe McDonald. "Don't start with specific competencies in particular subjects; start with a single constructive act that is unbounded by disciplines--writing, inquiry, discussion of texts, problem-solving, experimentation." Where schools have done this (as at Chicago's seminar-based Sullivan High School, for example), the strands of curriculum, pedagogy, assessment, and schedule interweave to support the whole school's transformation.<p>   Building a common curriculum around "essential questions" also reflects this lesson.  Without such unifying techniques, even an "interdisciplinary" curriculum with teacher teams can fail utterly to draw in new pedagogy and assessment practices, and ultimately restricts the student's intellectual experience. "When people figure out what the essential questions are, they become less discipline-centered," says Patricia Wasley. "This in turn causes teachers to think about what's important for kids to know and do, rather than about mere coverage."<p>   Like so many of these lessons, this one comes back to looking at Essential school change as systemic, rather than piecemeal.  Viewing new classroom methods as separate and isolated acts allows participants to regard them as among a smorgasbord of possibilities change-seekers can choose from, not a fundamental shift that will transform the entire system. "A school cannot be successful if it tries to do several things at once without making each authentically integrated with the others," says Paula Evans, who heads the Coalition's National Re:Learning Faculty. "When you take on too many new projects simultaneously, people don't have the energy to do it all. They revert to the old argument of the shopping-mall high school--'If I don't want to work on one thing I can work on another, or I don't have to work on any.'"<p><hr><h2>Essential school change takes more time and resources than you think--stick      it out. </h2><hr>School reformers at every level are learning the hard way how much their efforts cost and how long they take. A dogged patience seems to be part of the bargain, giving schools the time to move steadily along the continuum of change--planning, moving along, stopping to reflect, reevaluating decisions, taking stock, and trying new things.<p>   This lesson has implications at two levels. Within the schools, as Deborah Meier of New York City's Central Park East Secondary School points out, teachers need time and support to develop new ways of viewing teaching and learning, new classroom habits, and newly collegial work styles. "Teamwork, for example, doesn't automatically happen by setting up a planning period," says Paula Evans. "It takes time, training, and coaching. And as the level of complexity of change increases, we've learned, support must also increase." Even the best summer workshop is not enough, Evans argues; teachers need continuous and sustained professional development during both the school year and the summer.<p>   At the district and state level, the challenge is to fund and foster that work throughout the crucial period when change is taking hold. "It is not possible to have a good fix on the duration of that period," contends Chicago's Dorothy Magett. "To say ‘It takes five years,' as Illinois Re:Learning did when we started, only short-circuits the effort--it makes you rush in to start, try to finish this stage and that stage, when you don't quite know what is entailed. Coalition membership must be perceived as the beginning of an ongoing relationship that will characterize the way the school is run forever, not as some innovation with starting points, benchmarks, and a predetermined ending point. You can't just incubate it for five years and then come out as a butterfly."<p>   So how much does it take? "You need three to four years of $20,000 to $40,000 a year just to bring people to the work, the books, the sites, to give them time to argue out what they want configured in their schools," says ECS policy analyst Bob Palaich. "If you don't allow them that luxury it's not going to work. They've got to reach a critical mass where they can start moving existing resources around." Ted Sizer, who has long argued that once change takes hold Essential schools can operate at no more than 10 percent above their current levels, would put even more money into research and development than Palaich estimates. "Early on, Dennis Littky calculated that in his small school [in Thayer, New Hampshire] they needed an extra $125,000 a year to start, and by now it would be more," Sizer says. "That would pay for two to three weeks' additional time a year for teachers, summer stipends for a quarter of the faculty, a few overstaffed ‘empty chairs' during the year to allow for teachers to travel and learn."<p>   Fiscally strapped schools that find such projections daunting might look to Baltimore's Walbrook High School for a lesson in financial ingenuity. "Marian Finney is a whiz at getting grants from everyplace under the sun," says former CES staffer Amy Gerstein, now a consultant to the Coalition in California. "She'll tell you, ‘If we weren't so poor we wouldn't be so good at grantwriting.'" Walbrook applies for everything, Gerstein notes--"but they always make the use of grant money consistent with their Essential School program. If you're going to apply for aerospace funds, focus the grant on your larger goals."<p>   Ted Sizer speaks caustically of the "grotesque contrast" between public expenditures and the R&D needs of school change efforts. "It's instructive that Chris Whittle's Edison Project is spending $60 million just to get the outlines of the earliest pre-schools and primary schools designed," he says. But even Essential schools with bare minimum budgets have seen progress by taking bold steps to redeploy the dollars they have. In the grip of California's fiscal crisis, Gerstein says, "there are still schools that amaze me with their tenacity. If you decide to do it no matter what, you'll take what's in the pot and spend it in new ways."<p><hr><h2>Workshops don't fundamentally change school practice. </h2><hr> The most successful Essential schools, observers say, have virtually no use for the traditional "staff development" scenario where outside experts conduct periodic workshops on subjects determined by the central office. Instead these schools take teacher learning experiences into their own hands, arranging the long-term coaching they need to carry out the work they have decided on.<p>   This insight plays out in several Coalition strategies. One is the National Re:Learning Faculty's effort to establish "longer, more intensive, more stable relationships between practitioners and schools," as director Paula Evans describes it. Principals and teachers selected for the National Faculty work with their own and neighboring schools to mentor and reflect on change efforts over time. In a similar strategy, schools that participate in the Coalition's year-long "Trek" process are paired with a nearby school as "critical friends." And finally, the Coalition is working to establish regional mechanisms and networks that would make it easier for schools to visit and consult each other as partners in change.<p>    Travel to other schools does help, experience shows, especially if there is a nearby Essential school that is truly far along. "Sometimes you can't get people to talk about a thing until they've seen an example of it," says ECS's Bob Palaich. "If you see it, you can imagine it; if not, you won't consider it a possibility." But many visitors also experience insecurity and defensiveness when they compare their own progress to others', Rick Lear observes. "It takes a long time to get past that so schools can share freely," he says.<p>   Walbrook's Marian Finney considers her faculty's critical friendships a key factor in the school's progress.  "The few days we spent at Paschal High School in Fort Worth before we started was one of our most valuable experiences," she says. "Now we work closely with six other schools in Baltimore." National Faculty teacher Cheri Dedmon speaks wistfully of the professional isolation her colleagues have experienced at Hixson High School in Chattanooga, Tennessee. "We're doing our own stuff--we're alone in the city, the state, the region," she says. "The closest Essential schools are in Atlanta and Mississippi, and nobody's spending money to send us there."<p>   Another strategy to weave professional development into the fabric of school life involves fostering critical friendships within the school itself. "Teachers need to watch each other teach, look at kids' work that they don't have to grade themselves," says Joe McDonald. Walbrook has set aside a large room in the school as its "Center for Change," where faculty members regularly meet and work with visitors or consultants, view videotapes, and share professional conversations.  And many successful Essential schools arrange periodic weekend staff retreats for planning and reflection.<p><hr><h2>Take the initiative in setting standards and documenting your performance.  </h2><hr>This applies, Essential schools have learned, both to student achievement and to benchmarks for the change effort overall. "In the first year or two there's a grace period," observes Delaware's Bob Hampel. "Then people want to know. If you don't measure your own progress using criteria that make sense to you, people will do it to you, and they'll grab any handy measure."<p>   "Be clear and public about what you consider a high standard for your students," Ted Sizer urges. This is a collective responsibility, observes Joe McDonald, which involves teachers "daring to inquire whether graduating students do possess the intellectual skills you want them to have." Such hard questions of rigor will eventually come at Essential schools from a skeptical public; it can only help a staff to ask them regularly and honestly of each other. And ending the isolation of the individual teacher's judgment fosters a balance of "warm" (more empathic) and "cool" (more objective) assessment methods that holds up well under outside scrutiny.<p>    A school must document its overall progress with equal rigor and care. Ethnographers Muncey and McQuillan urge schools to gather evidence on student achievement over long periods of time, in a variety of ways, and at several levels including individuals, teams, and the school as a whole. "Incorporate portfolios and other documentation from students into every evaluation," Donna Muncey says. "Be prepared to show what kids can do as a consequence of their Essential schooling, and how that is qualitatively different from what they could do before." This can also prove politically dangerous, she warns: "It implicitly criticizes the status quo."<p>   CES Director for Schools Bob McCarthy has another documentation strategy, in which schools would contract with certain key employers and colleges that accept many of their graduates to supply examples of student work along with recommendations and transcripts. The practice, he believes, would raise expectations, increase awareness of new standards, and forge strong partnerships with what he calls "the external forces schools invariably come up against when they start making significant changes." It helps to follow graduates' progress well after high school, several successful Essential schools have found; such efforts foster community bonds and provide important data for critics and analysts. <p><hr><h2>Schools within schools are potentially divisive. </h2><hr>Experience shows that such programs rarely lead to whole-school involvement. But this is a complex lesson to digest; many huge city schools, for example, see no other way to start an Essential school effort. Unless a school agrees from the start on a plan for expanding a "pilot program" into the entire school, however, a limited program has several serious political and philosophical drawbacks.<p>   First among these is the "we-they" split such programs foster. Selecting only a portion of the school to pursue reform aggravates this by implying both that something needs reform within the status quo and that dramatic change is not a schoolwide priority or responsibility. When teachers within the school-within-a-school get extra planning time, lower student loads, andother preferential treatment, their colleagues' opposition crystallizes.<p>   The division often encompasses faculty and students both. Forward movement of the school-within-a-school is often held hostage, Rick Lear notes, to the reservations, resentments, and fears of the rest of the faculty--often those who are least ready to change. "A faculty that starts this way has to understand that their every success may isolate them more and more from their colleagues," Donna Muncey observes. "If they're not ready to deal with that, the added stress on top of the extra work of an Essential program will burn them out." And students are often resistant too, observers say, when Essential School practices make them work harder than their peers and towards different kinds of goals.<p>   At the same time pressure is high on the school-within-a-school to prove good results quickly. This encourages superficial gauges of progress, Rick Lear points out, which may actually hamper the development of the program.<p>   Schools-within-schools also feed a "deficit model" of education, Lear argues, in which the problems are seen to lie in the kids themselves, not in the school's practices or expectations. "A school will often decide to try the new ideas on a small segment of kids, often ones who are not doing well so there's nothing to lose," he says. "If the new stuff works, it then becomes something that may work with ‘certain' kids, but not with all, and certainly not with successful kids. And it works because there is something lacking in those kids that makes them unable to fit into a conventional approach to schooling."<p>   Baltimore's Walbrook High School is unusual for its successful transition from school-within-a-school to whole-school Essential School involvement. But coordinator Marian Finney today regrets that Walbrook did not start with a full grade level; and other schools with similar strategies have seen less happy outcomes. "We're too big to do our thing and not irritate the others," laments Cheri Dedmon, who has struggled for five years to extend Hixson High School's "pilot program" schoolwide, "but too small to really sway the school."<p>   The lesson: Start with an agreed-upon plan for whole-school expansion;  work hard at maintaining the program's status as part of the larger faculty; and don't limit it to selected kids.<p><hr><h2>Kids are more invested in their work when it's more rigorous.</h2><hr> Whether this is a lesson Essential school veterans have really learned or merely a wishful gleam in their eyes depends on the teacher, the day of the week, even the assignment they've just evaluated. But quite a few concur with Patricia Wasley, who concluded after her School Change Study that "when students are challenged to do something that's bigger--involving more complex thinking, synthesis, analysis--they are more willing to put out time and energy and go to greater lengths."<p>   "Kids will surprise you with what they're capable of," agrees Amy Gerstein. "It's a lot more than we give them credit for. If you take a deep breath and give them a real opportunity to show off, they won't abuse your trust." Croton-Harmon High School in New York's Hudson River Valley took such a breath last year when all students took the elite state Regents exam, with dramatically positive results.<p>   But just giving a tough assignment and expecting kids to meet high standards doesn't alone do the trick, Joe McDonald warns. "In fact, my evidence shows that kids hit with rigorous work when they're used to worksheets will virtually go on strike," he says. Instead, a school must develop new community norms that create pride in how hard the work is, just as athletic teams do.  Chicago's Sullivan High School, where seniors must pass a demanding graduation exhibition involving a tough set of classic readings common to all, has come close to this goal, he believes. And at Walbrook High School, Pat Wasley says, "visitors are surprised at the depth to which kids delve in exhibitions."<p>   The hardest part of raising standards, in fact, comes not with less advantaged students but with those who have excelled under more conventional expectations. School after Essential school has struggled with heated opposition from students and parents with little incentive to change a system that has served them well.<p>                                   <hr><h2>Parents can be teachers' biggest allies.</h2><hr>This is a well-established educational lesson with important political ramifications. The most successful Essential schools have reaped crucial support by involving parents on graduation committees, duplicating staff workshops with them in evening sessions, including them in grade-level advisory councils, and asking them to join as volunteers in assessing student papers.<p>>>>Plan Carefully, But Seize Opportunities As They Arise.  Several successful schools have made bold moves forward when they took advantage of unexpected circumstances. In one case, the resignation of a superintendent provided a vacuum in which a strong principal moved more freely toward curricular change. In another, a governor's promise of waivers if the school could move quickly toward an outcomes-based diploma sparked a key grant that freed teachers for large-scale planning. Forced to move from their building for several years because of asbestos problems, another school leaped into whole-school involvement when it came time to move back in, giving reluctant teachers the chance to transfer out gracefully if they liked.<p><hr><h2>Go far enough quickly enough so you can't go back.</h2><hr> When its staff began to fall into old ways of evaluating kids on progress reports, Central Park East Secondary School took steps to accelerate the pace of change, to "escape the force of gravity that was pulling us back," as Deborah Meier put it. Fatigue makes cowards of us all, Vince Lombardi once quipped; the remedy lies in early boldness, constant self-evaluation, prompt corrective action.<hr><h2>Keep revisiting the nine common principles for deeper understanding. </h2><hr>Catch phrases and one-time handouts won't capture or fully probe these complex ideas. The most successful schools continue to argue through Essential School philosophy, addressing the gap between understanding its principles intellectually and practicing them in a class of squirming kids.<p><hr><h2>Find ways to break large schools into smaller decision-making units. </h2><hr>Unless a school's setting is intimate enough to be truly collegial, self-governance and professional development schemes can exhaust teachers' energies, divert them from their central work, and dilute the school vision. Because communication is more complex in a large school, change efforts maybe more threatened by alienation and divisiveness. In any case, trying to negotiate change in a very large group is undeniably harder.<p><hr><h2>Early fame can help the work or harm it. </h2><hr>Good publicity brings money, freedom, and excitement, along with the well-known positive effect achieved by just paying attention to something. But such attention can create rifts if the whole school is not involved, and it can also distract teachers from their difficult early efforts and encourage complacency about the results. Schools that use fame best don't rest on their laurels; instead, they ask outside visitors for critical feedback.<p><hr><h2>Schools that nurture full student involvement get farther with schoolwide and     classroom change. </h2><hr>Ironically, students are seldom full participants in the change process and may have a shallow sense of Essential School ideas and practices or even resent their new demands. Where a student-faculty congress addresses important issues together, or where kids have written a pamphlet explaining changes to parents and peers, schools have seen clear benefits.<p><hr><h2>It's harder to involve math and science in essential school change than     almost any other discipline. </h2><hr>Despite national trends toward integrating math and science with other subject areas, faculty in math and science are often the most vigorous in defending their turf, including the touchy area of ability-grouped classes. Because getting a full complement of teachers committed to interdisciplinary work is crucial to whole-school involvement, resistance from this quarter can sabotage a change effort. Addressing conflicts openly and involving everybody early can help.<p><hr><h2>Serious change is a series of individual transformations. </h2><hr>These occur, observes CES's Rick Lear, on at least two levels. First, of course, is when <i>one teacher after another</i> has that key insight or breakthrough that allows them to commit to the change--"what we usually think of as chalking one more person in the ‘committed' column," he says. On another level, though, and more important in the long run, is the series of transformations that occur <i>over and over within each teacher</i>, which go on for a long time, again and again and again.<p>  <hr><h2>Write to Us...</h2><hr>HORACE welcomes letters from readers addressing issues in past or coming editions.

It is not a formal evaluation of Lincoln High School, with long lists of commendations and recommendations. Neither are the researchers neutral outsiders; we endorse Coalition principles. We began this three-year project as partners in the Coalition of Essential Schools, which Lincoln joined in 1988. <p>	Nor is this a history of Lincoln's considerable progress. The images in these pages focus on the fall of 1991 instead of exploring all the accomplishments before then. A full history of the school's impressive evolution would highlight a point too easily missed: restructuring is neither easy nor quick. It may look simple but it rarely is. As Lincoln has moved ahead, confusion, fear, and anger have periodically flared.<p>	Located in a south-central state, Lincoln High School is a suburban high school with approximately eleven hundred students and about seventy-five faculty members. Seventy five percent of Lincoln's students are white and 25 percent are black; about 40 percent come from low-income families. Lincoln attracted us because we knew from Coalition friends that the school had made greater progress toward whole-school change than had most Coalition schools.<p>	We made our first visit to Lincoln High School as part of the School Change Study in the last week of October 1991. During our visit we spoke with many people in the school community and observed in classrooms to gain understanding of what it is like to learn and to teach at Lincoln at this point in its effort to become an Essential school. From our conversations, observations, and reflections we produced the following snapshot.1<p>	We did not come simply to celebrate the gains already secured. Our work is designed to support, advance, and deepen the good work under way.  Through this snapshot of Lincoln High School, we hope to raise questions and frame issues to help the faculty and administrators reflect on where they are, without telling them what to do next, which would be presumptuous.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fts"><h3>Focusing the Snapshot</h3><p>In this first snapshot, we focus on the theme of caring. <cite>Caring </cite>is a word with many meanings; at Lincoln, <cite>caring </cite>means more than a loose and pleasant atmosphere. It entails respectfulness, responsiveness, patience, consensus decision making, and other traits that take people beyond laissez-faire niceness. Caring can erode whenever students come to school indifferent or hostile, or when teachers suspect or oppose restructuring. The stamina and savvy of the principal, along with many dedicated faculty, help sustain caring.<p>	But caring also has the potential to be limiting. Caring can enhance or diminish serious academic work, and considerable variation in academic seriousness mark Lincoln's classrooms. In some cases, could more be expected, aside from the abundant extra-credit opportunities? How might pro-Coalition teachers convince skeptical students that new practices, especially teaming, may be better than the traditional structures most kids accept? In a final section, we discuss several other challenges that face the school: time, staffing, mainstreaming, and the state's education reform act.<p>	Within the framework of caring, not every major issue facing Lincoln High School can be examined. Future snapshots will attend to other themes and also trace the school's development in 1992, 1993, and 1994.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="dcit"><h3>Does Caring InfluenceTeaching and Learning?</h3><p>Morale improves. Teachers feel closer to each other. The old us/them tensions between faculty and administration fade. Transfer requests stop. The tone of the place manifests the textbook traits of an effective school: orderliness, respect for diversity, energetic leadership, and other familiar characteristics take hold. The way people get along reflects the "tone of decency" recognized in the Coalition's Principles.2 (See Appendix B for a listing of the nine Common Principles.) Relationships seem much better than they once were, and the youngsters as well as the adults behave differently from before. Classrooms are noisy but rarely chaotic, filled with the hum of work, not the shouting of rowdiness. Discipline problems look manageable. Attendance is up, suspensions are down.<p>	Lincoln's comfortable climate is not reserved for a chosen few. Although Lincoln has some aspects of the shopping mall high school, it avoids the most regrettable upshot of life in the mall: the pervasive "unspecialness" of so many shoppers. Lincoln does have the choice featured in the educational malls, with arena scheduling recently introduced for picking senior-year courses, and incoming ninth-graders enjoying more choice of both school and program than ever before. Where Lincoln differs most dramatically from the shopping mall is its unwillingness to let "specialty shops" flourish. A "gifted and talented boutique" has never been large or strong, since several other magnet schools in the city attract some of the brightest students. Sports are certainly popular, but they are less prominent than they were in the early and mid-1980s. Special education is taken seriously, but extensive mainstreaming keeps it from being an enclave off to itself.<p>	Instead of catering to the specialty shops, Lincoln has tried to shrink the size of the general track population, which is where "unspecial" students usually land. More and more, students are directed to focused vocational or academic curricula. Unspecialness is also curbed by the Teacher Guided Assistance period, a half-hour between second and third periods. In addition, the teams pride themselves on knowing their students as unique individuals, with personal attention that minimizes the anonymity which in shopping mall high schools contributes to unspecialness.<p>	How does school climate bear on restructuring? When people genuinely care about each other, what other changes follow? Of particular interest is whether teaching and learning change significantly as interpersonal ties change. We know of schools where camaraderie mistakenly convinces people that they have revamped instruction, when in fact most classrooms plod along in the old ways. Feeling good and doing better may not be synonymous. When getting along pleasantly is the priority, conflict avoidance can rule out even friendly questioning of traditional instruction. What flourishes instead are the nonjudgmental live-and-let-live truces described in the second book from A Study of High Schools (the forerunner of the Coalition),<cite> The Shopping Mall High School.</cite>3<p>	We also know of schools where a humane atmosphere was not purchased for such a high price. Collegiality encompasses disagreements, including debate on what aspects of curriculum and instruction need to change. Caring encourages, not discourages, innovation, risk, and uncertainty. Congeniality by itself is not mistaken for classrooms alive with the activity of students absorbed in meaningful projects.<p>	As the three of us reviewed our seventy interviews and observations made at Lincoln High School in late October 1991, we kept coming back to these issues. We knew we had been to a fine school, a friendly place where the webs of human relationships are admirable. On balance, these were good people--energetic, frank, funny, alert--whom anyone would welcome as colleagues. And we had met students whose civility and respectfulness reminded us that facile stereotypes about mischief in blue-collar communities, integration, and busing usually mislead. Walk the halls before first period, listen to the buzz of the lunchroom, eavesdrop by the buses, and the quiet conversations might not signal that poverty, pregnancy, split families and other serious complications mark many students' lives.<p>	How much of the tolerance in this generous place is translated into teaching and learning where the student is truly the worker, confronting essential questions and exhibiting a well-defined level of mastery? Why did many teachers rate Lincoln a "three" on a five-point scale, with one end indicating no change and the other marking full implementation of the nine Common Principles? Why is effort, a good try, often accepted as the standard of excellence? What challenges now face the school which will test its stamina and ingenuity?<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ciac"><hr><center><h2>Caring in a Changing School</h2></center><hr>Although people we met agreed that Lincoln is a caring place, we were interested to know what they meant by <cite>caring</cite>, and we also wanted to find out how Lincoln's caring culture both influenced and responded to change.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tcvo"><h3>The Community's Viewsof a Caring School</h3><p><blockquote>This school is something else! The teachers: they're friendlier, they're easier to work with. If you need help they'll bend over backwards to help you; if it's after school, before school, anything--they'll do it.</blockquote><blockquote>I know just about every teacher here. I'm a really friendly person. And they're wonderful. I wouldn't trade them for nothing. I loved eighth grade but that does not compare to Lincoln. I mean you would not believe it.</blockquote><blockquote>This school is so <cite>dedicated</cite>. That's the word, <cite>dedicated</cite>, that's what this school is to their students. They would stop what they're doing to help you. This school cares about their students.</blockquote><blockquote>Last year we had a derby festival. It was called the Zephyr Team Derby Festival. We had our own races; we cooked out, too. You never know what to expect. You don't know if you're going to the library or outside. It isn't like a teacher, a chalkboard, turn to page blah, blah, blah, and do your work. We do more group work. We are really into social skills.</blockquote><blockquote>Everybody is just <cite>so </cite>friendly here. If I had a problem, I could tell anybody and I would have no problems talking to them whatsoever. Mr. Stewart is like a dad to me; if I need something he's there. I don't call him "Mr. Stewart"; I call him "Stu."</blockquote>	Although they used slightly less exuberant language than this student, Jill, does, nearly everyone described Lincoln High as caring. "What's best for students" motivates the faculty, one group of teachers all agreed. What that phrase means in practice is a comfortable and friendly high school where, as one parent said, "the kids feel like they fit in." The ninth-grade teams, particularly the oldest one, the Zephyr team, consciously try to ease middle-schoolers into Lincoln by activities that minimize fear and anxiety about the school. In all grades, students spoke of trust, openness, and responsiveness as aspects of a place that seems as warm as a family or second home to many. Nancy Nunn, a records clerk, described the faculty as concerned and helpful. "It's a close-knit school. Everyone tries to help somebody else find their niche, feel important, feel welcome."<p><h4>How Students View Caring</h4>In the students' descriptions of their favorite teachers, caring implies <cite>niceness</cite>. A preferred teacher is helpful, patient, has a sense of humor, listens well, and takes the time to explain fully what's expected. She is accessible and available when you need to see her: "If you come in and something is bothering you, they'll ask you what the problem is." They have fun when they teach instead of "taking everything too seriously." "They're not too pushy," one student said, and Jill exclaimed, "Even the janitors here are nice!" <p>	Students also feel cared for by virtue of the neighborhood's devotion to the high school. The strong athletic teams traditionally spark the local community's allegiance. After several years of estrangement in the wake of busing in the mid-1970s, the loyalty of the locals revived. Although PTA membership is small, it is increasing, and parents respect the school for academic as well as athletic programs. Few understand the Coalition and what it seeks, but they don't fret that their youngsters are guinea pigs in an experiment. Parents and students alike marvel at the extensive, multimillion-dollar renovations that in 1987 transformed the dreary, old, gray concrete hulk. The face-lift is a sign of respectability, an indication that they are worth being cared for. They, in turn, have taken good care of the facility; it is clean, bright, and free of graffiti.<p><h4>How the Staff View Caring </h4>Unlike some high schools, Lincoln rarely envisions caring as if it were professional therapy. References to psychological theory are infrequent, even from special education staff or counselors. The Teacher Guided Assistance period was not designed as group counseling, and it does not seem to be used that way. Social services are available and have increased recently by state law, but the teacher-talk is free of clinical jargon, free of offhand theories about the stress and strain of being adolescent today. When teachers spoke of their own fatigue, they said they were "tired"; not that they suffered from "burnout," or "midlife crisis." Several administrators referred to students as the school's "customers." <p>	Instead of using <cite>Psychology Today</cite>-style banter, several staff described <cite>caring </cite>with reference to safety. The school is relatively free of major fights, drug use or sale, and overt racial tension. Most students shun rather than respect those few students who do drugs, drink heavily, fight, or act prejudiced. Corporal punishment stopped several years ago, even before a district ban on it. Several teachers were fired (not transferred), and after those dismissals the principal felt that no one remained on the staff who would hurt a Lincoln student. So caring is partly the absence of non-caring, and it offers protection from mischief or danger.<p><h4>The Principal: A Model of Caring</h4>The principal, Valerie Taylor, is seen by the teachers in much the same light as the students view their favorite teachers. Singling out her ability to listen--she was once a counselor--faculty said, "You can be heard here." Valerie is also admired as an excellent speaker. As with many leaders, she combines characteristics that in less skillful hands could seem contradictory. Teachers praise her patience, her willingness to wait, to "look inscrutable" in a meeting rather than reveal her opinion. She knows that change takes time.<p><blockquote>The way we treat people is the key. Everything we do teaches more powerfully than we recognize. You don't achieve an attitude of respect in a building unless everybody is practicing it. If teachers are not treated with respect, then they aren't going to treat their kids that way. Faculty share decision making with me, and the teachers share decisions with the kids. There was a time when they didn't. There was a time when every kid went to a classroom where there was a list of rules to follow. I think we have accomplished much. The kids believe they are important. We won't tolerate outrageous behavior and we won't let anyone behave outrageously toward them. It is a long process and people do violate. That is why you have to renew the commitment constantly.</blockquote><blockquote>You don't get much done if you think you are going to do it yourself. It has to be through other people. You give up what some people perceive as the status. I'll never forget coming to this building and finding a parking place for the principal. Ridiculous! I deliberately had to park elsewhere for a long time before anyone would use that space.</blockquote>	She models a type of caring that entails tremendous energy and hard work. Faculty are amazed (and concerned) by the long days she devotes to the job, often staying at school late in the evenings. Stamina, perseverance, and commitment matter greatly to her. As she said in regard to increasing parental involvement with the school, we "do everything and then anything" to draw them in. Trying is valued.<p>	The most frequently noted aspect of her nurturing of faculty was a sincere encouragement to do something new. The staff said they "never got knocked down" by her. It is safe to innovate, and teachers feel they can fail without penalties. She may prod some faculty to use new methods or take advantage of professional development opportunities, but she tries to "let people come to their own understanding of things." Teachers get "latitude" from a "receptive" and "nonthreatening" principal. Those words convey the point that no one is forced or compelled, even if everyone knows that Valerie wants to see the nine Common Principles permeate the school. She is less neutral about the value of notions like "student-as-worker" than she is about the various ways her teachers try get them to become workers.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="aaoc"><h3>An Atmosphere of Change </h3><p>The upshot of the principal's caring--her encouragement and support for new efforts by the faculty--is a school with more and more adventure in the air as projects multiply. There are different things people can "hook into and play with and begin to feel involved." Examples include the formation of additional teams, the TGA period, collaborations with the local university, school-based decision making, staff and course development supported by a grant from the Southern Regional Education Board, activities in and through the Lindeman Academy (the district-sponsored professional development academy), and Valerie's travel as a Thompson Fellow with the Coalition. In a variety of ways the school has sought opportunities to change. <p>	The momentum began before membership in the Coalition in 1988, but much of what has happened would have occurred without the formal tie with the Coalition. Instead of being just another initiative, the Coalition for Valerie offers "an overarching umbrella" to span the particular innovations. <p>	Teacher Sam Morrison used another metaphor to express that idea: "Now we have a credo, and it feels like we're singing from the same hymnal." Faculty at Lincoln sense a greater emphasis in the last two years on Coalition ideas as the standard by which all proposals are judged. That focus seems to have emerged with Valerie's deft combination of subtlety and persistence. Lincoln may be shifting from "It's here if you want to try it" to "Why aren't you willing to try this?" That shift sends the message to Lincoln faculty that the changes undertaken are not a whim or fad. "This too shall pass," the standard reaction to razzle-dazzle pilot projects, seems more and more inappropriate at Lincoln. <p><h4>The Faculty's Difficulties with Change</h4>The new atmosphere of change has elicited various responses from faculty.<p>	The more traditional teachers wonder if the caring includes them. The staff most uncomfortable with change are called "resisters," although their opposition seems quiet rather than active. Their numbers are small, and some are close to retirement. Often they feel that the kids are so distracted, indifferent, or ornery that teachers today face the thankless, even hopeless, task of working with unmotivated students who do not value education. The resisters have not been excluded or ignored. Valerie emphatically declared, <p><blockquote>You cannot ignore the resisters. You have to constantly go after them. Give them a thousand chances to say no and then a thousand more. I don't think resistance is forever. We've seen that. People change.</blockquote>	Even so, change can be painful, and decent people occasionally feel anguish. One of the teachers spoke compassionately about the distress he'd witnessed recently:<p><blockquote>This is the third day in a row I've seen [her] crying at the end of the day. She says that kids are changing, that they won't do homework at all, that they don't care about learning, that she's under pressure to change her very traditional style of teaching, that administrators have hinted that her subject is an anachronism here. She's one of our resisters, but it would be unfair to belittle the pain she's experiencing. Maybe that pain is the first sign, a necessary first stage in the process of change. Perhaps now is the moment when someone needs to approach her and offer support and a better way of motivating kids. Who?</blockquote><h4>Students' Views of School Change</h4>When we spoke with students, we were interested to learn how they viewed the changes under way at Lincoln. <p>	When students discussed courses they enjoy, they often, <cite>but not always</cite>, singled out teachers active in Lincoln's initiatives. Not every favorite teacher is a "restructurer." They might like a traditional teacher who is funny, or they might criticize a "student-as-worker" advocate if they think he or she overuses group work. If a teacher is clear, not too demanding, and pleasant, students do not resent the heavy use of recall items on tests.<p>	Most students could not describe the Coalition or restructuring. Even questions about the major changes the school has accomplished in the past five years usually prompted remarks on the building renovations, the sports teams, or the good reputation in the community. When someone asked them about specific changes, such as working in groups, they usually qualified their praise, and noted how it can be abused by students who "goof off" or pressure other students to cover up for them.<p>	It is unlikely that the current level of student understanding of and support for the Coalition Principles will nudge teachers to endorse and use those ideas. Unless teachers and administrators take more time to explain and justify what the Coalition stands for and why that is preferable to the notion that teaching is telling, learning is listening, and knowledge is objective facts, one possible source of support for change--informed students--will remain weak. For many students, a relaxed classroom and a caring teacher are not inextricably bound up with the nine Common Principles. Traditional teaching can win student loyalty even though we saw more allegiance to the teachers who consider themselves restructurers.<p>	In a recent book, <cite>The Unschooled Mind</cite>, psychologist Howard Gardner analyzed the misconceptions and intuitive hunches children bring with them to school, including deeply rooted notions of what schooling must be.4 Many students envision learning as sitting, listening, remembering, and regurgitating facts on machine-scored tests. That is a pervasive view of education which they and millions of other middle-schoolers carry to high school, even if they have previously done some group work, tried cooperative learning, or finished a few projects. <p>	As one thoughtful Lincoln English teacher said, "Students don't think they're learning unless they feel pressured and harangued. If the teacher isn't 'teaching,' then it follows they must not be learning." She give an example from one of her classes:<p><blockquote>For the <cite>Canterbury Tales </cite>we're acting and drawing and assembling. My initial impression is that the less I ask them to do academically, the more they seek to find the lowest level of acceptable effort. It feels like a game wherein I have to ferret out and block their continuing drive toward mediocrity.</blockquote><blockquote>They are having a lot of fun with this project. They are also experiencing a lot of anxiety because the assignment is so formless. I told them each to choose one pilgrim, and make that pilgrim memorable. They want me to tell them how.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="car"><hr><center><h2>Caring and Rigor: Lincoln's Classrooms</h2></center><hr>Throughout Lincoln the culture of caring is played out in classrooms. As we observed classes and spoke with people in the school, we kept in mind the question of how this caring culture affected rigor--the expectations and standards--of students' work. <p>	There is considerable freedom for individual teachers to do as they see fit in their classes. Although some departments have reputations as traditional or innovative, departments rarely shape instructional approaches. Instructional approaches reflect voluntary choices within a group of like-minded teachers, rather than orders from the chair, a position without much power. Ninth- and tenth-grade students are assigned to teams of approximately one hundred students and four to five teachers. The teams differ one to the next, and within the teams there seems to be mutual accommodation of teaching styles rather than a wedging of everyone into the same mold.<p>	Many Lincoln classrooms manifest caring through a relaxed give-and-take between students and teachers. Banter often marks the start of the period and reappears during the hour. Students frequently ask questions without raising their hands or asking permission to speak. Note writing, hair combing, gum chewing, shoulder rubs, and quiet side conversations are tolerated in almost all classrooms. Dozing off is acceptable; if lengthy, it is interrupted by some teachers, overlooked by others.<p>	The classroom environments at Lincoln reflect the faculty's view that unless students feel comfortable with each other and with the teachers, not much will be learned. As one teacher said, "They have to know you care before they care about what you know." Rich Horn argued that "willingness to participate" precedes the "joy of learning." In the opinion of Diane Franklin, "The students seem to be happy. If they are happy, they're going to have an open mind to learning." <p>	Not everyone arrives at school pleasant and cheerful. Instead of happiness, several teachers detect anxiety and hostility. One teacher said, <p><blockquote>[Many students are] unhappy with family members, lack aspirations for bettering themselves, and worry more about paying the car insurance than their grades. Their low self-esteem concerns me. In class I often see anger, which is directed at their parents first and carries over to us.</blockquote>	Just creating classrooms where the students are calm and courteous is not a trivial accomplishment.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="agims"><h3>A Glimpse into Ms. Sherman's Class</h3><p>Our visit to Jane's class provides an example of how caring manifests itself in her classroom and in her instruction.<p>	Jane Sherman has been out for three days on a trip to Florida, and the students are glad to see her back. As they come in, they ask her questions about her time away. "It was nice, real nice," she says. "Nice weather. I ate too much. I had a good time." One student asks, "Did you get the tests graded?" Jane replies, "I graded some on the beach but I'm not done yet. I'll give them back later--tomorrow." Another student pipes up, "Can you grade in a car?" Ms. Sherman answers, "Yes, teachers learn how to do that."<p>	Ms. Sherman is sitting on the edge of a table, and the mention of the tests prompts her to say that the essay questions had been difficult for the class. "Why do I give those?"  Various students answer without raising their hands: "To check our writing?" "To see how simpleminded we are?" Ms. Sherman continues, "Are there right and wrong answers?" She urges them, "Avoid rambling. Some of you were avoiding the topic. I wanted you to <cite>respond</cite>. Maybe that wasn't clear. What does it mean?" Ms. Sherman answers her own question. "Your work should be thoughtful." <p>	She asks them to get out a piece of paper, think about Jews and the Jewish religion, and jot down what came to mind. "No blank sheets of paper now!" She gives them several minutes for this exercise. She walks over to talk to her student teacher and, on the way, asks one student if she got a hair cut. There is some chitchat and side conversations as Jane speaks with the student teacher, but by and large the class is quiet.<p>	After a few minutes, she asks students to say what they have put on their paper. Without raising hands, students offer all sorts of remarks: no meat on Friday, rabbis, they wear little hats, they eat turkey, they cook on Saturday and eat on Sunday, they don't cut their hair, they have long beards. "What else?" Ms. Sherman asks. A student offers, "They were persecuted in World War II." Jane beams, "I knew you knew that." She then adds, "It is a simpler religion than the Egyptian. Why is that?" Several students respond. By this point, there are a few side conversations and students offer silly answers such as, "A goat was the father of Christ." Still, the class is orderly and she tolerates constant chatter, as long as it isn't chaotic.<p><h4>Maintaining Rigor in a Caring Culture</h4>Once students feel at ease, as they do in Ms. Sherman's class, what do they learn? Are academic standards and intellectual challenge modified for the sake of a comfortable atmosphere?<p>	The answer to that question is not a simple yes or no response. Different students interpret the same experiences in quite different ways. For instance, they voiced a range of opinions about the Zephyr team. Some said the field trips taught them quite a bit; others saw them as a break from school. One boy wondered if he suffered as a sophomore because he did not learn enough mathematics in Zephyr. A star football player, who called Zephyr "lots of fun," said, "Everything we had in science I already knew," but he acknowledged that many students came to school who otherwise might have cut.<p>	The question of standards is further complicated by Lincoln's history of very modest academic demands through the mid-1980s. Compared to five years ago, both the atmosphere and the academics seem better. If we could juxtapose course work in 1986 and 1991, we bet it is more demanding now. The traditional statistics do not report dramatic increases in standardized test scores, although course enrollment data gathered for the Southern Regional Education Board project indicated an impressive percentage of seniors completing chemistry (42 percent), Algebra 2 (50 percent), and pre-calculus (27 percent). Several teachers noted higher grades earned by their students--and other teachers scoffed at the reliability of grades as a measure of intellectual rigor. <p>	Individual students occasionally reported reborn enthusiasm for education. For instance, sixteen-year-old Cal Kolbe wants to finish high school, go to college, and become a nurse. Mother of a two-year-old son, she had considered dropping out after eighth grade, but she credits Lincoln for her strong desire to stay in school. She clearly likes her teachers and takes her classes seriously. She praises both the affective and the academic aspects of Lincoln.<p>	The question with Cal and others is whether she could be asked to do more. She does about two hours of homework in a typical week. She tells of her class where, "instead of having to read novel after novel, we can watch a movie and explain what we learned. Then we can read out loud instead of by ourselves. It's much easier." She has a science course where the teacher's sense of humor "keeps us off of school." She often studies for tests during lunch. To Cal, her most exciting class is home economics, where they just made angel food cake.<p>	There may be missed opportunities, chances for more to happen, in some Lincoln classes. Certainly there are fine teachers, likable <cite>and </cite>demanding, who do not settle for low-key relaxation at the expense of serious standards. But how many Lincoln students consistently, hour after hour, feel engaged in curriculum they value as useful? Even if every single hour didn't crackle with the intensity of the instruction advocated in Ted Sizer's <cite>Horace's Compromise</cite>,5  there are moments when more could be expected of the students.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="agimc"><h3>A Glimpse into Mr. Cannon's History Class</h3><p>We turn to a visit to Earl Cannon's class that we believe raises some of these questions.<p>	The period begins with announcements on the public address system: yearbook tickets, sophomores running for office, photographs to be taken, and the like. Then Mr. Cannon states: "We are ready to start." Student conversations continue, although they quiet down to see how he has set up the exam review--a ticktacktoe-style quiz, with one student at the side board marking <cite>X'</cite>s and <cite>O'</cite>s. The desks are divided, facing each other, with three rows of six desks on each side.<p>	"Who was captain last time?" Mr. Cannon asks. When he seeks volunteers, one student exclaims, "I don't want to be captain because it involves work." Several students finally volunteer to be team captains, and Mr. Cannon then says softly, "I'll make the rules. That way there will be no confusion. Raise your hands. Don't yell out the answers. If team <cite>A </cite>cannot answer, the question goes to team <cite>B </cite>to see if they know the answer." Mr. Cannon has a stack of cards with a recall question on each one.<p>	Then the game begins. "Jackson was president for how many years?" One student says to a friend, "That is easy, too easy," but neither side knows how long he served. "Who was Charles Finney?" "When was the Erie Canal built?" "How do you spell <cite>abolitionism</cite>?" When one student answers, a brief discussion follows about whether or not he has cheated.<p>	About half of the students are playing the game, either giving answers or telling teammates what the answer might be. There are a few personal conversations, especially in the back row of both sides. Some students are slumped down in their seats, and one is chewing a lollipop. The student at the board who is posting the <cite>X</cite>'s and <cite>O'</cite>s begins to draw little faces inside the <cite>O'</cite>s and talk to some friends standing near him. <p>	Then they have to define <cite>nativism</cite>, which a student does very briefly. Mr. Cannon adds, "On the test, I'll look for your definition to say that it required dislike of Catholics." There is some good-natured grumbling; for example, when he asks one team to define the word <cite>overseer</cite>, one student groans, "Oh, God, how easy can you get?" At such exclamations, Mr. Cannon chides them in a soothing, low voice as calm as music in a doctor's office. <p>	Later the students seem restless and fidgety. Few take the game seriously; even the team captains by the end seem distracted. To Mr. Cannon, the review makes sense. At one point, he stops and says, "You'd be surprised at how many people miss these simple questions." As he speaks, one student starts combing another student's hair. Several students pass notes to each other. One boy constantly shifts his legs and thighs back and forth, making his chair tilt and squeak. A memorable sight is the young man who has on a Sony Walkman, with one earphone in and the other removed so he will be able, if he wants, to follow the game or listen to the music, or do both, or neither.<p>	Fidgeting notwithstanding, many of Earl Cannon's students enjoy his class. The assignments are straightforward, with little of the ambiguity and risk that mark many projects and Exhibitions.6 Earl is pleased with the changes he feels he has made in recent years. He says that he lectures less often and he sees a great improvement in his students' grades. Although, he says, "it gets on my nerves a lot," he now lets his students sit wherever they wish.<p><h4>What Should Expectations Be?</h4>A dilemma for Earl, and others like him, is that many students do indeed "miss these simple questions," and there is no consensus within Lincoln as to what a sensible "maximum minimum" standard might be for the average-ability youngsters (which is the bulk of Lincoln's population). "All children can learn." Yes, of course, but learn what? at what speed? in what depth? A student in the Zephyr team knows so little punctuation that he put only one period in a paper. Another student can describe the fine points of pre-calculus. For the large majority of Lincoln students who fall somewhere between those extremes, what is a reasonable standard of achievement?<p>	Right now, pushing for more is often optional. In many classes, the availability of extra credit is the major option. The points are there for the taking <cite>if </cite>a student is willing to do the work. Cal beamed about her math teacher. "She gives real good extra-credit points. We get like fifty points for a two-page paper rewrite, and twenty for one page. Out of three hundred points, I have a 495 so far! That's how good the extra credit is." One boy she knows skips much of his in-class work, but he makes it up through the extra credit. In another of her classes, the teacher walks around the room when the students are in groups, and she awards extra credit when she sees someone helping someone else. Cal is pleased that in her English class, <p><blockquote>If you miss an assignment, you can make it up in extra credit real easy, <cite>real </cite>easy. Like if you miss a one hundred-point exam, you can make it up by writing about someone in your family, or things you hope to be later, or someone you base your life on. </blockquote>	In her courses and elsewhere, extra credit not only reaps points from work over and beyond what's expected, it can also compensate for absence, failure, or mediocrity on the first try. Either way, it underscores the importance of <cite>effort </cite>in doing well at Lincoln.<p>	Many students believe that <cite>trying </cite>is the key to good grades. Asked what's necessary to get an A, one senior said, "Show up, do your work, listen to the teacher, and follow directions." Another senior felt that "if you go in there and try, everyone can get an A." To Cal, teachers "have to know you've been working on it the best you can." On the other hand, failure results from no effort. One young teacher said that "the only way they fail is not to turn in anything." Failure reflected conduct--absence, cutting, sleeping in class. <p>	In some respects, grading standards for the ECE (special education) students, which explicitly stress effort, also apply to other Lincoln students. If a youngster worked hard and did what he could, a low grade is unlikely. As a member of the Zephyr team explained, "Those of us who've taught a while will accept things that show a great deal of effort and concentrated work, even though the outcomes may not look as good as we'd like. Effort is real important." She looks for signs of improvement. "At the beginning of the year, their Exhibitions are real crummy. I expect them to be better at the end of the year."<p>	We don't know enough about the specifics of the extra-credit work to evaluate its substance, or say whether it undermines students' attentiveness to the regular assigned work. What does seem clear is that students appreciate this option and see it as part of what makes Lincoln a caring and friendly place. They have second and third chances; if they mess up, it's their fault, not the school's. That attribution seems particularly accurate in the teams, where teachers seem to reach out to students to urge them to do make-up and extra-credit work, but that same encouragement also marks some classrooms of teachers who are not in teams.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="stco"><hr><center><h2>Supporting the Challenges of Change</h2></center><hr>Burgeoning change has brought its own challenges for the faculty at Lincoln. Although in some respects Lincoln staff have found ways to cope with these challenges, they will need to find new measures and continuing support to deal with several change-related issues. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cat"><h3>Concerns about Time</h3><p>After explaining why Lincoln's atmosphere was its greatest strength, a teacher said the lack of time to take advantage of that climate was frustrating. She wanted more chances to share ideas, exchange materials, visit other teachers' rooms, and swap lesson plans with the department chair. She craved a few hours to chat with several new teachers about Lincoln's steering committee, the Coalition's Fall Forum, and some exciting workshops at the Lindeman Academy. A minute or two to sit with friends and catch up on their lives would also be welcome.<p>	She admitted it was a great credit to the school that the faculty lounge is almost deserted, a pleasing contrast to the constant complaining she used to hear there. That sort of sharing she did not want to see. Yet within the current allocation of people and periods, she wondered how it would be possible to free any meaningful blocks of time.<p>	Other concerns about time at Lincoln focus on work equity. Muncy and McQuillen's study of several pioneer Coalition schools reported hostile "You've got it easy!" "No, I'm working harder!" exchanges between teachers outside and inside the teams.7 At Lincoln, it is clear that some teachers work much longer and harder than others. These teachers bristled at suggestions that teammates, block schedules, favorable public relations, and field trips more than compensate. They noted the sacrifice of personal and family time--many restructurers are energetic women with home lives that allow, or at least tolerate, sixty-hour work weeks. Sometimes exhaustion hits. "But we've never all felt bushed at the same time; somebody is always revved up," one teacher observed.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="arfh"><h3>A Role for Humor</h3><p>We met teachers who believe fervently in the importance of their work. Along with that zeal is a good sense of humor. We suspect that the combination of conviction and playfulness sustains many of the restructurers. For instance, an after-school meeting of the curriculum task force scrutinized a half-dozen ways to create a block schedule. Teachers summarized the options and then thoughtfully discussed the advantages and disadvantages of each. During the two hours, refreshments with unusual names were ordered. Three people ordered Sex on the Beach. When the check came, one woman rose to pay and leave and hollered, "I had Sex on the Beach and it cost me $3.50!" The comments and quips flew. One teacher stood and asked, "Are you bragging or complaining?" Laughter and guffaws continued for a minute.<p>	The hooting didn't trivialize the meeting or slip into prolonged silliness, digressions, or crudeness. Nor did the strong advocacy of various scheduling options cross the line into intemperate and shrill harangues. The tone of the meeting paralleled how good teachers are often relaxed without becoming too casual and simultaneously intense without being manic.<p>	Still, it was a vast topic for this committee to tackle. Devising block schedules that facilitate interdisciplinary teaching is a major challenge. Even a two-hour meeting seemed too brief to explore carefully such a complicated and important matter. But where would more hours be found?<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="bsfc"><h3>Building Support for Change</h3><p>Although more time might sustain the front-runners and also lure some of the fence-sitters, other measures will probably be necessary to boost the number of Lincoln faculty who wholeheartedly endorse and adopt Coalition Principles. There is agreement that "reviewers" outnumber either the "restructurers" or the "resisters" (to use the categories nearly everyone at Lincoln uses). Out-and-out resistance is rare, with some of the opposed close to retirement and thus reluctant to fight. Estimates of the number of restructurers ranged from 20 percent to 35 percent. Those folks were pioneers on the teams, leaders of different committees in the school, and volunteers for workshops and summer projects. Reviewers, in contrast, are a more amorphous group, who share a "yes, but" cautious attitude toward change. The lines between the groups are not rigid, and many reviewers support the nine Common Principles or claim they already do much of it. The reviewers span a broad range of teaching practices and philosophies; and a major challenge in the future will be recruiting and retaining some of them without driving others toward the resisters.<p>	Strategies used so far for supporting the faculty and gaining their support for change could continue, or be revitalized if they have lapsed. As a school moves deeper into this effort, the need for staff development rises, not falls. Some schools assume that all the workshops, travel, in-service discussion, and informal conversation lay a foundation that, once set, is over and done with. But veteran as well as rookie teachers stumble on unanticipated problems and questions as they take on difficult challenges, such as achieving "less is more,"  implementing Exhibitions, and maintaining universal goals--that is, goals that apply to all students.<p>	Early successes can hurt schools like Lincoln, because funders sometimes conclude that they have already reached the Promised Land, so other sites receive the dollars. Within the school, it will be important to celebrate past successes in ways that avoid complacency and too much self-congratulation. As district administrator Todd Patrick said, "I would hope that when we up the ante, we affirm the important, commendable, and significant progress so far. Provoking the next level of serious and hard work shouldn't be seen as scolding."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tdom"><h3>The Demands of Mainstreaming</h3><p>To be more specific, the mainstreaming of the ECE students marks a major change for many teachers. There are a wide range of opinions on this shift. Valerie justifies the decision as "morally right," and many teachers feel the same way. A few teachers believe that many ECE kids drag down the rest of the class, and that what they gain is much less than what others lose. Many who have already taught scores of special education students feel comfortable and competent amid that range of abilities. Others think it's the right step, but wonder if their own teaching methods can work well with the mixture. For instance, a teacher who relies on humor to keep the kids' attention isn't sure that the ECE students understand or appreciate his quips, even if most of the group does. Could staff development explore the research on learning styles to probe how different students learn in different ways, and to find out what their learning style differences imply about instructional methods? In addition, the practical issues of meshing special education staff with classroom teachers may deserve attention. How are responsibilities parceled out? How are decisions made and conflicts resolved?<p>	A caring school climate certainly fosters effective mainstreaming. But is that sensitivity enough to sustain this change? What if the demands of mainstreaming erode rather than reinforce caring? Might some teachers see the Coalition's universal goals as quixotic, utopian, and unworkable? If so, the ranks of the reviewers and resisters could enlarge, with the restructurers dismissed as watering down the curriculum so all students could get by. One way to avoid that danger is meaningful staff development activities on mainstreaming.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cwt"><h3>Coping with Transitions</h3><p>With a commitment to change comes the challenge of hiring people who will continue to support the work when staff leave. Hiring restructurers whenever faculty resign or retire may be the best way to increase the number of Coalition advocates. Recently, that has happened by virtue of the close connections with teacher education programs at the university, or by savvy interviewing on the part of particular teams. Attracting candidates whose beliefs and practices match Coalition philosophy could be coupled with an induction and mentoring that sustains and deepens the enthusiasm of the rookies. Mentoring need not be formal or fancy, as long as it offers serious coaching of the novices, who now rely on ad hoc conversations or chance discussions for their initial understanding of Coalition ideology. <p>	A crucial appointment will be Valerie Taylor's successor if she leaves in the near future. Faculty expressed uncertainty about whether the changes instituted so far would survive her departure, although on balance they feel guardedly confident they would endure, especially if a successor who shared Valerie's views convinced key teachers and administrators not to leave simply because Valerie was gone. "Initially it all hinged on Valerie. It is to her credit that that is no longer the case," one observer said. Yet for some loyalists the attachment is so strong that they declare, "If she goes, I go."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cwts"><h3>Coping with the SSIA</h3><p>Whoever is there in the mid-1990s will be coping with the State School Improvement Act (SSIA), the recent package of far-reaching reforms enacted by the state legislature. Some SSIA provisions simply affirm changes already under way at Lincoln, such as site-based decision making. Others will provide resources, such as the new youth service centers to coordinate and extend programs. Less familiar will be the new statewide system of assessment and accountability. By 1995, a new battery of tests, including performance-based measures, will gauge the progress of each school in the state; poor performance will reclassify a site as a "school in crisis," and exceptionally good achievement will yield extra dollars.<p>	How creatively will Lincoln use the SSIA? There are at least two risks to be avoided. Lincoln could settle back and say, "But we already do all that," even though some of the SSIA provisions are novel. It could hunker down and resent the changes as impositions foisted on it by unfriendly outsiders: we'll go through the motions; we have to; we are victims-that attitude would be regrettable, when so much of the SSIA embodies the spirit of the Coalition.<p>	The greatest challenge will probably involve assessment. Some teachers are rethinking the tests they make and give, and the SSIA will prompt new ideas about classroom assessment. The performance-based thrust of the new system should encourage Lincoln's own beginnings in regard to Exhibitions. Another large benefit could be the nudge to traditional teachers to change their courses in order to prepare students to do well on the performance-based sections. Films and lectures cannot equip a biology student to demonstrate lab skills. And if the SSIA tests are wisely designed, they could prompt more discussion within Lincoln about a Coalition Principle sometimes overlooked: "less is more." What is essential knowledge? Why is it vital to know that? The interdisciplinary aspects of Lincoln's teaming have occasionally raised those questions in fresh and interesting ways, but there is still much work to be done. If that happens, there may be less attention to pedagogical technique (cooperative learning, for instance) and more attention to curriculum (hammering out a rigorous interdisciplinary unit on late-nineteenth-century industrialization, for example). <p>	Even with creative adaptations to SSIA, there are still issues of self-assessment. In a school where people like and respect each other, does that caring rule out in-house evaluations of the programs? Is evaluation seen as a breakdown of caring, as an effort to "get" certain teams? Many teachers seem to rely on their intuitive sense of how happy the students are--they see results in their youngsters' behavior and attitude. Others cite rising grades as evidence of effectiveness. One frustrated teacher asked, "We've said, 'This program is really great and that program is really great'--but how do we actually <cite>know </cite>that?" Several teachers brought a proposal to the school's steering committee. They asked for evaluations that would determine whether the program was making a difference in students' learning. After a long and heated discussion, it was adopted, but as an option, not an obligation.<p>	Good evaluations are neither quick nor simple, and it is possible for well-intentioned people to do more harm than good if the study is misused or flawed. Evaluation has never been a high priority in American high schools, and when it is done, it is often to satisfy someone else, with the results soon filed away. But there are many possible uses of sensible evaluations, including raising questions, framing a discussion, and generating helpful information. They need not be feared or brushed off as irrelevant. Within the school, one could draw on university friends to do focused studies of particular topics. For instance, one math teacher now uses a traditional text with two classes and a new text (with cooperative learning activities built in) with a third. Assessing which text is better would be a reasonable topic for someone to examine.  <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ct"><h3>Concluding Thoughts</h3><p>If the school looks to our writing as a type of evaluation, we hope everyone bears in mind that there are other ways to tell the story of this remarkable place. Instead of the theme of caring, this paper could have emphasized how Lincoln's changes weave together some middle school practices (teaming, above all) with aspects of university culture (teachers who consult, for example). That marriage of the best of middle school pedagogy with the best of the university's treatment of faculty as professionals offers another viewpoint for seeing life at Lincoln.<p>	Yet another viewpoint is now available, in Sizer's new book, <cite>Horace's School</cite>.8 Lincoln might note with pride how their committees proceed more smoothly than the ones in which Horace's acrimonious peers interact. The pages on Exhibitions will be particularly apt for Lincoln as it comes to grips with assessment in the wake of SSIA. The descriptions of interdisciplinary units should spark interest. And so might a line on the very first page of the book: "Franklin is a caring place, but the kids worry Horace."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></center><p><ol><li> Pseudonyms were used for every student, teacher, and administrator mentioned in this paper. Some details of the long quotes and classroom vignettes were changed to protect student and teacher anonymity. The interviews and observations took place from October 28 to November 1, 1991. Our on-site liaison adroitly set up our schedules for that busy week. Robert Hampel, Laraine Hong, and Neill Wenger wrote field notes to transcribe and summarize what they saw and heard, and Hampel then wrote the first draft of this paper, which Laraine Hong, Neill Wenger, Dick Clark, and Pat Wasley reviewed in early January. Ten Lincoln staff read the second draft and sent detailed comments. Professor Ann Lieberman (Teachers College, Columbia University) visited the school for two days in February 1992, gathering reactions to the second draft, which she shared with Hampel.<p><li> The Coalition of Essential Schools is a partnership between Brown University and schools across the country.  The purpose of the partnership is to encourage educators to make student learning the central focus of schooling.			The work of the Coalition emerges from "A Study of High Schools," reported in <cite>Horace's Compromise </cite>by Theodore R. Sizer (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1985). The nine Common Principles, presented in an appendix to the book, provide the focal point for the re-examination of secondary schooling.<p><li> See Arthur G.

So much change under way already. Mainstreaming the special education students; implementing portfolios, authentic assessments, site-based decision making and other requirements of the state's education reform act; expanding the new public safety magnet program, the three teams in the ninth grade, and the professional development alliances between the school and a local university--each undertaking a major change, each complicated and time-consuming. With these shifts it grows harder for any teacher to brush aside innovation as merely an option chosen by others which he or she is still free to ignore. "It touches everyone now," the principal declared.<p>	This was our second visit to Lincoln High School, a middle-sized suburban high school located in the south-central part of the country. Of Lincoln's eleven hundred students, about 75 percent are white and 25 percent are black; 40 percent come from low-income families. During our visit, from April 13-17, 1992, we spoke with many people in the school community and observed in classrooms to gain understanding of what it is like to learn and to teach at Lincoln at this point in its effort to become an Essential school. From our conversations, observations, and reflections we produced the following snapshot.1<p>	We decided to make teamwork and teaming the focus of this second snapshot. By <cite>teamwork </cite>we mean the ability of all the people in the school community to work together in various activities and dimensions of school life. <cite>Teaming  </cite>at Lincoln refers to grouping students so that approximately one hundred students stay together for about two-thirds of the day with four or five teachers. Of course, teaming depends on teamwork.<p>	As the teaming initiatives have taken hold, some more firmly than others, attention this year has increasingly focused on the Van Plan, a design to team the entire school, created by a half-dozen teachers as they drove home from the Coalition's Fall Forum in Chicago the previous November. The curriculum committee, which previously discussed block scheduling and teaming, took up the Van Plan and spent many Monday afternoons crafting a new master schedule for the 1992-93 school year. By March, the revised plan assigned every tenth-grader to one or another of three teams for four hours each day (all ninth-graders would also be on teams, as happened in 1991-92). Up to 110 juniors and seniors could join a new eleventh/twelfth-grade team. The other upperclassmen could arrange a traditional schedule; scaling back the Van Plan's ambitious design for total teaming, the committee decided that not everyone had to join a team.<p>	Lincoln's bold step was built on its recent history of creating teams, but the scope of the Van Plan exceeded previous structural reforms. So it was not surprising that strong feelings arose--anxiety and excitement, doubt and optimism. (The second section of this snapshot describes these reactions.) What becomes clear is that how the school went about making the changes was as much an issue as what occurred when teaming was in place.<p>	It would be unfortunate if all the time and passion devoted to creating, revising, and adopting the new master schedule distracted the faculty from the central reason for even having teams: better teaching and learning. This paper, therefore, begins with sketches of two classes in which the researchers believe teachers and students are demonstrating good teaching and learning--where lively instruction engages students in meaningful work. Not every Lincoln classroom is as strong as these two; there is still much work to do. The snapshot ends back in the classroom, which is where we hope the Lincoln faculty and administration concentrate their efforts, as they keep in mind the reason why they invested so much emotional and intellectual capital in creating more teams.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ktal"><hr><center><h2>Keeping Teaching and Learning Central</h2></center><hr>The school is crossing a threshold, as more than half of the students this coming fall will be teamed. Neither John Thornton nor Fran Murray, however, works alongside other teachers on a team. When the bells ring, they are on their own, although each keeps in touch with colleagues after class. Mr. Thornton and Ms. Murray are not loners, opposed in principle to teaming. If they stay at Lincoln High, they will probably become members of a team. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="jtc"><h3>John Thornton's Class</h3><p><blockquote>When you go back and get your power amplifier, double-check the IC orientation. Be sure pin one is where it's supposed to be. Make sure you don't have any of the capacitors backwards or we'll have premature Fourth of July. And take an ohm meter to verify that you don't have a zero ohm condition, indicating a short. Now once you get the power amplifiers that work, I don't want to have them smoking! So be sure you double-check your work when you set it up.</blockquote><blockquote>Some of the tables in the back have been pushed together. Please move them apart. And be careful with the table with the ferric chloride solution--I don't want that spilled on the floor! If you need a soldering kit, take one of these, but bring it back. By the way, yesterday at a meeting we were given a good pat on the back by Miss Burke for the work we're doing.</blockquote>	When Mr. Thornton finishes, the kids get their projects and assemble at their tables. David is at the ferric chloride solution, etching his plate. As he works, he explains how he covers the circuit board, a slab of plastic with a thin copper layer on top:<p><blockquote>I'll cover what I want to keep with an acetate stencil and put the board into the ferric chloride. The solution eats away all the copper that is not covered by acetate, leaving paths for the current to flow to different parts. Once I have that, I'll drill holes through to solder on electrical components like ICs, capacitors, and resistors.</blockquote>	We ask David, "What part of the project are you working on now?" and he answers, "The SAD [serial analog device] 1024. It runs the power through this, and then it goes through the buffer. And this hooks up to the power amplifier. You can take a Walkman and plug it in and it'll boost it to about twenty-five watts."<p>	David has his own business cards. He and two friends install car stereos, and they buy the components for their clients, as well as installing them. His current project at home is taking apart the back seat of his own car to rig up new speakers. When he plays the system, the seat will rise several feet to unleash stereo sound powerful enough to rattle windows a block away.<p>	As David and his classmates speak, their talk is punctuated with technical details about wattage and speaker magnet weights. To many, their conversation would sound like a foreign language; even so, it is clear that they are fluent in this language and enjoy the ease with which they can speak. Occasionally someone calls across the room for information. It is loud because of the acoustics, not because of yelling, and all are working as they talk.<p>	Mr. Thornton compares his students to unmined ore, an upbeat image that reaffirms the worth of what they bring with them to his class. He builds on their interests, particularly in music and cars. He talks with pride about these students:<p><blockquote>David and these guys know what a power amplifier is, and they know what mixers are. When we talked about filters, they plotted the responses on one of these dB meters I brought in. Then they'll say, "Wow, I saw the same figure when I was out shopping for a speaker cabinet! It was right there on the label inside the speaker."</blockquote>	If he told them to pull out a textbook and "graph for the sake of graphing," Mr. Thornton says, he would lose them; "There's got to be an application for them." He fantasizes about taking an entire class to a Circuit City store: <p><blockquote>One group would select the tuner, another would pick the CD player, a third would get the power amplifier, and the fourth group would choose the speakers. They'd not only buy everything, but they'd actually put it into somebody's car; then we'd go through it step by step to inspect what we did. Everybody gets a passing grade if they did their part. That to me is what learning is all about.</blockquote>	The same approach could work in other subjects, Mr. Thornton believes. If he were teaching English and assigned one of his favorite books, <cite>The Old Man and the Sea</cite>, he would have students find old advertisements for fishing equipment and also dig up the National Weather Service reports for that year. He would send them to local fishing stores to learn more about bait and rods. What he would <cite>not </cite>do is begin with a book report: "They'd put in a huge title to fill up three lines, then leave a big space, then have three words on each line, double-spacing, and keep on like that, finishing with a big 'The End,' just to give me five pages."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fmc"><h3>Fran Murray's Class</h3><p>Right after the bell, the students are busy with their assignment, a "sponge" activity to do when they walk in. This morning, the class is working through an algebraic equation. After a few minutes, Ms. Murray goes over the solution with the students, asking questions constantly, coaxing, providing clues. Then they move to the central task for the day. On the overhead, she draws a model of a table with additive inverses and absolute values. Continuing to question and prompt, Ms. Murray completes one entry in the table, showing how the job should be done.<p>	She then begins to set up groups. During this time, the students are attentive and quiet, and virtually all seem to be following the lesson. Only one girl, Nina, is not with the rest. She has her head down on her desk. At one point as Ms. Murray goes around the room, she gives Nina's back a part, saying sympathetically, "I guess you're having a hard morning." Ms. Murray knows that Nina's grandfather died during the school's spring break.<p>	Rather than telling students to get themselves into groups, Ms. Murray passes out colorful cards with geometric shapes ("Triangles over here, please, circles in the far corner"); then, on the overhead, Ms. Murray jots down the social skills they will work on along with their math concepts. There is a master list on the back bulletin board, and for every group activity, Ms. Murray and the class select several. Today they agree on three skills: no put-downs, with Ms. Murray adding a comment about not calling each other names; checking (they were to read each other's papers); and listening. She writes those on her overhead as she speaks. They pick some roles, also listed on the back board: recorder, observer, and seeker. Last fall Ms. Murray added <cite>seeker </cite>because students had trouble getting along, and the prospect of summoning her seemed to prevent disruptions.<p>	Once the roles and skills are established, Ms. Murray asks the students to move their chairs into groups and reminds everyone to sit close together in a square. She says, "I'm going to count to ten, and I want you to be in groups by the time I reach ten." As she starts the count, everyone bunches their chairs together, an impressive feat, since some have to move across the room. At ten, all four groups are working on the additive inverses.<p>	Ms. Murray walks around the room, answering questions, usually asking questions back. She coaxes one student to give an answer, then asks the student who asked the original question if that helped. She often refers to work completed earlier in the spring, reminding them how everything is building on what they have learned and is fitting together.<p>	One group has a student who briskly directs the others: "OK! Is everyone ready? OK! We have to do this timeline." Fran later said that he was in group therapy and her other students often find him overbearing. Today he is directive in a quiet way. No one in his group seems annoyed.<p>	Nina's head is still down on her desk, yet she holds a pencil upright in her hand. Fran comes over to give her another pat, and she asks the group to be understanding. They pass their papers to Nina throughout the hour, sometimes pushing them right under her nose and arm. From time to time the top of her pencil moves, and she is in fact trying to check the papers.<p>	Although Fran Murray's class is obviously shaped by her friendly relationships with students, her notion of caring includes mutual obligations. "Just being a nice guy, making life easy, giving them a way out--that's not what's best for our kids." Curving the grades when students do poorly on a test weakens both students' and teachers' responsibilities for learning. So does allowing truants quick ways to make up six weeks of missed assignments. "Caring has to go both ways. You have to be--I don't like this word--an authority. Set strong goals and expect them to live up to those goals as you encourage and nurture them." Fran worries that Lincoln High is prone to starting and celebrating new initiatives without enough attention to program goals and evaluation. "Pushing for the program is OK, but we always need to ask ourselves what we expect students to get."<p>	Fran pushes herself to experiment and innovate. She has picked up exciting ideas from a district algebra collaborative for using graphic calculators and making group tests. On her own, she has decided to include more applications in every class: for example, electricians' fees, angles of ski slopes, and average heights of females from birth to age twenty. Some of her most effective methods mark the classrooms of good teachers of any subject: using cooperative learning and frequent writing, answering questions with more questions, urging students to teach each other, and creating stories to demonstrate understanding of abstract notation. She would like to work with science teachers, perhaps paired once a week, to share what she knows. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="csig"><h3>Can Students Identify Good Teaching and Learning?</h3><p>Even with lively instruction by dedicated teachers, it is not easy for students to appreciate active learning or understand concepts in depth. The dimensions of the challenge are large. When students see the need for teamwork in solving genuine problems, the odds are better that they will value what the Coalition seeks. Even so, it is a big job and quick victories are rare, as the comments of Vanessa and David indicate.<p>	For Vanessa, math with Ms. Murray is the best of her classes. She opens her notebook to show off her quizzes, "sponges," homework, and class work: "I pay attention. Have to." Last year she could daydream and talk in class. "That was a blast. But this is better." Not only is her best friend in four of her classes, she is also proud that she finally learned how to add and subtract negative numbers. She draws pictures of balloons to explain how she has learned: "See, these are air puffs and these are sandbags. You put your balloon on positive three, then take two air puffs away so the balloon sinks." She shows how five plus negative nine should be figured. "Have to put in nine of these old sandbags so the five sinks down to negative four." When asked to <cite>subtract </cite>negative nine from five, she fidgets and says, "That makes me so mad--it doesn't make sense to me." When asked why we study negative numbers, Vanessa shakes her head: "I don't know. I know what it is but I don't know why." She can repeat procedures--she knows all the roles for group work, and she remembers the number line laid out on the floor of the classroom, which Ms. Murray calls "the algebra walk"--but deeper understandings elude her.<p>	Even though David loves electronics, he claims that he still dislikes math. Last semester he failed geometry, and this spring he thinks his average is a D+. He failed health class last year and only earned the credits by going to the late-afternoon Extended School Services, a second-chance program at Lincoln. David knows that he could easily raise his math grade by turning in more assignments--even incomplete or wrong answers earn some points--yet when he does math assignments, he frequently leaves them at home.<p>	David has never heard of the Coalition of Essential Schools. He does know that Lincoln High has made changes recently. In his opinion, the evidence of improvement is the fresh paint in the building, better security, and a tougher stand on tardiness. He does not mention anything about instruction, yet he values the underlying principles of the Coalition, even if he does not know or use the lingo of "student-as-worker," "Exhibitions," or "less is more." David enjoys group work, prefers to show off his skill by making things he can use, and appreciates teachers who have high expectations. Whatever his feelings about math, he knows the value of interdisciplinary learning, because from personal experience he realizes that measuring the thickness of wire helps him solve problems in electronics. He can give examples of the now-fashionable word <cite>authentic</cite>:  <p><blockquote>A real test is the working of the classroom. Trying to get people that don't want to work, to work. Cause it's just like a car: some guys might work on the engine and some other guys are doing the wheels. You need both. That's what we're doing. The SAD part of the project won't work without the buffer. The buffer can't work without the SAD. The power amplifier can work by itself, but it won't be as clear or sound as good.</blockquote>David knows what it means to work together.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tiot"><hr><center><h2>The Impact of Teaming on Lincoln</h2></center><hr>Before examining the many issues raised by the expansion of teaming at Lincoln, we will describe, in brief, how teaming efforts at Lincoln evolved into their present, still-developing form.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rhot"><h3>Recent History of Teaming</h3><p>The expansion of teaming has been taking shape since the late 1980s. In 1988, the Zephyr team arose to ease the transition from middle school to high school and reduce the high dropout rate of freshmen. The team veterans acknowledge the tentative and halting first steps of the early years: "That first year we just worked on behavior and attendance. It wasn't until the second year that we started our environmental unit." Staff turnover, especially of science teachers, complicated curriculum planning, even though the team won a second planning period. Some observers wondered if Zephyr took too many field trips. The team persisted, proud of their efforts and pleased by the growing number of visitors.<p>	A smaller team, a pairing of an English and history teacher, also began in the late 1980s. Their version of American studies for juniors featured a range of activities: mask making, family trees, interviewing local citizens, acting out book reports, and hearing guest speakers. They, too, refined and improved their collaboration. One parent reported the progress through the eyes of her three children: "My oldest said it stunk. The next year, 1989, I heard that it wasn't wonderful, but he lived with it. Now I hear great things about it from my youngest."<p>	Several more teams formed in 1991, in order to have every ninth-grader on one of three teams. So far, the achievements of the new teams center on conversations about individual students, parent conferences, and fewer referrals to the front office. As with most new teams, pedagogical changes, including interdisciplinary units and dramatically different use of time, lie in the future. "I'm still the math [teacher]; I go to my room and do my thing," one teacher reported. They have spent much time learning how to work together, getting to know each other's strengths, and figuring out how to make decisions, plan, and follow through.<p>	Although the teams differ considerably, there is the underlying faith that if the master schedule changes significantly, then instruction will also change sooner or later. The principal sees teaming as a good way to "create the conditions" for better teaching. She welcomes the variety among the teams: "I don't want to say to people, 'Everybody has to look like this.' Maybe that's been a problem, teachers believing we're saying that. No, that's never been what I've wanted." She recognizes that many fine teachers at Lincoln have not been on teams, and she acknowledges that sometimes the teams haven't made good use of their opportunities. Still, provision of large blocks of time for four or five teachers eases the way for teachers to coach rather than lecture, for students to tackle projects, not worksheets, and for students and teachers to get to know each other well instead of avoiding close contact.<p>	What Lincoln is trying to do with the expansion of teaming sets it apart from, and ahead of, most other Coalition schools. Few sites have made the bold step of teaming as many teachers and students as Lincoln plans to do. Usually a team encompasses only a handful of volunteers, and often they live a separate life from the rest of the school, with a few rooms of their own and the accompanying isolation typical of schools-within-a-school. What Lincoln is creating is also exceptional in light of the school's size. It is much easier to team when a school is small, especially if de facto teams have already taken hold. Furthermore, the change is a marker of how far Lincoln has moved since the 1980s, when a ninth-grade team was created. A veteran English teacher remembers four colleagues then struggling without an integrated curriculum, a common planning period, or shared space in the building. They had several weeks together in the summer, but each one wrote his own curriculum. One of them recalled, "I kept saying to myself, this is not what a real team should do."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tama"><h3>Teamwork and Mainstreaming: A Major Challenge</h3><p>Teamwork is more than just the internal relationships within formally identified teams. <p>	In Lincoln's recent history, a major innovation which called for imaginative teamwork throughout the school was the summer 1991 decision to mainstream all the special education (ECE) students. The shift caught most staff by surprise, even though the possibility had been discussed periodically. Quite a few teachers, therefore, felt blindsided by the change when school began last fall. <p>	Several aspects of mainstreaming may foreshadow what could arise this fall in response to teaming's expansion. What constituted true mainstreaming was not always clear. Did numbers matter? In a section of consumer math, for instance, fifteen of the twenty-one students were ECE. Was that mainstreaming? One team wanted to pull aside the ECE kids because the overall range of abilities in the team was so vast. Was that mainstreaming? To what extent should ECE students failing in one class be reassigned to a less demanding section of the same course, where the odds of passing were higher? Was that mainstreaming?<p>	Those questions were not as volatile as the ambiguity about the place of ECE teachers in regular teachers' classes. On teams, the specialists sometimes stayed at the edges, acting like aides or clerks, as the regular teacher held center stage. Elsewhere, when they followed individual students through their classes, they appeared so rarely, perhaps twice during the year, that no role other than a quick check-up was established, and even that seemed to vary in usefulness. A few regular teachers resented the special education teachers' independence and relative freedom to arrange their days as they wished, with some more diligent than others. In turn, the ECE staff saw how several teachers either would not or could not change their instruction to accommodate a wider range of abilities and disabilities.<p>	Opinions varied as to mainstreaming's impact on students. As an assistant principal said, "It's difficult and frustrating . . . we're all learning. . . . In a way, we mainstreamed the teachers along with the kids." Some teachers celebrated the ECE students who worked hard enough to earn the regular grade, instead of taking the ECE grade option, yet other teachers resented counselors who occasionally raised a grade on the basis of the student's Individualized Educational Program (IEP). Most of the concerns focused on the behaviorally disordered students, with the majority of teachers feeling they were not all well served by placement in regular classrooms.<p>	The same cries of "we're moving too fast" were heard in the spring of 1992, when the new master schedule crystallized. When the number of teams rises this fall, the same uncertainties about teaming--what is this? how can we work together? what are the results?--will probably arise, as they did when mainstreaming was instituted.<p>	As a result of the initial snags as well as early successes, fine-tunings are likely, just as next year's revised ECE program will feature new options for job training and for teaching the behaviorally disordered students.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tscc"><h3>The School Community's Concernsabout Teaming</h3><p>Apart from the experiences with mainstreaming, it is already clear that other questions are on the minds of Lincoln faculty in regard to teaming. The creation, revision, and adoption of the 1992-93 master schedule generated some controversy about <cite>what </cite>teaming would mean, as well as some dispute about <cite>how </cite>the school went about making the decision. There was grumbling on both counts. Students, parents, and teachers raised questions and voiced concerns. <p>	In the following section, six perspectives on teaming--four of individual teachers, and two of students and parents in general--are sketched in order to lay out the wide range of experiences and opinions on teaming. The profiles deliberately highlight anxieties and doubts. It should be remembered that not everyone in the school shares these views. Furthermore, much of the concern may turn out to be the natural fear, confusion, anger, and uncertainty which people in many schools feel in the face of major change. In fact, it would be surprising if those powerful emotions did not surface in the wake of restructuring.<p><h4>Chip Smoley's Views </h4><p>Although he would like to see hard data on teaming, in its absence Chip relies on his own observations and conversations with students. He thinks the junior year English/history pairing has improved. He hears some kids say that they don't do enough English, but Chip knows that without the familiar grammar book, they might not realize that rewriting a history paper is indeed English. Chip is sure that he can identify a former Zephyr team student by the second week in September. "They are the ones who say, 'Homework? On the first day, we get homework?' And then, three days later, they ask, 'When do we get a free day, Mr. Smoley?'"<p>	What worries him more than the track record of previous teams is the way decisions about the master schedule have been made (or not made) in recent months. He appreciates the open-door policy of the curriculum committee, which meets every Monday afternoon. What he perceives--and resents--is an implication that "if you don't show up, you shouldn't complain about what we decided." He also regrets the two-month delay in responding to five pages of questions generated in small groups at the faculty meeting where the 1992-93 master schedule was presented. He wishes there had been a survey--perhaps a questionnaire, not necessarily a vote--to see how the faculty really feels about the creation of more teams. Chip also wants to know how slots would be filled if two or more teachers applied, or if several teachers on their own volunteered themselves as a team. "Everything's been suggested, from drawing names out of a hat to submitting mini-resumes to the steering committee. Those are important decisions, and I think the uncertainty has hurt morale."<p><h4>Wendy Campbell's Views </h4><p>While Wendy holds very different views from Chip's, she too is frustrated. <p>	She claims that the assessment figures speak well for teaming. On her own, she tallied her former students' grades in math, English, and science in the year after she taught them. She also counted how many became leaders in school clubs. She was thrilled with how well they did--better, she said, than students not on her team. But she decided against publicizing the comparisons. "We knew that if we showed those results at a faculty meeting, it would make everyone mad. Boastful, that's what they'd say! I'd only use those results if parents were upset or the program were threatened." She is proud her students did well, but, she says, "We didn't rub it in anyone's face--they dislike us anyway and that would have made them hate us more."<p>	As Chip worries about moving ahead too quickly, Wendy recalls the hours spent studying all the sophomore and junior transcripts. The original plan for teaming included math and science for every senior, which Wendy defended by proving that the great majority of the upcoming seniors needed credits in both subjects to graduate. What would happen if they needed Algebra 2 and biology, but those teachers were not on the same team? Another long look at the transcripts indicated that usually the Algebra 2 students needed chemistry. She devoted many hours to the curriculum committee and steering committee meetings, and she appreciated the time spent by several administrators who stayed in a motel for two days to forge the final details of the master schedule.<p>	Wendy's concerns stem from the struggles she endured--and sometimes provoked--last year as a team member. She quarrels with the administration about the team's responsibility for covering the in-school suspension class, which she dislikes in principle and resents in practice for eroding her team's planning time. She complains about the way the counselors and assistant principals assigned new students to her team and switched old students from one team to another, without asking either team's approval. She resents the pressure last fall to offer two subjects targeted for the most able students. Occasionally the team appealed to the principal in hopes of reversing the assistant principal's decisions, but, she says, "If we had bothered her on every issue this year, we would have spent our lives in her office."<p><h4>Derek Dee's Views </h4><p>Derek, a math teacher, admits, "Dealing with fourteen-year-olds all day wears me out. I need variety." A senior class, in contrast to the freshmen, is a "gravy train" because, by then, "a lot of the trouble is weeded out." Unequal workloads annoy him; when he was department chair, he made sure everyone had at least one top-track class. This year he had 120 ninth-graders, with only ten or twelve he considered attentive and motivated. One period, he says, was <p>wall-to-wall special ed kids. That's tough. You lecture and walk the aisles. All ninth-graders, with massive problems: drug use, wrecked homes, bad love life, pregnant girls, girls wondering if they are pregnant, breaking up with boyfriends, sitting here crying and whining. I'm trying to teach math, but it's like talking to a brick wall.</blockquote>	Some of the problems that bother Derek the most are beyond the reach of even the best team. Students, he says, "come in here in turmoil, not because I did anything wrong. They're so upset they kick the wall or pick a fight." He estimates that 15 percent of his students have been in drug rehabilitation and at least 50 percent need professional therapy.<p>	Derek wants to work with kids who want to work. He has taught adults in night school. "They do their part. They've had their fill of four-dollars-an-hour jobs and are looking for a better life." Those were the students he sought: students who would come to him with a work ethic. "I can't take somebody that doesn't have any desire and change that."<p>	He admires the principal: "Valerie Taylor and that whole crew are trying to make a better world, I have no doubt. They are willing to try an awful lot of stuff." What he wishes they would try is a crisis center "so when I get ready to kill a kid, I can send him some place besides the hall or downstairs, especially when the principals are out and about. When all hell breaks loose and I want to get one guy out of here, we have big trouble. I can't leave to take him down, but I can't trust him to go on his own."<p>	Derek feels that his team this year agreed on several rules which they enforced consistently. That helped, as did the agreement for everyone to slow down so the special education students would not be totally lost. Teaching study skills and giving points every day for participation encouraged more students to try. Derek is pleased with the graphs and charts he coordinated with the unit on ecology his team developed. But no team could give him what he craves: "better kids, on grade level, who are academically motivated." He decided to retire.<p><h4>Pat Clark's Views</h4><p>Pat's sophomores have as many emotional complications as Derek Dee's freshmen. Ozela has herpes; Harriett weights 350 pounds; LaTosha's stepfather is in jail for murder; and Beth Ann, a manic-depressive, has been hospitalized four times. Jim is hyperactive and often jumps out of his chair; Sean works eight hours daily and usually dozes off in class. Lou routinely farts in class. Oprah sucks her thumb, and when she starts, Michael does too. Two boys, best friends, are so shy they fear speaking in front of others.<p>	On her own initiative, apart from a team, Pat searches, with more optimism than Derek, for new ways to teach. She values conferences and has gained useful ideas from the Coalition's Fall Forum, the Commonwealth Institute for Teachers' summer seminar, Foxfire gatherings, and local presentations. She invites guest speakers to her class, and she takes her students to plays and concerts. Pat thinks about her teaching all the time and keeps a journal filled with lengthy reflections. Like Derek, she knows that some efforts fail, but unlike Derek, she comes back with undiminished determination:<p><blockquote>The traditional methods I once used do not work. I am trying to find another way to capture the kids' interest in reading, without threatening them. I want to encourage them to like it enough so they won't run away from reading. I think if we keep writing, their reading skills will improve. So far, I haven't had any real disasters. I do wish I could get better results faster. I haven't found a way. I haven't found in the articles and books I read that other people know a surefire way either! I hope there is a way. I'll keep working on it until I find it.</blockquote>	Pat likes the idea of team teaching. Teaching at other schools, she joined two teams and loved both. She relished the moral support of her teammates, and felt she had more access to the principal and a better chance of getting small grants for supplies. But Pat now teaches two sections of foreign language. With next year's teams blocked for four periods, she wonders if she will have to drop the language teaching. She loves teaching it and worries that fewer students will be able to take foreign language as one of their few electives. In this way, teaming will both help and hurt her.<p><h4>Students Voice Concerns </h4><p>The seven students in the conference room sound wary at the prospect of teams next fall. The upperclassmen are particularly upset. Several students circulated petitions against teaming and went to the steering committee to voice their concerns. Could they still take yearbook? Could they pick the teachers they wanted? Why spend four hours every day with the same people? Would this hurt them later in college? The freshmen and sophomores also worry about the teams. The teams bring back memories of middle school: "It's like they're trying to put us back, treating us like little kids again." They do not want to be babied, they say. High schools should offer independence, chances to meet new people and move around the building: "Nobody likes to be cooped up, stuck in one room all day with the same old faces."<p>	Several able and diligent freshmen doubt that the Zephyr team pushed them far enough. Why didn't they have more homework? How come they got A grades without doing much work? Why did sophomores they knew tell them they would be lost next year? Why did other freshmen do algebra that "we can't imagine doing? . . . They ask if we've done it too, and it's embarrassing because we're on eighth-grade stuff, like plotting negative and positive points."<p><h4>Parents Voice Concerns</h4><p>A group of parents also wonder if the more talented youngsters have been stretched enough. One mother hopes her daughter would take biology rather than general science, and she is puzzled why teachers do not correct spelling more often. "They need to give the honors students more work," she feels. The parents respect the reasons for mainstreaming but fear that "when they're all together, it may pull some back, even if it helps some others." Cooperative learning is acceptable to them; that method makes sense, even though they doubt that everyone contributes fully or gets to work quickly when a unit lasts six weeks.<p>	Where the parents differ the most is in the amount of contact they have with the teams. Some have heard immediately from the teachers whenever they have called; others are miffed they did not know sooner if their child was failing a course. One mother admits that "after being around here for years, I still didn't know which team would be best for my son." Another woman says she relies on the advice of a good friend active in the PTA, and a surprised father confesses that he had not known that it was possible to request a particular team. They are all relieved that their children sometimes knew how to push for change. One girl wrote a letter to the principal, and a boy switched classes when "the teacher threw up her hands because a bunch of them didn't want to learn. A few did, but the ones who really wanted to learn were suffering. So he got a transfer to another team."<p>	Still, those parents like the idea of teaming. The shortcomings and disappointments were not inherent in teaming and could be fixed by having more demanding teachers along with sending more information home. No one suggests abolishing teams or returning to the regimented classrooms they had endured as students. They have experienced teaming in their workplaces and that makes good sense to them. All they want is assurance that their children are challenged and the knowledge of what is going on. They are proud to be associated with the school, admire Mrs. Taylor's leadership, and praise the many teachers who are willing to innovate. Asked what he would do if tomorrow he were principal, one man smiles and says, "I'd hire Mrs. Taylor as my assistant principal."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="hdta"><h3>How Does Teaming AffectWork Conditions?</h3><p>Implementing teaming at Lincoln has had an effect on several aspects of teachers' working conditions and attitudes: their workload, their sense of equity and fairness, and their morale.<p><h4>Teaming's Impact on Workload </h4><p>In most high schools, teachers shape their working lives over time to find niches which they prize. Job satisfaction often stems from claiming a special program, favorite elective, winning sports team, popular chorus, or some other unique opportunity where it is possible to shine. Alternatively, some teachers welcome anonymity and isolation; that is their niche. In either case, teachers who remain at a high school find ways to arrange a tolerable workload. Often that accommodation takes years to establish and requires savvy negotiation. Its hard-won results are usually cherished.<p>	Teaming can rearrange those accommodations. For Pat, her elective brought her extra gratification. She has other sources of stimulation, but sometimes a teacher whose entire load is electives feels squeezed when the expansion of teaming restricts students' access to those courses. One veteran teacher at Lincoln was willing to do more than the three preps (the contractual limit) in order to attract more and better students. "Right now I just kind of hang on, try to survive, and enjoy the ones I do get." Some electives, she fears, will get dropped entirely, others will be scaled back, and others will be preserved. The pain won't be distributed evenly, she predicts.<p>	Teaming also affects the required core subjects. Derek Dee struggles with 120 ninth-graders and yearns for variety in the form of upperclassmen. Yet a load of five senior English classes (which awaits one unteamed teacher) may be quite burdensome in light of the substantial writing and rewriting for the portfolios mandated by the state's education reform act. The trade-off of fewer preps for less variety does not appeal to everyone. Maybe the variety might take another form: with a wide range of students in one team, perhaps six levels of math will be necessary; even if several levels are formally called the same thing, the prep time necessary to truly personalize the instruction may be substantial.<p><h4>Teaming's Impact on Equity</h4><p>The assignment of students affects everyone. In the original design, teamed teachers had approximately thirty fewer students then the unteamed teachers, and they had two planning periods, one more than everyone else. In the past, some Lincoln faculty claimed that the privileged conditions of the team meant more work for everyone else, and the team, in turn, was sure it was working harder than ever. The workload discrepancies narrowed as the revisions of the master schedule moved along this spring, but the "You've got it easy," "No, not at all, my life is harder" exchanges continued. In addition, issues of equity arose around the distribution of the strongest and weakest students. Would each team receive equal shares? What to do if only a few seniors in May, on the first day of arena scheduling (a first-come, first-serve process of choosing teams), signed up for the new eleventh/ twelfth-grade team? Could students be recruited or assigned there? By whom?<p>	Those questions about fairness might have popped up regardless of the procedures Lincoln used to create teams. Such anxieties may be inevitable. But the concerns about equity were heightened by some reservations about how decisions were made.<p>	Lincoln prides itself on using consensus as the way to make decisions, although some teachers claim that they still do not understand what consensus means. A few teachers wonder if it means that the most vocal keep talking until the skeptics are eventually worn down. Other teachers and administrators point out that the meaning of consensus has been discussed repeatedly, and that the opponents of particular changes seek a vote so they can defeat a proposal quickly instead of pondering its merits. They also note that there are well-established procedures for motions to revert to the steering committee when there is no agreement among the entire faculty. In their minds, the system is clear and fair. To others, it gives an advantage to the loud, the persistent, and those willing and able to attend dozens of meetings.<p>	In an early-March faculty meeting, Chip Smoley asked if the proposed master schedule was a "done deal." He expressed a concern shared by some faculty: the decision seemed set. Others teachers picked at the work of the assistant principals, who renamed the original plan, revised it, and later recruited a few teachers for some slots. But from the assistant principals' perspective, the original was unworkable, the details had to be handled by people who understood all the constraints on the schedule, and without recruitment some team slots might remain vacant.<p><h4>Teaming's Impact on Faculty Morale</h4><p>In the discussion at the March meeting of what and how the school was changing, the faculty with reservations were not identical to the group previously known as <cite>resisters</cite>.2 A wider spectrum of the faculty fretted about the expansion of teaming than they had about other changes Lincoln has undertaken recently. Teachers, such as Fran Murray, who had never teamed but taught in the spirit of the nine Common Principles, voiced concerns; so did teachers on teams who had rarely taught according to Coalition precepts. Old and young faculty had questions. Male and female teachers spoke up. <p>	The alignment on teaming correlated to some degree with allegiance to the Coalition. That does not mean that faith in Coalition ideas suddenly vanished. It suggests, instead, that loyalty can be rivaled by other immediate concerns and priorities that bear directly on the nitty-gritty of who, when, where, and with whom someone teaches. Workplace conditions that create and maintain security in teachers' everyday lives can overshadow ideological commitments to innovative pedagogy.<p>	One way to think about the emotions aroused by the expansion of teaming at Lincoln High School focuses on the interplay of agreement, trust, and energy. Those three traits are critical components that act together to allow teachers to sustain a stable environment in which they teach. It is possible to operate in a climate of disagreement when there are ample supplies of energy and trust in the decency of others. But when supplies of trust become overdrawn, when decision making is seen as a "done deal," energy alone is probably not enough to mitigate the stresses of daily life. When the reservoir of agreement, trust, and energy is too low, daily life can become harried.<p>	In the past, Lincoln often endured disagreements without eroding the sense of mutual trust or the drive to work hard. Sometimes a few people lacking trust or energy came to a new issue ready to quibble and obstruct; their opposition, in other words, stemmed from, rather than caused, their wariness or lethargy. But this spring, some faculty who before had a large measure of both trust and stamina lost a bit of both as a result of the disagreements.<p>	It could be that energy, agreement, and trust resemble the three engines on a 727 jet. The flight is fast and safe when all three are operating. If one engine sputters or fails, the other two can carry the plane, although the pilots and passengers won't go as far as originally planned. But if two of the three engines give out, the odds of a safe flight drop.<p>	Fortunately, engines can be restarted, and a challenge ahead is the restoration of trust and drive in the minority of the faculty who were deeply disgruntled this spring. What other challenges may await Lincoln High?<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="mtwt"><h3>Making Teaming Work to Improve Instruction</h3><p>Between the extremes of total autonomy and constant surveillance, Lincoln needs to find ways to support the teams in the constructive spirit of a "critical friend," to use a popular Coalition phrase. Advice and help should extend beyond an occasional workshop. The central challenge is keeping a focus on instruction. The details of teaming--rooms, budgets, trips, paper work--should not distract attention from pedagogy. Because a schedule is only a means to the end of better teaching and learning, teaming by itself guarantees nothing. It can offer opportunities and favorable settings in which instruction might improve. Whether or not good use is made of those chances depends on other factors than the schedule.<p>	We offer some suggestions for reflection on how to make teaming work to improve teaching and learning at Lincoln High School.<p><ul>	<li>	What if a respected veteran teacher spent part of each week (or each day, if possible) as a mentor to the teams? He or she might watch, listen, ask questions, and in other ways facilitate the work of the teams. This colleague would be neither an administrator/evaluator nor an aide there to do chores. The notion of a peer coach does not preclude creative, new alliances with administrators. One can imagine part or all of a ninth-grade course in each team, taught by an assistant principal or a counselor (as happens in many private schools), and in turn the teams could try to relieve the administrators of some tasks. Having many strong teams, for instance, would mean fewer disciplinary referrals.<p>	<li>	What if a copy of the minutes of all the major committees was put in the mailbox of every staff member? Knowledge of changes under way might be deepened if everyone had a copy, instead of keeping the minutes in the front office. The easy excuse, "I didn't know," would be removed. The larger issue is communication: when schools move away from the traditional hierarchical organization, the flow of information takes on greater importance. Knowledge and power now go together. Wise decisions should be based on accurate and complete information.<p>	<li>	Teacher isolation might wane this fall, only to be replaced by team isolation. What if each team swapped ideas with the other teams? A meeting every other week, with one representative per team, could generate helpful exchanges of ideas and experiences. Interdisciplinary units, ECE students, portfolios, and other instructional topics could spark productive discussions.<p>	<li>	What if the teams listened closely to students' views of learning and teaching? For example, many students' wariness about teaming is no secret. How much of that fear is grounded on incomplete and inaccurate information, circulated by gossip and hearsay? Just lecturing students on the similarities between changes in their school and changes in the modern workplace will probably not be enough. A local company may have every employee on teams, but frequently student knows other places where teamwork isn't mandatory. And they are quick to point out that sloppy teamwork at work brings stiffer penalties than the consequences they see when classmates goof off. Students need to be convinced by experiencing the benefits of teaming.<p>	<li>	Even so, what if a pamphlet was made available for students (and their parents) that explains in simple, clear language the teaching and learning that Lincoln prizes. Vivid examples of student work should be included; in fact, the students themselves might write the pamphlet. In any case, the material should be as concise and direct as the issue of <cite>Horace</cite>, the Coalition's newsletter, which featured Lincoln's athletic department's views of the parallels between teaching and coaching.<p>	<li>	What if Lincoln asked for more advice and assistance from the allies it already has? A former Lincoln teacher now at the Lindeman Academy, the district-sponsored professional development academy, understands the obstacles well-intentioned teams face; she has much to offer. Faculty from the local university could alert Lincoln teams to some excellent articles on the recurring problems teams encounter; and from the Coalition, Lincoln should make use of Pat Wasley's case studies of teams. The ongoing exploration of Deming's work on Total Quality Management should be apt and useful, as the teams start to define quality work. The researchers from the University of Wisconsin who are studying Lincoln should be asked for feedback. Whatever the approach to getting advice and assistance, much is already known about teaming, and Lincoln has ready access to the literature and the people who know it.<p>	<li>	Discussions of teaming usually focus on couplings--adults with adults, teams with students--as the placement of people captures attention. What if the school emphasized the importance of who comes to Lincoln in the first place, regardless of how they are scheduled after they are there? Often educators put great stock in new programs and unintentionally underestimate the crucial matter of the people who make up a school. As a magnet school, what students does Lincoln want to attract? What marketing strategies will draw the students the school seeks? What talents and values do new faculty bring? To what extent can Lincoln decide who the rookies will be? How are the newcomers introduced to the Coalition after they arrive? <p></ul>	On the other hand, what efforts are made to keep the excellent teachers who might consider leaving? If a top-flight research university lost as many of its stars as Lincoln has in the last five years, its national standing would drop considerably. Valerie Taylor spoke wistfully:<p><blockquote>[I worry about the talented faculty] who have been taken from us. That sounds like an obituary. Lots of folks have been picked up by the state or the district--some of the heroes I could always count on--and I worry about the health and fatigue of the ones still here. This takes its toll.</blockquote>	The most awesome master schedule could be created, without friction, but if the faculty lacked the verve, pedagogical flair, and whatever else makes an outstanding teacher, then the expansion of teaming would be a hollow victory.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="alat"><hr><center><h2>Another Look at Teaching and Learning</h2></center><hr>We end this snapshot, as we began, with a visit to a classroom that will raise questions about what makes good teaching and learning. These are questions that ought to remain central in the midst of the major organizational changes the school is experiencing in regard to teaming.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="avtm"><h3>A Visit to Mr. Edwards' Class</h3><p>After Sam Edwards calls the roll, two boys close the window shades, then a movie begins. It is a graphic film, with pictures of hearts, surgery, and lots of blood. At the first sight of a heart beating, one student calls out, "Is that real, Ed?" Another student asks, "Does a heart really make that sound?" Mr. Edwards nods. Seven minutes after the film started, five students' heads are down, but everyone else seems to be watching, including Mr. Edwards, and the class is fairly quiet. From time to time, students toss out questions and Edwards gives short answers. <p>	"How long does that surgery take?" <p>	"Four or five hours." <p>	"Don't they take any rest?" <p>	"No."<p>	The movie ends after fifteen minutes, and Mr. Edwards sits on the table at the front of the room and starts talking. "When I first saw this, I felt sick. That hatchet used to pull the sternum apart, the heart jumping around...; they have to cool the heart, slow it down, before they can operate. I wish the movie had shown you that." <p>	Mr. Edwards continues his lecture with the students occasionally popping a question at him. In a few minutes he talks about circulation of the blood, artificial heart machines, how to prepare the ribs for surgery, and the expense of surgery. Then he turns on his overhead projector and says, "You all give me your attention now, please."<p>	He writes an outline on the overhead as he shushes them to be still. "You're hummin' and chantin'." Starting with monotrenes and marsupials, he asks the students which marsupials have belly buttons; do dogs? cats? chickens? horses? He urges a boy to crawl under a horse and double-check.<p>	One student asks a reasonable question: "How does a mother horse tie the belly button since there hasn't always been veterinarians around to do it?" She wonders if horses chewed it off. Mr. Edwards replies, "Yes, madam, mother horse chews it right off."<p>	He continues with his list, without making connections between these categories and the movie. He moves briskly and covers a lot of material, punctuating his talk by some stories about different kinds of bats. One student asks if bats in South America land on cows and bite them. He leans his head back, sticks his arms out to the side and twists his head and body. The students don't laugh much, although several, later, say they like his sense of humor.<p>	As this lecture continues for ten more minutes, there isn't much commotion in the room. Mr. Edwards does move a talker to the front row, and occasionally students yell to each other. One boy is rocking back and forth in his chair, knocking it against the back wall. Twice students get up, to throw away a piece of paper and to pick up a jar. A boy sitting in the front right-hand corner does no work; we were told he is staying in school until he can drop out.	<p>	Mr. Edwards gives a quiz with eight minutes left in the period. He asks them to recall what had been on the overheads. He tells them to write down several categories of mammals and give an example of each one. "Don't look at your notes." The students do not seem to cheat, but Mr. Edwards does not check closely to see if they looked at their notes.<p>	Several students are asleep, and there are some conversations, including a few students giving each other answers. At least half of the students do the quiz, but some skip it. <p>	At the end of the class one boy asks, "What are you picking up, Ed?" <p>	"Your assignment." <p>	"What assignment?"<p>	Sam Edwards combines interesting films, organized lectures, a sense of humor, and immediate reinforcement through quizzes. As with most experienced teachers, he uses the opening and closing minutes of the period effortlessly for taking attendance, entering grades, and handing back quizzes; and he knows the line between typical teenage talkativeness and chaotic hollering. He relies on a set of routines he likes and which the students accept.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cr"><h3>Concluding  Reflections</h3><p>We return to the issue with which we began: could working together improve teaching and learning? Who is doing the work in Mr. Edwards' classroom? Who is exhibiting? With a film nearly every day, how much chance is there for students to work together? More to the point, what is the chance that membership on a team could tempt Mr. Edwards to try instructional methods in the spirit of the Coalition? How will his life be better if his tightly scripted, teacher-directed style gives way to approaches where part of the success of each hour hinges on what the students do? How will the students' hearts and minds be better? The answers to those questions will be one assessment of teaming this year.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></center><p><ol><li> Pseudonyms were used for every student, teacher, and administrator mentioned in this paper. Some details of the long quotes and classroom vignettes were changed to protect student and teacher anonymity. Although occasional use was made of notes from the first visit in October 1991, nearly all the material here comes from our interviews and observations from April 13-17, 1992. We talked with thirty-five faculty members and administrators, interviewed or shadowed twenty-six students, saw fifteen classes, and attended three meetings. Pat Wasley, director of the study, joined us for two days, and she sent Hampel her notes and tapes. Two teachers kept journals for this project, and throughout the year they both sent us rich materials. We thank the teacher who masterfully scheduled our visits. <p><li> During our first visit to Lincoln the previous fall, the faculty seemed broadly divided into three groups: restructurers, those who supported the changes with enthusiasm; reviewers, those who were fence-sitters and had many concerns about change; and resisters, those generally opposed to the changes the school is undertaking.<p></ol><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr><p><a href="../../../projects/sc/chanlong.htm">Appendix A: About the School Change Study</a><br><a href="../../../principl/principl.htm">Appendix B: The Common Principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools</a><br><a href="../list.htm#2">Return to Index of School Change Publications</a><p></body></html>

As we do each time we visit a school as part of the School Change Study, we produced a "snapshot" of our visit, based on our observations in classrooms and conversations with people in the school community--teachers, students, administrators, and parents.<p>	 Lincoln High School is a suburban high school located in the south-central region of the country. About 75 percent of the students are white and 25 percent are black; 40 percent come from low-income families. Since joining the Coalition of Essential Schools in 1988, Lincoln has actively sought to implement the nine Common Principles in the school curriculum. (See Appendix B for a listing of these Principles.) Some of the major changes the school has undertaken have included mainstreaming the special education students; implementing portfolios, authentic assessments, and site-based decision making; and restructuring the schedule to team more than half the students in the school into groups of about one hundred students and four or five teachers. <p>	Instruction has to be the centerpiece of these snapshots, just as it should be the focus of the restructuring under way in all serious Essential Schools. As a way to highlight instruction in this snapshot, a student, "Brenda," narrates the first section. Brenda is not the writer's fantasy. Her words bring together the voices of several students, and the classroom observations rely on the insights of adults as well as youngsters. Brenda is admittedly articulate, serious, thoughtful, and not a bad writer! We hope her insights are not dismissed because she seems so sharp; nearly all Lincoln students are good observers of classroom life. They recognize excellent and poor teaching, and if they sometimes misjudge instruction, on balance they are reliable.<p>	What Brenda observes and reports from her point of view is what the researchers saw and heard. In this snapshot, we use classroom observations and interviews from all three visits to Lincoln, although the bulk of the material comes from our most recent week there.1 <p>	Suggested exercises for the reader appear at several points in the snapshot. Originally these exercises were intended for the Lincoln staff as a way of exploring the issues raised by the snapshot. We invite the reader to complete the exercises as well.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="adwb"><hr><center><h2>A Day with Brenda</h2></center><hr>The day in the life of Brenda offers quick sketches rather than exhaustive scrutiny of each period. The point is to provide enough description to provoke rather than overwhelm. What counts most is not our analysis, offered in the second section of the paper. What is important is the reflection that Brenda's narrative stimulates in each reader. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="se1"><table border><tr><td><h3>SUGGESTED EXERCISE #1</h3>	Brenda is a junior at Lincoln High. This fall she's taking chemistry, keyboarding, American studies, Algebra 2, and art. She also has a non-graded, twenty-five-minute Teacher Guided Assistance period (TGA) early in the day. Her GPA is 3.6, and she plans to go to the state university.<p>	Write your predictions about her comments on her classes. What themes or patterns will run through this section?  <p></td></table><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fpc"><h3>First Period, Chemistry</h3><p>Girls at the back of the room talk about bad romances: "If I hate someone, believe me. . . ." Julia missed last week's test and tries to negotiate for more time: "I had to watch a video last night and write a paper." Students spread out around the room, filling half the lab benches, each of which has sinks and electrical outlets. Announcements over the intercom: progress reports next Wednesday, dance team auditions after school today, items for the steering committee to Mrs. Taylor by Friday, Bulldog Bank open 11:15 to 12:30 and we can get loans to buy yearbooks, Department of Health requires booster shots, tryouts for wrestling extended.<p>	We move around to get into groups of three and four so we can work on skits we'll give. We have to do a presentation on lipids and proteins, their formations and breakdowns. It's a follow-up to earlier work on reactions between molecules. Mr. Warner gives an example of a news format used for a skit in his biology class: <p><blockquote>"Here we are outside the cell wall. I understand that mitosis is about to take place. We have a reporter on-site, inside the nucleus. Dave, over to you." </blockquote><blockquote>"Thanks, Chuck. Yes, the nucleus is splitting! Now two, now four. . . ."</blockquote>	We don't know the dot structures of molecules, but we'll remember better which molecules react with which other molecules if we make these songs. Our group is using the <cite>Brady Bunch </cite>theme song. Have to fiddle with it to get the beat right:<p><blockquote>There's a story, about a lonely glycerol,<br>That combined with three lonely fatty acids.<br>All of them combined to make a triglyceride which is a lipid<br>There's a story, of three glucoses,<br>Who were mixing with water of their own<br>They were four molecules, grouping altogether<br>. . . </blockquote>	Walking from group to group, Mr. Warner stops to see what we've done. "I thought you'd have proteins in there. What about doing something with them?" We agree to use an <cite>Addams Family </cite>tune for that section. Paula, a cheerleader who works at McDonalds four days each week, kids me for not knowing the tune. I kid her for watching too much television, but I am impressed that she's spent time on the phone with her boyfriend talking about saccharides.<p>	Two girls near me ask for help on glucose breakdown. Mr. Warner asks, "What's a form of glucose?" Blank stares. "What about this candy bar?" He picks up one student's breakfast. "What happens to that after you swallow it?" He keeps asking questions. They talk about fuel-to-energy conversion. After Mr. Warner leaves to work with another group, they take out their yearbooks.<p>	Our group goes first. We're happy with it, but Tim says no one else wants to go after us because we did so well. Three of the four of us are cheerleaders; we're used to working together and performing in front of other people. The second group uses cards to stand for oxygen, and they hold hands and then break hands to show bondings and reactions. Stacey in their group is absent, so they recruited Julia fast. The third group reads a story about amino acids and peptides, with Mr. and Mrs. Protein, their son Enzyme, and daughter Amino Acids. Herman reads it all--not too dynamic. Mr. Warner videotapes all the skits. He seemed pleased with how it went. He reminded us, "Next week is water week. Since we've been talking about water from a physiological approach this week, I want you to see water from the environmental side next week." On my way out I saw him with the candy bar-glucose students who did not do a presentation. "I know your mom is sick, but . . ." They are stalling, pretending they don't understand enough to do a presentation, getting defensive and a bit crabby.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="spk"><h3>Second Period, Keyboarding</h3><p>Ms. Stevens' classroom is set up so we all sit at work stations. Each table has four typewriters where four students sit so we see each other without being elbow-to-elbow close. Throughout the hour, she walks from table to table answering questions and looking at our work.<p>	She started this period by admitting that she could not find the papers turned in last Friday, and she immediately gave another assignment: centering material, setting proper margins at the side and top. She repeated the assignment to several tables as she went around the room. Students asked her questions, politely, sometimes calling out, "Ms. Stevens!" without shouting. Everyone had their books open to the right page, and work started after a few minutes. <p>	Ms. Stevens gets along well with us. Like when one boy came in late with a pass, she read it, frowned some, and said, "I am just telling you this for future reference. You miss something important when you come in late." She reminds me of a stewardess--dresses nicely, trim, graceful as she walks around, and polite.<p>	Unlike most other classes, we usually raise our hands here. We can keep reading or fiddling with the machines even when one arm is up. She sees us right away and comes over. Half the time kids want to show off their work, excited at getting it right; the other times they ask a question or say why they're stuck.<p>	At the tables, we talk as we work, not instead of doing work. It isn't always about typing, but often it is. People who finish their assignments early often move around and help a friend. <p>	People don't fool around much in here. Today only a few students daydreamed or worked on another class assignment. Even that boy up front near the end of the hour--the one playing the computer game--had finished his work. We can get up and move around if we want, without asking permission. Right before the bell there's more noise, but it's not as rowdy as some classes with five minutes left. And the litter on the floor in here, it's paper from work we'd done. It wasn't thrown there--it slid off the tables.<p>	It's hard to hide in this class. Ms. Stevens knows if we're not working, and we know she knows. But it's not like we want to hide. One girl finished early this period, and the teacher suggested she be the class file clerk, putting student papers in folders in a cabinet at the side of the room. She wasn't excited about that. Ms. Stevens offered her another choice: working ahead in the book, solving a problem the rest of us will get to next week.<p>	The only suggestion I'd give her is to ask us sometimes why we made the mistakes we did. Usually she gives answers or points out how to do it correctly. If she would take an extra second or two and see where we'd gone wrong, maybe she'd understand better how we think about the assignment. Lots of kids come up with their own logic and ways to do it, and they get locked in. You have to unlearn that old way before you can learn the new way, otherwise you forget and go back to how you used to do it, even if you keep making mistakes.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tga"><h3>Teacher-Guided Assistance (TGA) </h3><p>Seven black students are here for a meeting of MTRP, the Minority Teacher Recruitment Project. Some are assigned to another TGA, so they get passes from Mr. Stanley. Mr. Stanley teaches an African-American history course. As the black students circle their chairs (we whites are in rows, talking among ourselves and looking on with curiosity), Mr. Stanley says to a boy wearing a Malcolm X shirt, "Do you know what that <cite>X</cite> means?" "No." "It means <cite>unknown</cite>. Malcolm X couldn't trace his roots, so he used an <cite>X </cite>for his last name, just as in math we use an <cite>x </cite>for the unknown." On one wall is a display of African-American history, with pictures of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X.  He passes out some papers. One of them reads:<p><blockquote>MTRP/FEA invites you to apply for membership.<br>Purpose:<br><ul><li>To identify minority students (in particular) who have a real interest in a career in education. All students are welcome. To help students become that educator.<br></ul>Criteria:<br><ul><li>Real interest<li>GPA of 2.5 or higher<li>Participate fully in meetings<li>Two letters of recommendation from teachers</ul></blockquote>	He also hands out a blank calendar for the fall. "Membership meeting" is the lone entry for November. Mr. Stanley suggests activities for future months: making Thanksgiving and Christmas baskets for the needy, tutoring, writing a newsletter. He explains, "I'm throwing out ideas, but I want you to come up with some ideas." He asks them to think about what they want to do during Black History Month. Most of the ideas are his; TGA is short, and he wants to cover a lot of ground. Even so, the interest is genuine and no one in MTRP goofs off during the twenty-five minutes of TGA.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="haet"><h3>History and English, Third and Fourth Period </h3><p>Our two-hour American studies meets in a big, comfortable area that once was four separate classrooms. <p><h4>A Glimpse into Ms. Marler's History Class</h4><p>For history, we're in Ms. Marler's quarter of the suite. There you'd see two full-size, costumed mannequins; each wears an early twentieth-century gown. Across the ceiling there is red, white, and blue crepe paper we put up before the presidential election. Next to her desk is a small, old school desk with a stuffed bear sitting on the seat, wearing a striped hat, and she lets us hold it if we want. On the floor is a wicker basket with our papers in it. On her desk is a lamp shaped exactly like a red pencil, which she keeps on even during movies. It gives a glow to that part of the room--she wants us to feel comfortable to go over there. She doesn't mind if we look through the desk when we need a pen or pencil. She's always concerned about us, not just how much history we learn. Once I heard her tell a visitor, "Students don't care how much you know until they know how much you care."<p>	This class began with an assignment to do overnight which we'd finish in class tomorrow with the student teacher, Mr. Taggart. Ms. Marler referred to the "living amendments," the bookmark she gave us that has the first ten constitutional amendments (she likes bookmarks and small pamphlets because we can put them in our jeans and don't lose them as often as bigger books). "Please read the case study, read the ten amendments, and decide which amendments fit in. It may be one or several--look at your bookmark and decide." Mr. Taggart handed out the case study, which was four pages xeroxed from some book, as she continued speaking: "Everybody look up here please. Come on. I want you to take ten sheets of paper at the end of class today, and take twenty-six if you want honors credit. You should either draw or cut out pictures to illustrate the amendments." She reminded us to write one amendment on each page, and told us we could refer to the posters on the back wall that had sample illustrations of the first ten amendments. Mr. Taggart called the roll as Ms. Marler answered a few questions.<p>	Before class, Ms. Marler had divided the room with signs that said, "White Only" and "Colored Only." We'd followed those directions as we came in and sat divided by race. Now the students paid attention as she explained the day's work: "We'll be role-playing today. But first I'd like you to answer this sponge2: Why are the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments called the Civil War amendments?" As a model for the assignment due in two days, she passed around the work of a student last year who had illustrated the amendments. The activity for this day was to take two Supreme Court cases on equal rights, <cite>Plessy v. Ferguson </cite>and <cite>Brown v. Board of Education</cite>, and write three things about each one. She said that those two decisions had "changed history. The Supreme Court is like a brick wall, and we'll see how it tumbled down." She then turned the class over to Mr. Taggart.<p>	He asked us to open our textbooks to page 90, and he started to read about civil rights. He went slowly and read with feeling. He tossed out questions--short factual questions which were not addressed to anyone in particular. He used to be a policeman, and he tells us great stories. We can ask him anything. Yesterday we wanted to know if policemen are goofing off when they stay in their cars to eat doughnuts and drink coffee.<p>	As he read, Ms. Marler went over to LaToya and said, "Honey, did you turn in your election notebook last Friday?" She handed out folders to two boys, moved Kevin to another seat because he had shouted, while at her desk Jeff was picking up her clock, claiming it was one minute slow. She nodded and talked to a girl about her grades, then put her arm around a boy as she wrote out a note for him to go to his counselor. She does a lot of work with students as Mr. Taggart teaches. So does Ms. Barnett, who works mostly with the special education kids, although I'm not really sure who's special ed and who's not.<p>	Kimberly turned to Claude and asked, "Why do you call white people <cite>crackers</cite>?" Claude asked her, "Why do you call black people <cite>niggers</cite>?" Kimberly raised her hand and asked Mr. Taggart, "Who made up all these names? Like <cite>honkies</cite>--where did that come from?"<p>	We didn't get into that because just then Ms. Marler announced the entrance of three students who were dressed up as historical figures. Eartha, dressed as Homer Plessy, read several sentences from the back of a sheet of paper. Ms. Marler took his picture. She then explained the meaning of <cite>separate but equal</cite>, and a minute later, Jim Crow came out. He wore a hat and also read from the back of a card, and again Ms. Marler took his picture. Then Thurgood Marshall came in, read, and walked away. All that took five minutes, and there were no questions from the class (no wisecracks either).<p>	Ms. Marler directed us to page 92 in the book and asked us to write out why the Brown case was a turning point. She told us we'd have the rest of this period to finish that question or work on the illustrations due Friday. We spread out around the room so we had enough space and talked quietly with each other about the illustrations. Ms. Marler told us we'd get extra points if we used markers instead of pencils. Several students finished early, and they went across the suite to join in singing and guitar playing.<p>	While Mr. Taggart helped us, Ms. Marler spent a few minutes with a reporter from the <cite>Courier Journal </cite>who interviewed her about the support group she runs during her TGA period for teen parents.<p><h4>A Glimpse into Ms. Benin's English Class</h4><p>There are twenty-three students in Ms. Benin's class, sitting at six different round and square tables in a nook next to Ms. Marler's space. The walls of the room are bright and colorful, thanks to several large posters, plants, and artwork. Only one student sat alone; nearly everyone else sat next to someone of the same sex and race.<p>	Ms. Benin spent this hour introducing an activity she really likes: mask making. Several masks done the previous year hang on one wall. She had printed on a large sheet of paper a sentence backwards. There was a lot of interest in the sheet. "Can you hold a mirror up to it?" It wasn't clear to us if she had done it on purpose or not, and we tried to figure out what it said.<p>	Alongside the backward printing she had posted a quote from John Updike: "When you look in a mirror it is not yourself you see but a kind of apish error posed in fiercesome symmetry." Ms. Benin asked Sasha and Jennifer how the mask related to the quote. There weren't any answers I could hear, so Ms. Benin talked for a long time about how all of us hide behind masks in different ways and that we aren't always what we seem to be: "We see different things and faces, and we also see similarities. I bet we'll notice that when we look at your masks."<p>	She passed around one mask, a thick one that held up very well but didn't show as much detail as most other masks. "Why am I showing this one? So you can avoid these errors." She said that a cast is made of gauze and that we would need to be mindful of the warmth of the water and the speed of drying when we make our masks. She told us that we would be in pairs and triads, and that everyone would make a mask of someone else as well as their own. She said the mask making would connect with a week on the state's literature, taught by Ms. Marler, and that at the end of the month, a crew from PBS would be here for the day when we painted the masks.<p>	She passed around more masks. Each girl at my table touched them, put them over her face, and asked about the nose holes for breathing. Ms. Benin asked us to look at the masks and write about how they related to the quote. "I want <cite>everyone </cite>to write something down now." A few people did but many did not. She walked around, asked a few questions, then a minute later said, "Who has some comments?" Several students mumbled and Ms. Benin said, "OK, someone over here please." One girl said, "The inside is the opposite of the outside," and a boy added, "It's like looking at your own self." Four students had their heads down. Sheheedra asked how strong the mask is. Before answering, Ms. Benin said there was too much talking and she would move people if the noise continued. She talked about a mask that was soft and smooth, and pointed to a mask on the front wall that looks fragile but it is actually strong. "The outer edge is very important. You take strips, get them wet, and go around the outside of the face, start at the lips and the nose and then move to the cheeks and the ears. The mouth can be open or not, that's your choice." People really paid attention when she said that when we make the masks, we have to put Vaseline all over our face. Jason cried out, "That's gross," and Jasmine said, "I ain't doing it." Pamela was the most worried: "Are you sure Vaseline won't make you break out? I thought it got into your pores." Ms. Benin reassured her and went on to describe the ear holes.<p>	We finished with a short worksheet. There was a list of events, like weddings, deaths, and sunny weather. Next to each word we had to write an emotion, and the four choices were <cite>glad, mad, scared</cite>, and <cite>sad</cite>. We then had to pick a color to put next to each emotion. These colors were drawn as a bar graph with longer graphs indicating stronger feelings. Then the bell rang and everyone flew for the door.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fpa2"><h3>Fifth Period, Algebra 2</h3><p>There were twelve students here today. Our desks form a wide U and students sit at the outer edges. It's not easy to hear exactly what another student says on the opposite side of the room, but it's close enough to be distracting if somebody's chattering. Because many of the chairs are empty, you have three or four clusters of students in the room, which can be fine if they are working together in groups. Sometimes the way we spread out reminds me of a beach--four or five people under an umbrella, others nearby on towels, a few loners, with everyone semi-aware of each other, but whether they talk and mingle is up to them. It's nice of Ms. Hiebert to let us sit wherever we wish, and all of us have found a spot we like.<p>	Class began with a sponge, a review of negative numbers. Here are the problems:<p><blockquote>3^2 =</blockquote><blockquote>(-3)^2 =</blockquote><blockquote>1-(3^2) =</blockquote><blockquote>(-3)^2 x (3)^3 =</blockquote>	Even though this is Algebra 2, some of the people here aren't too good on negative numbers. So we started the period with that. Ms. Hiebert and two university students (who visit Lincoln as part of their undergraduate teacher-education program) walked around and checked our work. After a few minutes they used the overhead projector in the center of the room to review the answers to the four sponge problems.<p>	Then Ms. Hiebert told us to look over the homework from yesterday. She asked Juan to go to the overhead projector and draw his answer on the transparency. As he did that, Ms. Hiebert walked around and checked the homework, recording in her grade book whether or not it had been done, then went back to the overhead and told Juan the parabola he'd plotted was correct. She said, "Now we'll look at wider parabolas." This time we graphed <cite>x</cite>^2-4. She told us to get into groups of four and asked us to factor it, then graph the function, then describe how the parabola differed from <cite>y-x</cite>^2. Three groups formed, with Ms. Hiebert assigning several students to one small group. She talked to each group and gave out paper.<p>	The students in my group were working, the second group was shooting the breeze about social stuff, and the third group looked busy, but they were working individually rather than as a group. In the second group, where two girls were chewing lollipops, the university student was able to get them back on task, but basically he wound up doing the work for them. In that group several girls were still puzzled by multiplication of negative numbers, and one sighed, "I'll be glad when this semester is over so I can leave." Students in the other two groups were moving ahead pretty well. The university student spent all his time with group one--were they trying to keep him there by playing dumb? I didn't know whether they really needed help or whether they acted dense in order to get his attention.<p>	After we all finished, Ms. Hiebert passed out wax paper. She told the class how to fold the paper so the dots, which were already on the paper, hit a line on the paper. We were to crease the wax paper each time a dot hit the line at a different spot, and she asked us to do that ten times. Ms. Hiebert walked around the room as we started working, and everyone seemed genuinely interested in this. After five minutes of folding, Ms. Hiebert asked us to look at the outside crease. "Ms. Hiebert, mine is kind of straight!" Alice exclaimed. "Mine's more like a bowl." "Mine's a big U." Ms. Hiebert drew a semicircle on the overhead transparency and under it she wrote the word <cite>parabola </cite>as she shushed four students talking to Jim, who'd just wandered in late. There wasn't much discussion; instead she asked us to draw another graph, showing the function <cite>y</cite>=<cite>x</cite>^2. We did that for values going from negative two to positive two.<p>	Ten minutes later, she went to the overhead projector and plotted the points. She asked us now to find out where on the graph one half and one quarter would fall. She urged us to estimate. Again she left the projector and walked around the room, giving advice and answering questions. One boy was asleep and two girls were talking about a party where their friend had been kicked out. Back at the projector, Ms. Hiebert plotted a quarter and a half to show how they fit on the curved, rounded edge of the parabola. I think she was trying to correct a misperception that the parabola was a V with straight edges.<p>	Moving quickly, she next gave a homework assignment--two functions to graph: <p>		<blockquote><cite>-y-x</cite>^2-4 <p>		and <cite>y-x</cite>^2+4. </blockquote>	She asked us in the homework to explain why we got the curve and she told us to hold on to the wax paper, which three people had crunched up.<p>	I went up to the table in the front center of the room to look through a stack of papers and notebooks; mine will be graded by tomorrow. With two minutes left, eight students were standing near the door talking, and a few boys drifted in and out of the hall. <p>	I asked three friends in this class how they liked it. They said Ms. Hiebert is fair, patient, and helpful. She wants us to learn; we know she cares about us. June told me Ms. Hiebert takes time to explain something if she's lost. "She goes through everything," Stephanie added. I asked June how Ms. Hiebert could improve and all she said was "I really don't know. I like it the way it is. It's not real wild or loud."<p>	The only thing that worries me is that my three friends don't know why we're studying parabolas. Why bother factoring equations and plotting graphs? Whoever uses parabolas in a job? June said we "might need it sometime in life," but she didn't know when. Stephanie thought somebody might "get a job that deals with that" but she didn't know which job.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sptz"><h3>Sixth Period, the Zephyr Team </h3><p>I was a student on the Zephyr team as a freshman, and today I'm with those teachers to write an article for the newspaper about teams. There's a sub for my sixth-period art class so I won't miss much, I hope. Most of the teachers in Zephyr are different from the ones two years ago; as Ms. Campbell said, "We've had a lot of divorces here." They still run field trips and special projects, and as Ms. FitzPatrick told me, "We offer the chance to explore yourself before we shove the great works or algebra down your throat." Many of my friends say they wish they'd had more algebra and other serious work. From what I saw today the team seems like they're trying to emphasize more of that.<p>	Their hour together began with a visit with a parent. Her son saw a doctor recently--he's had headaches--the tests showed no physical problems so the doctor recommended anti-depressants. She's reluctant to see him on those drugs. She's also concerned that he has so few friends. The mother asked the team to keep an eye on him, and the team reassured her that they would, adding that they thought he was pleasant, well behaved, in class.<p>	Then they started talking about a trip to a museum they'll take in two weeks. Because only thirty kids can go at one time, they need to figure out who will stay here, and what they'll do with the seventy-five who aren't out. Should they fill in for each other or get subs? Two teachers wanted to cover for each other by doing two-hour blocks with two large groups, then switching. Ms. Cubberley worried that would interrupt the flow of a new unit. "I'll just be starting genetics. It's rough for me to have kids going in and out; catching up will be hard. This isn't a great time for me to go on an activity binge." She wasn't sure what Ms. Campbell had in mind when she talked about splitting the seventy-five kids, with half in one room for a two-hour math/science and the other half doing a two-hour health/English. Would it be the regular curriculum she'd planned or not? What about equipment? Ms. FitzPatrick volunteered that "I always have a lesson I can pick up and flip in." Ms. Cubberley finally was satisfied that the team wasn't asking her to stop or drop her unit on genetics. They ended up teasing each other. Ms. Cubberley said, "I like how we plan so far in advance!" Ms. Campbell punched her arm and said, "You've got to learn how to wing it, Cub."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="se2"><table border><tr><td><h3>SUGGESTED EXERCISE #2</h3>What were the surprises you felt as you spent the day with Brenda?

We heard everything from "tell us what to do next" to exactly the opposite. The following observations on classroom life include some possible approaches the school might take, but we hope the reflections here stimulate the readers to imagine other options as well.<p>	All of the following issues arose in the course of Brenda's day, either in her experiences or in her teachers' actions and thoughts. We devote the most space to those points which also emerged from our observations in many other classrooms. The goal is to move from the particulars of one student's day to the larger patterns that characterize Lincoln High.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="laag"><h3>Looking Again atGroup Work</h3><p>Group work is the most common instructional strategy in Lincoln classrooms that spurn the old "lecture, lecture, lecture" routine. Each of the teachers profiled in the first section relied on group work.<p>	Although Ms. Stevens spent the least time organizing group projects, the layout of her room encouraged working in groups. Because the assignments were done individually, working in groups was not identical to group work, but there certainly was informal sharing and questioning back and forth, and work did occur. In other classes, the groups were free to move around and settle wherever they wished (overcrowded rooms are rare at Lincoln). Teachers varied in how thoroughly they had trained students in the rules and roles for effective group work, and they differed in whether they kept the same groups throughout the fall or whether they let students pick their own groups. Penalties for not working well together also varied, with most teachers generously offering second and third chances to earn enough points to pass. In light of the prevalence of cooperative learning, it may be useful to revisit this technique from time to time. People who are good at it can become better; novices can gain insights they might not pick up on their own.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="foc"><h3>Focusing on Cognition</h3><p>Group work is often part of an activity which the teacher, or teachers, created. Most Lincoln teachers think of innovative curriculum in terms of units, projects, special theme weeks, guest speakers, field trips, or other discrete packages which they make. Usually these initiatives seek greater student interest, and participation is often considered a reliable sign of success. Did their students listen, attend, join in, and enjoy? Good behavior and reasonable effort reassures teachers that the venture went well.<p>	That is the way teachers plan and evaluate instruction in most schools. The emphasis is on procedures and the level of student satisfaction with the new experience. There is less attention to the difficult question of what is going on inside students' heads. How are they making sense? What are their strategies for learning? That perspective, which asks of all students what a good special education teacher seeks in developing an IEP, is diagnostic. When we asked teachers what they would see if they could peek inside their students' heads, they tended to talk about emotional upheavals or factual knowledge rather than learning strategies or deeper understandings of the logic of their particular field.<p>	Minds learn in complicated ways. Information does not go directly into heads in the same form that it is presented. In the behavioristic era, the emphasis was on the lesson. Teachers were told to plan and present lessons; that was, and still is, a major focus of teacher training. Nowadays, however, it has become clear that designing lesson plans is not the main task. Understanding how students learn the lesson is. Teachers everywhere need to understand the complex ways students actively incorporate information. Teachers must try to grasp the goals students set (not merely the lesson goals the teacher wants them to set); the cues that students actually attend to (not merely those the teachers emphasize); the knowledge that students choose to invoke (not merely the facts that the teacher hopes they'll recall); the actions and speech the students actually express (not merely the behavior the teacher sets as an objective); and the self-monitoring routines students actually use (not merely the ones teachers prescribe).<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="gsts"><h3>Getting Students to Stand and Deliver</h3><p>Teachers who design student projects often see oral presentations as the hallmark of using one's mind well. When students had to perform in Mr. Warner's chemistry class, their preparation took the entire week. Ms. Marler's skits were much shorter, but they are a regular feature of her classes. Ms. Benin's students learned they would later perform for the PBS cameras.<p>	Other teachers are also explicit about the importance of good public speaking. "You would think you were in Speech 101 at the start of the year," Ted Stewart said of his history classes. Eye contact, voice inflection, answering questions: Ted stresses those skills. He knows that most of his students are unaccustomed to standing and speaking. They are shy, awkward, nervous and lack confidence. Pat Clark collects stacks of newspapers and periodically asks her English class to pick a news article, then rise and summarize the piece. "When I get tenth-graders in the fall, half of them will not stand on their feet and say <cite>anything </cite>to the class. It's incredibly important that the kids need to know they can speak if they have to--they won't die, the earth won't swallow them up." Nearly everyone who presents earns an A for the day, and the audience gets extra-credit points if they are polite.<p>	Pat Clark thinks about educational reform, including Coalition Principles, more than most people in American high schools, and she recognizes the risk of generously encouraging students: "Kids can exhibit without really having mastered much of anything." However, the sheer effort the students make seems praiseworthy to her and deserves reinforcement: "If you finally see a kid who hasn't wanted to stand up, get up and exhibit something, you are going to give him a great grade just because he put on a show, drawing from his inner resources."<p>	Speech could be a worthwhile curricular focus for the ninth-grade teams. Gaining the confidence to talk in front of others is not a trivial accomplishment for many freshmen, and it may be the prelude to other forms of serious work, including good writing and reading. The challenge may be to keep pushing until the expectations come close to those of high school debaters, who go beyond brief statements of personal opinion or factual recall to analyze, cross-examine, draw from their own research, and in other ways marry confidence with the habits of persuasive argument.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tonf"><h3>The Ongoing Need for Time to Plan </h3><p>The expansion of teaming holds out the promise of more and more thematic units, interdisciplinary work, and other creative curricular designs that honor the Coalition's notion that less is more. Some of that hard work has already begun, with the older Zephyr and American studies teams examining essential questions in their curricula. The newer teams made a few promising starts last fall, but usually their earliest accomplishments were better communications about individual students, in which they shared important facts and insights about particular kids everyone knew.<p>	Most Lincoln teachers think that the key to curricular change is <cite>time</cite>. Many discuss the topic of time in terms of a second planning period, when the team could focus on instruction. Without that extra hour, teaming is doomed to be teaming in name only, they predict. There have been lively discussions of future schedules. Do student course needs and the school's staffing levels rule out a second planning period for all? What trade-offs would be necessary to get there? It would also be worth asking how individuals and teams that have enjoyed a second planning period made use of the bonus; what did they achieve?<p>	If a second hour cannot be secured, how might teams nevertheless use time to develop curriculum? A three-year, $200,000 grant offers many chances for release time and days off, and some teams have begun to make good use of that opportunity. Others have found a few minutes over breakfast or lunch, and a few went to a teammate's home for a working dinner. Occasionally devoting individual planning time to team issues is another option sometimes used.<p>	Perhaps the major source of time is the common four-hour block, when the teams could creatively reschedule the students they share. If it is time for the English teacher to grade portfolios, give her two days without classes. Have two hours for work on political cartoons, then use two hours the next day for literature. Let the Zephyr kids devote all four hours to building their hot air balloons for their Derby unit. There are many possibilities, and some teams have begun to explore ways to break free of the fifty-five-minute lockstep.<p>	There is less discussion of the role of departments and disciplinary expertise within the teaming structure than there is of schedule. Teaming encourages the Coalition's "teacher-as-generalist" Principle, a notion easily misunderstood to mean that everyone has to teach absolutely everything. Some innovators at Lincoln feel that departments are obsolete. Others believe that as the school stretches to meet the State School Improvement Act (SSIA) expectations, there will be subject-specific challenges on which teammates will be less helpful than department colleagues.3 How departments and teams will connect is not clear so far.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wdsw"><h3>What Do Students Want?</h3><p>Not all students welcome adventuresome instruction that takes them a step or two beyond where they might otherwise go. Some of them are not bashful about telling teachers to back off. When Mr. Krug began the term with some ambitious projects, his class said, "Are you sure you're teaching chemistry for high school students?" When Ms. Cubberley expected problem solving from her Zephyr team students, they said, "We don't want to do anything where we have to think." Openly and subtly, students try to strike bargains to minimize the demands they are asked to meet.<p>	Yet many students resent classes that seem too easy. Listening to the students, it is clear that they respect teachers who do not waste time, who expect learning to occur, who are organized rather than chaotic. They dislike anything that suggests they are being treated like middle-school kids. It is also evident that they want learning to be fun, notwithstanding a prejudice that it can't be real learning if it's very fun. They appreciate teachers who care about them, who give consideration to and understanding of their non-academic as well as academic needs, without pampering or babying them. Lincoln students want their classes to be relevant, to have a purpose that promises to be useful later in life. They often have mixed feelings about traditional teaching methods. Although they appreciate variety, projects, group work, and movement in class, they also see homework, textbooks, rote memorization, and drill as the marks of demanding instruction.<p>	One result of those widespread notions of appropriate teaching is that many students can be satisfied at a level that may not equip them for the analytical reasoning expected in the SSIA exams. Teachers have to fight many students' regrettably low self-assessments, as well as the students' conventional ideas of what entails good teaching and what constitutes legitimate demands on them.<p>	In many high schools where students lack a strong academic work ethic, the "dumbing down" negotiations between students and teachers often take place in classrooms filled with the least able, who get a steady diet of films, worksheets, silent reading, and other exercises designed to keep the peace without totally abandoning the illusion of serious work. That is rarely the case at Lincoln. The special education students often take demanding math and science courses, and if some teachers are baffled on how to teach a vast range of abilities, others are pleasantly surprised by how many special-needs students put forth effort and behave well. After a rocky first year of total mainstreaming, the ECE services seem to be much improved this year.<p>	What about the kids in the middle, the students who are not varsity athletes, handicapped, gifted, or in other ways exceptional? In most large American high schools, they lack strong allies such as coaches or savvy parents. They are not rowdy. They pass their courses. These students are the spectators in the stands, not the players. They are free to pick and choose from a curricular smorgasbord, but receive little individual advice on what to take.<p>	At Lincoln, it may be that the "unspecial" students are better served than they would be elsewhere. They benefit from the individual attention which teaming encourages. They are helped by the extraordinary efforts of the Youth Services Center staff, who offer crisis intervention and social services. And some students may feel special by virtue of the new public safety program, which seems to be privileged in regard to class sizes, budgets, priority in creating the master schedule, and so on.<p>	In the opinion of many Lincoln teachers, the most able students are not stretched as far as they could be. Although this upper end is modest in size (approximately 30 percent of the graduating seniors go to either a two- or four-year college), it is not absent. These students were among the critics of teaming last spring; they foresaw fun and games which would not prepare them for college. Extra credit and honors work is often defined as doing more of the same assignments everyone else has, and advanced placement course work is unavailable. What complicates the situation is that students of the caliber and drive of Brenda rarely protest or transfer. They are fairly satisfied as long as their classes are reasonably stimulating. <p>	If the students are the "customers," as many Lincoln teachers like to say, where is the consumer movement for different goods and services? Some Lincoln students yearn for more, others would be content with less, and a few are not sure what they want or need. Monitoring change or gauging quality solely by the level of student satisfaction will therefore yield imperfect measurements. Ignoring customer wishes, on the other hand, has never worked well, either in industry or in schools. This dilemma is a major challenge for schools which try to raise expectations while competing for students in an open-enrollment marketplace.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="il"><h3>Instructional Leadership</h3><p>There is a wide array of views as to how the front office should coach individuals and teams. Some teachers think the administrators are already too directive, sure of where the school is headed and determined to get there. Others consider the administration not directive enough, especially in regard to the day-to-day operational details, particularly scheduling and discipline. The administration sees itself as quietly refocusing, redirecting conversations, occasionally nudging, advising, listening, encouraging, and cheering the risk-takers.<p>	In some ways, the administrators' style resembles the style of those working in higher education: Give the faculty considerable freedom and autonomy; alert the entrepreneurial teachers to grants and other external resources. Be patient, don't insist on early evaluations, don't punish early shortcomings and false starts. Make decisions democratically, and trust committees to plan and implement change. Many Lincoln faculty welcome this approach, and they seem to have the energy, imagination, intelligence, and collegiality to make good use of invitations and opportunities to innovate.<p>	A test of this leadership style may be the way novices and other newcomers to Lincoln come to understand and support the changes now under way. The school has a rare opportunity this year. One third of the faculty is new. Many of the staunchest skeptics and saboteurs left last year. Do the newcomers know what the overarching mission of the school is? Do they understand to what ends teams are the means? Do they see how the various initiatives started at Lincoln in the last seven years fit together? Do they grasp what SSIA seeks?  Making sure the new recruits are first-rate will go a long way toward creating the instructional improvements the school wants.<p><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="se4"><table border><tr><td><h3>SUGGESTED EXERCISE #4</h3><ol><li> Jot down the thoughts which you had as you read the second section.<p><li> Find someone else who has read this snapshot and exchange your papers, especially your writing in Exercises #1-4.

We were also familiar with the many ambitious and far-reaching changes that the staff had been putting into practice since Lincoln joined the Coalition of Essential Schools in 1988 and committed itself to work towards whole-school change, according to the Coalition's nine Common Principles. (See Appendix B for a listing of the Principles.) Some of the major changes that Lincoln has undertaken in the last few years have included mainstreaming the special education students; implementing portfolios, other authentic assessments, and site-based decision making; and restructuring the schedule to group more than half the students into teams of about one hundred students and four or five teachers.<p>	Home to about eleven hundred students, Lincoln High School is a middle-size high school located in a suburb in the south-central region of the country. About 75 percent of the students are white, 25 percent are black, and about 40 percent come from low-income families.<p>	Lincoln, like all the schools throughout the state, has been greatly affected by the State School Improvement Act (SSIA). Enacted in 1990, the SSIA constituted a fundamental restructuring of the state's educational system, from the state department of education down. <p>	This spring, the blizzard of state, district, local, and personal challenges meant a daunting year for Lincoln High. No wonder the faculty decided that the coming fall was not the time to introduce fresh changes or revamp the schedule. Should they take time to consider whether or not the school should reorganize into houses in the fall of 1994? Or focus on rigorous instruction, rigorous expectations in the curriculum, and Exhibitions in the coming year? What worthwhile goals! Planning for houses may seem to be the more radical and daring quest, but figuring out how to take everyone's instruction up a notch may be the more significant breakthrough.<p>	As we do each time we visit a school as part of the School Change Study, we produced a "snapshot" based on our observations in classrooms  and our conversations with people in the Lincoln High School community. For this fourth visit, we decided to focus our snapshot on the issues that Lincoln High School considered of high priority at the time of our visit. First, however, because of the vast impact of the SSIA on schools throughout the state, we will begin by discussing the SSIA's ramifications for Lincoln High School. We will follow in Part 2 with a discussion of other issues that the school currently considers to be of significant concern. Part 3 of this paper contains brief excerpts from our notes relating to five central issues facing Lincoln High at this time, followed by questions the researchers would like the reader to consider regarding these issues. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="part1"><hr><center><h2>Part 1<br>The Impact of the SSIA </h2></center><hr>The SSIA stirs strong feelings. It pleases reformers eager to show how thoughtful performance assessments can improve instruction; it bothers penny-pinchers, worries fundamentalists, and it threatens small-town, patronage politics. At Lincoln High and elsewhere, teachers cannot ignore the new order, whatever their private feelings about the law. The entire school will be affected if student scores on various tests fall below an acceptable "threshold" set by the SSIA, and individual teachers are already affected by particular SSIA requirements, especially by needing to keep portfolios of student work in English and math.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sis"><h3>SSIA's Impact Statewide</h3><p>The impact of SSIA on the 520 professionals in the state department of education was immediate and far-reaching. Only 20 percent of the top management staff in the department were retained. Although most of the rank and file kept a job, more were demoted than promoted, and everyone was put on one-year probation. The new organization included a few cross-role teams, but on balance the previous hierarchical and centralized structure persisted. <p>	The new commissioner has been keeping a close watch on every division's work and sets short timelines for large projects. The pace is hectic and tiring. Although in spirit the SSIA values innovation and risk-taking, many department staff shy away from daring departures or creative leaps. It is understood that anyone who makes mistakes could be dismissed. Turnover in the top jobs continues, and communication across divisions is ad hoc and sporadic.<p>	The greatest dilemma involved moving from a monitoring to a service orientation and at the same time regulating the districts. There now is a stronger emphasis on helping districts, either directly or by building local capacity for their own staff development. For example, a former math teacher at Lincoln, now on the SSIA staff, has worked with over seven hundred teachers in the past year, created a video on math portfolios, and helped to write a hefty, five-hundred-page explanation of the benchmarks for scoring portfolios. She was delighted by math teachers' receptivity and bragged that attendance at this year's State Council of Teachers of Mathematics soared 300 percent over last year. Although she misses her students at Lincoln and could do without a daily one-hundred-mile commute, she finds the work stimulating and rewarding. <p>	The SSIA emphasizes results, but many regulations constrain how schools can operate. The state department of education has issued many "program advisories" to clarify and offer interpretations of the SSIA, which the recipients often see as binding, not advisory. One observer called the spate of guidelines "the Bubba effect":<p><blockquote>We've got Extended School Services [ESS]--it's a great idea, great program [to make up credits]--but there was a guy in one of the districts who needed money for football uniforms. So he took the ESS money and bought the uniforms. Now we have all sorts of regulations on what you can use this money for. All sorts of rules, written to control the Bubbas of the world.</blockquote>He feels that the regulations are neither foolish nor wise, but their goodness is not the point: <p><blockquote>[Regulation] kills the spirit of SSIA. If I had to do it over again, I'd go through the law and anywhere it said, "State board will be responsible for . . . ," I would put some kind of caveat that says, "to the extent that it doesn't limit local autonomy to make decisions." </blockquote>	Another person said the SSIA speaks warmly of outcomes, then lets the state department stage-whisper, "Psst, we'll tell you how to get there." The press for monitoring is reinforced by the legislature. The lawmakers want to know what the unprecedented $1.3 billion tax increase of 1990 is buying, and a new, legislative Office of Education Accountability demands detailed information on implementation. A popular quip is that soon <cite>SSIA </cite>may mean "State Superexpensive Improvement Act."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tsio"><h3>The SSIA's Impact on Lincoln</h3><p>Transitional tests, non-cognitive indices, matrix-sampling, performance levels--the technical procedures are formidable, but the results are clear-cut threshold numbers for each school in the state to shoot for in the mid-1990s. If the threshold is exceeded by 1 percent or more, there will be rewards in the form of extra money for the school, but if the site falls more than 5 percent below the threshold, it could be designated a school "in crisis," which would trigger the equivalent of a takeover by the state, with all staff placed on probation and improvement overseen by a "distinguished educator." Lincoln teachers realized this possibility. This spring, many Lincoln students who took the tests focused on the multiple-choice section and slighted the written answers to open-ended questions, which the state eventually weighted more heavily than the multiple-choice items.<p>	So far, the impact of the SSIA on Lincoln High has been gradual and gentle. Site-based decision making existed at Lincoln before the SSIA mandated it. The Youth Services Center extended and broadened social services already recognized as a vital need. ESS, the second-chance afternoon and summer catch-up option, was introduced without controversy. Interest in alternative assessments predated the SSIA because Lincoln staff took various district workshops on testing. Teachers acknowledged that the county has set the pace for the rest of the state; the SSIA codified much of the good work already under way here.<p><h4>Implementing SSIA-mandated Assessments</h4><p>In the past school year, the portfolio requirement seemed to be the most direct and visible effect of the SSIA. The experiences of two teachers who were "cluster leaders" (trainers of fellow teachers) suggest a reasonably good beginning for portfolios.<p><b>	Paula Baker's Experience.</b> Paula, a math teacher, likes the SSIA assessments' emphasis on problem solving and understanding: "It's not: here's an equation, plug in a formula." She explained why she was pleased with her recent adoption of a computer-assisted program from the University of Pennsylvania for her Algebra 1 juniors and seniors that dovetailed with the SSIA goals: "All the problems in the three binders we get require applications; that's why I like it. You don't come in and solve 2<cite>x </cite>+ 3 = 5." <p>	She feels some uncertainty about what lies ahead. As a cluster leader, she attended training this summer in grading portfolios, and later she will coach Lincoln teachers, who will eventually grade Lincoln students' portfolios, with spot checking by outsiders. She heard rumors that next year students have to complete a math portfolio in order to graduate, but she is not sure that will be so. She wonders what to do with transfer students, and she also wonders who is responsible for coaxing students to finish their portfolios.<p>	This year she relied on a mimeographed sheet with a series of questions for students to ask themselves about the quantity and quality of their portfolios. Whenever her student teacher took over, she met individually with students to review those questions. The toughest challenges she sees now are convincing students that the portfolios are not just an add-on, an extra chore, and fighting the traditional view that getting the right answer is all that matters in math. For the portfolio items where students have to explain how they arrived at their solution, she said, "Some of the work is great, but some kids just don't care."<p>	<b>Jane Owen's Experience.</b> Jane has been as involved as anyone with the English portfolios, and she values the focus they provide. "My students can look at their own writing and judge it. They know what's novice work, and it's not just the little bitty stuff like spelling or punctuation." She is delighted that students on their own speak of "voice" in their own writing (which is a trait of the top two performance levels, "distinguished" and "proficient"). Although most Lincoln (and other of the state's schools') portfolios fall in the lower categories, "novice" and "apprentice," Jane points out the wide range of work within particular categories, as well as the fine line between the levels, especially "(high) apprentice" and "(low) proficient." <p>	She thinks several aspects of the portfolios need work. Encouraging and training all teachers to understand and value portfolio assessment would be helpful. The quantity and quality of writing done in other classes concerns her (two of the six portfolio papers cannot be from English class). So does the prospect that incoming seniors, who have dutifully saved enough written work, will be able to walk in and say they are done in September, or that some seniors may not finish work by the March 1 deadline. On balance, Jane feels the portfolios and the accompanying rubrics support her notions of good writing. The process of gathering and grading the portfolios consumes many hours, but she says, "I still love it. I'm glad we do it. The record keeping is a headache. But portfolios are wonderful."<p>	Jane, Paula, and other teachers face two tremendous challenges: deepening their own understanding of portfolios and encouraging their students to value this new requirement. After-school and summer workshops abound. In 1993-94, at the high school level alone, there will be twelve different district sessions devoted to just the assessment and scoring aspects of portfolios. The training is not simple or quick. As Dr. Terman, the director of research, explained, undoing misconceptions of the four levels is necessary before any practice scoring can start. Some teachers equate each level with a letter grade. Dr. Terman tells them, "<cite>Novice </cite>means you are just starting. This is a big change from A, B, C, D, which has winners and losers. We have to dump that philosophy." Most teachers are hungry for more advice and assistance, when it would be easy to play wait-and-see, in a state that has changed its testing program four times in the past decade.<p>	<b>Accountability. </b>Knowing what portfolios are about--either the fine points of scoring them or the big curricular implications--is only part of the story. Another aspect is accountability. There is much concern that the teachers and the school could suffer more than the students if the performances do not rise to meet or exceed the school's threshold; the school might be declared "in crisis" and the teachers put on probation. But will anyone tolerate more student failure or higher dropout rates? The recent task force on restructuring high schools, which Lincoln's principal chaired, recommended performance-based units of credit in place of Carnegie units, which would increase student accountability, assuming the performance standards went beyond the old "minimum competencies" adopted and trivialized by many states in the late 1970s.<p>	Another type of accountability encouraged by the new assessments of student work parallels what happens in university doctoral programs (or should routinely happen). As students submit draft after draft of their dissertation, the major professor's comments, suggestions, and even rewriting of sentences begin to blur the line between the work of student and advisor. A final draft exhibits the talents of the professor without obscuring the original thinking and hard work of the student. Because an advisor would not accept incomplete arguments, questionable evidence, sloppy writing, or other shortcomings that would mar first-rate work, the final product is significantly better than it would have been. In the defense, the major professor feels free to step in on the student's behalf if the candidate falters, and afterwards a co-authored article might appear. Throughout, the collaboration is close and continuous, even as the student carries the burden of responsibility for designing and doing the research.<p>	To what extent will that sort of intimate connection mark high school teacher-student relationships in regard to portfolio entries? If they are treated with anything like the coaching a graduate advisor gives, then the portfolio entries will need painstaking reading and rereading by teachers. Yet a graduate advisor shepherds only a handful of novices, not 120, and teaches six hours each week (nine is considered excessive), not twenty or twenty-five hours. Already the time demands on Lincoln's teachers are substantial: collecting, sorting, filing, double-checking-the paperwork alone is burdensome.<p>	Even if Lincoln teachers have the talent and stamina to provide detailed comments on student papers, some students would resist. In one English class, a teacher reported, "The students said it wasn't fair [to have to finish a portfolio to graduate]. If you come to school and do your work, that's all that should be asked of you. They were really grumpy." One of Jane's students resubmitted a paper for his portfolio without erasing Jane's comments in the margins. At what point does the teacher's responsibility for that indifference end?<p><h4>Raising the Issues of Equity and Challenging Work</h4><p>It is not impossible to link the SSIA with the teams, master schedule, and special programs recently introduced at Lincoln High. Making those connections might be a fruitful exercise because the reactions to structural change often latch onto prickly issues of equity and collegiality. When this happens, the talk about teaching and learning lapses. The irony is that apparently very novel SSIA initiatives (authentic assessment, for example) raise very old issues. Figuring out what is equitable has been at the heart of a century of organized effort to improve teachers' lives. Who wants "low numbers and good students" unjustly bestowed? The old answer--an ironclad contract provision hammered out by union negotiations--no longer seems ideal, but the old questions about fairness persist. <p>	The larger issue is that Lincoln's students' notions of "challenging work" are not always the same as that mandated by the SSIA. The students define <cite>challenge </cite>in terms of quantity ("They give me a lot of work") and time--including homework, which signifies, "You are so far behind you now have to take work home." Sometimes challenge is associated with novel and strange actions: calling an 800 number to order free seedlings for a science project was challenging because some students became nervous (so nervous that several asked their mothers to make the call). Meeting deadlines is a challenge to many students, also. So is working together in groups, or standing to speak in front of classmates. It is rare to hear students speak of higher-order skills, levels of analysis, use of evidence, and the other forms of reasoning which the "distinguished" ranking seeks. "My challenge?" Charles asked. "I want to make it out of here at seventeen."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="part2"><hr><center><h2>Part 2<br>Daily Concerns and Priorities at Lincoln High</h2></center><hr>Just because the SSIA has had a momentous impact on Lincoln does not mean it suffuses every aspect of a school. Although the statewide conversation about SSIA surfaced in some remarks of individual teachers when they spoke of the day-to-day concerns in their working lives, other important topics also arose with more frequency and immediacy. This year, local changes influenced day-to-day life more than SSIA did. The expansion of teams, shifts in the master schedule, and a new public safety magnet program had significant consequences for nearly all the teachers and, to a lesser extent, for most students. Where to deploy teachers and students, and then what to do within the new configurations, were difficult and persistent issues. These issues were worked through in many ways across the school.<p>	What is crucial at top levels of policy making may not reflect the daily concerns and priorities of teachers. As Ted Sizer, founder of the Coalition, says, the "national conversation" about schooling is only one level at which ideas take shape and circulate. There is also regional, state, and local discourse which reaffirms, modifies, ignores, or rejects the national policy talk. What goes on in one domain is not necessarily what develops in other arenas.<p>	For instance, advocates of free public high schools in the 1840s and 1850s intoned the civic, religious, and economic benefits of secondary education, but local voters often based their decisions on whether or not the nearby common (elementary) school serving their children needed the repairs, books, and teachers which a new high school would siphon away, to educate only a fraction of the town's youth. In the same years, national political rhetoric drummed on about slavery and its expansion, yet in election after election, voters were swayed by ethnic and religious issues, especially nativism, temperance, and anti-Catholicism.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tas"><h3>Teaming and Scheduling</h3><p>This year, nearly everyone's life was influenced by the spread of teaming. The expansion last fall put all ninth- and tenth-graders on six teams, created a new cross-age eleventh/twelfth-grade team, and continued the interdisciplinary American studies pairings. Although the public safety magnet is not called a team, all the teachers involved in it shared the task of creating a viable new program. In addition, teachers at the school who were not on teams were affected by the teams' need for elective courses in the two periods that their students were "off team."<p><h4>Initial Confusion in Scheduling</h4><p>In the experience of some teachers, teaming and scheduling are practically synonymous. Some disappointed teachers had imagined the schedule would include a second planning period, and its absence infuriated them. Others knew that on early drafts of the master schedule, what originally seemed to be second planning periods were actually designed as slots for each team to create whatever classes their students needed or wanted. The opportunities to do that were constrained by an unexpected influx of students who showed up in early September.<p>	Although Lincoln attracted fewer freshmen than it anticipated--open enrollment throughout the summer let students move on and off the rolls--there were more juniors and seniors than expected, including quite a few former dropouts. Extra sections had to be scheduled during the team slot, and it was impossible to restrict those classes to students from the same team. The fall flux was compounded by problems with new scheduling software (MacSchool) and well-intentioned volunteers who input data without knowing all the intricacies of a master schedule for a school of this size.<p>	The faculty made it through an upside-down September. English teacher Patty Palmer found forty students in her fourth period, with the overflow sitting on bookcases, footstools, and window ledges. History teacher Ted Stewart had twenty-seven freshmen and sophomores mistakenly assigned to him first and second period. In one course, a week after school began, the teacher heard several boys admit they had already taken the class. Roberta Coles lost four of her Algebra 1 students for a month, as they spent the period in the lunchroom. Counselor Betty Greenfield remembered schedules that read "no teacher" for several periods. "We knew they were on the eleventh/twelfth-grade team, and were in one of four rooms, but parents looked at that and went bananas."<p><h4>Issues of Workload and Tracking</h4><p>Reassignments corrected the major imbalances in classroom assignments. But if no classrooms still burst at the seams, the issue of overall student load continued to prompt discussion. It was no secret that some teachers had considerably fewer students than others. At a well-attended curriculum committee meeting in February, Andrea Marler said that twelve teachers (excluding special educators) had fewer than eighty-nine students. In her opinion, the schedule should eventually change so all teachers enjoyed the ratio envisioned by the Coalition of no more than eighty students for every teacher.<p>	For many teachers, the bigger issue was not how many but which students were assigned to them. Several teachers who had previously taught applied math and science courses with "low numbers and good kids"--classes of twenty where everyone had already passed algebra--now had larger numbers and a wide range of students, including 10 percent who failed all their ninth-grade classes. The discussion among several young teachers about a possible schedule change to pair physics and pre-calculus students as well as Algebra 2 and chemistry students sparked pointed comments about some teachers' hogging the best students. No one team seemed blessed with disproportionately more above-average students--which could happen if all the freshmen taking geometry (the top math kids) end up on one ninth-grade team. <p>	The possibility of tracking arose within the teams, not among them. Because the teams had all their students (or nearly all, in some cases) for four hours, it was possible to reschedule within that block of time. Resorting according to students' mathematical ability was the starting point for several teams. The goal was not to create advanced or remedial sections of the same subject, but instead to distinguish algebra, pre-algebra, geometry, and Algebra 2 students, so separate classes could be filled appropriately. A few other teams depended on their ECE (special education) teacher for assistance with their poorest students, or for periodically teaching classes so the teammates could meet. Not every team retracked, and the most blatant segregation of ECE students was quickly vetoed by the administration. Furthermore, one team used their open period to create what might seem a form of tracked instruction--an "A.C.T lab" tailor-made for the college bound. So many others wound up there, however (closed out of electives or unsure what else to take), that the average pre-test score was only nine, and the teacher eventually decided to divide the class into small groups that would follow two-week rotations through basic skills units.<p>	All in all, the variety of approaches to diversity which the Lincoln teams took mirrors the national divisions of opinion on heterogeneous or homogeneous grouping. It is extremely hard to reach universal agreement on grouping students, even within a school that says it rejects formal tracking.<p><h4>How Do Teachers Form Teams?</h4><p>Scheduling the teams also raised the significant question of who would work with whom. Last spring, many teachers signed up for a schedule, not for particular teammates. They saw slots with particular courses already written in. Picking what and when they would teach swayed more decisions than the knowledge of who else would be on the same team. Although some people had ideas about who their teammates might be, it was rare that anyone had the information which the oldest team, Zephyr, had, where it was clear who wanted to be there. And with Zephyr's history and reputation well known, the type of team it would be, not just who would be on it, presented no real mystery, in contrast to many brand new teams without an identity.<p>	By last winter, potential teammates for the fall began to seek each other and to discuss what courses they would prefer to teach and who else might round out their team. In late January, one teacher exclaimed, "The rush is on! Suddenly every way you turn, someone's soliciting somebody to join or form a team." A young teacher agreed the negotiations began early, but he regretted that he had made his specific intentions--that he would accept what in fact was his second choice-known so soon: "It's sort of like poker, and I showed my cards too early." <p>	It is noteworthy that few of the teachers who considered shifting teams rejected or despised the notion of teaming. They were willing to give it a try and saw potential which had not been fully realized in their first effort at teaming. Occasionally, a teacher who felt misplaced formed a partnership with one other teacher on the team, as in coordinating work on a science research project with work on an English portfolio entry. Sometimes a docile teammate was not hostile to teaming and was not a saboteur, but the reluctance to volunteer annoyed the adventuresome. As one younger teacher reported,<p><blockquote>Dave Jackson never says, "No we can't do that." He'll go along with whatever you put forward. He doesn't contribute much. He won't say, "We shouldn't do that," but he rarely says, "Let's do this." He is really saying, "Leave me alone. I want to teach math."</blockquote>	In contrast, another teacher stifled his misgivings about a teammate's new interdisciplinary unit. Although he believed a particular topic would have been a better choice because it was more local and familiar--and in his opinion, therefore more meaningful to students--he welcomed the energy and excitement so much that he went along with a topic he privately considered obtuse.<p>	As those examples suggest, temperament, disposition, and interpersonal chemistry outweighed disagreement about curriculum, pedagogy, or assessment in determining how well a team meshed. It is true that some teams shared common views of good teaching (and in one case their stated view was an unapologetic defense of "traditional values," which they defined as homework and failure for unacceptable work). Other teams differed on educational strategy, particularly on how rigidly structured and teacher-directed classes should be; but the key to whether or not they cohered seemed to be personality factors more than educational philosophy.<p><h4>Challenges for the Public Safety Magnet </h4><p>Although not formally called a team, the teachers working in the new Public Safety Magnet have to be a team of sorts if this elective program is to draw enough students to maintain current staffing. Freshmen move through various rotations--fire science, radio communications, emergency medical-technician training, emergency driving, law enforcement, and physical training--and later pick areas of specialization. <p>	Challenges which vocational-technology educators often face confront this program. One huge issue is recruitment. Convincing potential recruits that skills acquired in this program lead to good jobs after graduation is a hurdle; local fire and police hiring usually rules out students fresh from high school. Lincoln's relations with its feeder middle schools are not perfect; one major feeder warns some students bound for college to avoid Lincoln. The district will not wait long for the numbers to rise. Unless the program draws more students soon, the extra start-up dollars and staffing the program has enjoyed so far will be pared. Buying up-to-date equipment is not cheap, even though this program looks well-funded to academic teachers who get by on comparatively small discretionary funds (about two hundred dollars per year). Just buying the necessary gear for fire science costs $740 per student. <p>	Another dilemma is creating a strong program with an identity kids value, without thereby isolating the program from the rest of the high school (a risk increased by the physical separation of much of the program in a building on the back edge of the campus, an eight- or ten-minute hike across or around the track). Furthermore, it has been disappointing to teachers that many students enrolled in the courses lack the motivation to pursue earnestly any of the public safety areas. Whatever reason prompted them to sign up for the courses was not strong enough to sustain their interest, teachers report.<p>	It has not been easy to think creatively about imaginative instruction since the above-mentioned concerns arose early in the program's short history. The goal of weaving together academic and vocational course work remains elusive. There are first steps and small starts, such as a new teacher's relating his social studies unit on heroes to the law enforcement course. Several observers felt that the academic demands within the specializations need "more meat" and "high and consistent expectations," while acknowledging that the program is young and still taking shape.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ic"><h3>Interpersonal Concerns</h3><p>When students and teachers shared what was important in their days at school, they often mentioned issues unrelated to state, district, or local change initiatives. A wide range of concerns were on the minds of Lincoln staff as they thought about their own lives. Discipline, personal safety, race relations and other personal priorities--that's what they were coping with, more than the fine print in the nine hundred pages of SSIA legislation. <p><h4>Insuring a Safe Environment</h4><p>The endless work high schools everywhere do in order to establish and maintain a stable and calm environment is a high priority for many Lincoln staff. No one claims that the school is out of control, rowdy, or unsafe; in fact, they acknowledge that the huge problems many students bring with them would be much worse without the valued help from the Youth Services staff, other administrators, and community social service staff. Even so, order is on the minds of many teachers. Some of the concerns involve relatively modest infractions--smoking in the bathrooms, swearing in the halls, sloppiness with food and drinks--and their total suppression could create more disorder than would be eliminated. Routine disciplinary matters, such as cuts and tardies, are handled almost entirely by several teams; other teachers, especially the heavy referral writers, want faster and tougher action from the assistant principals.<p>	To some teachers, orderliness means reasonable manners and simple courtesies. One English teacher was dismayed by her students' rudeness to a guest speaker dressed in period attire who gave a dramatic reading of Dickens. Several read magazines, others talked or slept, and one sucked a lollipop and stuck out her blue tongue to the speaker. A few students later tried to apologize to the speaker, who quit after twenty minutes, but other students asked, "We don't have to write him a thank you note, do we?" Yet on previous special occasions, when there were guest musicians or field trips, for example, the same students behaved decently.<p>	More serious danger occasionally flares, as suddenly as one of the UPS jets that periodically roars over the school in descent to the airport four miles away: an arrest for dealing drugs; a student's death-threat against a teacher in his journal; two guns in school within two weeks; a public safety kid's fighting another student as they wait to assist police officers with a volunteer program in an elementary school; a manic-depressive, paranoid student calling a teacher the antichrist and a Nazi (in the previous year he was removed from the building in a straitjacket). Fortunately, violence on campus against teachers is not a tragedy Lincoln has suffered, and the worst assault in the last two years--a star athlete's stabbing of his ex-girlfriend--happened away from school. Sometimes rumor outstrips reality--the Zephyr student at the crime scene did not shoot the bus driver--and sometimes teachers know about incidents only because the administration does not try to hide what happened. The tone in the hallways is not tense or fearful, but <cite>public safety </cite>has a second meaning to those teachers who wonder when the next eruption might occur.<p><h4>Dealing with Race Relations</h4><p>Race relations are an important concern to some teachers. "I get accused of racism at least once a week by a misbehaving African-American," one teacher reported, and others agreed that many black students periodically claim prejudice to explain away teacher behavior they resent. On the other hand, several blacks who saw <cite>Roots </cite>last year in American studies later called several of Lincoln's black teachers "Uncle Tom" or "Aunt Jemima." Most staff see tolerance and acceptance between black and white students, but wonder if it goes much beyond that. Athletes with teammates of other races seem the most respectful and friendly to each other. Some teachers are puzzled and hurt by black students' withdrawing from their efforts to reach out. One English teacher was jolted by a boy's announcement that no book written by a white man and no class taught by a white teacher could ever benefit him. "He is turning off possibilities. Here I am, a white teacher. I don't know if I can get through to Tyrone, but I'll try. I thought I had rapport, but it was all in my head. That hurts."<p>	Few black students seemed as outspoken and adamant as Tyrone. Comments about race relations were as likely to mention disruptive black students as to suggest white racism. The white students rarely volunteered observations about race unless asked directly; then they claimed that some black students get away with mischief in the halls and the cafeteria, which they themselves would be punished for. They wondered if teachers are scared of being called "racist" to the point of ignoring or overlooking minor violations.<p><h4>Maintaining Fairness</h4><p>As in most high schools, fairness is an important issue to students, and it is not race but athletics that evokes the strongest feelings as well as the most disagreement among students. Although students boasted of the schools' winning teams and enjoyed playing for the school, a few students thought some teams received too many resources and publicity at the expense of other teams, especially junior varsity teams and girls' teams. On a topic like new uniforms, their information was often secondhand (from a friend's friend) or incomplete (they didn't know who had them in previous years), so clarification by the administration or coaches might clear up their confusion and diminish the resentment. Students also differed in regard to athletes' grades. Several felt athletes were unduly favored, especially in season. One football player argued that he and his teammates worked hard and sought help: "If we get a bad grade, we keep asking the teachers if there's anything we can do. Other kids will just say, forget it, but when the report cards come, they'll be the ones to holler."<p>	Other student priorities also involve matters of fairness. Grading that seems arbitrary and capricious is resented, whether it is too harsh or too lenient. Losing points for delaying a presentation when a partner is absent caused just as much unhappiness as the announcement, "Depending on how everybody does, we'll determine whether or not this is a test." Students bound for college wonder if admissions offices unjustly discount a high grade-point average from Lincoln while honoring GPAs from local high schools with stronger academic reputations. A few have heard one teacher say that an A from Lincoln is considered the equivalent of a C from more prestigious high schools. Other students are concerned about scholarships and doubt they have explored all the possibilities. Several who seem eligible are not even aware that they have not done the necessary research.<p>	Another type of justice the students seek is consistency. Students think it is unfair if a teacher is absent-minded, moody, or unpredictable. They resent a course that alternates between interesting and boring projects. They prefer that one teacher would not say, "I'm not a woman; I don't change my mind," or tell the girls, "I don't want you to get your hands dirty." To a lesser extent, they regret a lack of consistency within a team. When they evaluated teachers, they almost always mentioned individuals, rather than generalizing about the team as a group. <p>	On balance, students feel they get a fair shake at Lincoln. The stories of isolated episodes and occasional lapses seem to be the exceptions, not the rule--predictable reactions from high-schoolers quick to point out anything that rankles. Interviewers had to probe to bring forth many of the anecdotes recorded here. Often the conversation would begin: "What's happening here?" "Nothing much, really. Let me think. I'm trying to think of anything that's happening. It's really about the same." <p>	From some lethargic students, the low affect is as revealing as anything they say. From LaTonya and others, outspokenness comes easily: <p><blockquote>I come home and see my mom sitting on the bed. Her feet hurt. She has trouble paying the bills; works overtime, too. I won't let my kids see me struggling to pay bills. I want to go to an all-girls college. No distriction <cite>[sic] </cite>there. People call me square. I want my brain working for me, not just my body.</blockquote> <p>	LaTonya associates the SSIA with portfolios, and as a junior she began to save papers and pick her best work to include in the portfolio. Most of her educational views are traditional. She believes, for example, that a real college requires individual work, not teamwork, so she worries that cooperative assignments are poor preparation for the future. She prefers to read a textbook's explanation than to trust what one teacher tells her or to trust what her classmates think. She likes the idea of ability grouping and advanced-placement courses; she says a friend of hers at Central High who already has college credits "is starting with a foot in the door and I'm just knocking on the door."<p>	No legislative decree could possibly address every priority in the day-to-day life of students and teachers. Even if the SSIA were nine thousand rather than nine hundred pages long, adolescents and adults would still be pursuing personal priorities unrelated to the law. Even so, the distance between the new educational goals of SSIA and the less novel, but very urgent, concerns about safety, race relations, and fairness mean that the priorities of educational reform and its intended beneficiaries are not always the same. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tfsp"><h3>The Fifty Schools Project:A New Priority</h3><p>This spring Lincoln joined the Coalition's Fifty Schools Project, a new initiative to encourage vanguard schools to extend the transformations already under way. Started and run by the Coalition of Essential Schools, the Fifty Schools Project involves "clusters" of schools supporting one another as they push the reform agenda to become exemplary Essential schools by putting all the nine Common Principles into daily practice. A Coalition coordinator works with all of the schools as they move quickly in their change efforts.<p>	Lincoln's successful application mentioned the possibility of creating "houses" for the 1994-95 school year, perhaps three houses with approximately four hundred students in each one. Conversation about this change has just begun, and so far the main advantage which people foresee is greater personalization by virtue of the Coalition's 80-to-1 student-teacher ratio. <p>	The prospect of houses raises many of the same nitty-gritty concerns that arose this year and last as the number of teams expanded. Issues such as the allocation of teachers and students, the schedule, electives, parity among teams, and students' wariness of teaming could easily surface if houses arise. One parent asked,<p><blockquote>How do you give our students what they want or need in every house when many teachers aren't certified to teach everything at every level? What if one house is weaker than another? Would I want my child there? If not, nobody's child should have to be there. And with open enrollment, will incoming freshmen pick Lincoln if they feel they'll never see two-thirds of their classmates?</blockquote> <p>	Other teachers elaborated the metaphor to give shape to their thoughts. One asked, "Will we build a house designed by an architect who knows our needs? Or are we buying in order to renovate? If so, will we paint over old wallpaper or remove it?" This teacher wondered if a house would be too confining for the juniors and seniors. "Maybe we need more doors or attic space there." Isolation worried a former Lincoln teacher: "Can they do it without walls? Maybe fences?" Another metaphorical reflection spoke of furnishings in considering how much would change: "Some pieces, like large, overstuffed chairs, are comfortable, serviceable, and match the new furniture. Other items, like a plaid orange and green sofa, just have to go." <p>	The language of architecture and interior design fits the current rhetoric of restructuring, but it does not necessarily fit images of good teaching and learning. Within the houses there might be Exhibition rooms, but what sort of valued work is to be demonstrated and shown off? If there are separate houses for younger and older students, perhaps the stairwell between them is the set of competencies and knowledge which will let them move up, if Lincoln decides to move away from Carnegie units as the basis of promotion. <p>	A major challenge ahead is thinking through how the houses will not only allow but encourage and even require the type of instruction and learning which Lincoln (and the Coalition) seeks. Will houses leave it up to individual teachers to decide whether or not they are comfortable with change? Instead of thinking first of structure, it may be advisable to focus initially on teaching and learning. Just what is the shared vision within the faculty of high expectations, honors work, good Exhibitions (as mentioned in the sixth Common Principle), and productive group work?<p>	After deciding what it is the staff earnestly agrees to do with and for students, then the value of houses might be determined properly. Otherwise, Lincoln risks repeating the history of houses. Twenty to twenty-five years ago, many high schools adopted this configuration and soon realized that teaching and learning had not changed very much. Instead of dismantling the shopping mall high school, they built a batch of mini-malls.<p>	The Fifty Schools initiative offers teachers another opportunity to reaffirm their beliefs and make those convictions real by shaping plans for 1994-95. The talk of new structures can go hand in hand with conversation about instruction, and it is heartening when those meetings include previously skeptical colleagues, draw out the talents of the rookies, and revitalize the senior faculty. Considering new possibilities--remaining open to creative ideas and well-intentioned suggestions--does more than build faculty camaraderie. It may be the way to bring closer together the priorities of individual faculty members and the SSIA mandates. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="part3"><hr><center><h2>Part 3<br>Issues for Discussion </h2></center><hr>The following are excerpts from our notes about five issues related to school change. The excerpts are followed by questions to prompt reflection. Although we originally addressed the questions to the Lincoln staff, we invite the reader, also, to take a few minutes to read and consider the following five items.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="jeaf"><h3>Justice, Equity, and Fair Play</h3><p><blockquote>I think the Coalition of Essential Schools is about justice, equity, and fair play. I think the biggest stumbling block we all face is that a lot of teachers today haven't yet seen that pulling kids up is better than separating them. They still see themselves as agents who protect the middle class from the lower class. It's real easy to say, "I came up the hard way, so you should be able to also." It's not just here, of course. How many middle-class taxpayers out there really care about anyone below them? A couple of my friends in private industry say to me, "You can't educate those kids. You're wasting your time." Unless we sell them on what we're doing, reform is going to fall flat.<p><cite>-An assistant principal </cite></blockquote><h4>For Discussion:</h4><p><ol>	<li>	What in the Coalition's nine Common Principles speaks to "justice, equity, and fair play"?<p>	<li>	How does Lincoln "sell them on what we're doing"?<p>	<li>	In what ways are kids tracked at Lincoln High?

Or both?</blockquote><blockquote>Have they made any interdisciplinary units?</blockquote><blockquote>Do the kids help plan the curriculum? Zephyr does some of that, for example.</blockquote><blockquote>Is there any self-assessment, and are students invited to evaluate the team?</blockquote><blockquote>What type of information is shared at team meetings? Brand new teams usually talk about student behavior in one or two classes. Later it changes and there's more time on teaching strategies--alternatives they've tried or just thought about--and their expectations for kids.</blockquote><blockquote>They stopped asking me to sit in on so many team meetings.

There is a lack of consensus that all students can learn well. We have made great strides in untracking students, through mainstreaming and creating eight (heterogeneous) teams. Teams have not coordinated their curricula, nor have we developed a clear focus on what kids should know and be able to do well. We're struggling with developing an integrated curriculum approach on teams and with developing a schoolwide philosophical focus to complete the big jump from a shopping mall high school to a concentration on academic essentials. Student choice versus meeting students' diverse needs is a controversial issue. We consider our students as customers and teacher work as our product. Some of our faculty find this analogy difficult to understand, interpreting that we need to please students with lots of variety in course selection instead of understanding that student needs are met with high expectations and integrating student-as-worker learning.</blockquote><h4>For Discussion:</h4><p><ol>	<li>	What does "academic essentials" mean to the faculty?<p>	<li>	What will be reliable evidence in the future that the "big jump" from a shopping mall to an Essential school has in fact happened?<p></ol><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="iaa"><h3>Instruction and Assessment</h3><p>The following is an excerpt of conversation between a School Change Study interviewer (I) and a Lincoln High science teacher (T).<p>I:<blockquote>	How do you know that what you're doing is working?</blockquote>T:<blockquote>	I do a lot of different things. Especially in chemistry, there's a lot of problem solving that takes place. That's pretty good feedback right there. If you can solve a problem, you know what you're doing. I also set up labs where you have to apply what we've done without any instruction. In a lot of labs, it's "do this, do that." But I'll say, "Here, figure it out."</blockquote>I:<blockquote>	So that would come after there's been some practice?</blockquote>T:<blockquote>	Sure. After you think they understand, can do it on paper, then see if they can apply it in a lab. We do a lot of that.</blockquote>I:<blockquote>	Being a non-chemistry person, could you give me an example of a concept you teach and how you follow it through?</blockquote>T:<blockquote>	We're doing gas laws, basically common-sense laws: if you increase the pressure on something, then its volume will be reduced. After they've seen the laws and can work the laws on paper, I give them a pop can. Heat water in it, then invert it into cold water, and the can immediately compresses. Then they're asked to explain why that happens, in writing:"This is what I saw happened, this is why I think it happens."</blockquote>I:<blockquote>	Individually?</blockquote>T:<blockquote>	Usually in groups, in fours.</blockquote>I:<blockquote>	How about informally? What do you look for informally?</blockquote>T:<blockquote>	If they have a question, I usually try to question them until they have the right answer instead of giving them the right answer.

When we visited Lincoln High School during the week of October 18-22, 1993, as part of the School Change Study, we wondered if there was a comparable lull in Lincoln High School's push to improve itself. The place seemed calmer, quieter than it had before.<p>	Located in the south-central region of the country, Lincoln High School is a middle-size, suburban high school, with approximately twelve hundred students. About 75 percent of Lincoln's students are white, 25 percent are black, and 40 percent come from low-income families. <p>	By this, our fifth, visit, we had become familiar with the challenges that Lincoln was facing. We were also familiar with the changes it had achieved since joining the Coalition of Essential Schools in 1988 and committing itself to work towards change according to the nine Common Principles. (See Appendix B for a list of the Principles.) Some of the changes the school has undertaken have included mainstreaming the special education students; implementing portfolios, other authentic assessments, and site-based decision making; and restructuring the schedule so that more than half the students are grouped into teams of about one hundred students and four or five teachers. The State School Improvement Act, a fundamental reworking of the state's entire educational system, enacted in 1990, has also pushed Lincoln to change.1 Most recently, Lincoln's involvement since spring 1993 in the Coalition's Fifty Schools Project has meant an intensification of reform efforts at the school.2<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ncnc"><h3>New Challenges, New Changes</h3><p>When we arrived for our visit, we noted that two of the volatile issues from the previous year, the expansion of teaming and the tangled master schedule, no longer sparked intense reactions. With the Fifty Schools Project committee busily considering a reorganization into houses for the 1994-95 year, no one overinvested in the teams when a new configuration might soon arise to modify or replace them. People also admitted that the three tenth-grade teams this year should not be faulted if they did little, because quite a few teachers and students had to leave the teams for part of each day. Whenever a school offers numerous electives, admits students with a wide range of abilities, introduces a magnet program alongside traditional courses (at Lincoln, the Public Safety Magnet), and lets teachers transfer in August, it is hard to create the ideal conditions for teaming, especially the long blocks of time when everyone stays together.<p>	Some outspoken dissenters had transferred, and their absence removed some turbulence. Chip Smoley, after vowing he would never be "driven off," accepted an offer from a well-regarded, local, traditional high school. Russ Michaels, tired of unmotivated students, also left. In contrast, the new recruits included a welcome mixture of rookie teachers along with experienced pros, including a Citibanker3 and a respected Lincoln math teacher who had tried working one year elsewhere and was glad to get back. The stalwart restructurers remained on the staff; and unlike the previous year, they voiced fewer complaints about inequitable workloads, a sore spot to several.<p>	Everyone missed Ted Stewart, the history teacher, out for several months after quadruple-bypass surgery, but he could not stay away; he was roaming the halls on Parents' Night (the evening open house for parents) and popping in at other times, twenty pounds lighter and itching to get back to Lincoln.<p>	But just as marine life churns under a lake's smooth surface, so were the currents moving in and around Lincoln. Some of the activity was simply the periodic crisis that flares unexpectedly and then passes. During an interview we had with an assistant principal, for instance, his walkie-talkie announced that two students had just left the Zephyr team suite with ice picks. He excused himself, then returned five minutes later, relieved that the ice picks, apparently mislaid, had been found in a teacher's desk.<p>	Not every unanticipated problem comes from the students, of course. At Parents' Night the principal, Valerie Taylor, stayed an extra two hours, until 10:30 p.m., to soothe parents upset with one teacher who had dozens of unhappy folks outside her door. The band teacher saw them going up and down the stairway to the teacher's room, "red in the face, frothing," in quite a contrast to the overall good will and satisfaction he had seen that night. <p>	The new district superintendent stirred the waters soon after he arrived from another state. He wanted to tighten a few areas which struck him as too loose. Deadlines should be firm, he felt, not false dates which administrators could miss without consequences. The leave days for professional development--thirty-five thousand days last year, or an average of seven per teacher--would have to be justified persuasively. Statistics on all aspects of schooling would be sought more and used more. This is not to say he wanted to roll back the spirit or substance of the SSIA. He praised its egalitarianism, and publicly questioned the city's elite magnet schools as a form of tracking. He also seemed willing to restructure his own domain, especially the Lindeman Institute, the district-sponsored professional development academy, where he startled its staff by telling them, "If in the middle of the day I can call a meeting of 192 people and our schools can still operate, then there are too many of you." On the other hand, he had already created a new position to advise and coach district principals, and Lincoln's principal was asked three times to apply.<p>	The greatest external challenge came from the low state test scores in the spring of 1993. The dozen open-ended response questions counted for most of each student's score, yet comprised only a small fraction of the 160 items, with the 148 multiple-choice National Assessment of Educational Progress questions used to compute norms. Testing conditions at Lincoln--in the cafeteria, not classrooms--were not ideal, but the major problem was the lack of incentives for seniors to take the test seriously.<p>	One of the monitors, Mary Beth Norton, urged students to write something, to at least try the open-ended questions, but many "just gave a lick and a promise," as one assistant principal put it. Mary Beth recalled, "They were tired of tests. It had no impact on their graduating. They saw no reason why they should exert themselves." Some took back their papers at her request and wrote one sentence in the blanks, apparently feeling, "I did 130 other ones, so what's the big deal?" As Brad Haber said, "I was tired of filling in circles. It didn't mean nothing to my grades. I just went <cite>tch, tch, tch </i>[making pencil checks rapidly]."<p>	The school devised an improvement plan to raise the scores; all teachers were asked to use open-response questions in homework, paper assignments, and classroom tests. The gain needed in the spring of 1994 to meet the SSIA threshold is considerable, and teachers recognized the possibility that Lincoln could be a "school in crisis," at the same time that it would be designated a "model school" under the state's new pilot program for restructuring high schools.<p>	That pilot program, which stems from the recommendations of a task force chaired by Lincoln's principal, contains far-reaching proposals: the end of Carnegie units, Exhibitions for graduation,4 an individual educational plan for all freshmen, no tracking, and other significant reforms aligned with SSIA objectives. The next few years would be full of new thrusts and fresh starts, and that anticipation of what is on the horizon was another reason why the superficial calm at Lincoln was deceptive. The awareness that a great deal of important work lies just ahead keeps teachers and administrators from complacency or lethargy.<p>	Regardless of whether an individual at Lincoln feels the lull or the stirrings, it is evident that old roles continue to shift. The nature of work is changing for both administrators and teachers. Sometimes the transformation is obvious and extensive, as when a new team moves ahead and creates exciting interdisciplinary units; sometimes the metamorphosis is gradual and hard to detect, yet still significant in scope and consequence. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fts"><h3>Focusing the Snapshot</h3><p>As we do each time we visit a school as part of the School Change Study, we created a "snapshot" of our fifth visit to Lincoln High School, based on the observations we made and the conversations we had with people in the school community during our visit. We decided to devote this snapshot to what happens when role changes occur because of the changing nature of the work. First we will discuss some of the challenges that go along with these changes in roles. Next we will present profiles of individuals and groups in the midst of rethinking their jobs and undergoing role changes in the school. We conclude with reflections on the snapshot and three "provocations" for the reader's further consideration.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="mtcw"><hr><center><h2>Meeting the Challenges When Work and Roles Change </h2></center><hr>We will look at three challenges that the staff at Lincoln face as their roles change as a result of the changes in their work: confusion, changes in working conditions, and misunderstandings concerning role boundaries and schoolwork. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cwc"><h3>Coping with Confusion</h3><p>Often the challenge posed by uncertainty over roles is learning how to cope with confusion. Sometimes the lack of clarity can be relatively inconsequential and accommodated effortlessly. One teacher said she could not figure out which committee meeting she was attending this week, because the same people came to different meetings, but she was not troubled or bothered by that. So, too, does another teacher accept the ambiguity about her new position as a "guidance teacher," doing work comparable to a counselor's, but classified and paid as a teacher. <p>	At other times, the fuzziness is more significant and stressful. For instance, some folks see the Public Safety Magnet program teachers as another team, whereas others view the program as the heart and soul of the entire school (or feel that it should be that as soon as possible). The choice carries nontrivial consequences for Lincoln's recruitment, scheduling, and curriculum. We observed another case of meaningful ambiguity when we watched the Deming training provided to the Zephyr and American studies teams so they could learn the techniques of Total Quality Management. Was their time with a corporate executive intended to turn these teachers into trainers of their colleagues? Several teachers yearned to move the entire faculty forward by sharing the analytical skills they were learning. Others thought their own understanding and use of Deming's methods would be a huge achievement by itself. The group agreed to postpone a decision regarding which path to take. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cwci"><h3>Coping with Changes in Working Conditions</h3><p>Even when role changes are fairly clear-cut, there are a wide range of consequences which follow the shift. Sometimes the consequences that follow a shift in roles make a job easier or harder than it was before. For instance, some public safety teachers with previous experience in vocational schools now have tougher working conditions. In the past, they taught fewer students in shorter days. Many classes only had a dozen kids, motivated and diligent. With time lost to bus travel to and from their home schools, or to afternoon coops, the teaching day was short--often four hours or so. The lunch break was long, and at Lincoln, a custodian used to cook lunches for the faculty in a kitchen installed years ago by a previous principal. But if they now find life at Lincoln demanding, they could ask Fran Murray about her year at another high school nearby. When she left Lincoln after seven years, she thought the middle-class students she would teach would not present the massive challenges many Lincoln students bring with them. To her surprise, the students she taught were less respectful than Lincoln's. There was more theft too; she could not leave her markers on the overhead projector without losing a few.<p>	Perhaps the basic issue is not whether any job became harder or easier, but the types of differences faced as people take new positions. In August, Cindy White became the "tech prep coordinator" when Alice Hansen took an assistant principalship elsewhere. Cindy writes and oversees grants, helps Valerie with special projects, and escorts the stream of visitors around the campus. In the first few months, she began to view her school in new ways, learning that the principal knew more about the day-to-day details than she would have guessed, seeing that discipline was better than she had imagined, and sensing how the various programs, initiatives, and grants interconnected on behalf of Coalition Principles.<p>	Initially, she was not sure whether the school had changed or if her new perspective explained this grasp of "the big picture." Valerie reassured her that classroom teaching is so consuming that it's hard for any teacher to step back and see the big picture. Although Cindy sometimes worries that her overview could be "the first fateful step on the path to the ivory tower of administrative isolation," she feels too busy to be isolated. Because the principal delegates much and trusts Cindy, she has freedom and leeway, although there is as little "down time" as there was when she taught. Her responsibilities now make it impossible to continue carpooling with other Lincoln teachers, but when she does drive with them, she tells them about positive developments within Lincoln they would otherwise not know.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="dwma"><h3>Dealing with Misunderstandingsabout Role Boundaries </h3><p>For the counselors, the big challenge of their role is overcoming others' misunderstanding of what their role is. As part of the administrative team putting together each year's master schedule, they see the constraints on who can be where with whom. Electives, certifications, numbers, and other considerations keep them at school for many days during the summer, including unpaid time, hammering out the schedule. They are not out of state at Coalition institutes or special workshops.<p>	Yet some teachers feel that if there are problems with the schedule at the start of school, then the counselors did not work hard enough over the summer. Because the counselors know the parameters of the schedule, they often point out barriers or problems with proposals teachers put forth to create houses or expand teaming. "If we discuss the nitty-gritty too much, we get looked at as resisters [to change], when we're really not. As a matter of fact, we were instrumental in developing the teams." They cannot always attend those meetings where teachers dream and plan, sometimes because they have school activities to sponsor. Their response to the teachers involved in planning is, "We'd love to see all of you at Homecoming, too."<p>	Misunderstanding also marked an unusual faculty meeting where one student stepped into the role of evaluator. As a student council representative from Lincoln, Ron attended a district meeting where the superintendent spoke, urging students to think as consumers: Are you getting your money's worth? What grade would you give your teachers? Are you shopping at Wal-Mart, or worse? Ron was fired up by the superintendent's talk, and he was also astonished to see several Ivy League recruiters at the high school where the meeting was held. When Ron asked the recruiters why they never came to Lincoln, they responded, "Where's Lincoln?"<p>	Ron asked Valerie if he could speak at the next faculty meeting. He gave her an outline of his points. The student council advisor agreed to sit in the first row and signal Ron if he was overtime or off track. Ron's talk lasted twenty minutes, signals notwithstanding, and the tone was "accusatory," one teacher observed, as he railed at the staff for much more than the absence of Ivy League admissions officers. He declared there was too much "fun and games" in classes, that "new ways of teaching" were needed, and that discipline should be better. He also made inaccurate or misleading claims, such as the assertion that everyone disappeared before 3 p.m., when in fact many faculty put in hours after the last bells. As he spoke, he apparently sensed the mood turning resentful, but instead of retreating he attacked harder, pointing a finger and warning, "I'll be watching you."<p>	What is the appropriate faculty role in a situation where a student oversteps his boundaries? The faculty reactions were varied. One walked out of the meeting, disgusted. A few laughed it off. Several said that his speech was far more coherent than anything he had ever presented in their classes. Valerie later observed that Ron didn't realize that he was an example of Lincoln's success, not failure. What other school would trust a special ed student to go to a district-wide student council assembly? Some teachers were incensed and angry. Several wanted to grieve, but against whom? One slipped an anonymous note to Ron under a classroom door, taking him to task for outrageous comments. <p>	The episode raises questions about what is appropriate from a superintendent, a student, and his teachers, and suggests how a widely used slogan, "Students are our customers," can lead to unanticipated and possibly hurtful consequences. The slogan by now is quite familiar, but this form of customer feedback was novel and jarring.<p>	Misunderstanding also marks many students' notion of the portfolios which they must accumulate in math and English. The error stems from preconceptions of what constitutes schoolwork. Students think of the portfolios with reference to familiar ideas and definitions of what a test is. A group of tenth-graders talked about the makings of a good portfolio by speaking of effort and diligence--"go into detail, write a lot, and take your time"--rather than quality, and that premium on trying was how they thought about success in other assignments. Some wondered why the final portfolio, unlike all required work, is not graded for course credit. Others knew it is evaluated but think it's "only to make the state look good," or, they said, so "we can see it in the newspaper." Students tended to rank and curve each other's work, giving the best papers ratings of "proficient" or "distinguished," regardless of the traits spelled out by the rubric.<p>	Students, teachers, and administrators all face new roles in the wake of change. The transformations can take many shapes, and this section touched briefly on some dimensions of those shifts: confusion, ambiguity, harder work, unanticipated insights, misunderstandings, and preconceptions. The emotions shown varied considerably, from pleasure, to anger, to frustration.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="popi"><hr><center><h2>Profiles of People in New Roles</h2></center><hr>What is encouraging about Lincoln High is that many people who are changing roles persevere with good spirits and undiminished idealism. In the next section, three profiles highlight folks who combine willingness to break out of old routines and norms without totally abandoning structure and organization. Sometimes reformers are scorned as too scattershot and chaotic. It is important to consider the individuals who can strive for both order and flexibility.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="jmap"><h3>Jane Merrill, Assistant Principal</h3><p>After nineteen years and three Teacher-of-the-Year awards at Lincoln, Jane Merrill began as an assistant principal four years ago with the traditional view that no student should ever want to come to her office: be tough, discipline, evaluate, take care of problems, and oversee books, buses, and cigarette butts. <p><blockquote>A couple of months of that and I was miserable. I never taught that way, and I never raised my own children that way. I never used fear as a way of getting anything out of people. You use reason and logic, and model trust. I felt terrible in that rigid role, so I decided to do it my way. And if teachers thought I was too easy on kids, that would be something I'd have to live with. I do get that criticism sometimes. When kids come in here, I'm going to reason with them. The second time I see them, then yes, discipline and punishment may kick in, but I think my job is very close to being a counselor. Fear cannot be in my repertoire. </blockquote>	Jane believes her redefinition parallels the changes endorsed by the SSIA, which nudges administrators away from issuing top-down edicts to serving instead as facilitators. She knows that redirection rarely satisfies everyone. Some teachers yearn for the old-style assistant principal, who hollers at kids and backs up every single referral with swift, tough punishment. Another group, which craves more influence within the school, gets the chance to make decisions. She said of this group:<p><blockquote>Then if things aren't happening, they'll say, "You're not organizing meetings for us or setting agendas." [I answer,] "You told me you didn't want me to do that." [They respond,] "Oh, okay, I guess we don't." They don't always know exactly what they want me to do. </blockquote>	She also works with teachers who want independence and autonomy, yet when a problem on their team arises, they ask Jane to solve it. "On any day, it can switch. I have to do a balancing act as to how directive I'm going to be." <p>	That is a particularly timely finesse, in light of the Fifty Schools committee work. Some teachers feel her presence and participation overshadow teachers' opinions, but other teachers think her absence deprives the group of crucial information about the intricacies of the master schedule. The committee needs to know the ins and outs of the complicated schedule, which cannot be handed off to a clerk or entrusted totally to a software program. One committee person said:<p><blockquote>By the time you tell MacSchool everything you need to tell it, you've already made the schedule! When you say, "This subject is only for the eleventh- and twelfth-graders," or "This can only be fourth period," or "I can't have those two teachers on the same team," the whole schedule is just about in place, because you had to work it all through in your head to know that it can only be in fourth period.</blockquote>	It took several years for her to see all the twists and turns of the schedule, so it is unsurprising that some well-intentioned, gung-ho members of the Fifty Schools committee are frustrated by the barriers they bump into as they plan clever new rearrangements of twelve hundred students. <p>	Jane knows that more than the master schedule is at the heart of significant instructional change, which she hopes will be the focus of the current school year. "The structure alone will not improve teaching," she asserted, and she thinks the frequent changes in the recent past gave a few teachers a handy excuse to avoid rethinking their own pedagogy. She is excited about the potential effects of planning backwards5 (which the Zephyr team modeled in a fall workshop for the entire faculty). She yearns to see in every classroom a visible display of "what you're working on, what the child has to know and be able to do, and how they're going to be assessed. If you focus on outcomes, kids have to know where they're going." Jane admits it is hard work, and recalls her own tests rarely came at the start of a new unit. At the end of <cite>Macbeth</cite>, she would pick up her old tests, look them over, and patch together a new test with pieces from the old ones. She says, "[That is] not how I would teach today. That assessment would be up there the first day. I think if we just do that one thing, the rest of it is going to be easier."<p>	Jane understands the anxiety in reformers' hearts. One good teacher once told her, "I feel like I'm going to jump off a diving board, and I hope somebody puts water in the pool." Jane wants all the administrators to send this answer: "We're all jumping in. We know there's water under us. We're real good at doing other dives, but this is a brand new dive. If we practice enough, we'll be able to do this one too."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="nbnt"><h3>New Blood, New Teams</h3><p>An important role at Lincoln is being filled by younger teachers who quickly win respect for their interest in teaming, cooperative learning, cross-disciplinary units, and other instructional approaches in sync with Coalition ideology. These rookies often graduated from local teacher-education programs imbued with the spirit of the Coalition, so they come prepared, rather than experiencing conversion later. Some student-taught at Lincoln, and some found in their first year a mentor or teammate who encouraged them. Valerie's skillful hiring has recruited enough "new blood" that their presence is seen as one major way Lincoln sustains the momentum of change.<p>	They find all the attention exciting and a bit scary. To be offered opportunities early in their careers is exhilarating. To be seen as the wave of the future and held up as examples is dizzying, especially when they readily admit they are still finding their way, making mistakes, learning from experience, and seeing rough edges in what they try. One said, "Last year I went to my first Fall Forum and thought, hmmm, this is neat. Now this year, I'm presenting. Twice!" Not only are they wary of being lionized too quickly, they also know the risks of taking on a label or stereotype as "Coalition teachers." They realize that triggers knee-jerk reactions from a few colleagues. "If it's called 'Coalition interdisciplinary,' then to some people it's automatically O.K., and to others it's automatically not." They don't want to be aligned with or subsumed in any crowd or faction within the school. If they were, it would be too easy to lose touch with some teachers who they know contribute much to Lincoln. For instance, Ms. Hiebert, the math teacher, who recently learned just how many extra hours the coaches she eats lunch with devote to the school, says, "It's no wonder they don't do all these Coalition meetings." She adds, "I've started to appreciate those extracurricular hours they give."<p>	In one of their planning periods, it seemed as if one team with three young teachers had found a nice balance between improvisation and following guidelines. An ambitious unit, centered on a crime, had crept up on them, so they were scrambling to work through the preparations necessary to get it under way in two days. Ms. Hiebert admitted to some anxiety about the math component: "We should tell them the same things, but I'm the least involved, and I'm not sure what to say."<p>	The team spent much of the hour piecing together how they would introduce the unit to their students: post the goals tomorrow, divide classes into four groups, then ask them to pick the roles they want to play in investigating and prosecuting the crime. The group backed up to discuss what needed to be defined at the outset: Use a mimeographed sheet? Post the definitions? Let them learn new words on their own, as they need and use them in the unit? They agreed to introduce a few key terms and let them learn the others as needed.<p>	Much of the discussion focused on individual students, as team meetings often do. They carefully reviewed the students who should not be in the same groups, and Mr. Houser suggested that they also divide their best kids as well as their rowdiest. Later in the hour, they realized they had to set aside the crime unit to review one girl's request to switch English classes to get away from another girl. They checked to see who had space, were told, "That's a good class, I could handle one more," and presto--the switch was done, at a speed which team planning makes possible. Throughout the hour, the importance of the chemistry in a class came through--the mix of kids and how a shift of just a few could alter the work ethic and disposition of the twenty-seven others. Just as "new blood" in the faculty can reinvigorate and energize, so can "bad blood" among students in one room powerfully affect what happens. That insightful awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of individual students was as much a testimony to the new blood as the ambitious crime unit they earnestly planned.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="amta"><h3>Andrea Marler: Teacher as Facilitator</h3><p>A new role for teachers is asking questions in a Socratic seminar, a format popularized by Mortimer Adler in the early 1980s and introduced to many Coalition schools by workshops at the recent Fall Forum. At Lincoln High, there were several days in June 1993 for staff development with a trainer, Bert Plum, including practice sessions with students in the summer school classes. The time and dollars spent on Socratic seminars were an example of what Lincoln administrators meant when they said that this year was a time to focus on instruction.<p>	One of the enthusiastic advocates of Socratic seminars is Andrea Marler, who appreciated the Fall Forum workshops and had taught with Bert Plum for three years at another school. She hopes the technique will help her students become more comfortable, skillful speakers, willing to answer questions in front of others. For herself, whom she calls a "talker," she sees it as a challenge to say less, even though her typical class features little lecturing and frequent student group work.<p>	Her second Socratic seminar of the fall examined a fourteen-line poem. The first half of the class took up a two-page, xeroxed reading as background information, about which Andrea asked the students questions. Both halves of the class period concentrated on the topic of the removal of the Indians west of the Mississippi River during President Jackson's term.<p>	Along with the two-page excerpt, Ms. Marler passed out a mimeographed sheet with ten questions on it. The first twenty minutes of class were devoted to reading and answering questions. The class was generally quiet. One group of five boys was not very engaged, so Andrea lingered near them to be sure they were not disruptive. In that group was a blind boy, who got along well with the other four. The boy next to him read him the excerpt. Andrea walked around elsewhere to see how others were doing. She reminded them to keep that day's mimeographed worksheet for a quiz on Friday, and also reminded them that on Wednesday and Thursday they would watch a movie. <p>	An assistant principal, Claude Young, came by with a visitor. He and Andrea had taught at the same school before. She asked him to sign a guest book, and the visitor remarked on how nice the rug in the suite looked. Andrea asked her student teacher to walk around, check on student work, and award points, as she spoke with the visitor. Andrea explained how they used the early twentieth-century costumes displayed against the wall.<p>	After the guests left, Andrea reviewed the ground rules for the seminar. "Please say 'pass' if you don't have an opinion or don't care to answer a question. There are no endings or right answers in a Socratic seminar. They aren't about closure. We will just stop when it's time to do some group processing." She asked them to take a few minutes and read a fourteen-line poem, "If We Must Die."<p>	Without relying on notes, Andrea posed several dozen questions to explicate the poem. The queries concisely directed students to different sections of the poem:<p>	"Who's the 'we' in this poem in line one?"<p>	"What do the first two lines refer to?"<p>	"What happened in the Trail of Tears that we read last period? How would they have responded to these two lines?"<p>	"Tristen, what are your thoughts?"<p>	"Look at line ten. What does that mean?"<p>	"Can you think of times that has happened in our history?"<p>	"Who are the monsters? Tyisha, would you explain lines eight and nine?"<p>	"Hector, what do you see in line eleven? Sherita, do you agree?"<p>	"Can someone explain line twelve?"<p>	"OK, let's look at the last two lines."<p>	As those quotes suggest, the Socratic seminar revolved around a series of questions Andrea asked the students in fairly fast succession. The students were very quiet and attentive, and someone answered every question. Andrea purposefully did not praise or criticize their responses. She sometimes repeated what a student said without revealing whether or not she agreed. She tried to call on students who were quiet, and gave others an opportunity to speak by asking, "Does anyone want to add to that?" Once she got a response, she turned to another part of the poem and asked more questions to move them through the fourteen lines.<p>	The hour ended with a debriefing. She asked the students to give their opinion about the seminar, and everyone had a chance to speak. The positive comments ranged from "pretty good" and "interesting" to "better than the last one" (a seminar on a tough e. e. cummings poem). The only critical comments faulted silent students who had not participated. All in all, the class seemed to enjoy the seminar.<p>	In her new role as a facilitator of a Socratic seminar, Ms. Marler cannot follow a script or fly on autopilot. Even if she keeps her mind on a few goals--don't say too much, don't evaluate student comments--there are many other issues to think about in the future. When is it appropriate to focus on one student and push his answers with follow-up probes, just as Socrates roped his interlocutors with a series of questions? What is the best size of the circle of desks, a ring small enough so everyone can easily hear each other speak, yet not so small that anyone feels cramped? How many students share the view of Tammy Wearne, who saw the class as traditional, an exercise in answering her teacher's questions? Besides a debriefing, what summary is needed to underscore the lessons learned? There are many features of a Socratic seminar, many questions to ponder, and Andrea yearns for a once-a-month discussion group where Lincoln teachers could constructively raise such questions with each other.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rap"><hr><center><h2>Reflections and Provocations</h2></center><hr> As we consider all the efforts that staff have made towards improving student learning, including all the changes the staff have been experiencing in their work since we first began to visit Lincoln in 1991, we note the particular qualities that have seemed to sustain them.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="arfh"><h3>A Role for Humor and Caring</h3><p>As roles change, and even after they have changed, the transitions can be stressful and trying, yet the Lincoln faculty seems to share a reservoir of good humor and cheer, which is one of the least studied and most underrated qualities necessary to sustain meaningful whole-school change. This was apparent at a late afternoon reception during the Fall Forum for the three schools in the School Change Study. Wendy Campbell, charter member of the Zephyr team, called her boisterous and chatty table the "BD kids." Pat Clark saw parallels, too: <p><blockquote>It's interesting to see how our faculty is so much like our kids. We are absolutely irreverent--disjointed, unfocused, and seemingly inattentive--but not a single joke escaped our notice. Pat Wasley [a senior researcher at the Coalition and director of the study] was speaking and thought we were all tuned out, but everybody at our table was right there . . . a bunch of guttersnipes . . . but creative, energetic, dimensional, and, by gosh, we care! We care as much as anybody cares for our kids, who come burdened with so many problems. </blockquote>	That nurturing role, highlighted in our first snapshot two years ago, is one role that has not changed.6  It seems as vibrant as ever.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="prov"><h3>Provocations</h3><p><ol><li> What emotions other than humor and caring are necessary to stay sane and persevere in the hard work of school reform?<p><li> In what ways did the teachers and administrator profiled in this snapshot balance spontaneity and pre-planning, so that both improvisation and organization were honored?<p><li> What role changes do you see within the high school in the next few years?

Lincoln is a middle-sized high school, located in the south central region of the country, with about twelve hundred students. About 75 percent of the students are white, 25 percent are black, and 40 percent come from low-income families.<p>	Having visited the school twice a year for the past three years, we were familiar with the many ambitious and far-reaching changes that Lincoln had undertaken since it joined the Coalition of Essential Schools in 1988 and committed itself to whole-school change according to the nine Common Principles (see Appendix B for a listing of the Principles). Some of these changes included implementing site-based decision making, portfolios, and other authentic assessments; mainstreaming the special education students; and restructuring the schedule so that the majority of students in the school spent much of their day in interdisciplinary teams of about one hundred students and four or five teachers. <p>	Like the other schools in its state, Lincoln was greatly affected by the State School Improvement Act (SSIA), enacted in 1990, which fundamentally changed the state's entire educational system.1 Lincoln staff were pushed to change instruction in order to prepare students for the SSIA tests, with their open-ended questions and scoring "threshold" a school must meet in order to avoid being considered "in crisis." Lincoln's teachers were also affected by SSIA's mandating of portfolios in English and math.<p>	Lincoln committed itself to even more intensive, rapid, whole-school reform than it had previously, when it was among the first schools selected to participate in the Coalition's Fifty Schools Project in 1993.2 <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fts"><h3>Focusing the Snapshot</h3><p>As we do each time we visit a school as part of the School Change Study, we produced a "snapshot" of the school based on our observations in classrooms and our conversations with people in the school community. For this final visit to Lincoln, we decided to take the snapshot using three different lenses. Each lens takes in only what we have seen or heard but focuses on one of the following central aspects of the school experience: authentic work, decency, or commitment. After looking at Lincoln through these lenses, we present questions that suggest ways of reflecting on the snapshot as a whole.<p>	As we leave Lincoln, we wonder which of these three aspects could become the hallmark of Lincoln High School in the year 2004. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tfl"><hr><center><h2>The First Lens: What Is Authentic Work?</h2></center><hr>Most students claim their parents have straightforward expectations of schooling; as one student said, "They want me to do well, get good grades, and learn as much as I can." Often parents' goals are expressed as the absence of mischief--stay out of trouble, don't cut class, no phone calls at home from unhappy teachers--rather than the presence of particular habits of mind or intellectual dispositions. At one team meeting, for instance, a parent turned to one teacher and said, "My son's passing your class. Why are you here?"<p>	A few parents, especially the PTA activists, however, share SSIA's vision of active learning, performance-based assessment, cumulative portfolios, and the like. They are pained when their child has to endure a class where the overhead projector is the center of attention. They love projects of the kind which required building a container to protect an egg dropped from thirty feet. Even the mom whose pillow was ripped apart to make a better cushion appreciated the project. She knew that her son frequently resists unfamiliar tasks and would only admit his pleasure after the unusual undertaking was over.<p>	The attempt to involve parents has met with mixed results. A half-dozen energetic mothers have tried to get other parents involved. They made available chances to volunteer as an aide with a team or individual teacher. Two parents did volunteer, and one was so terrified of her task  of entering grades on the computer that she hesitated to come back. An open house in the West End, where many of Lincoln's black students live, attracted only one mother. Another form of participation requiring less exertion is signing a weekly progress report. Bill Gordon offered his physics students extra credit if they returned signed reports. He told them they at least had to take the progress report home, although he could not enforce their compliance. At first, half of the reports came back signed, but within a month the rate fell to 10 percent.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tsfa"><h3>The Search for Authentic Work in the Public Safety Magnet</h3><p>In the absence of consistent parental push, the burden on the school's magnet public safety program increases, but consistency there is not yet high. Instructional styles vary from one specialty to the next. Resources and community partnerships range widely, with law enforcement, the most popular of the three areas, bolstered by paid internships with the city's police department. As part of the internship, students ride with officers for eight hours a week and wear uniforms, which, one boy said, "catches a lot of attention and respect" from other students. The three twelve-week rotations by freshmen to introduce them to the magnet differ in quality, and there are also considerable differences in how extensively the public safety teachers reach out to the rest of the faculty to create interdisciplinary units. Yet even fewer academic teachers have gone the other way and initiated contact with the public safety teachers in order to link curricula.<p>	For one science teacher who did try to make a connection, the big surprise was how often students left his real-world examples in the classroom. He described their response when he had them check the thermal resistance of a plate:<p><blockquote>I can say, "OK, you're going to add to your basement, and you need to know the resistance of the material you'll use." They can hear that, but what they think is, "Man, I don't want to bother now," or "That's ten years away; I'm in tenth grade and it's time to play." They do the lab and earn the points, but I'm not sure they take it out of here. When they leave, they're thinking about playing ball or hanging out with their friends. It's like school stays in the classroom.</blockquote>	Many public safety teachers see student motivation and interest as the irreducible precondition of the magnet's success. They want students with academic ability, good attendance, and a work ethic. They take the position, "Don't dump on us. We can't take a psychotic and make him a police officer." Occasionally, counselors are criticized for routing apathetic students to public safety courses. Teachers don't mind adolescents' emotional neediness ("I usually get calls every night: 'My boyfriend left,' 'I'm worried about college,' 'I'm partying too much'") as much as they begrudge indifference. For instance, Andy Anastasi said, "I set out this year, like last year, thinking these young people wanted to be firefighters, but I have quite a few who are just here for the ride." He encouraged the motivated students to take course work at the city's community college, where two of his juniors earned A's in fire suppression. He coaxed two other kids to a regional fire-science fair, and he took ten more to see the excellent fire department of a large city nearby. Andy is grateful that his city's fire department's cadet program for early adolescents sparked enough interest last year to bring four gung-ho freshmen to Lincoln, but Andy yearns for more aggressive recruitment. Recognizing it will take much more to get out the word, he has made shirts with <cite>Fire Science </cite>stenciled on the back. He needs new equipment--burn pits, extinguishers, ladders--but above all he wants more motivated kids.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="srtt"><h3>Students' Reactions to the Expectations of the SSIA Tests </h3><p>As public safety teachers seek authentic work, the SSIA tests demand it. The importance of the spring 1994 tests was no secret. Teachers knew it was crucial to improve Lincoln's scores so the state would not categorize them as "in crisis." They reviewed sample open-ended response questions and coached kids to write detailed answers whenever possible. The school gave bonus points applicable to final exams for "distinguished" and "proficient" work (the two top achievement levels) and Lincoln paid seven thousand of its own dollars so that all students, not just the seniors, could take the tests. The staff hoped that practice and familiarity would build motivation and competence.<p>	Although most kids took the week-long testing seriously, the novelty of the open-ended questions surprised many students. The unfamiliar topics in the questions puzzled some kids accustomed to test items closely matching what they had covered in class. Questions about the orbits of two planets and the number of blocks in a pyramid startled one bright junior girl, who said, "That's stuff I'd never seen. How am I supposed to do good when I've never had it?" A senior in public safety felt disadvantaged on an item about New York City in the nineteenth century, because he had taken social studies as a junior. One girl froze when she saw a math problem about a robot. "Oh my gosh, what's that?" she thought. Students tended to see what reformers celebrate as "real-life" problems as remote, strange, and unfair puzzles to solve. The tests they are now required to take sometimes seem as contrived as the old, traditional exams reformers deplore as artificial.<p>	Moreover, the format of the test items worried some students, especially those who felt the writing demanded they fill the page, even if they finished after a few sentences. One boy who had no idea why apples are red knew his teacher did not want to see blank space, so he said, "I made up some stuff." A junior who earns good grades found that her biology teacher's practice essay question made her nervous because it was a long and multistep problem, one she had not had in previous classes (her own conversation is usually one-sentence answers to questions). A full week of testing in two-hour blocks each day exhausted some kids; they said their performance faltered later in the week.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="snol"><h3>Students' Notions of Learning</h3><p>The students' reluctance to cheer SSIA's open-ended questions reflects many students' underlying notions of learning. Over and over again they claim that the keys to success at Lincoln are doing the work, staying out of trouble, and not falling behind. Their goal is to reduce, not heighten, complexity and uncertainty. Theirs is a blue-collar view of work--a predictable day's pay for a day's time--more than an entrepreneur's notion of work--exceptional rewards for unusual achievement. <p>	Some students who do have a work ethic prefer traditional notions of learning. A sophomore who complained about learning more punctuation in typing class than in English typifies the kids who compartmentalize subjects and want English teachers to stick to vocabulary words and grammar. The "I need a book" view of a real course is another common attitude, as is the misinterpretation of the Coalition's "less is more" Principle as "you learn but don't do a lot of work." <p>	For some students, the work ethic is constrained by primitive notions of important techniques or simple procedures. Mr. Thornton described his students' reactions to the writing process:<p><blockquote>"What's a rough draft, Mr. Thornton?" They thought it was an outline done in pencil, scribbled; the final would be done real pretty, in ink. So I had to explain rough drafts. It blew their minds when I said the rough draft starts with the outline, converting it to sentences and paragraphs, putting an introduction and a conclusion with it, and then it's still rough. It hasn't even been checked for mechanics.</blockquote> 	Mr. Warner invites his chemistry students to try the unknown, but it is a struggle: "When I come up with a creative lab--real science, a true investigation--they don't want to fight through their ignorance to do it. They won't say, "OK, I don't know how to use a burette, but I'll learn so I can do this experiment." Hence his frustration when he and his teammates discussed which students to invite to attend the Coalition's Fall Forum:<p>Ms. Hiebert:<blockquote> If you've already talked to Dora, maybe you should pick her.</blockquote>Mr. Warner:<blockquote> I'm not sure she feels I made a commitment. Also, she's talked with me about transferring to Butler, so...</blockquote>Mr. Houser (alarmed):<blockquote> <cite>Why</cite>?</blockquote>Mr. Warner (imitating Dora's voice):<blockquote> "Because it's a rigorous program--it's challenging."...Didn't you know Lincoln's not challenging?</blockquote>Ms. Vickers:<blockquote> She should talk to Bethany. She left Butler. She hated it, said she was bored.</blockquote>Mr. Houser:<blockquote> We can't afford to lose kids like her.</blockquote>Ms. Vickers:<blockquote> No, we can't.</blockquote>Ms. Hiebert:<blockquote> Well, she just broke up with her boyfriend here. She thinks the boys are cuter there.</blockquote>Mr. Warner:<blockquote> They deceive themselves into believing the grass is greener there.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tsl"><hr><center><h2>The Second Lens: The Struggle for Decency</h2></center><hr>The attitudes and behavior of both teachers and students have an impact on the tone of decency and trust in the school. Currently, the Lincoln school community is clearly struggling to maintain a positive atmosphere for learning.  <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="htto"><h3>How Teachers Treat One Another</h3><p>There is tremendous variation from team to team in the way people treat one another. Some treat their special education teachers as clerks, others make them full partners. One team plays with time in order to lighten their own teaching load by 20 percent, whereas other teams feel exhausted by their efforts to create worthwhile projects. One team celebrates the achievements of its blind student; another team is sure that if a student reads on a third-grade level, it is impossible to raise that level significantly.<p>	Students wonder about possible disadvantages of the teams they are on. One girl expressed her resentment of her teachers' absences for travel: "They ought to worry about us too, you know--our education. How are we supposed to learn anything if they're always gone?" A classmate wondered if there was too much willingness to try new ideas: "Someone could walk in here and say, 'Hey, let's do a six-hour block,' and she'd go for it."<p>	Some teachers dismiss site-based decision making, another type of teamwork, as a sham which rubber-stamps what administrators and a few wily teachers want. They believe that the choices have already been made and that democratic trappings mask an authoritarian regime. Others are more indifferent than angry. They have chosen to spend their late afternoons on planning and class preparation; for them a two-hour meeting seems wholly unrelated to the demands of everyday life with students.<p>	The ways teachers act in meetings surprise their colleagues. One women misrepresented the range of opinion at her table when it was time to share and summarize the discussion of a master schedule with two-hour blocks. The next day, several teachers from that table visited the principal to set the story straight. One man at the same meeting hemmed and hawed because he wanted to please both the principal and the die-hard traditionalists. Another man in his department resented the administrators' participation in the discussion. "You aren't teachers. You don't have to do this," he stammered, wringing his hands and pointing at their table. Many teachers were taken aback when the oldest team in the school announced they were delighted with their own creative schedule and claimed it was too late in the year to monkey with the master schedule. "You send them out for all that training, then you ask us to do something new which they don't want to try, even though they were on the committee that developed the idea."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="pwsa"><h3>Problems with Students' Attitudes and Behavior</h3><p>Students, also, suffer from skepticism and indifference. One area in which they express these attitudes is the SSIA testing. The chair of one department heard several students call the exam "stupid," which in her opinion translated to "I'm too lazy to bother." A week after the assessment, one of her students asked her, "Why are we still doing open-ended questions? The test is over." The reaction to the SSIA tests mirrors the weak academic work ethic pervading the school; as one student said, "Just give me my credits and let me out the door."<p>	Ms. Vickers scolded students who came to class without their folder three months after that expectation had been laid out. One boy told her, "You ought to be glad we bring anything here--we don't take anything anywhere else." She began to bring the folders herself to sell to the students. "I practically run a bookstore some days," she commented, but she's not sure whether to give without charge a folder to students who wear gold chains, yet say they cannot afford to pay.<p>	Teachers continue to seek new ways to reach unmotivated and disaffected kids, and the school welcomes grants, pilot projects, local university faculty, and the Coalition to provide opportunities for teachers to enhance their skills. The school prides itself on its visibility and reputation for innovativeness; scores of visitors come each year. But as one administrator admitted, the immediate problems Lincoln's students bring with them, especially the extra burdens that the minority and poor kids bring, can defeat or limit the best efforts of well-intentioned reform. It is possible for good teachers to try all the pedagogical and curricular notions held up as best practice, and still fall short in the face of the overwhelming woes engulfing a student. <p>	So it is not obvious whether a boy like Freddie counts as a success or a failure. He had a dismal average in physics, Mr. Gordon recalled, but came alive during a project of building a car. <p><blockquote>Freddie got into it, and did a pretty good job. He learned something about aerodynamics. The day we finished, we decided to race them the next day. Freddie was all excited about it. I never saw him again. He never showed for the race. Later I heard he was in all sorts of trouble. His dad is an alcoholic, and he's debating running away from home, a counselor told me.</blockquote>	Freddie's troubles were not out of the ordinary. "Everybody has to act bad," an English teacher observed. One of her former students agreed, defining <cite>bad </cite>as "wearing my hat backwards and shaving my head." He called the game "King on the Streets," with each player trying to go one better than the next guy. "If I got more gold than the other fellow does, if I've got more rings on, the girls might look up to me and think I'm the big guy. But another dude says, 'No, that's how <cite>I </cite>am,' and that causes fights." <p>	Various kinds of<cite> bad </cite>account for the stacks of referrals on each assistant principal's desk. Many are for cuts and tardies, others reflect more serious offenses. The assistant principals want teachers to come see them before they write up anyone for a major infraction. One assistant principal remarked, "I get slips now saying 'disruptive,' and I have no idea just what they mean. The kid tells me it was no big problem, then later the teacher, flabbergasted, tells me [he] did this, this, and that." She had seen how some teachers wrote up kids all the time, when others sent in two or three all year. "We didn't want it to be so easy to whip out a referral. Come see us first. Ninety-eight percent of the faculty are fine now, but that 2 percent keeps us inundated." A few teachers were outraged by the restricted access, many didn't seem to mind, and Wendy Campbell, a member of the ninth-grade Zephyr team, jokingly offered to swipe and hide packs of referrals if teachers would themselves handle discipline, as she believed her team did.<p>	Some infractions go beyond the teams' capacity. Last spring, the shots in the air in the parking lot were fired by outsiders, but Lincoln's students bring weapons to school. The number who carry a gun, either occasionally or regularly, is unknown, but nearly all the students have a story to tell of someone they know who does it. Ozela Watson recalled a "little-bitty freshman" who yelled at her, "Get away! I'm packin!" as he flipped through a roll of fifties and hundreds to find a dollar for the soda machine. Jill Davis said, "[I was] giving one of my best friends a hug the other day. He said, 'Don't move your hands down too far.''' Jill knew what was there. With him and her other friends she has backed off. "I used to joke with everybody and tell them they're crazy. I can't do that now. How do I know if the guy's going to pull out a .44 and blast me?"<p>	Vanessa wasn't blasted, but someone left a death threat in her locker. Immediately, she called her mother, who came to the school. When they could not meet with a counselor or administrator, they went to the police station, and an officer returned with them to the school. They spoke with Ms. Greenfield, a counselor. Because Vanessa was already earning credits by working two periods a day at the teen parenting program, the principal arranged for her to spend the entire day there.<p>	Soon she felt "frustrated and out of place because [she] wasn't pregnant." She transferred to a self-paced district program known by the shorthand "Wash County," where she moves through worksheets and workbooks in essential living, English, and biology. Teachers are available for help if she needs it. "I like it. It's not a zoo. It's so quiet I could hear a pin drop." She works thirty hours a week at her fast-food job, longer hours than before, because Wash County only has her from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. At first, Vanessa's mother worried that she no longer attended a "regular" high school, but now she is pleased with the switch, which she also made for Vanessa's brother. Vanessa appreciates Wash County as a safe and fast path to her diploma. Although she remembers science facts she can use on her biology worksheets now, there is nothing else that carried over from Lincoln, which she recalls as "baby-sitting."<p>	Aside from the carrying of guns, the kind of disrespect that students notice the most is foul language, especially voiced by students toward teachers. When asked to put away a guitar, a freshmen told his English teacher to "kiss [his] ass." A junior football player started a remark by insisting he's not racist, then claimed that many blacks say "f- you this and suck that--anything you can imagine--but I slip and say something smart, not even a cuss word, and it's, 'You! Down to the office!'" David, a senior fascinated by electronics, came from a Catholic middle school. He reported, "When you talked back to a teacher there, man, you were in the office. Usually got paddled. They called your mom, then she'd beat the crap out of you. But here kids are always cussin' their teachers."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ttl"><hr><center><h2>The Third Lens: Commitment</h2></center><hr>Students and parents share a positive attitude toward various aspects of the school experience: the Public Safety Magnet program, involvement in school activities, preparations for the SSIA test, and special performances that allow students to "be somebody."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="eftp"><h3>Enthusiasm for the Public Safety Magnet Program</h3><p>Both students and parents have positive feelings about the Public Safety Magnet program. One student said, "Most of us want to be back here. We know if we mess up, we're out." Who would mess up when the public safety course work "feels like a real job"? Besides, the building is cleaner than the main campus, the bells are not as jarring, and there is less smoke in the bathrooms. And parents appreciate what their kids learn. One reported, "My son came home and asked, 'Where's our fire extinguisher?' He checked it out. He told us not to ever use it on trash fires."<p>	Connections between academic and public safety work look promising. Ms. Hiebert, for instance, invited Mr. Holden to her geometry class to show how triangles could be used to analyze a crime scene. Mr. Thornton set up a photo composition station where facial features are selected and arranged to make pictures of suspects. He also sent the English teachers a meticulous note reviewing his students' writing about graphics software, which he hopes will find its way into their portfolios.<p>	Students of different abilities and backgrounds benefit from it all. In fact, two of the eight interns with the police department came to Lincoln classified as "behaviorally disordered," slotted for a self-contained classroom.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="piig"><h3>Parents' Interest in Getting Involved</h3><p>Parents' interest goes beyond attending an open house or joining the PTA board. Information is made available to parents so that they can help their child take advantage of the choices in arena scheduling, and they are given counsel on how to seek the teacher or team known to be the right match for the child. Parents who have spent time in the school or in PTA have a remarkably good sense of who teaches well and who does not, and they coach their teenagers accordingly. <p>	Other types of help also abound. Parents appreciate Mr. Gordon's offer to attend his physics classes--"take the quizzes, do everything with your kid." Cindy's mother heard about a poetry contest, and she collected Cindy's previous year's poems and encouraged Cindy to enter. One mom, who sits with her son every night before "lights out" and asks him exactly what he did in each period that day, said, "I'm real lucky. A lot of boys wouldn't do that." Her husband volunteers as a teacher's aide in the school, working with Ms. Hiebert in math. <p>	For some parents who grew up nearby and went to Lincoln High, their commitment derives from the contrast between then and now. Betty Foss was delighted when her daughter, Louise, announced in the car that she could calculate in her head the height of the trees along the roadside. Betty compared that achievement to the dead-end vocational math class her husband endured twenty-five years ago at Lincoln: "It really didn't have anything to do with his vocation. There was no one who encouraged him to take algebra. All that changed when Miss Taylor got here in l986."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sfts"><h3>Support for the SSIA Exams</h3><p>The SSIA exams were regarded respectfully. Several mothers reported that their daughters went to bed earlier than usual, to be sure they were alert each day. The school asked employers to limit the hours students could work that week. Teachers encouraged students by posing, weeks in advance of the test, practice questions parallel to what would be on the test. During the test there was constant encouragement--"Come on, I know you can do more." Afterwards, teachers praised students who had tried hard and done well. Mr. Warner read one girl's work on a math/science problem, and he congratulated her in the hallway. She wasn't his student, so she was surprised and delighted by the unexpected pat on the back.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="otbs"><h3>Opportunities to "Be Somebody"</h3><p>The SSIA tests assess academic domains, but the performances students do throughout the year are not confined to academic courses. In band, for instance, students always demonstrate what they are learning. Mr. Young welcomed the two-hour blocks of time made available during the SSIA testing week. "Five whole rehearsals of nothing but two hours...I saw amazing improvements in their playing." Because students typically need a half hour to rise to the point where Mr. Young wants them, the two-hour block gave them an extra hour for peak performance. He knows that two hours might strain some teachers in other departments, but he had his hopes up for having them at least eighty minutes at a stretch in future master schedules.<p>	Even without eighty minutes, many teachers reported special moments when they make contact and suddenly a student is bursting with interest. For Mr. Krug, those breakthroughs included a geography student's doing a special cartography project; a boy's voluntary reading of two Desmond Morris books; and a special ed student's asking for a hundred-year-old flood plain map to help his family determine if their house was located in that area.<p>	For many kids, the chance to perform at Lincoln seems within closer reach than it would be at other schools. The sophomore daughter of a counselor transferred to Lincoln from a high-octane, upper-middle-class high school. "It's easier to be somebody here," she glowed. Her mom had considered her "lost in the crowd" as a freshman. At the other school, with twice as many freshmen, it was harder to join teams and clubs. She had to apply, write stories, and sell ads to be <cite>considered </cite>for a position as reporter on the newspaper staff; at Lincoln, she volunteered and was in. Last year, she had seen with dismay senior girls cut from the squad after three years of cheerleading--a fate she doubted awaited any of her fellow cheerleaders at Lincoln.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="qfr"><h3>Questions for Reflection</h3><p><ol><li>	How are the first and second scenarios different?<p><li>	Why are the topics of decision making and teams absent from scenario three? <p><li>	What aspects of the third scenario please you the most?<p><li>	What needs to happen to improve the odds of the third scenario's coming to pass by 2004?<p></ol><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><hr><center><h3>Notes</h3></center><p><ol><li> See Robert Hampel, "Possibilities and Priorities: Choices for Change," Studies on School Change (Lincoln No. 4), Coalition of Essential Schools, Brown University, Providence, September 1993, for a fuller discussion of the impact of the SSIA on Lincoln High School, as well as on the other schools in the state.<p><li> The Fifty Schools Project, started and run by the Coalition of Essential Schools, began in spring 1993.

At first glance, it appears to have been created by a New England sea captain infatuated with the culture of the southwestern United States: the three towers of the school, adobe-like structures topped with glass, resemble lighthouses along the Atlantic coast. According to the student handbook, the school's towers represent the pillars of the school: academics, athletics, and activities. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="aooc"><h3>An Overview of Crossroads</h3>Although a winner of an international award for its design when it was constructed four years ago, and identified within its state as a leader in innovative programs, Crossroads is still trying to overcome the community's tendency to consider it a second-rate place in comparison with long-established Main High School.<p>	Crossroads is home to about eleven hundred students; 70 percent are Hispanic and another 3 percent are from other minority groups. The school is located in one of the nation's most beautiful cities, a culturally rich home to art galleries, chamber music, and opera. For the most part, Crossroads' students are drawn from the town's low-income population--most of the more affluent reportedly defeated a school board move to include them when the school opened. <p>	In some ways Crossroads is a high school similar to many in the country. Students' normal schedule includes classes in six fifty-five-minute periods each day, five days a week. In order to graduate from Crossroads, students must earn twenty-three credits, including four credits of English, three of math, two of science, one of PE, one-half of health, one of U.S. history, one of government/economics, one of world history/geography, and one of communications. Students also have to pass the state competency tests to demonstrate that they possess the basic skills the state expects.<p>	During lunch period, students might climb in a car and join the large, exiting group that drives the two miles to Taco Bell, Burger King, Wendy's, Sonic, or one of the variety of outlets in the shopping mall. Those who remain at school gather at the round tables in the student cafeteria for fare such as "Navajo Taco/Lettuce & Tomato/Beef Fajitas/Flour Tortilla/Spanish Rice/Salsa/Milk & Juice, Chilled Fruit & Cherry Pie," as the menu announced for October 23, 1991. <p>	At the end of the school day, students can participate in a wide variety of extracurricular activities. Athletes, drama students, and musicians perform in state-of-the-art facilities. Students readily identified the sports program and school spirit as strong features of Crossroads. They also spoke with pride of the drama program in which they mount productions attended by elementary and middle school students who are brought to Crossroads. These children and adults from the community see productions such as Stud Terkel's <cite>Working</cite>.<p>	Members of the band perform for some of the athletic events--mainly football and basketball games--in addition to performing at seasonal concerts of their own. Some student athletes miss classes for these extracurricular activities, since a number of the contests start during the last period. Many other athletes are enrolled in a special PE section for athletes during that period. <p>	Crossroads' students have access to a wide variety of other clubs and activities, such as computer club, speech club, astronomy club, DECA, and Future Homemakers. Students who do not participate in such activities are labeled "outsiders" by some of the students who do take part.<p>	Crossroads has counselors, health specialists, and social workers to assist with various special needs. It offers special education and Chapter I services to students needing academic assistance. A central characteristic of Crossroads is that parents, students, and teachers demonstrate concern for the success and welfare of the students. The successes of Crossroads have been obtained with less money per student than is spent, on the average, nationally.<p>	One of the key challenges Crossroads faces is a lack of continuity, due to all the changes in its leadership. Changes in key personnel may be the most constant feature of Crossroads. The superintendent who initiated the school died suddenly two years ago and was replaced by an interim superintendent, who has since been replaced by the current superintendent. The original principal was replaced this year by an administrator from a nearby junior high. Three months into this school year, an assistant principal left, and he was replaced by his predecessor. The current assistant principal is the second person to hold her position.<p>	Thus, in four years, there have been two principals and four assistant principals (with one of the four having been assigned to the school twice). Ten new full- and part-time teachers have been hired this year. Two of the originators of the Pathways program (an innovative program described below) have left the school.<p>	The process for selecting the present principal--who is new as of the start of this, the fourth, school year--involved a screening committee that included teachers, a parent, and a student selected from the school's Governing Council, and teachers, a parent, and a student selected from the school community at large. The principal has had two years of experience as a vice principal in one of the junior high schools that feeds Crossroads. He is, at once, a person whose selection was supported by many on the faculty and one who is seen by others as lacking in high school experience.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cif"><h3>Crossroads' Innovative Features</h3>In spite of its many traditional features, Crossroads has its unique characteristics. As one student observed, "When you move [here] from someplace [else], it's hard to know what to take; we don't have English and social studies." In fact, during its short history, Crossroads has developed a statewide reputation as a leader in the struggle for school reform. Crossroads has earned this reputation because of two innovative features: the Pathways program and the Governing Council.<p>	Pathways is a multi-age, interdisciplinary humanities program in which all ninth-, tenth- and eleventh-grade students enroll. Pathways teachers use common themes drawn from world and American history to link history and English. Ninth-, tenth-, and eleventh-graders satisfy their requirements in these fields by enrolling in the Pathways program. Even though the rest of the students' school day is divided into conventional fifty-five-minute periods, their Pathways class is blocked so that they may have a longer time with one or both of their Pathways teachers. <p>	Students are told that Pathways emphasizes interdisciplinary curriculum, heterogeneous grouping, cooperative learning, and assessment through Exhibitions of written, oral, and visual presentations. The description of the program in the student handbook states:<p><blockquote>Pathways is a humanities project organized around themes in history, literature, philosophy, and the arts. Currently, five themes cover topics in American history, world history, and government. Each theme is taught cooperatively by English and history teachers. All students attend a Pathways class, and, grouped heterogeneously by age and ability from the first three years of high school, study within each of these thematic families. During their senior year, students will major in one of five areas and combine their studies with internship experience.</blockquote>	The second feature that has given Crossroads its reputation of being an innovative school is the Governing Council. Led by its teacher chair, the Governing Council involves teachers, a parent, students, and administrators in critical decisions. The school has had a Governing Council since it opened. Prior to the school's first year, the Panasonic Foundation conducted a week-long training session for faculty who had been selected by June 1988. This training session initiated shared decision-making practices at Crossroads. By March of that year (according to the teacher who is the current chair of the Governing Council), parents managed to win a seat, and by April the students added a representative. <p><h4>Crossroads' Connection with the Coalition</h4>Beyond its Pathways program and Governing Council, however, Crossroads has been committed to innovation since its creation through its connection with Re:Learning.1 Re:Learning, a partnership involving the Coalition of Essential Schools and the Education Commission of the States, provides funding and a coordinator to support schools involved in Essential school reform. Re:Learning provides a framework for allowing school-based reform efforts to influence state educational policy and for schools to obtain support for planning and testing new classroom practices and school structures.<p>	Involvement with Re:Learning and with Panasonic is partially attributable to a charismatic superintendent whose vision helped create several model schools in the district. His untimely death two years ago left a power vacuum in the district which administrators, teachers, and parents suggest is just now sorting itself out.  <p>	In its 1990-91 Re:Learning report, Crossroads identified an ambitious Action Plan for the 1991-92 school year. During two visits in the fall of 1991, the only item from that extensive plan which we heard discussed was the intention of the business department to provide support for planning a new vocational wing at the school. With such rapid turnover, the task of sustained renewal becomes tremendously difficult. <p>	The state's Re:Learning coordinator described Crossroads as "an implementation school."2 He uses teachers and administrators from the school to help conduct training sessions for other schools and for the staff of the state office. In this way the Crossroads staff has contributed to the change effort of other schools throughout the state. <p> 	Crossroads' involvement with Re:Learning includes participation in its state's version of a "Trek." Treks were originally designed by the Coalition of Essential Schools as week-long seminars to help schools investigate and manage change. Crossroads' faculty members have also participated in a follow-up session to the Trek. A team from the district central office participated in the first district Trek conducted nationally by Re:Learning during the fall of 1991 in Delaware. The central administrators who participated in this session were enthusiastic about it and voiced strong support for Crossroads' efforts. <p>	The student handbook indicates that the school's goals have been adapted to be consistent with the Coalition's nine Common Principles. (See Appendix B for a listing of these Principles.) The faculty handbook, on the other hand, does not include anything about the curriculum or programmatic focus of the school but emphasizes rules that teachers and students need to follow. The student handbook also includes the school's mission statement--its version of the Common Principles. Originally drafted prior to the school's opening in 1988, the statement has been rewritten several times and was adopted by a faculty vote and by the Crossroads Governing Council on May 17, 1991:<p><blockquote>[Crossroads High School's] faculty, students, parents, and administration believe that all students must have equal access to an excellent education. We are committed to developing disciplined citizens and to providing students with active learning experiences which promote inquiry and a desire for life-long learning.</blockquote><blockquote>We further believe that healthy self-esteem fosters motivation and is the key to students' educational success. To this end all activities and disciplinary procedures will promote student self-esteem and a sense of school community.</blockquote><blockquote>The specific objectives we have set to meet our goals are consistent with the Re:Learning [Crossroads High School] program:</blockquote>	A. Helping adolescents learn to use their minds well;<p>	B. Helping adolescents master a specific number of essential skills;<p>	C. Applying the school's goals to all students equitably;<p>	D. Establishing small, personal classes;<p>	E. Teaching adolescents to [sic] responsible for their own learning;<p>	F. Awarding diplomas to students who have successfully exhibited mastery of established standards for essential knowledge and skills;<p>	G. Fostering an atmosphere of inquisitiveness, trust and decency;<p>	H. Employing a staff that has a sense of commitment to our students;<p>	I. Recognizing the non-academic as well as academic time needs of our students;<p>	J. Providing additional time for collaborative planning by teachers.<p>These are the school's official goals and mission statements. To get a further understanding of the school, we looked at how students and adults experience it.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="asoc"><h3>A "Snapshot" of Crossroads</h3>In October 1991 we made our first visit to Crossroads High School as part of the School Change Study. During our October visit we talked with people in the school community--teachers, students, staff, and parents--observed a number of classrooms, and obtained additional information from written material in order to produce the following "snapshot" of what it is like to teach and to learn at Crossroads High School.3 <p>	During our first visit to Crossroads High School, we interviewed thirty teachers, forty-five students, six parents, the administrators in the school, and two members of the central administration. We observed nineteen class sessions. In addition, we studied reports from self-studies previously conducted at the school, documents prepared by central administration and school staff, newspaper clippings, student newspapers, and annuals. From these interviews, observations, and document reviews we have constructed the snapshot which follows. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cc"><hr><center><h2>Classroom Close-ups</h2></center><hr>We turn now to descriptions of a few of the classes we visited to get a close-up of what it is like to teach and to learn at Crossroads. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="pc"><h3>Pathways Classrooms</h3>Whether or not they support the Pathways program, all connected with the school say it is the heart of the change effort at Crossroads, so we will describe some of these classes first.<p><h4>American History and English </h4>	We enter an airy, bright room (it's too hot but the teacher tells us that someone will have to contact the central office to turn off the heat). There are four questions on the chalkboard: "America as a melting pot: myth or reality? Work: the key to the American Dream? Citizenship: Every American's inheritance and legacy? America looks in the mirror: How do we change--in laws, rights and dreams?" We also see the outline for the five-paragraph essay students are to write during the next two days: "introduction, thesis, statements of support (paragraphs 2-4) and conclusion." <p>	Student desks are arranged in sets of four to facilitate cooperative discussions. The teacher's  reminder to students to sit "by their immigrant groups" causes a few to move from the seats they had originally taken. <p>	As the bell signals the start of the period, ten students are present; eventually three more will arrive, and, as the period progresses, two will leave. Today the teacher is conducting a review for the next day, when students will be asked to use information from both history and English to develop their thesis statements as a "performance" to show what they have learned during the first nine weeks. The teacher begins the class: <p><blockquote>All right, everyone. Settle in. Focus. Just raise your hand. All right. Let's focus just a short time. See you have your rubrics [guidelines for scoring themes]. The other teacher covered this? Everyone pay attention. [There is still a lot of noise and side conversation.] Take good notes. Hey, Carlos, you weren't here. Have you forgotten in one day? Take good notes. If you need to borrow readings, they're up here. Any seniors? This is for the yearbook. Fill this out on your own. Take out paper. Take out your rubric. </blockquote>	As the review progresses, the teacher asks the students to recall information: "A better house where?" "What were some of the themes?" "Why is this book not called the <cite>Life of Francis Nolan</cite>?" About 80 percent of the time is spent in "teacher talk": the teacher asks the questions, the students answer them. Questions are based on the text, and right or wrong answers are given. Although the students are sitting in groups of four, they seldom talk with each other.<p>	We stay in the teacher's classroom for one period and then return the following period when a second class comes in. The class begins with twelve students but gradually increases to sixteen. Again she conducts a review covering much of the same material as before. During each class, public address (PA) announcements interrupt three times. While the teacher calls on a variety of students, a few students, as in the first class, provide most of the answers. <p><h4>American Government</h4>On the next day we visit another Pathways classroom. Again, this class has ten students when it begins, but several more wander in as the period progresses. This time the students are seated in conventional rows. Since the opening ceremonies on the PA system were lost in the hubbub of general conversations, the teacher leads the Pledge of Allegiance. After a couple of brief announcements, she says, "Do you have any questions about the essay test?" She reminds them that they are to write on the question, "Who has the power?"--the theme for their section of Pathways. <p>	Next, she tells them that they should already have with them their materials from advanced planning. Then she asks, "How many planned in advance?" All but four indicate they did. <p>	The teacher emphasizes that a good thesis statement should be a statement of opinion and may have some controversy; she adds that it "has to be clear and concise, not too broad. Since we know it is your opinion, you should avoid introducing it by saying 'in my opinion.' " <p>	The students write for two hours, with a ten-minute break at the midpoint of the double period. The teacher and a Chapter I reading teacher circulate throughout the room, helping students in response to raised hands. <p>	Soon after the students begin writing, Karen, who is sitting in the back of the room, shows a neatly written three-page paper to the teacher. The teacher looks it over, points to a sentence, and asks, "Is this your thesis statement?" During the first fifty-five-minute period Karen seeks help five times--twice from the Chapter I teacher and three times from the Pathways teacher. At the break she indicates she is finished with her paper. We look at it; it is a description of the three branches of our federal government.<p>	Meanwhile, in the front of the room, Cindy and Maria spend most of their time chatting with each other. About every five minutes the teacher stops to talk with them, quietly encouraging them to write.<p>	From the back of the room Paul consults with the teacher many times. He asks, "Can we use the movie for proof?" She explains that can be done "only above and beyond two other sources." Paul returns to his desk muttering, "Kill! Kill!" (but he has a smile on his face). He talks with Harold, who suggests something he can say instead of quoting a movie. He fills in that information and checks with the teacher to make sure it is all right. She indicates he now has "two and two"--apparently two references from each class (social studies and English) in the five-paragraph essay. <p>	As the teachers continue to help the students with their essays, the Chapter I teacher devotes particular attention to Elmer and Julio in the back of the room, who, she indicates, have very low reading ability. She also leaves the room occasionally to help Sam, who is writing in a small room off to one side of the classroom. Later she goes to the counseling office to explain why Elmer cannot come to the office as requested by one of the four PA announcements that interrupt the period. <p>	Tina, a student who has enrolled for weighted course work because of her high ability, asks about using some references from <cite>Antigone</cite>. She spends two-thirds of the first hour reading reference materials. When she writes, her thesis is that money is the source of power. She has added references to King John's taking money from the nobles to some of her observations about <cite>Antigone </cite>and <cite>Oedipus Rex</cite>. (Concerning these tragedies, Tina said the day before, "They are semi-interesting; I can catch on even though I missed reading them because I was absent. I understood it by talking with friends.")<p>	The mixture of ages in this classroom is evident. Older students tend to finish their essays ahead of the younger. In some cases older students respond to questions from the others, helping them with form, with spelling, or with ideas for their papers. However, in some instances the roles are reversed, as younger students help the older ones. <p>	While the students write, the teacher shares with us the scoring rubrics that will be used for these nine-week essays. This essay is to be scored on a four-point scale related to three major dimensions: "thesis statement and organization, elaboration, and mechanics and procedure." She also shares another scale which she says will be applied in the spring: a five-point scale applied to six facets: "lead in, thesis, topic sentences, development, punctuation/mechanics/spelling, and the conclusion." <p>	As the second period comes to an end, Cindy and Maria, who had spent the first hour talking, are rushing to finish their essays. The PA interrupts again--calling for Consuelo, Dale, Mary, Pedro, Jesus, Laurie, and others to come to the office. <p>	The teacher says, "The essential question is, What do you need to do in advance?" The students respond in unison, "Focus and plan." <p>	Ten minutes after the class is over, Tina finishes her essay. The teacher gives her a note admitting her late to her next class. <p><h4>English </h4>Later that day we visit another Pathways class. As we enter, twenty-eight students are lounging on or at their desks. They are ignoring another student who is reading announcements from the front of the room. The room is set up in traditional fashion, with rows of desks facing the chalkboards in the front of the room. Three adults are in the room. We learn that two are interns and one is their supervisor. On the chalkboard on one side of the room, it says: <p>	I. 	Vocab quiz<p>	II. 	Presentations<p>	III.	Journals <p>	One of the adults announces that the students have five minutes to review before the vocabulary quiz. The three adults circulate throughout the room, chatting with the kids. The kids are talking with each other, sometimes about the vocabulary words. <p>	While we are waiting for the quiz to begin, one of the adults comes over to us, explains how difficult the students in the class are, and tells us that the reason for the supervisor's presence is that the two interns had not been able to handle discipline in the class. The intern also explains that they had tried to start out with the themes for which the students had enrolled in their class but it just wasn't working, so "we've gone back to teaching the traditional parts of speech, traditional approaches to grammar, and then maybe later we can get into the themes." The adults frequently say "Quiet" and "Shhh." <p>	Finally, the students begin their vocabulary test. One of the interns reads off the words. Kids yell out for him to slow down as he moves to the second word. We can see several students' papers as the test progresses. Luis, who is identified as gifted and is therefore assigned weighted course work, quickly writes down the words and their definitions. Mary, seated nearby, writes down each word but no definitions. As the test concludes, she turns to the boy next to her, shrugs her shoulders, and says, "Shows you how much I know." <p>	After some chatter, the students shuffle desks around. Several boys begin a presentation of a scene from <cite>To Kill a Mockingbird</cite>. Tom is giving closing statements for the accused black man. Now James, as the prosecuting attorney, reads from his handwritten script. Art, acting as the judge, seems confused about the classroom procedures to follow. Tom reads from his paper. They finish. A jury of students lined up against the chalkboard indicates their decision on the case; they acquit the defendant. One of the interns leads the weak hand clapping by students for the performance. There is no discussion of this presentation.<p>	Next, Connie and Michelle come to the front of the room and are introduced by the intern. "It's about 'If Fox Could Kill,'" Connie reads from her paper. She summarizes a story about a girl who got psychic powers when she was electrocuted. Students come to the front of the room and engage in experiments which the girls say are designed to test whether they have psychic powers. They try to identify the symbols on cards which are held up for observation by the other students. Most of the time they fail. They try to guess the results of rolls of dice. Most of the time they do not guess correctly. One of the interns asks the two presenters, "Why did you start out with physics?" Michelle replies, "Not physics, psychic!"<p>	Throughout the presentation, the testing of extrasensory perceptions, and the discussion, other students pay minimal attention. However, Luis exhibits considerable interest in the psychic experiences and helps the intern connect the dice experiment to questions related to probability theory. <p>	Students then move on to journal writing. The teacher tells them, "You can address the questions on the board or do one of your own if you ask the teacher first." Ellen and Ron lean over to us and explain, "This is not a very good school because you do not learn much here." Their comment conflicts with those of the majority of students we interviewed who spoke positively about their school. However, as we reflect on the class we have just witnessed, we understand why they said what they did. <p>	Mary, who wrote no definitions for her vocabulary quiz, is making no entries in her journal. Some hand in their journals as the class ends. <p><h4>History </h4>The students move to the associated history class where Luis tells us the theme is "myths and legends, but not in the classic sense."<p>	The class begins shortly after the final buzzer, with the teacher's joking with students as he calls roll. Tom leans over and tells us, "He is the best teacher." We wait to see what happens in a class taught by someone this student thinks is the best.<p>	The teacher starts the class briskly, "OK, ready. Does everyone have a map?" Luis helps pass maps down the rows of desks to those who don't have them. "Who has homework to turn in?" A few respond. "Let's go, we're wasting time. You need three colors each." Kids run to the front desk to get markers and colored pencils. <p>	The lesson begins. "Get one color; that will represent the U.S. Start on either side and label the first map '1620-1781.' What does that date represent? Should I include Florida?" The students yell out, "No!"<p>	The teacher works this way almost the entire class period. He draws on his big map, constantly asking questions about why he is using the colors he is using. He talks them through changing territorial boundaries, through the second map and issues of slavery associated with the Dred Scott decision, through 1853, and on to the acquisition of Alaska and to the effect that had on the American territories. Students help each other informally as they seek to make their maps reflect the information the teacher has been sharing. He finishes the map work, admonishing the students: "Do we put our maps in our folders? Yes, we sleep with them. I want the map inside your head, big time." <p>	Then he moves on to his story of how Hawaii was overtaken by Western culture. The kids write furiously as he dramatizes his tale. He speaks loudly, with lots of gestures, and the kids are paying close attention. One gets the impression their attention is not caused just by his earlier reminder that the next day's quiz will be on everything: "maps, notes, story." He finishes the story of whites and missionaries in Hawaii, and students pick up papers from him as the bell rings. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tc"><h3>Traditional Classrooms</h3>Becoming familiar with the Pathways program is important because of its reputation as the center of change efforts, but students spend less than a third of their time in that program. If we are to understand what learning is like for students at Crossroads, we need to take a look at other classes as well. We sampled such classes as psychology, video, computers, geometry, biology, journalism, chemistry, AET (a small-group gifted program), drama, Spanish, and algebra. <p>	In one of these classes we saw students engaged attentively in science lab work, and in another we saw students idly chatting while a teacher arrived six minutes late for a class, snapped his fingers as if he forgot something, and left for another eight minutes. While it was unusual for teachers to leave the classroom in this fashion, teachers generally started instruction long after the final bell. In an interview, Ralph complained, "[Teachers] take twenty minutes to take roll. I could do the whole high school day in two hours." Rose told us she "missed school for two weeks and came back today and nothing had changed." <p>	We saw students wander into class at various times and leave without passes, and we saw students locked out of class for being a fraction of a minute late. Students told us that compared to last year, this year there are fewer students in the halls during instructional time and that more students come to class on time.<p>	As we visited drama classes, we witnessed students busily fulfilling their responsibilities for scenery, lighting, publicity, and costumes. The student workers were painting checkerboard squares outlined on the stage floor by their teacher. We observed the teacher explaining how he made the precise measurements needed for the checkerboard to give the audience a sense of depth. <p>	We saw teachers who had close rapport with students talking informally with a group around a table, students working independently on long-term projects, a non-English-speaking student being tutored one-on-one for an entire hour, students who had written an editorial with a carefully thought-out criticism of school discipline policy, and students demonstrating their affection for each other as they talked quietly in one corner of a classroom. We saw teachers seeking to be "buddies" of students, and teachers frustrated because their efforts to explain a difficult math problem were interrupted by lengthy PA announcements or by students leaving to participate in athletic events.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="conv"><hr><center><h2>Conversations</h2></center><hr>Besides finding out about the school by visiting classrooms, we met with students, faculty, and parents to learn how they feel about the school. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tws"><h3>Talking with Students</h3>Students see Crossroads as a good school but have their own ideas about its strengths and weaknesses. One of their complaints was of a sexist teacher who asked, "How many men does it take to clean a toilet bowl? None; that is a woman's job." Some defended him by saying he did it to stir up discussion in the classroom. Others, attacking him, said he asks for discussion and then won't let the students talk. <p>	Students were particularly vocal as they shared their feelings about cooperative learning. They tended to see Crossroads' involvement with Re:Learning and the school's philosophy of cooperative learning as the same thing. Students complained that with cooperative learning a few students do all the work, and that it is used instead of having separate gifted classes. They praised it for making learning much more interesting than listening to "a bunch of boring teacher-talk." They also expressed pride in helping others learn, and they acknowledged that they learn a lot from helping others. Those who come from junior high schools with a heavy emphasis on cooperative learning seem to adapt to it more quickly than those who come from schools which are just beginning to use it. <p>	Students acknowledged that they are given considerable freedom and responsibility but complained about dress codes and strict attendance practices. (Neither the dress codes nor the attendance policies seem to be enforced with the severity claimed by many of the students.) Many students told of being able to talk with teachers informally about matters other than school--everything from future careers to issues such as religion. <p>	Students spoke harshly of their peers. For example, Lucy called another girl a "Maybelline" and was told by Jan that she should not talk that way about another student. Lucy persisted, insisting the girl was totally "caked with make-up and hair spray." On another occasion, Pedro complained about the "outsiders" who were lazy, saying nothing could be done for them. Those who brought guns to school came only because their parents wanted them to come. Those who never did their homework also came in for criticism.<p>	While they offered such criticism, students also reminded each other not to be judgmental. Martha was particularly vehement in defending her friend who had brought a gun to school and was now facing expulsion. Several urged their peers to delay condemning a sophomore who was critically injured in a car accident on his way to school. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="twf"><h3>Talking with Faculty</h3>To ascertain where Crossroads is on the path toward becoming an exemplary Essential school instead of just another American high school, we need to examine the experiences of adults as well as those of students in the school. <p><h4>Concerns about Salaries and Budgets</h4>As we talked with teachers, we heard their frustrations. Frequently, they talked of their low salaries. While there is some dispute between them and the district administrators concerning how bad the salaries are, there is general acknowledgment that their salaries rank lower than those of teachers in many other districts in their state, which has among the lowest salaries in the country. The problem of their low salaries is exacerbated by the high cost of living in their community compared with living in the rest of the state. While they love the community and its amenities and have pride in the work they have been able to accomplish so far, many wonder, as did their former superintendent, if there might not come a time when they will say, "I'm working fourteen hours a day and what am I getting from it?" <p>	Some teachers also see themselves as poor in the materials they have available for their work. For example, one young teacher, looking for construction paper, found that another teacher was the holder of such paper--a few colors reportedly left over from an elementary school that was closed several years ago. The holder of the paper indicated to the young teacher that the school could not afford replacement supplies. The young teacher shook her head and returned to her classroom, which was equipped with a television linked to a central control unit in the school's exemplary media resource center. She did not realize that other teachers in the country would consider themselves very fortunate to have the telephone and other technology she had in her classroom. If she had been aware of it, she probably would have replied that a telephone does little good if there are not enough lines to be able to use it when you need to.<p>	The Crossroads faculty, with a handful of exceptions, believe that the central administration does nothing to help them. Although central office administrators stress their total support for the school's change efforts, many people at the school continue to doubt the sincerity of the central office's offer of external support to the faculty. <p><h4>Problems with Divisiveness</h4>We also learned about strong divisions within the faculty. People had differing views regarding the nature of these conflicts. Some said there is a clash between the coaches and the other faculty members. Some described the conflict as one between those who want change and those who are against it. Some said the conflict is between prima donnas from Pathways who received all of the attention from the original principal and the others who worked hard but received no recognition. Teachers also argued about the role of cooperative learning--some claimed it is being used as a panacea, some integrate it into their teaching as one of several instructional techniques, and still others refuse even to learn about it. <p>	In addition, teachers reported disagreement about how well Pathways is accepted by the faculty. One report concluded that 50 percent of the teachers in the Pathways program felt they could not be critical of their own program because any criticism was seen as disloyalty and that criticism could lead to loss of employment. Others suggested that as few as 10 percent of the faculty--a vocal 10 percent--are critical of the Pathways program.<p>Lack of Adequate Time and Support</h4>Another problem that faces the staff at Crossroads is a lack of time. In spite of their long hours in individual efforts, ranging from extracurricular activities to class preparation, the teachers complained of lack of time for collaboration. The faculty and administration at Crossroads are hard workers. As an assistant superintendent in the district put it, "The teachers work from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and the principal works from 5 a.m. to 12 a.m." Although the schedule gives common preparation times for some teacher teams, most teachers function more as individuals than as team members.<p>	The teachers expressed their concerns about having sufficient staff development and support at Crossroads.  The lack of continuity in the school's leadership, they said, has been a major reason they are not getting the support they need. Principals described the necessity of focusing attention on staff development, and central administrators assured us that they will do whatever is necessary to provide the teachers with the staff development that is needed. Teachers insisted, however, that they get no help with staff development from the central administration.<p>	Panasonic-supported retreats, the Re:Learning-sponsored Trek, and five-week-long sessions on cooperative learning stand out as extended efforts the school does make toward staff development. However, when asked what kind of help is needed, teachers and administrators spoke in terms of short workshops by outside consultants. They did not say the faculty needs to engage in sustained inquiry regarding instructional issues. <p>The Governing Council: A Sign of Progress</h4>One area in which the faculty said they see progress, however, is in the work of the Governing Council. As the Governing Council begins its fourth year, the faculty, students, and parent who participate in it have established grievance procedures otherwise lacking in this nonunion setting. They have assumed responsibility for a variety of operational decisions, ranging from the overseeing of finances to the scheduling of the student day and of special assemblies. Recently, for example, the issue of block scheduling for classes other than Pathways came before the Council. The Council referred it to the faculty for more discussion, with action slated for later in the year. In addition, a district policy, providing a framework for site-based management within which the Governing Council can operate, has begun to evolve. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="twp"><h3>Talking with Parents</h3>The parents had both praise and criticism for Crossroads. Parents who are knowledgeable about the Re:Learning initiative go through the interzone transfer processes to get their students in Crossroads. On the other hand, some parents with gifted children withdraw their students and enter them in Main High School, the original high school in the community, in order to place them in enriched classes. Some parents with kids who are "at risk" expressed worry that their children do not get enough attention. Other parents with such children have little communication with the school. One parent praised teachers for engaging students in challenging assignments such as a debate over the virtues of <cite>Plessy v. Ferguson</cite>. Another questioned whether the teachers follow through when they address complex issues such as censorship. They also saw some teachers who have not been modeling the kinds of adult behavior they think is appropriate. They cited as an example a teacher who wandered around during student registration in shorts with his underwear showing. But parents also mentioned teachers who have been trying hard and who have demonstrated sincere concern for their children. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="roov"><hr><center><h2>Reflections on Our Visit</h2></center><hr>After this first visit to Crossroads, we wonder how a number of issues will play out as the school continues its reform efforts. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="qftf"><h3>Questions for the Future</h3>Our observations of classes and our talks with the students left us with questions for the future.  <p>From Classroom Visits and Conversations with Students </h4><ol>	<li>Will Crossroads be a school which stresses academic success for <cite>all </cite>students? <p>	Or, will it be a school that caters to the gifted students by creating a gifted program for ten students and focusing much of its attention in other classes on weighted exercises for these talented students?<p>	<li>Will the students be expected to use their minds well, as have those in the Pathways program who tackled <cite>Antigone </cite>and <cite>Oedipus Rex</cite>, or those in chemistry who were working on difficult lab exercises? <p>	Or, will the students get by with Exhibitions that are term essays based merely on seeing some films about literary works and gleaning notes from the few students who did read the material?<p>	<li>Will the principle of "Less is more" prevail as teachers try to implement it through attention to the major themes in the Pathways humanities program? <p>	Or, will the expansion of schooltime contests, broad-based elective course offerings, and the expansion of social services to meet the urgent needs of the students turn the idea on its head, making it, truly, "more is less"? <p>	<li>Will the students be the workers as they address complex issues in the Pathways program, create highly successful dramatic productions, craft individual and group projects in industrial arts, and perform with winning athletic records? <p>	Or, will the students complete trivial, teacher-prescribed tasks, emphasize sports over academics, put more energy into driving to lunch than solving problems in class, and permit a limited number within cooperative groups to do the real learning?<p>	<li>Will classes be characterized by creatively designed lessons that involve students actively in their learning? Will students debate the conclusions of Supreme Court decisions, put themselves in the shoes of immigrants to this country, and seek to solve complex mathematics equations? <p>	Or, will students shuffle from period to period, wandering in late, waiting for as much as half the period before the teacher completes required personal paperwork and begins some form of organized instruction? <p>	<li>Will pervasive caring about students and personalization of instruction persist? <p>	Or, will rules and threats be the basic method of keeping the students under control?<p></ul>From Our Talks with Faculty and Parents</h4><ul>	<li>Will the nine Common Principles become the guiding goals of the school as they have been adopted by the Governing Council? <p>	Or, will the teachers and administration continue to exhibit the superficial knowledge of these principles revealed by classroom instruction and responses during interviews?<p>	<li>Will teachers, parents, and administrators find a common vision of what is Essential in the program and how learning should be facilitated? <p>	Or, will various groups persist in slinging mud at each other? <p>	<li>Will "traditionalists" continue to be criticized for their unwillingness to try new approaches? <p>	<li>Will Pathways teachers continue to be belittled for de-emphasizing subject matter and for not preparing individual students to perform in the way higher education demands? <p>	<li>Will innovators be attacked for participating in activities away from the school? Will they spend so much time away that they are unable to plan and carry out instruction with the continuity that is needed?<p>	<li>Will the Pathways program continue to carry the burden of developing innovation? Will the school, as one central administrator suggested, "continue to hang its hat on Pathways"? <p>	Or, will academic areas such as mathematics and science join in the effort? <p>	<li>Will the proposal to increase block scheduling take hold? Will the change effort become schoolwide?<p>	<li>Will the school's Governing Council be given sufficient room to make significant instructional decisions by the central and school administration?

A lack of adequate financial resources has caused many problems for the school.<p>	One of the results of inadequate funding is problems with the school's physical facility. Constraints on school financing have recently led to contracting out custodial services for half of the school--a practice which the principal and the faculty have found to be unsatisfactory. They insisted that the signs of wear now evident at the new school were not present before the advent of the cleaning service. Groups of students clustered around entry ways prior to the start of school, standing on dirt where grass might soften the appearance of the school. The telephone in the faculty room had no handset for a month during the fall of 1991. Walls are beginning to show the need for a new coat of paint; hallways need cleaning. <p>	Not only are the students from low-income homes, the teachers and others in the school perceive themselves as poor in that they receive salaries below state average in a state that is below the national average. Such salaries make it hard for them to deal with the high cost of living in their community; they have difficulty buying homes in their city, whose housing costs are much above the state average.<p>	Some parents, administrators, and teachers expressed both concern and resentment about extraordinary amounts of absenteeism by Crossroads teachers who engage in Re:Learning activities. Administrators, teachers, and parents offered widely different claims concerning the extent of absenteeism for individuals. Some insisted that no one was absent more than fifteen days; others claimed to have seen documents showing that several of these teacher-leaders missed as many as seventy-five days during 1990-91. A central office investigation of this absenteeism recognized that parents and fellow faculty members had strong concerns but reported that the high-end estimates could not be confirmed from school records. <p>	In spite of the fact that shared decision making was initiated by means of the Governing Council when Crossroads first opened three-and-a-half years ago, this decision-making process is still a matter of some dispute in the school--a point made by the principal and several of the teachers, including the Governing Council chair. The latter indicated that she had received phone threats and that other teachers who were trying to promote change had received threatening messages in their mailboxes. She said this is a positive sign that the change efforts supported by the Council are being recognized as making a difference. Whether it is really positive or is an indication of deep and unhealthy divisions within the school remains to be seen. <p>	A central problem that Crossroads faces is one of vision. Just as the architecture seems to be a mixture of different, if not contradictory, designs, the staff struggle to find a clear vision for their instructional program. Is less more, or is the school a "shopping mall high school"? The school goals stress the importance of dealing with essential questions. However, the course catalog reads like that of a small college, with such diverse offerings as "Clothing for Athletes," "Calculus AP," "Political Science/Street Law," and "Teen Issues" included in its 201 listings. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wdtf"><h3>What does the Future Hold?</h3>In the face of these problems and incongruities at Crossroads, one is not certain which direction the school will take. How will divisiveness within the faculty over program approaches and personal leadership styles be resolved? How will concern by parents and faculty over the perceived absence of a program for gifted students and the desire to eradicate tracking be reconciled? How will leadership help chart the course of this young school, given the high turnover by key district and school personnel? The staff expressed strong commitment to caring for individual students. How will they come to grips with serving the urgent needs of their student population?<p>	Crossroads High School seems poised between the heights of success as an Essential school and the depths of mediocrity which characterize so many American high schools.<p>	When asked where Crossroads is on a continuum toward becoming an Essential school, most associated with the school said they think it is 40 to 50 percent of the way there. Using different metaphors, they described the school as being at a critical point on the path toward eventual success: a point between implementing the ideals espoused in their student handbook or falling back to the conventional features of high school life from which they fled to come to Crossroads.<p>	Crossroads began with a great deal of excitement among its leaders and teachers. When the school first opened, the principal was joined by teachers from well-established Main High School with a new vision for what the school could become, as well as by some whose reasons for coming to the new school were not as clear. He worked for a year prior to the opening of the school, selecting his staff and facilitating the planning activities. Nevertheless, at least one teacher described the first year as disorganized, with lack of attention having been given to planning such activities as student registration.<p>	Still, as one of the district's administrators noted, "Crossroads began with teachers who were excited about being there, excited about changing the status quo." That their vision was never shared by the whole faculty, and that the principal struggled to find a leadership style that would unite the school, appear to be two of the conditions leading to the current state of affairs at Crossroads. As one school district administrator noted, Crossroads is a "school which has gone through a lot of growth and pain." This growth and pain continue. <p>	A sign of progress for Crossroads reported by the state's Re:Learning coordinator is that one of the critical elements needed to support restructuring is finally in place. As a result of recent actions by the state, Crossroads will now have more say in spending. No longer will 80 percent of its instructional materials have to come from state-approved lists. Furthermore, the school will have assistance in obtaining waivers of restrictive state policies.<p> 	The school also reported progress in its efforts to integrate the nine Common Principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools in every academic area. We learn of these efforts from its 1990-91 school year report, "Documenting Restructuring and Change." <p><blockquote>Four members of the science department have been trained in cooperative learning. Spanish teachers worked during the summer of 1990 to restructure their curriculum. The mathematics department has created a model for presenting the mathematics curriculum based on ideas of essentiality and demonstration. Coaching and problem solving are emphasized in the art department. Art teachers have also been involved in interdisciplinary projects with the English department. Lab classes in home economics require students to exhibit what they learn by producing a variety of products. </blockquote>	Teachers and administrators have worked hard to achieve the progress in reform during the past three years. Few schools in the country have been able to create multi-aged, heterogenous classes around interdisciplinary themes. Few schools have adopted the ambitious goals for schoolwide reform reflected in Crossroads' mission statement. Few schools have risked the close examination of practices which this study involves. The difficult challenges which still face the school should in no way be taken as disparaging the gains made to date.<p>	Crossroads faces competing possibilities. What will be the nature of the school which emerges? The school we have visited is truly at a crossroads. The nine Common Principles are clearly identified as the school's goals yet are not well understood by all staff. One segment of the school, the Pathways program, has been identified as a focus for change; but there are differences among the people in it, and it has a long way to go to meet its ambitious goals. Moreover, the strategies for spreading change to the entire school are not yet apparent. The school will have a difficult time sustaining change in the midst of high turnover of personnel and divisiveness within the faculty.<p>	The questions we have posed concerning students and adults highlight the different directions the school may take. How such questions are answered will determine what happens to students of Crossroads in the years ahead. The students' enthusiasm and vitality hearten us. In spite of the magnitude of the challenges facing the school, these students and the many teachers who demonstrate dedication and commitment leave us encouraged that Crossroads will choose the directions which will assure that all kids receive an academically challenging education in a caring environment.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><h3>Notes</h3><ol><li> Re:Learning is a school restructuring initiative involving the Education Commission of the States, the Coalition of Essential Schools at Brown University, and fourteen states, regions, and districts.

We were interested in finding out what it is like to learn and to teach in a school undergoing whole-school change.<p>	Located at the edge of a culturally rich southwestern city, Crossroads is a middle-size high school with eleven hundred students. For the most part, its students come from the town's low-income population. Seventy percent are Hispanic and 3 percent are from other minority groups. Crossroads has many features of a traditional high school: a normal schedule of six fifty-five-minute periods a day, a wide range of extracurricular activities and support services, and a strong athletics program. According to the students at Crossroads, school spirit and sports are its finest features. <p><h4>Crossroads' Innovative Features</h4>In addition to its traditional features, Crossroads has some innovative characteristics. One of these is the Pathways program, a multi-age, interdisciplinary humanities program in which all ninth,- tenth-, and eleventh-grade students enroll. Pathways teachers use common themes drawn from world and American history to link history and English. The Pathways class is blocked so that students may have a longer time with one or both of their Pathways teachers. A second innovative feature is the Governing Council. Led by a teacher, the Council involves teachers, a parent, students, and administrators in critical decisions. In the summer before Crossroads opened, faculty attended a week-long training session in shared decision-making practices, run by the Panasonic Foundation, so that the Governing Council could begin to function when the school opened. <p>	In addition to these two features, Crossroads has been committed to innovation since its creation through its connection with the Coalition of Essential Schools and Re:Learning, a partnership between the Coalition of Essential Schools and the Education Commission of the States. Re:Learning provides Crossroads with funding and support for Essential school reform. When it joined the Coalition, Crossroads made a commitment to use the nine Common Principles as guideposts for improving student learning. (See Appendix B for a list of the Principles.)<p><h4>Crossroads' Competing Possibilities</h4>We gave the school its pseudonym of "Crossroads" because of the contradictions and competing possibilities we observed during our first visit in fall 1991. We understood that Crossroads had made a great deal of progress in its first three years as a school because its staff had worked very hard.<p>	During our first visit we saw a new principal seeking to understand the school and to gain the support of the actors in it. On the other hand, we saw that Crossroads was faced with serious challenges. We saw dedicated professionals working without adequate funding for either their salaries or the instructional materials and equipment they needed. We saw the creative Pathways program, designed with interdisciplinary, multi-aged groupings of students, being implemented by teams of teachers whose instruction was mainly traditional. We saw a school with innovative decision-making structures which was deeply divided--one where individuals claimed colleagues had threatened them because of their participation in change efforts.<p>	Official statements of goals at Crossroads and actions of teachers and administrators appeared to be at odds with each other. For example, we saw expressions of caring about students offset by adults' actions that clearly ignored student problems.<p>	At the conclusion of this visit, we recorded what we saw and heard, shared the case study which summarized our understanding, and read the statements by faculty at Crossroads who agreed and disagreed with our perceptions. <p>	After our first visit to Crossroads, we were filled with more questions than when our team arrived to begin our three-year study.1 When we approached the school in the spring for our second visit, we were particularly curious to see how, if at all, the school had changed since the fall. To find out about Crossroads' progress and problems, we had conversations with students, teachers, administrators, and parents, and we visited in some classes. We hope the following "snapshot," based mainly on the conversations we had during our visit, will reflect what Crossroads was like at the time we visited for the people who learn and teach there.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="conv"><hr><center><h2>Conversations</h2></center><hr>When we came for our second visit, we met with students, faculty, administrators, and parents, to learn about Crossroads from their perspective.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="p:tpo"><H3>Progress: The Product of Consensus</h3>We asked the students, "What has changed?" and they said:<p>	"The tardy policy has changed. If you are late you either go to the cafeteria or you're suspended." <p>	"If you're tardy, you go to the cafeteria, and if you don't have an excuse, then it is an inexcused absence because you can't go to class. If you get nine, then you're kicked out of school." <p>	"Nothing much has changed except the tardy policy. It only affects my fifth-period class."<p><blockquote>With our new tardy policy, we are sent to the cafeteria if we are late. The teachers sweep the halls. You have to have a pass to be in the halls for any reason. First they call your parents, and then, if it happens again, you get suspended.</blockquote>	"They just did it one day and there were 250 kids in the cafeteria. The halls are clear and there is less noise. Classes start on time."<p>	One student commented on the value of the new policy by asking a rhetorical question: "Why be the first one to class, if you have to hear instructions more than once?" In other words, under the previous conditions, when students loitered in the halls after the tardy bell, late students could count on teachers to repeat instructions for them.<p>	Not all student voices were as positive about the changed tardy policy. One curled her lip and asked, "What do you 'sweep?'" After a brief pause for effect, she answered her own question: "Dirt!" Another suggested that "people are leaving school because of this [tardy policy]."<p>	Still, most commented positively about the policy--even many of those who also criticized it. For example, one student said, "Not all of the students feel negative about the new policy because we have seen the effect. It has changed the school from a hangout to a place where kids expect to learn."<p>	We asked the teachers, "What has changed?" and they said: <p><blockquote>We have a new tardy policy, and I guess that's the first time in a long time where I felt the faculty really voiced their concerns, and the administration tried to follow through on something that we worked through together and suggested as a change in policy.</blockquote><blockquote>Teachers are talking more with each other because of the policy, because of the duties we now have. . . . The administration has been participating; they have been committing themselves to this too. This is really good for morale. This one rule has permeated so much of the school.</blockquote><blockquote>I think that student and faculty morale has changed. We seem to have a better grip on things, the principal seems to have a better grip on management issues, discipline, a better grasp of what is going on. The tardy policy is great; I'm sure that it's sending really positive messages to the kids about us caring and also meaning what we say.</blockquote><blockquote>The [tardy] policy has been here for a long time. The first day we just enforced it. I don't think [the students] can object because the policy was already in place. It was meant to display and demonstrate what the consequences would be.</blockquote><blockquote>I am a big fan of challenging people and using discipline to do it, but I would not have guessed that a policy I felt was overly strict to students would yield the results we have gotten. <cite>Rah </cite>for an accident!</blockquote><blockquote>Our kids go to class on time and this has changed the tone of the school. We used to spend a lot of energy tracking a kid.</blockquote><blockquote>The school has gotten in better shape, it is cleaner. Our collective self-image is better. . . . Now that we have the sweeps, we are more cooperative.</blockquote><blockquote>There is a civility among the teachers, and students say things are calmer. This is all due to something relatively trivial [the new tardy policy] that caused a big stink, yet when solved, it had a positive impact and the stink went away. The amount of graffiti was reduced and courtesy broke out.</blockquote>	We asked the administration, "What has changed?" and they said:<p><blockquote>We have implemented a new tardy policy. . . . It has really made a difference. There are very few students around without a pass. This is what the teachers wanted. They said this was their biggest concern. Some of the students thought we were unfair in the beginning, but most have come around.</blockquote><blockquote>Teachers say this has changed what does go on in the classroom. Classes aren't as disrupted, kids seem more attentive and ready to go when class starts on time. So, it's a major change.</blockquote>	We asked, "What happens to students sent to the cafeteria?" The administrator explained:<p><blockquote>For the first two weeks we sent students to the cafeteria and kept them there. Then, we had a meeting after school for a couple of hours and a committee stayed for another two hours hammering out procedure--on the first occasion, tardy students would be warned and sent to the cafeteria. There an administrator could go in and decide if the student had a valid excuse such as an illness or a doctor's appointment.</blockquote><blockquote>At the beginning we had several complaints. . . . We had one parent call the fire marshal and complain that we were locking students in class. The fire marshal came and we explained. [The fire marshals] checked classes and saw we were in compliance with the code.</blockquote><blockquote>We notify parents on the second infraction by a student, then suspend for a day if there is another one. Now parent reaction has settled down.</blockquote>	Another administrator commented, <p><blockquote>We have a new tardy policy and as a result the school is cleaner, vandalism is down 100 percent, and the parking lot is clear. Commodes are no longer plugged and there is no graffiti. Visitors have even asked if we are in session! This is a dramatic improvement.</blockquote><h4>Observed Changes at Crossroads</h4>Our own observations correspond to these administrative comments. Students were not in the hallways during class periods and the school was cleaner.<p>	An administrator told us the new policy was having a direct effect on instruction: "Teachers are starting on time. Interruptions are limited or rare and so students are on track for fifty minutes. . . . Teachers are so pleased that this one thing has made a change in climate."<p>	Again, our observations tended to confirm these administrative comments. Minutes after we arrived in both the band and choral classes on three different occasions, students were energetically on task. Students in a science classroom arrived and, while roll was being taken, began to obtain the grasshoppers they would be dissecting. Students in an advanced placement science class began collaborating with their teacher as they tackled difficult problems from their text shortly after the period began.<p>	Another class met and dived into a favorite poem of a teacher which was used to help students consider symbolism, allusions, rhyme, and figurative language. Several classes started quickly with teachers asking students to take out homework from the previous day. A class, which in the fall had begun twenty minutes into the period as students wandered in, started on time with one late student turned away for lack of a pass. Even on April 1, a science teacher with a sense of humor instructed the students, just as the tardy bell rang, to "get out paper and number it one to ten," and then, before panic set in, assured them it was an "April Fool's" comment and launched into a preview of the day's activities.<p><h4>The Response from the Central Office</h4>In a few instances, lack of purposeful activity still dominated the first part of the class period. Students chatted idly, and teachers engaged in extended conversations with classes and students about matters apparently unrelated to the subject or to the interests of students.<p>	Central office administrators were also aware of the changed policy that has become the center of attention at the school. One commented,<p><blockquote>The first day, I think, they had a sweep of about four hundred students who were tardy, and the last sweep that I heard about they had two. So obviously they're doing something right. The teachers were also very concerned that we were not going to support them in that change. And I told [the principal], I said, I will support you because this is important. . . .</blockquote><blockquote>And so I did have some parents call to complain and told them, you know, we are trying to make the students responsible. . . . We're not going to be unfair to the kids; if they have some legitimate excuse, we're going to listen. </blockquote><blockquote>But we did get some parents complaining that they thought it was too severe. Oh, and we had one who turned us in to the fire department because we were locking the kids up. . . . You know, you're never locked in. And that's what the fire department looked at. And I tried to explain it to the parent, and he was just furious because his daughter had been caught. . . . And then I explained to him that if the kids aren't in class they can't learn and he seemed to be happy with that answer--after about forty-five minutes.</blockquote>	Another central administrator saw the tardy procedure as evidence that the principal recognized the need to create "teammanship" and get the entire faculty working together on details of student behavior problems.<p>	Central administrators also spoke of the positive article in the local paper about the principal at Crossroads. The article had described the sweep as an example of the new principal's finding his "voice" as a result of analyzing the needs of the school. These central administrators were pleased with the evidence of collaborative leadership the paper reported.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="oop"><H3>Origins of Progress: How Consensus Was Built</h3>The tardy policy, which seemed to be the focus of everyone's attention, is a simple, one-page statement consisting of three parts: procedure, teacher responsibilities, and student responsibilities. We asked how the new policy was created.<p>	One teacher said, "We were all getting fed up." Another joined in with the observation: "We had an in-service and it emerged there."<p>	Still another described how he and a fellow teacher took it on themselves to begin stopping kids for hall passes: <p><blockquote>We counted 166 kids in the halls--a combination of kids not going to class, getting out early. I confronted forty-eight kids coming toward me and stopped them. They didn't have a pass. So, they started avoiding our hallway. We locked everyone out--cheerleaders, football players, it didn't matter.</blockquote>	One teacher, explaining another origin of the policy, observed, "Some teachers went to Baltimore and reported what they saw. Every kid had a hall pass and the doors were locked." However there is evidence that the visit to Baltimore was not the first time faculty were aware of this approach.<p>	Another teacher commented, "Personally I couldn't be happier with this policy. . . . We wanted to implement this same policy two years ago but . . . our old principal was against it. I really must let him know how well it works!"<p>	Apparently, the earlier proposal had been one of several "tough love" approaches to discipline that had been suggested but then rejected, even though it had been supported by a teacher who had experienced it at her former school. <p>	We asked an administrator, "Who initiated the change?" He responded,<p><blockquote>Teachers did. We were at in-service and teachers kept complaining and they came up with the idea of not allowing students to enter and that is the way it came about. At that time I didn't think it would work because some would not follow that procedure, but they proved me wrong.</blockquote>	Another administrator offered still another version of the origin of the change, telling us, "The tardy policy came as a result of the snapshot [the first case study in this series]. The snapshot showed that teachers were being inconsistent."<p>	Observing that there seemed to be more agreement on the implementation of this new policy than on some other issues in the school, we asked an administrator, "Why the consistency on this one?" He responded, "[The teachers] were mad. It was an open discussion. Teachers challenging each other to be united. . . . Teachers are beginning to trust [the principal]; if he says he will support them, they know he will support them."<p>	Some students viewed the beginning of the changed approach to tardiness differently from most of the adults in the school. "They just sprang it on us," said a junior. A sophomore commented, "They subjected us to it without warning or without our say in it." While students generally were positive about the effects of the policy, it was common to hear them say, as one student did, "I didn't appreciate the way it was implemented."<p>	This student view had some support from teachers. One teacher, responding to our general question about change, said:  <p><blockquote>[There is now] a fairly high degree of faculty involvement. For example, the new policy concerning students coming to class late seems to be working well even though it was initiated in an underhanded and inappropriate way by beginning on Monday without telling [the students] about the new policy. As a faculty we decided that this advanced warning wasn't needed. If kids had been told, it would have been better. Trust will be higher if you tell people in advance. It was unfortunate we resorted to such tactics, but it is working. It is going backwards in some ways, but it is nice not to have kids walking into class late.</blockquote>	After the policy had been in place for a while, students were invited to a meeting to share their views about it. Teachers and administrators offered various versions of that meeting. Some suggested that the involvement of students was not ideal:<p><blockquote>When we had a discussion with some of the students, a student said something and was attacked. It was embarrassing when a teacher yelled, "Bullshit!" at one boy. After we had done the sweep for a week, teachers gave the students a bad time. We are all teachers and we are supposed to draw from students--at least be courteous. We attacked this ninth-grader. If I had not brought the student into a conversation, [the other teachers] would have just ignored him. Another student I was concerned about felt we were more concerned about the affairs of teachers and administrators than of students.2</blockquote>	Disagreements over the meeting with students led to some name-calling among teachers. Another teacher, commenting about the follow-up to the decision, said: <p><blockquote>Some of us were upset that some of the students were warned ahead of time by a few of the faculty--they made phone calls over the weekend before the plan was implemented on Monday morning--and so a few kids knew about it, but most didn't. It doesn't seem fair to a lot of us that some faculty would abuse this agreed-upon procedure like this. We are getting tired of the coaches who seem to run everything here, and who always seem to get it their way. It's just not fair to a lot of us or to a lot of the kids.</blockquote>	Several staff members disputed the charge that it was the coaches who called students. In spite of such differences, most adults were positive about the new policy as an example of their ability to reach and hold on to a consensus. Even students were not universal in their condemnation of the process and were generally positive in their reaction to its outcomes. As one student commented, <p><blockquote>I didn't appreciate the way it was implemented, but attitudes have changed. . . . It used to be anarchy in the halls. Even people who wanted to learn, couldn't. Now with the policies, it has been more positive for everyone.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="lop"><H3>Lack of Progress: Problems in Gaining Consensus</h3>While the tardy policy dominated many of our conversations, it was not the only issue people at Crossroads faced between our visits. During the planning for the school, three years earlier, teachers and administrators spent much time talking about alternative schedules for instructional time. The Pathways program's two-period block was, in part, a product of these early discussions. Since then, some individuals in other departments have been seeking opportunities to have extended periods. When we first visited the school in the fall of 1991, the Governing Council was considering a policy on block scheduling. When we returned in the spring, confusion reigned concerning that proposal.<p><h4>Decision Making Regarding the Block Schedule</h4>Prior to our spring 1992 visit, a faculty discussion about block scheduling had ended in a vote which supported the proposal to change, with sixteen faculty opposing and forty-seven endorsing the proposal. One view was that those who opposed it were the coaches who were afraid of losing their last period PE classes (during which turnouts began for a number of sports.)<p>	One teacher indicated that what had bothered him most about the decision was the way in which the principal handled the issue. This teacher complained,<p><blockquote>As a faculty we voted . . . and I was so excited, because this is what I have been waiting and working for now for four years. But . . . the majority of the sixteen . . . voted against this because it would interrupt their last period of the day. . . . And so here we have most of the faculty who want to try this, and now the administration says we are going to wait. . . . The teacher who was chair of the committee to investigate this whole thing feels that we have just been railroaded. We've even suggested that a few of us be allowed to try the block scheduling if we want. </blockquote><blockquote>But now the administration is taking the position that there are teachers who can't even teach for one hour, so how could they do two in a row? So, they are now saying that we have to address issues of faculty incompetence first, before we can move ahead.</blockquote><blockquote>First of all, I find it disgusting that they would talk publicly about faculty like that. I'm not saying that maybe some faculty don't have problems, but these are things that should be addressed in evaluations, in-services, staff development plans for the individuals involved. Isn't this why we would want to move to peer coaching, or something like that, as part of our Coalition effort? So here they use the faculty again--like it's our fault that we can't move ahead on a Coalition-like thing such as block scheduling to allow us to do more integrated teaching.</blockquote>	Concerning the outcome of this discussion of block scheduling, a teacher noted,<p><blockquote>I was excited when the faculty could talk and agree on the tardy policy--it felt like it was the first action we had taken since we opened where we really had a voice. But now, with the block scheduling being blocked, I have real serious questions about our leadership. I just don't know how they can justify ignoring the majority wishes.</blockquote>	Another side of this issue is revealed by the teacher who told us,<p><blockquote>I have great respect for [the principal]. He's not flashy, but effective. I like his kind of leadership. . . . [For example, the staff was investigating the possibility of creating math and science blocks that would take two hours.] I felt that this would disassemble the school, because not all teachers were on board. In the end, [the principal] made the decision not to go forward with the idea. I like that kind of leadership. I hope I'm as happy if I don't win, but I didn't feel that I had to argue as much.</blockquote><h4>Disagreements Concerning the Block Schedule</h4>Some comments about this issue tend to turn the discussion of the block schedule into a dispute about whether the principal was right or wrong in refusing to allow the change in schedule. Others point out that it is more complex than that. They call attention to the problems of scheduling assignments for part-time teachers who also teach at other schools and for teachers whose only teaching contract is for the last period of the day. Moreover, comments from various teachers leave an unclear picture of the extent to which alternative approaches to gaining extended instructional time were debated.<p>	Generally speaking, faculty expressed confusion concerning the status of the block scheduling proposal. Frequently their conversations revealed a win-lose approach to the question rather than a searching for agreement. In a focus group, teachers conversed about the faculty's earlier discussion of block scheduling:<p>	"I was deeply depressed after the last in-service."<p>	We asked why.<p>	The teacher replied, "Something about having had to participate in it made me feel bad. I had real vague, unpleasant feelings when [the principal] said he will not consider the block schedule."<p>	Another commented, "Sounded like we were catering to the incompetent."<p>	The conversation continued with various people chiming in:<p>Herb:<blockquote> Yeah, he made that clear when he said he had sixteen who could not teach for two hours.</blockquote>Alice:<blockquote> What they should do is help those teachers, not make all of us conform.</blockquote>Allen:<blockquote> We are doing tardy sweeps because there are people who do not get started.</blockquote>Alice:<blockquote> Yeah, but the tardy sweep has changed the tone . . .; it is cleaner and quieter. . . . I do not have to do battle to get class underway.</blockquote>Allen:<blockquote> You start your class. I get mine going right away.</blockquote>Herb:<blockquote> You have to change the way you think--[the principal] is saying some teachers cannot handle students for thirty minutes--but they are handling the same kids for all day in the same amount of kid-contact time.</blockquote>	"So," we asked, "the solution is to get rid of the incompetent teachers?" And Herb said,<p><blockquote>Well, eventually. The other thing mentioned is peer pressure--using it to confront them. As I keep hearing that, it makes me concoct scenarios in my mind. We need to be spending more time in each other's classrooms.</blockquote>	During another interview a teacher said,<p><blockquote>I think that the block scheduling will be an issue for a long time. Some teachers can't keep a class busy for fifty-five minutes. But I would welcome the opportunity for a longer period. I think right now the problem is people are magnifying it--we either have it or we don't. They're making a mountain out of a molehill. We always have two factions, it seems. So why can't we just try it for a while?</blockquote>	Apparently lobbied by some of their teachers to support their point of view, students have been drawn into the discussion of blocking. For example, one girl remarked: <p><blockquote>Math is the only one stopping [the block scheduling proposal]. Others may be doing it, but they are not being stubborn. . . . [The teacher] thinks that the only ones who can affect the administration is the kids, because parents and teachers have already talked to him about this plan.</blockquote>	Some students had their own views concerning the proposed schedule with longer periods. With regard to the schedule, which she understood would mean three classes a day, every day except Friday, one girl said, "I don't know what's going on. I think that this would be good for some classes but for others I don't even want to <cite>dream </cite>about being there for two hours!"<p>	Other students told us of their teachers' complaints about the decision not to use a block schedule. One noted that his teacher had "been working four years for things that need to be done and still there are no changes." Another told us, "I have a lot of teachers who disagree with my others . . ."<p>	Administrators and teachers shared with us their different understandings of the current status of the discussion. Administrators indicated there would be more conversations during the remainder of the spring and that there would be opportunities for piloting. Some teachers said the item had been killed permanently. Others said it had been killed for this year and that they had been told they could not take it up again until next year.<p><h4>The Problem of Dissensus</h4>However, neither agreement or disagreement about the block schedule, nor recruitment of support from students in the debate, nor even common understanding about the status of the discussion seems to be the main issue here. Whereas the tardy policy revealed a school united and making headway because of its unity, the deliberations concerning block scheduling revealed a school unable to make progress because of dissensus. While the discussion of the tardy policy seemed to rely on information, including models from other locales, the consideration of block scheduling seemed mired in name-calling and in the maneuvering of different interest groups within the school. While students, administration, faculty, and central administration shared a generally common understanding of the tardy policy, there were as many different views concerning block scheduling as there were people interviewed.<p>	Disagreement among members of a faculty is not bad. Without differences of opinion, no one will be introduced to new ideas or helped to examine alternatives as efforts are made to solve problems. The ability to achieve coherence in the instructional program rests in reaching sufficient consensus among the actors in the school to keep them headed in roughly the same direction. Consensus becomes most powerful when reflected in the daily life of the classroom. Such consensus seems particularly needed in a school which takes pride in its Pathways teaching teams, which focus on agreed-upon essential questions.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="p:pap"><H3>Pathways: Progress and Problems in Seeking Consensus on Program</h3>Ninth-, tenth- and eleventh-grade students enroll in Pathways classes for their English and social studies credits. Each Pathways team of four teachers uses a common theme for organizing instruction for a year.<p>	During this visit some students described Pathways classes as great and told of "writing bills," "doing rallies," "studying a Greek tragedy by proving one of the characters was a tragic hero," "teaching ourselves," "doing battle plans," "making handouts for a topic we had researched," and "writing a screenplay and publishing it." One student told of having "just finished a mock trial" based on <cite>Twelve Angry Men</cite>.<p>	Another student described the extensive research he had done in order to prepare to participate in a student congress. In contrast, his friend, commenting on a bill she was supposed to have researched for her congress (with a different group of teachers), explained as follows the basis for her bill: <p><blockquote>I'm taking a wild guess. It's based on nothing, really. I don't have time to do research. Our teacher said to pretend to know what we are talking about. I'm to get a firm estimate off the top of my head. Ms. Saxon gave me a cost figure of $100,000, and I have no idea how she came up with that, but I'm going to use it.</blockquote>	A member of our team, watching Ms. Saxon in action, confirmed this student's description of the expectation for research and noted the contrast between that teacher and several of the other members of the same Pathways team. We conclude that in Pathways classes, students will interact, research questions, or listen and learn depending on the teachers. There is no common agreement among all of the teachers of the program about how they will approach learning.<p>	One student described her experiences in a class where she was involved in making posters and speeches for a rally; another student commented, "I've never done anything like that." A third student said simply, "Things depend on the teacher."<p>	Teachers are aware of these discrepancies. One teacher told us:<p><blockquote>There are not enough group meetings. I just see how I've grown; my program has changed and been fine-tuned. . . . There needs to be more time for Pathways people to talk. . . . Sometimes I feel overwhelmed that we should be doing more than cooperative learning. We need more time to talk about changes. I see some people getting slack. Some people have fallen away. . . . We don't have meetings to know what works and what's wrong and [to find out] about other people's programs. Last year we did team and self-evaluations, but we're not doing that this year. When we meet, it is a frantic <cite>zap, zap, zap </cite>and nothing is accomplished.</blockquote><h4>Students' Concerns about Competencies</h4>Consider the following conversation between Yancy and Olga. Yancy raised the question of whether Pathways is addressing the notion of competencies. Olga responded to this by saying that she felt teachers vacillated on the essential questions they were using to organize instruction: "The biggest joke of all is when the students register. You can see the teachers waving back and forth on themes and how they address world history, etc." In short, Olga contended, teachers are more worried about their popularity than about the issues on which they focus. <p>	This worried Yancy, who reminded Olga, "The origins of Pathways was based on the notion of competencies and opening the gates for them as they progressed through the competencies. Where has that notion gone?"<p>Olga:<blockquote> And when I brought that [original concept of Pathways] up to the other Pathways members, I got a lot of flack. They said I was going back to the traditional stuff. . . . There's no coordination, just arbitrary decisions about themes . . . the whole year. They are thinking that we are trying to bring back the traditional stuff, but we are just concerned about these issues. I don't think that as a staff body we have been addressing the "essential questions" or "less is more" at all.</blockquote>Yancy:<blockquote> But I think I see lots more of "student as worker" and "teacher as coach" here than in any other place I've been. When they come into the MRC [media resource center], I see "student as worker." I say it happens a lot. But there are teachers who don't come as much, and maybe they aren't doing as much of "student as worker." It's happening much more through Pathways than any place else here.</blockquote>	Similar conversations took place among members of another Pathways team. Conversations within this group revealed concerns and differences about the extent to which the Pathways program should be inclusive for all students (as opposed to being tracked), the extent to which teachers should become close to students, and the specific methodologies they should use in their teaching.<p>	Roger, a long-time leader in the program, said, "There is no time to share with the other Pathways teachers. I feel ill at ease. If we could move across the themes, that would be good."<p>	Milieu commented, "We do need to coordinate vertically. There is no assurance that there won't be repetition in materials or skills." Yet, at other times Milieu has made it clear that what she wants to do is shut the door and teach the way she wants to without any need to coordinate with others.<p>	Such conversations are about matters which must be addressed if schools are to grow in their ability to educate. Unfortunately, the conversations also provide evidence that such dialogue is not characteristic of the daily life of Crossroads. When conversations do occur, they seem to reflect the same disdain for research and sound information that the student reported her teacher had about the bill she was writing for her class.<p>	But not all problems are internal. . . .<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tap"><H3>The Attendance Policy: Progress Thwarted by Outsiders</h3>Schools' difficulties in setting new directions sometimes appear to be significantly attributable to outside forces. During the week of our visit, disagreements and misunderstandings were apparent with regard to the attendance policy. While people at Crossroads agreed that students had to get to class on time, the staff had widely different views concerning what happened if students were late or if they missed class altogether. Some teachers believed a new policy had been instituted which mandated automatic expulsion after nine absences during the school year. One teacher took up fifteen minutes of class time reading names of students and the number of days absence they had in relation to the "nine-absence" policy. Others thought that the nine-absence policy involved absences since the mid-year discussion of the policy. Some thought it was a new policy that was to go into effect next year.<p>	Teachers were also uncertain regarding the effects of field trips and other school-related absences. A quickly called faculty meeting during our visit seemed to add confusion for some of the teachers. As a parent said during a Governing Council meeting discussion of the policy, "Parents and students are very confused. If kids are getting suspended on attendance, or some classroom is using the old policy and some are using the new, it's not fair."<p>	A teacher responded to the parent by saying, "At an in-service it was decided, and kind of decided but not clear."<p>	In a focus group, one teacher commented, <p>The attendance policy is a joke. We have really dropped the ball on this one. We have a set number of absences. But kids don't know if they are excused or not. Kids who don't show up don't do well anyway.</blockquote>	Another responded, "It seems that every year we come back and we have a new attendance policy. I'm confused." And another stated: <p><blockquote>Half the faculty are using the old policy, half the new. So now we have to figure out what policy we are under. . . . Somehow wires got crossed, and we were never given the go-ahead to use this policy.</blockquote>	It was this failure to "get the go-ahead" which appears to be at the root of the problem. At first, listening to the conversations, we thought that the problem was lack of clarity in the construction of the policy. However, the school's attendance policy is as clearly written as the new tardy policy which has been so consistently implemented. Apparently, according to comments by both the principal and a central administrator, much of the confusion at the school derives from insistence by the district that the school's new attendance policy be approved by the board, thus delaying implementation. This was in contrast to the tardy policy, which was within the school's decision-making authority. Such insistence on external approval seems odd in light of the avowed district commitment to school-based management.<p>	Another explanation was offered by some teachers who expressed beliefs that the disagreements were associated with building administrators' unwillingness to follow through on removal of students. Such views did not seem to us to be borne out by administrative comments. They may reveal the divisiveness that can be generated between school administrators and teachers within a building by lack of clarity regarding respective roles of schools and central district decision makers. That is, people may assume that the source of problems lies within their setting when the explanation may lie outside of it.<p>	Whatever the source of the difficulty in enacting a common approach to student attendance, the policy proposals and conversation about them suggest a problem that may be more critical for the school than just its ability to obtain and articulate clear consensus on policy. It raises an issue that cuts to the heart of the school's stated desire to be a place known for caring about its students.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="pad"><H3>Pushouts and Dropouts: A Problem Needing Informed Decision Making</h3>The problem of pushouts and dropouts has a number of dimensions. We heard teachers, parents, and students expressing concern about whether students are going to receive an education. We saw a school faced with a serious problem but lacking the information or the deliberative processes required to begin solving the problem.<p>	The problem raises two issues. One is the extent to which all students are receiving an education at Crossroads. Nationally, dropout figures for Hispanics are higher than for any other ethnic group.3 With Crossroads' population being largely Hispanic, the question of dropouts and pushouts is clearly a significant one.<p><h4>Lack of Sufficient Data for Decision Making</h4>The second issue is even more ubiquitous. The lack of good data regarding dropouts is just one example of the general absence of accurate information available for decision making. While the faculty relied on considerable information in making its decision to implement a new means of dealing with tardiness, such does not seem to be the case for other decision making.<p>	The official dropout rates for 1990-1991 of 11.5 percent for the district give it the seventy-eighth worst dropout rate of the eighty-eight districts in the state.4 This appears to mean that the dropout  rate of a class of students could be estimated at 39 percent over the four years the class was in school.<p>	The principal claimed that for the prior year, dropout figures reported to the state had shown big improvements at Crossroads over the previous year (district-wide dropouts had increased from an annual rate of 10 percent). But upon his assuming responsibility for the school, he discovered that many students were reported as having "moved," without there being a record of where they had moved.5 As a consequence, he recognized that figures for the current year would look bad. <p><blockquote>We seem to be doing more to keep kids in school; students feel that more is not being done to keep kids in school. In parents' and students' minds [some things were done] to get rid of kids, but this is not proving to be so. Unfortunately, I don't have the statistics, and don't know how many students have been suspended.</blockquote>	We tried to learn more about the extent of the problem. We asked about specific numbers: How many students were failing courses? How many students were dropping out? Were students being pushed out? Generally, the data were not available. <p>	We appear not to be the only ones without information about the extent of the problem at Crossroads. For example, when we asked a school board member about it, he indicated he had not seen any figures for the school, but thought that it had improved. He commented, <p><blockquote>I don't know the numbers at Crossroads High School. I haven't looked at them yet. We should have gotten them from first semester, but I haven't asked for those yet. We [board members] should have those. That is a strong indicator of how well a school is doing.</blockquote><h4>Who Is to Blame?</h4>Several parents shared stories of students who were either in danger of dropping out or who had already dropped out. They blamed teachers who failed 50 percent of the students in English classes, teachers who failed to provide extra help, and teachers who did not communicate to them that their children were in trouble. One parent who, when interviewed in the fall, had spoken positively of the experience his child was having, explained that he supported the boy's decision to leave school because the people at the school were not caring for him. Some of the parents acknowledged that they had not kept abreast of what was happening to their kids. <p>	Several teachers commented on having lost students during the course of the year. One of the most dramatic of such observations came from a teacher who had considered her class "awful" in the fall; she said it was made up of "very difficult" students. Now she said of the class, <p><blockquote>[It] is down to eight to ten students. The dropouts didn't have a chance, with their home life. In fact, one of the kids told me that he was being taken away from his home just prior to spring break and was going to a boy's ranch. Of the eight to ten remaining, only a few are going to pass. I feel sorry for them.</blockquote>	Another teacher described a girl who was engaging in a project with the class as a dropout. I asked how she could be a dropout and still be attending class. The teacher explained that she had come back because she was interested in finishing a particular activity. Although the girl was a gifted student, the parents were moving and did not want to have to support her any longer, so they had told her to leave school and find work--about three months short of graduation. "Maybe she will take the GED," the teacher commented. <p>	Federal and state funds flow to a non-profit organization which operates a program to encourage Crossroads students to stay in school and graduate. According to the state-prepared manual for the program, it is a performance- and competency-based instructional program. The manual for the course indicates it has been initiated in this community because this district has the third highest dropout rate in the state. During class some students worked intently at writing letters, and some were slouched in their seats only engaging in the assigned task halfway into the period.<p>	The report on the success of the program is optimistic but vague in terms of results which have been achieved during its several years of existence. Teachers throughout the school seemed unaware of this special project. Moreover, there is little evidence of efforts to link it philosophically with the school's goal statements, which repeat in slightly different wording the nine Common Principles.<p>	The challenge such programs face become more evident when one listens to faculty talk. During a focus group, a teacher said, <p><blockquote>I would like to weed out unmotivated students who do nothing but raise hell--kids who do not even bother to turn in the final exam. I have a student who has a 0 percent average, yet he is there every day. He does not cause me any problems. Mandatory education does not work. </blockquote>This teacher apparently did not recognize the lack of connection between his concern about students who raise hell and the example he gave of a student who is there every day without causing any problems.<p>	Another teacher voiced her concerns about non-performing students:<p><blockquote>The class that I had in the student lounge is unbelievable. You need to do some weeding out. Refer them and refer them and eventually they leave. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. If we do not try to weed out the kids who do nothing, we are doing nothing for the kids who want to learn.</blockquote>	To which a teacher responded, <p><blockquote>In England and Japan, those schools--if you do not pass fourth grade, you do not go to fifth grade. There has to be a safety net to pick them up later. The community college here does that a lot.</blockquote>	A third teacher said:<p><blockquote>There were some kids suspended [because of the tardy policy]--but, hey. And we have lost some kids because of this, but I don't care. They were never here anyway. . . . Sometimes parents come in and complain and say they weren't notified. What about the report cards? Don't they pay attention?6</blockquote>	Students also expressed concerns as they told of friends who had left the school and of their own plans to leave. Several worried that students would be kicked out of school because the new attendance policy failed to discriminate between excused and non-excused absences.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="idm"><H3>Informed Decision Making: A Precursor to Consensus</h3>No teachers, school administrators, or central administrators interviewed could give an example of ever using information about student performance to help them make decisions concerning what changes should be made at Crossroads. When asked questions related to this, several identified the evaluation of last year's Pathways program as an example. Others criticized the report as containing inaccurate information.<p>	When asked what decisions had been influenced by this evaluation, none could cite an example. Similarly, no one could identify the results students were achieving on the state-mandated competency exams, let alone talk about how such results were being used to help faculty make instructional decisions.<p>	Consider the following dialogue from a teacher focus group:<p>Marie:<blockquote> I had 50 percent F's in one of my classes first semester. What is the failure rate here?</blockquote>Efren:<blockquote> First period class they all got A's; two bad kids came in and now I have 50 percent failures.</blockquote>Larry:<blockquote> I saw the same thing change my best class to my worst class. I hear, Marie, that you send a lot to Choices [the student disciplinary management program]. I am beginning to think we should send everyone to Choices. I am terrible about letting kids be jerks for too long. I have been using the old name-on-the-board routine.</blockquote>	The failure rate being tossed around in conversation is similar to that alleged by several parents during discussions, yet no one seems to be sure just how many students are failing. Moreover, no one seems to view the information as necessary for the inquiry concerning the need for changes in instructional programs or practices.<p>	A central administrator commented: <p><blockquote>Teachers have always felt like they teach, they give a test, and then they give grades. And I'm not sure that there's been a whole lot of effort (and our district is going to be deeply involved in that . . . ) of what do test results mean and whether or not [teachers] can look at a test and does that test reflect--test--what they have taught? Does it test, in ways that kids can do their best, what they taught? And then, [does it test] whether or not the programs that they are teaching are even effective for kids? </blockquote><blockquote>And I'll give you a good example . . . : A social studies teacher will tell me, "I've got the same curriculum I've had for twenty years, and years ago the kids used to do real well, and nowadays I've got a 50 percent failure rate." And they'll say, "I don't know what's happened to the kids." And I say, very simply, "Has something happened to the kids or has something not happened with you? Are you teaching? Is your teaching and what they are learning, or what you're trying to get them to learn, appropriate and effective? And what are your test scores or what are they telling you?" . . .</blockquote><blockquote>When a lot of teachers look at the success rate of the class and at student achievement, and it's low, they automatically, or they initially, assume there's something wrong with the kids: the kids don't study; they're not doing their homework. And they don't look at asking what they're teaching and whether or not they are exciting kids about learning.</blockquote>	Since this was the third time we had heard someone make reference to a 50 percent failure rate, we asked if this administrator had data on the failure rate in various courses at Crossroads. The response was, "I don't have that information."<p>	However, the administrator did describe an investigation of a specific new program at another high school in the district which had revealed a high failure rate. When she reported the failures to the administrators of the school, they were surprised because they had been unaware of the data.<p>	Aside from the use of information to help in creating the new tardy policy, perhaps the most encouraging indication of the school's willingness to use data in decision making was the response of the faculty and administration to the first snapshot they received. The Governing Council used it to help determine future activities. The principal identified it as having been used in deciding to change policy. Even though the snapshot raised some difficult issues, the school faculty as a whole voted to allow it to be used by state officials engaged in a Re:Learning-sponsored workshop. Such activities suggest to us that the problem is not the willingness of the faculty to use information as much as it is the lack of adequate data, the time to consider it, and the need to develop processes and skills for analyzing information once it is obtained.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="osop"><H3>Other Signs of Progress</h3>While they continue to struggle for agreement on vital issues, the people at Crossroads are making progress. For one thing, there are signs of greater acceptance of the school by the community. We interviewed a group of parents who had high praise for the school. One described elementary children with whom he worked in Little League as no longer being interested in going to the other schools in the district, but instead, wanting to attend Crossroads. Parents felt this was an example of their belief that the initial developmental years were behind the school and that spirit was high now and students were proud to be participating in life at Crossroads.<p>	Many students described their classes with greater enthusiasm than during our first visit. They were less inclined to complain about an over-emphasis on cooperative learning, and more likely to identify specific activities in classes which they had found challenging and enjoyable.<p>	We saw signs of more variety in instructional practices. Attention to non-traditional means of assessing student progress was evident in several of the Pathways classes. For example, we obtained a video prepared by a student team to demonstrate their understanding of <cite>Hamlet</cite>, and we heard descriptions of math teachers working with Pathways students to statistically analyze findings of surveys. Reportedly, teachers were planning to engage in more training related to student assessment.<p>	Teachers, parents, and central administrators were generally in agreement that the new principal was exerting positive leadership. He had obtained faculty commitment to continued involvement with Re:Learning, even though teacher comments revealed considerable differences in the depth of understanding at the school of the nine Common Principles which underlie that collaborative effort.<p>	Following the February visit to the school of Yale scholar Seymour Sarason, school faculty acknowledged the need to develop greater agreement concerning its mission and had held some discussions in that regard.<p>	After analyzing the first snapshot, the Governing Council joined with the principal in prioritizing attention to conflict resolution and peer coaching as topics for forthcoming in-services. The Council had submitted its proposal for designating Crossroads as a site-based management school under the district's new policy.<p>	The school has received more money from Re:Learning than any other school in its state. It has benefited from a major statewide grant to support its efforts to become a "21st Century School," from access to national consultants supported by the Panasonic Foundation, and from lesser grants from local, state, and national foundations.<p>	Activity moves forward on many fronts. While faculty remain split concerning how fast to change, as well as the direction change should take, change is evident throughout the school.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="conc"><H3>Conclusions</h3>At Crossroads, a consensus decision based on substantial information led to successful implementation of a new tardiness policy. In the process of creating and implementing this new tardy policy, several things occurred which may prove to be more important in the life of Crossroads than just the immediate effects of the policy:<p><ol>	<li>	Information was used to make the decision. Decision makers combined data from the earlier snapshot and from teachers' experiences with tardiness with information obtained from a visitation by a small group to another Essential school.<p>	<li>	Divisions within the faculty gave way to a collaborative effort to solve a common problem.<p>	<li>	Faculty and administration approached a common problem and, after extended dialogue, reached a solution to which they were willing to hold each other accountable. Even those who criticized the policy and the approach to making it, spoke of it as something "we" decided.<p>	<li>	 Central administration supported the school's adoption of a policy that was controversial with some parents. [This raises a question about the potential power that could be achieved if representatives of this office were a part of the decision-making process on critical issues.]<p>	<li>	 Faculty, parents, students, central administration, the media, and the new school administration itself expressed increased confidence in the administrators at Crossroads for their role in consensus-building and implementation of the policy.<p></ol>	However, lack of consensus and failure to have and use an accurate information base have kept the school from adopting a new block schedule. These factors have also contributed to the school's apparently ineffective dealing with problems of dropouts and pushouts. Lack of consensus and failure to use the information that <cite>is </cite>available have also combined with lack of district-level support to stir up confusion regarding a new attendance policy.<p>	Generally, the faculty and administration approached other instructional issues without having complete and accurate information available and by paying relatively little attention to that information which is available. The Pathways program, which represents the core of the change effort, has made progress, but struggles with too little communication within and between the various thematic teams.<p>	The overarching question for the year ahead, one of the questions we will be seeking to answer when we return for our third visit in the fall of 1992, is whether the power of consensus derived from decisions based on information will propel the school forward, or whether dissensus and lack of information will prevail.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><H3>Notes</h3><ol><li> This first visit is recorded in Richard Clark, "Challenges and Incongruities," Studies on School Change (Crossroads High School, Fall 1991), Coalition of Essential Schools, Brown University, February 1992.<p><li> The frailty of human memory concerning emotionally charged issues is evidenced by another report of the same meeting, which says that the epitaph was hurled at a fellow teacher by one teacher who felt students had a right to be late returning to class from lunch because the former teacher returns late from lunch himself.<p><li> <cite>Newsweek</cite>, August 19, 1991, page 60. The article reports that "Hispanics have the highest school dropout rates of any major nationality or ethnic group--about 43%."<p><li> [School district] public schools, 1990-91 Accountability Report contained in the local newspaper on Friday, April 3, 1992. Similar data for individual schools were not available.<p><li> Improvements in dropout rates were cited in several evaluations of change efforts at Crossroads. For example, a report submitted to the state on a dropout reduction project conducted in the school claimed that Crossroads' dropout rate in 1989-90 was 6.6 percent, compared with 12.96 percent at one of the other schools in the district and 19.25 percent at another. The school with the highest dropout rate is also the school to which many pregnant students transfer to complete their schooling because it has a child-care program.<p><li> Unfortunately, the answer to this teacher's question may be no. One parent with whom we talked was quite angry about lack of notification of problems developing with his child but did not know even how frequently report cards were issued, let alone what early report cards had said about his son's performance.<p></ol><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr><p><a href="../../../projects/sc/chanlong.htm">Appendix A: About the School Change Study</a><br><a href="../../../principl/principl.htm">Appendix B: The Common Principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools</a><br><a href="../list.htm#2">Return to Index of School Change Publications</a><p><p> </body></html>

On the third day the study team was at the school, it snowed. The snow blanket covered the dust, dirt, and flaws of the terrain. As the morning sun illuminated the landscape, Crossroads High School was clearly visible against the snow-covered landscape on that chilly morning. Trees stood statuesquely along the street edge and in front of the adobe houses set back from the roads. <p>	Later that day, the snow began to melt. Cars that drove through the street turned what was once white and fluffy, dirty-brown and wet. The trees dropped snow from their limbs in clumps, and this snow, too, was soon crushed under car tires or otherwise turned into slush and then pools of dirty water. Nature's appearance had significantly altered. By the end of our visit, our views of the school's progress in its struggle to change had also undergone a change.<p>	The five-day visit which serves as the primary source for this snapshot occurred in November 1992, in the second year of our study. As we do each time we visit a school as part of the School Change Study, we produced a "snapshot" of our third visit to Crossroads. The snapshot includes "close-ups" of classroom visits as well as conversations with people in the school community--teachers, students, administrators, and parents. Additional data were obtained from a review of local newspaper articles, journals written by students and teachers at Crossroads, and documents concerning the school provided by staff at Crossroads and the school district. Judy Bray of the Education Commission of the States provided additional information concerning the state and district context for the school, as a result of her interviews and document reviews conducted during November and December 1992.<p>	Before we share the impressions gathered during this visit to Crossroads, we need to remind you of why we selected <cite>Crossroads </cite>as the pseudonym for this high school. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="paac"><h3>Poised at a Crossroads</h3>Created four years ago to be an innovative school, Crossroads has some unique features. One of these is its Pathways program, which was designed to focus on themes or essential questions. Pathways features a heterogeneously grouped language arts-social studies block for all ninth- through eleventh-graders. Another innovative feature of Crossroads is its Governing Council. Led by a teacher-chair, the Council members, which include students, teachers, a parent, and administrators, share in making certain critical decisions for the school. <p>	In addition, since its creation Crossroads has been involved in Re:Learning, a partnership between the Coalition of Essential Schools and the Education Commission for the States. Through Re:Learning, Crossroads has received funding and support for school change. As an Essential school, Crossroads has committed itself to change using the nine Common Principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools. (See Appendix B for a list of the Principles.) In its first years, Crossroads and its innovations were being discussed widely throughout the state by enthusiastic members of the faculty.<p>	In its short history, however, Crossroads has faced many difficult challenges. One of these has been the many changes that have buffeted the central and local administration. The superintendent, whose vision was reflected in the new school, died, and the district has since had two other superintendents. During the first year of our study, a new principal took over and changes continued in the assistant principalship. Leadership in the faculty changed as well. Conflicts between groups within the faculty reflected the stress associated with the effort to assemble an innovative school. <p>	At the conclusion of our first visit, we suggested that the school appeared to be poised at a crossroads, ready to continue toward realizing its initial vision as an innovative school or to fall back into the pattern common to most of the nation's comprehensive high schools. After our second visit, we reported a coalescing of faculty and administration around a new tardy policy, but commented on the lack of information-driven inquiry into the curriculum and instructional practices of the school. We questioned whether the road chosen was going to lead the school to accomplish its own written philosophy, one which paraphrased the nine Common Principles.<p>	When we arrived for our third visit, students and teachers with whom we had become acquainted during earlier visits greeted us with their customary warmth. As we began our next round of inquiry, we found a few changes which, like the new snow's effect on the landscape, had altered the school. Immediately we were aware of the thirteen new faculty members. We were assured that during the hiring process, these new teachers had been asked to assess whether their beliefs were consistent with the nine Common Principles reflected in the school's philosophy. (Later, new teachers suggested that this question was not asked or only asked in passing, but that gets ahead of our story.) Additional optimism was evident as teachers told us about the construction of a new wing at the school which would provide science teachers as well as other teachers with facilities that would engage students as workers.<p>	In our continuing effort to understand the whole school, we were determined to concentrate on the students and on what happens to them in their classrooms. Toward that end, each of the three members of our team observed a minimum of thirteen classroom sessions in the five days we were there. From these observations and the interviews we had with individuals and groups of teachers and students, we have constructed the descriptions which follow.<p>	After we share a day of real classes through the eyes of two fictional students, we will listen to a conversation between a group of students about their school week. Then, we will turn our attention to the events in the school, district, and state, which reveal the difficulties the school is experiencing in obtaining the supportive context needed to strengthen it on its road to becoming an Essential school. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cc"><hr><center><h2>Classroom Close-ups</h2></center><hr>Danny Rodriguez and Mary Espinoza meet at the foot of the stairs leading up to the media resource center (MRC). Danny laughingly warns Mary that she better hurry or she will get caught up in the hall sweep that had been initiated the previous spring to catch students who are tardy. Mary smiles and says, "That's no big deal; they'll just send you to Choices [the student disciplinary management program] and everyone knows you have a ball there." <p>	"But," Danny protests, "I hear they are going to make us clean up trash if we are sent there." <p>	"No," Mary replies, "the Governing Council is just talking about it; they will never decide what they are going to do." <p>	Danny nods and says, "Well, I've got to run. Ms. Knorr is my Pathways teacher first period and she insists that we get to class on time." <p>	As Mary turns away she says, "Yeah, and I have to get to my math class, but Ms. Donald doesn't really make a fuss if we come in late." <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="dpc"><h3>Danny's Pathways Class </h3>Danny moves rapidly through the maze of students toward his classroom. The noise coming from the room is more than the usual Monday morning chatter of students sharing their weekend experiences. Immediately next to his room, construction workers are busily hammering away as they rush to close in the addition they are putting on the school before winter sets in.<p>	There are seventeen students in the room--eleven girls and six boys--as the class begins. The classroom is arranged in an unusual fashion, with a wide aisle down the middle of the room and students facing each other in three rows of desks on each side of that aisle. <p>	As Danny enters the classroom, Ms. Knorr hands him his report card, and the usual process of comparing notes begins among the students. <p>	"What'd ya get?" <p>	"4.0." <p>	"Yeah, sure you did." <p>	"I got a 3.0 and my parents are really going to be mad." <p>	"My parents wouldn't believe it if I got a 3.0." <p>The students' conversation is interrupted by the public address system's direction to stand for the salute. A few students heed the PA announcement and mutter the Pledge of Allegiance. When that is over, few pay any attention as a student reads the morning bulletin that announces visits of college representatives and tells them about upcoming testing. <p>	Danny looks at the chalkboard at the front of the room where, as usual, the week's and day's assignments are listed. "Read pages 37-50. Do sections 1-4. Do main ideas at the end of each section. Continue conference on essays." He goes with other students to get his history textbook from the bookcase at one end of the room. Ms. Knorr asks, "Does everyone have a textbook now? Does anyone have questions on what they are supposed to be doing?" When Luiz says, "Yeah," Ms. Knorr reads the assignment from the board.<p>	Danny asks, "Are we supposed to do others?" Correctly guessing that he is asking about other chapter-end activities, Ms. Knorr replies, "Just the main ideas. At the end of the day I will check to see if you have the work done."<p>	About this time a student arrives late. Ms. Knorr asks, "Were you helping her?" The student says, "Yeah." Apparently satisfied enough with this brief answer that she doesn't need to send the student to Choices, Ms. Knorr nods, turns, and writes on the board, "Kind of work, who is doing it, what things make a difference with work?" She then says, "These are the issues we will be discussing tomorrow. When you are done with that, you may continue to work on your essay rewrites." <p>	Since there are not enough books, Danny goes to the adjacent classroom and picks up some extra ones for the class to use. As the students settle down and begin to read from <cite>The Americans</cite>, their history text copyrighted in 1992, Ms. Knorr calls one of the students to a table in the back of the classroom to begin conferring about his essay. At this point, all of the students except two are working industriously. Hank, one of these two, picks up his book and begins reading as Ms. Knorr reminds him what the assignment is. <p>	As Danny looks at the questions at the end of the assignment and begins reading for information to answer them, words from Ms. Knorr's conference filter through. "That's the thesis statement. . . .Show us what you are talking about. . . .Talk specifically." <p>	Danny smiles as he notices that Hank has a book in front of his face to hide the fact he is talking to the girl behind him. <p>	The conference continues. "See how you need to use evidence? . . . I don't know what you mean. . . .I like your spelling and sentence structure." As Ms. Knorr finishes the conference with this student, she smiles at him and calls on the next one, saying, "What I want you to do is read this to me." <p>	Again she asks the question, "Is that your thesis statement?" "The boy responds, "Yeah," and continues to read until Ms. Knorr stops him and says, "This isn't a complete statement." At this point the teacher next door enters the room to check with Ms. Knorr about what the students in her class should be doing. Ms. Knorr reminds Ms. Nueva that the rewrites of the student essays will be due on Wednesday. Ms. Nueva nods and returns to her room.<p>	Ms. Knorr continues the conference by discussing the content of the boy's theme in relation to the way it is organized. "If you could capture that in the introduction and make the conclusion stronger--it just kind of ended." Paraphrasing some of what he says, she asks him, "Is that what you were trying to say? Could you use this [she points to a spot in the theme] as part of the prejudice thing?" She then says, "Watch the capitals and commas." <p>	He smiles and says, "OK." <p>	Before she calls another student to the conference table, Ms. Knorr moves around the classroom observing their work. Danny and the others are busy reading about the settling of Virginia and the bringing of slaves to this country. Ms. Knorr notes that one boy appears to be reading his text but has written nothing. One girl is on page 43; one boy is on 38. Most of the questions the students are writing about call for them to find information rather than to draw conclusions. <p>	As she calls another student to a conference, she warns Hank, who has sharpened his pencil for the third time, that he is going to have trouble finishing. She moves another boy to a different seat and responds to a question a girl has asked her. <p>	Now, fifteen minutes into the class, she begins the conference with the third student. Again, Danny hears her ask a student to show the thesis statement. As Danny moves rapidly ahead with his work, he notices that Hank is entertaining a girl with his pencil. A couple of girls in the corner are whispering. Ms. Knorr leaves her conference and moves to these girls. As she does so, one of them asks a question. Then Ms. Knorr is interrupted as the telephone rings. She answers and says, "I don't have any. I've used mine all up."<p>	Returning to the conference, Ms. Knorr says, "You are getting too many metaphors here." She then asks, "When the Irish first came, they were discriminated against because of what?" The boy answers, "Religion." As Ms. Knorr works with the boy on the paper, she smiles as she draws out an idea from him and says, "That's fine; you just need to be clear about it." <p>	As the bell rings, indicating the end of the first half of this Pathway class, Danny has read all the way to page 48. As Ms. Knorr looks at the open books, she notes that some are on pages 41 and 44. She then returns and continues her conference as the other students leave with their books open at the desks, where they will return to them when the next period starts. She concludes her conference with the boy, telling him, "You really did a fabulous job. Take a break and come back." During the second period, Danny and his fellow students will continue working on the questions in their history text and conferring with Ms. Knorr. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="mmc"><h3>Mary's Math Class </h3>While Danny is in Pathways, Mary is in her math class with Ms. Donald. As Mary enters the portable classroom across the parking lot from the main building, students are sitting at their desks, which are in groups of four or five. Mary joins her group, laughing and joking with the two other girls and boys in it. There are sixteen students in Ms. Donald's class today. As usual, the atmosphere is relaxed (Mary has heard some teachers say that Ms. Donald classrooms are too relaxed). <p>	As the class begins, Ms. Donald asks for volunteers to do homework problems on the chalkboard. Volunteering, Mary works at the board, talking out loud to herself. Two of the members of her group coach her from their seats. Ms. Donald circulates around the portable room, with its orange indoor-outdoor carpeting and orange window blinds, checking with students on their homework. There are students from each group working on the problems at the board. As Ms. Donald approaches a boy in the room who is having trouble reducing a fraction to its lowest common denominator, she patiently spends time with him by coaching him at the board, walking him through the calculations step-by-step. Mary is still working on her problem, and in the corner of the room, two boys are playing chess. <p>	Going over to Mary, Ms. Donald sits on a desk nearby and watches Mary talk herself through the problem. When a girl calls Ms. Donald over from the other side of the room, she immediately goes to answer the question, then, returning to Mary, she jokes with her about how much space her writing is taking on the board. Mary smiles, apparently pleased at the attention. Another student at another board calls for Ms. Donald to check his problem, and Ms. Donald immediately goes over to him. <p>	While all this is occurring, Mary's friend is sitting at Ms. Donald's desk, working at the computer. Other students are talking quietly or are working on problems at their desks. A girl asks Ms. Donald if problem number eighteen on the board looks right. Ms. Donald sits on her desk in front of the board to look it over. Meanwhile, Mary is still working on her problem. One of the boys in her group is coaching her intensely now. Mary seems to be working with increased concentration on the problem.<p>	Mary turns to the others in her group and says, "We have a test tomorrow, right?" She then says, "I guess we need to keep practicing." One of the girls in her group continues to coach her, explaining why she should do certain steps in the problem. Finally, with considerable assistance from the other students and from the teacher, she has the right answer. Meanwhile, Ms. Donald continues to banter with Shawn. When Ms. Donald asks Shawn about drama activities, she responds that they are about to produce <cite>Into the Woods</cite>.<p>	At this point, another girl asks Ms. Donald about a particular part of Mary's problem. Ms. Donald helps her see how to do that particular calculation and then stops and looks over her homework. When this process is finished, Mary turns to the girl and says, "I really never believed that everybody in the class would do the homework the way we are all doing it. Ms. Donald sure gets us to do it without making a big fuss about it." <p>	After helping another boy with a problem, Ms. Donald returns to Mary and asks who helped her solve the problem. She then takes out her grade book, giving credit to the girls and the boy who assisted Mary. She moves around the room, making similar contacts with other groups and writing her findings in her grade book. As the students work, most are using calculators and many exchange social comments, creating a background of chatter. Two boys who had been playing chess end their game and join Mary's friend at the computer. <p>	Ms. Donald reminds the students of their quiz tomorrow, which is to be three problems of the kind they have worked on today. Mary turns and asks, "How can I do three of these problems when one has taken most of us at least half an hour to do today?" There is no response from Ms. Donald. <p>	As the class period ends, Mary turns to her friend and says, "I love that class. It is so much fun!" One speculates that her enthusiasm stems from her active engagement in the work of learning math.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="msc"><h3>Mary's Science Class </h3>Walking through the hallways, Mary stops to purchase a chocolate-covered doughnut from the card table outside the MRC and then, eating and talking, goes to the science wing at the back of the building. As she enters the room, she notices the week's activities outlined on the front board:<p>Monday--conceptual models, What's matter?</blockquote>Tuesday--What is matter?</blockquote>Wednesday--Videos--Elements in periodic chart</blockquote>Thursday--Conceptual models, Matter</blockquote>Friday--Edit essay, "What is science?"</blockquote>	Today there are about seventeen other students present. Most of the students in the class are ninth-and tenth-graders who are taking the class for physical science credit. The room is decorated with mobiles hanging from the ceiling, one of which is a model of a bone cell. There are also a number of student-made mobiles relating to various aspects of science. <p>	Since this is the day students have received their report cards, Ms. Hansler begins by talking about what went into the grades she gave them. She uses a large computer sheet as a reference point as she talks about the grades. During this conversation, the boy at the back lab table jumps up to talk with other boys at the next table. A girl at the front of the room, looking into her little purse mirror, is putting on make-up, and another boy is leaning his head on the table.<p>	Ms. Hansler proceeds to talk about conceptual models. She reminds the students that they have been working on concrete models and points out that now they are moving into conceptual models and will concentrate on models in the universe. She also announces that she will not be in class on Wednesday because of a science meeting concerning district curriculum. <p>	Next, Ms. Hansler asks the students to get out their notebooks. Mary and the others go to the shelf at the side of the room and get standard composition notebooks, which are stored there between class sessions.<p>	The students begin to write their own definition in response to the question, "What is matter?" Ms. Hansler reminds them that the purpose of this is "so they can go back in nine weeks and see how much they have learned about matter from this initial point." <p>	Mary and most of the other students write busily in their journals. After a while, Ms. Hansler stops them and begins the discussion of conceptual models:<p><blockquote>It's more of an idea, not a model that you can hold in your hand like a model of a car. We saw Newton's model--we put different play people into a car and saw what happened when big and little people were in the car in terms of how far the people went when the car stopped. The bigger the car you have, the bigger the force you need to get it moving and keep it going.</blockquote><blockquote>We have concepts that we live with every day. Big cars have big engines because of mass--conceptual models of motion affect this. The periodic chart is another conceptual model. The continental drift is another conceptual model that has been accepted--we can't see the plates move, but we can understand the San Andreas fault because of this model. They can measure the movement, but we can't actually see it happening beneath the earth. So we have conceptual models to explain things we can't see or that are too big for us to see.</blockquote>	As Ms. Hansler concludes her remarks, Mary and the students in her small group slowly begin the next phase of the class. Ms. Hansler tells them that while working in small groups for about twenty minutes, they are to list everything they can observe about the periodic chart. She asks them to pick recorders who will report to the class at large:<p><blockquote>One person make an observation about the chart and everyone writes it down. I will go around the group and give everyone a chance to say one observation that their group has made. So, this will be easy in the beginning. It's when you go around the group more and more times that it gets hard to see another thing to add to the list. </blockquote>	While Mary and her fellow students work, Ms. Hansler circulates among the groups, encouraging students and answering questions. Students are busily looking at the chart and making observations. <p>	As the students begin to run out of observations, Ms. Hansler moves to the front of the room and says, "All right, we are just about ready." She then tells each recorder to speak slowly. Waiting a minute to make sure she has everyone's attention, Ms. Hansler reminds students to jot down observations from other groups which they have not recorded themselves. A boy at Mary's table reports several items, including naming the number of elements, atomic number, and atomic weight. From the next group, a boy gives a more extensive report. Most of the students in the class listen, but some make gestures and faces at each other as they listen to the report.<p>	When Ms. Hansler asks, "Do you now have a better understanding of what matter is?" most answer, "No." But then, when Ms. Hansler begins to question them about what they have just reported, they are able to give her information about the periodic chart. "So," she says, "you are beginning to gather information about this chart, even though you might not have a total idea of the conceptual model that frames all this." <p>	Class ends as the bell sounds. Students gather their belongings and exit, talking quietly with each other. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="mcc"><h3>Mary's Computer Class</h3>Following science, Mary heads to her computer class. It is totally individualized, and there are ten things going on at once. At least two students work cooperatively at a computer station on each task, and kids ask each other for help. As Mary works, Ms. Eisley encourages her, saying, "Good job!" and pats her on the shoulder.<p>	The students encourage each other with "I appreciate that" and "Thank you very much."<p>	When one student utters an expletive, Ms. Eisley says, "I don't want to hear that." He believes he has lost his data. The teacher says quickly, "Don't touch the computer; you might be able to get it back," and she goes over to help him.<p>	When a new student comes into the classroom, Ms. Eisley says, "What are we going to do, Austin?"<p>	He says, "I don't know."<p>	"Come on up here and let's make a plan. What do you know about word processing?" <p>	Austin mutters something under his breath.<p>	Ms. Eisley smiles and says, <p><blockquote>Is that all you know? Would you like to do more? Let's give you a practice one. I just received this letter in the mail, and I want you to type this, and I want it to look as close to this as possible. Let's see how you do with this. That will give you a starting point.</blockquote>	The bell rings. About twelve of the twenty-one students in the class are still working, including Mary, who is sorting and typing  comments from a teacher workshop held the previous Friday. Finally, the machines are turned off and the students head out of the room.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="dgc"><h3>Danny's Geometry class </h3>While Mary has been learning about computers, Danny has been hard at work in his geometry class. The week's assignments are posted on the board as he enters the room.<p>Monday: page 176-7 #1-13</blockquote>Tuesday: page 182 #1-7</blockquote>Wednesday: page 186 #1-31,</blockquote>Thursday: review</blockquote>Friday: test</blockquote>	Mr. Holden uses a variety of techniques to engage Danny and the twenty-four others present. They follow him closely and respond as he calls on them to learn the definitions necessary to work with parallel lines and angles associated with them. Making his usual effort to engage as many of the students as he can, Mr. Holden calls on more girls than boys. As the class comes to a close, Mr. Holden reminds the students to keep in mind the difference between a postulate and a theorem as they do the homework for the day. <p>	Danny leaves his class and catches up with Mary. They head out to the nearby shopping center for lunch, joining the parade of 4X4's and other vehicles that move slowly past the campus security guard onto the main road, away from campus.<p>	Returning from lunch, they again wheel past the security guard, park in the lot, and head off for the remainder of their classes. Mary remarks, "More students seem to get sent to Choices for being tardy to the class right after lunch than any at any other time during the day." <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ddc"><h3>Danny's Drama Class </h3>Danny bounces into the auditorium, where he and others will soon be working on the scenery for the next student show. As Mr. Parks takes attendance, he calls students to assemble in the front rows. There he chats with them about the production of <cite>The Glass Menagerie</cite>, which many of the students attended at the local repertory theater that afternoon.<p>	Mr. Parks comments that he is very unhappy because while he had reserved sixty-five tickets, only forty students showed up: "I had ordered two buses when I only needed one. Not only am I disappointed with those who didn't attend, but I am embarrassed because this could strain my relationship with the theater company." <p>	He then describes a little of what the students who missed the play would have seen and asks the students for suggestions as to how he can alleviate this continuing problem of students' promising to attend but not bringing in the parent permission slips or not showing up at the last minute. <p>	Danny suggests that he could hold tight to his permission slip deadline. Another student seconds Danny's proposal, saying, "You know you never enforce what you say you are going to do."<p>	This makes the teacher a little defensive. He explains the many details that go into the planning of a field trip such as this one, including the commitment he makes to the theater and the professional obligation that he feels to support its work. Another student suggests that he set a limit on how many can go and then make it first-come-first-serve according to who turns in their permission slips before the cut-off. Responding positively to this suggestion, Mr. Parks comments that this may be a strategy he will try in the near future. <p>	While this conversation is going on, the rest of the students, relaxed but paying careful attention to the teacher, are lounging against the stage stairs and sitting in various rows throughout the auditorium. <p>	Finishing his conversation about the play, Mr. Parks begins assigning students to various tasks related to the upcoming student production, including ticket and program design, practicing of lines, and organizing advertising materials for the program.<p>	He directs the remainder of the students, including Danny, to help him construct the sets. Because a dance company will be using the auditorium during the weekend, the students must complete the sets before the dancers arrive and prevent their continued working.<p>	With the other students, Danny ascends the stage to begin the construction effort. He chats with those with whom he is working and with Mr. Parks throughout the remainder of the class. He enjoys his work in drama and the opportunities it provides him to engage in activities that are creative and for which he is given considerable responsibility by his teacher.<p>	Clearly, the students have a great deal of respect for Mr. Parks. Perhaps this respect is generated in part by the real give-and-take of conversations, like the preceding one, which students believe they can have with him. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="mcc2"><h3>Mary's Choral Class </h3>While Danny has been in drama, Mary has also been in a fine arts class. She has joined twenty-seven other girls in chorus, a class that is all girls this year because no boys signed up for it. <p>	While Mr. Duke calls roll, he asks one of the girls how her ill mother is doing. He passes out music to several of the girls who had been absent the previous day and asks, "How many need 'Sound the Trumpet'?" This question elicits a number of hands. Mr. Duke says, "Ladies, we are going to do this on the Christmas program. I know you don't like it." <p>	A girl sitting next to Mary asks, "What does the 'Scarborough Fair' have to do with Christmas?" <p>	Mr. Duke responds, "Nothing, but we are not limiting our Christmas program to just Christmas. I know you don't like it. Okay, let's warm up. Altos, a low G today. Stop your yapping and let's get started." <p>	Mr. Duke has the students stand as they warm-up. He reminds them to stand up straight. As they continue their warm-ups, he warns them that they are losing the "ahhh" quality and says, "I don't care if it hurts you; open your mouth. Control that upper note." Then he asks them to change to the <cite>o </cite>vowel sound.<p>	As the girls go flat on a high note, Duke stops the warm-ups. He goes to the piano and tells the girls that they did two-and-a-third octaves--"not two-and-a-half, but pretty good." <p>	Going over to the piano, he asks the girls, "When does the accompanist play and when not?"<p>	After talking through the words to "Scarborough Fair," he asks the altos if they have any questions. He adds, "What gives you the hardest time?" <p>	Mary says, "Right where it says 'between the salt waters.'"<p>	Picking up on that comment, Duke rehearses the altos on that section and warns them, "Don't forget to break after the word <cite>water</cite>." He then gives each section its opening note and says, "Can we all sing? Sit up straight." <p>	The session continues. As the girls sing, Mr. Duke alternatively cajoles, praises, and criticizes. When they lose the beat, he stops them and starts over. He warns, "Some of the bad notes can be hidden by the piano, but we shouldn't count on it." He stops them and asks, "How do you spell <cite>work</cite>? What is the last letter?" <p>	He stops them again as they move to an a cappella part, saying, "There is no spirit here. You're better than that." He keeps pushing the students. Sally asks, "Why are you pushing me?" Mr. Duke responds, "You are in [Music] Theory. We are working on the same thing there: sight-reading." Sally nods her acceptance of this explanation. <p>	As they finish a section of a song, Mr. Duke goes to the piano to show how far off key they have become. Mary asks, "How did we get so far off key?" Mr. Duke responds, "Probably because of posture and breathing. Altos are the ones getting off. How many of you read notes? What does <cite>chromatic </cite>mean?" <p>	To this latest query Sally responds, "Goes up in half steps." <p>	Mr. Duke brings the altos to the piano. He has each student play the section in turn. He assures them that they will be able to sing this because they can play it. "Everyone gets a free piano lesson here today." With the piano lesson over, he says, "Now sing it." This time when they are finished they are all on key. <p>	And so the class goes. He picks up the music from one song and passes out another one. He asks Terri if she needs to lie down. Earlier he had asked her if she had a problem standing up during the warm-up session. She is recovering from an injury and obviously is having a problem keeping up with the activity in the class.<p>	They turn their rehearsal to more traditional Christmas music. As they come to the end of one of the songs, he smiles and tells them to remember that when they first got that particular piece, it took them three days to learn one page. The chorus responds with obvious pleasure at themselves and the way they are handling this complex piece of music.<p>	The class ends with Mr. Duke's chatting informally with several of the girls. As the bell rings, Mary and several of her friends from the alto section head off to the next class.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="mpc"><h3>Mary's Pathways Class</h3>In Mary's Pathways class with Mr. Allen, the desks are arranged in groups of four or five. Today, fourteen of the nineteen students in the class are present. Included in the class is a hearing-impaired student who has an interpreter with her. Starting class on time, Mr. Allen begins by taking attendance and presenting an overview of the coming week's work. <p><blockquote>Look at the schedule and write this down. Why do I ask you to write this down? In case you are absent. We will be doing <cite>The Scarlet Letter </cite>but not the whole book. We will discuss what it is about, and you will read three crucial chapters and you will view a wonderful adaptation on video. At least we will learn about it and discuss it. Today, we are working on the American dream, also tomorrow and then next week, big time. On your new syllabus, you will see that the essential question is "Work: The Key to the American Dream?" </blockquote><blockquote>You are already in your cooperative groups. You've been there for Indian tribes and dances, immigrant families, and now you will be workers in these groups. Tomorrow we will go over the vocabulary from <cite>The Scarlet Letter</cite>. Each of you will take a part of the words and then put them together.</blockquote><blockquote>Wednesday and Thursday we will go sideways and have a guest speaker from the Newberry Library in Chicago who will discuss, for those who volunteered [to attend], a lesson on Native American literature. Those of you who opted not to, will be with Ms. Berry. Part of you will have a sub because I am coordinator for a workshop. On that day you will have the video of <cite>The Scarlet Letter</cite>.</blockquote>	Following these opening remarks, Mary and the others in her group take out paper, pens, and pencils, and begin "to write a few things down," as Mr. Allen puts it. As the students work, Mr. Allen asks a variety of questions such as, "Do you remember Ben Franklin and that he saw people being tried for witchcraft?" "What were they doing at the river?" "Do you remember the huge Bible?" "What did they do with the Bible and scale?" <p>	While Mr. Allen asks these questions and fills in information, the students answer just one question he poses. Then Mr. Allen says, "On the board are seven pictures. Line up and look carefully at the pictures. By tomorrow, I want you to have decided on one picture and then make a one-paragraph description of one of these pictures. I want you to do this like the shell game." He pauses and then says, "What did we do?"<p>	The girl sitting next to Mary says, "We had seashells and we looked at them and described them the best way we could in a variety of ways." <p>	Mr. Allen nods and says, "Yes. Was it light or heavy, smooth or rough? We turned it around in all different ways. What was the objective?" <p>	Again the student next to Mary responds, "Descriptive writing." <p>	Mr. Allen says, "That's what I want you to do with these worker pictures. The one that looks the easiest may be the hardest because you will have to figure out what he is doing." <p>	Once these directions have been given, Mary and the other students go to look at the pictures. While they are looking, Mr. Allen continues to talk about how they might choose their favorite.<p>	As all of this is taking place, Joshua has been busy talking to his neighbors, but whenever Mr. Allen speaks, Joshua interrupts to add his own observations or to ask a question. Sometimes Mr. Allen responds to what Joshua says and draws relevance from it. Other times he asks Joshua to be quiet by saying, for example, "Joshua, sit down and pay attention and then you won't have quite so many questions." <p>	Mr. Allen reminds the students, "You will have another chance to look tomorrow at the pictures. Everybody sit down now." At this point, all the students return to their chairs. He then looks at the syllabus and talks about the weighted credit side of it: "What is a syllabus? Anybody, what's a syllabus? Look at what you have in front of you and tell me what it is." <p>	After a few moments without a response, he continues, "It's a map telling us where we are going to go. We have five sub-questions of the essential question. Please read. What does <cite>agrarian </cite>mean? We started out as agrarian and what does this mean? And this is the Puritan ethic."<p>	Having made this comment, Mr. Allen turns to Jackie and asks her to read number two, which she does. Then Mr. Allen asks, "When we left the agriculture and became industrial, where did people go?" <p>	Mary volunteers, "To the cities."<p>	Mr. Allen says, "Yes, because all of a sudden there is industry. Instead of trade and barter with neighbors we had to trade for money." He continues, "Mary, please read number three."<p>	The process of a student's reading an item and Mr. Allen's explaining the item after it has been read continues. Finally, Mr. Allen says, "We are going to read "Ragged Dick" to give us a sense of his time. Joshua, follow along with us. Any questions?" There are no questions. Mr. Allen then says, "Write this down. <cite>A </cite>is a symbol that holds the story together. Guilt, sin, love, revenge, redemption. This story is full of symbols. This story is a parable, a short story that draws a moral lesson or illustrates a religious truth."<p>	Looking at the chalkboard, Mary notices that the same statement is written on the board at the front of the room. The class is interrupted as the phone rings. Mr. Allen asks a student to answer it. The student does and calls him to the phone. He asks the class to look at the list while he talks on the phone. With the phone call finished, Mr. Allen returns and says, "Let me whip through the story," and proceeds to tell them the story of Esther in <cite>The Scarlet Letter</cite>. At the conclusion, he asks if there are any questions. Joshua has one. Mr. Allen says, <p><blockquote>Joshua, I'll answer you later. That's basically the story and you should take notes as you go through this. In our groups for the American dream, make a note of what it is for you. You will write later on "How do you personally achieve it and how do you sustain it?</blockquote>	Mary's friend asks, "What do you mean?" <p>	Mr. Allen replies, "Hold it." <p>	The bell rings and he says, "This is a big week. Any comments about where you are headed and where you are going? Take the last few minutes to look at the syllabus." <p>	Joshua says, "May I ask my question now?" <p>	"Yes, at my desk." <p>	The students leave.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="dabc"><h3>Danny's AP Biology Class</h3>Ms. Hansler, who teaches Mary's physical science class, also teaches Danny's last class of the day, where he hurries now. There are six other students, all girls, in the class with Danny. As he enters the class, he reminds Ms. Hansler that he has been thinking of dropping the class. She gives him a pass to go to the counselor to check out this possibility. <p>	Talking quietly, Ms. Hansler tells the girls about photosynthesis. She questions each student about current work in notebooks while making notes of her own concerning their progress and needs. She then asks whether there are any questions about yesterday's lab. At this point, Danny returns, carrying a folder the counselor gave him to bring to one of the girls. <p>	Ms. Hansler mentions a lab that they might do together on Saturday. "It's not a required lab, but it could really help us with our work." They decide they will make final plans for this soon. The conversation about photosynthesis resumes. Ms. Hansler asks, "What is this equation exactly the reverse of?" <p>	The students respond in a chorus and then write in their notebooks. As the conversation regarding the equation and process continues, Ms. Hansler observes that "scientists have never been able to make this in the ways that plants can." <p>	As Ms. Hansler continues talking, the students take notes. Their books are open, with sections of many of the pages highlighted. Ms. Hansler stops and reviews a bit of physics in order to explain the process they are starting. She notes that this whole process is going against the second law of thermodynamics. She says, "The light process is all part of what we call <cite>the electromagnetic spectrum</cite>." Gesturing with her arms, she explains this further. She also makes numerous notes on the chalkboard as she talks, highlighting the major concepts she is discussing.<p>	Danny watches intently and writes in his notebook, occasionally asking a question. Sometimes he asks questions that trigger ones from other students. They say to one another, "Isn't the role of the electrons amazing?" The students discuss the flow of electrons and the creation of life on the planet.<p>	A boy comes to the room and calls Danny out. After about thirty seconds, Danny returns and another boy comes into the classroom, asking Ms. Hansler to sign a form. The discussion turns to issues about how the sun burns and about what cumulative damage it does to the skin. Danny asks, "The stronger the pigment, the more it absorbs?" Ms. Hansler continues to explain.<p>	One of the girls comments on how amazing the properties of our eyes are that allow it to see color. This leads Ms. Hansler to explain that color-blind eyes have a structural problem with rods. This point triggers Danny to ask about black holes. "Is there such a thing as a white hole?"<p>	Ms. Hansler admits that conceptually she understands black holes but that it is hard to understand that possibility on the earthly plane. The class continues discussing chlorophyll, holes in the ozone layer, and the effect of these holes on humans, plants, and the earth.<p>	Regarding the ozone layer, Danny asks, "Is there anything we can do to repair the hole?" <p>	Ms. Hansler responds, "No." Using diagrams and equations on the board, she then goes on to explain why. As the class draws to a close, Ms. Hansler summarizes the lesson of the day by reviewing photosynthesis as a process that triggers chemical reactions, Then she diagrams the structure of a leaf on the board, enlarges one leaf cell, and describes the processes going on within it. The bell rings, but no one has packed up early. <p>	Mary and Danny have come to the end of this November day, the start of another marking period. As they head for the parking lot, they engage in animated conversation with their fellow students, as they did when their day at school began.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="conv"><hr><center><h2>Conversations</h2></center><hr>In addition to visiting classrooms, we spoke with the students, faculty, administrators, and parents to find out their feelings and ideas about Crossroads.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="twts"><h3>Talking with the Students about classes</h3>Skip ahead with us, if you will, to Friday of the same week. Sitting in a comfortable lounge area at one end of the MRC, Mary and Danny are talking with each other and with several other students about their classes.<p>	Danny opens the conversation with comments about his Pathways class taught by Ms. Knorr. <p><blockquote>I really looked forward to going outside on Wednesday and trying to find out how the pioneers were able to live off the land. Unfortunately, that was the day it snowed and the twelve of us that came to class spent our time reviewing the notes we made from the history book on Tuesday afternoon. During the last part of the period students had taken turns reading from the diary of William Bradford about the Plymouth Plantation.</blockquote><blockquote>During class on Thursday, Ms. Nueva had taken over from Ms. Knorr and talked with us about symbolism. She did one really interesting activity. She asked, "Can any of you think of a symbol? I'm looking at one now." She had been looking at the jacket that Mark had on. Then she asked him to model the shirt. She said, "What color is it?" It was a black shirt, and she asked, "What is the meaning of <cite>black</cite>?" I told her that black means death. Somebody else in the class said it means sadness. Ms. Nueva said. "Maybe even evil." Meanwhile, Mark was standing and displaying his T-shirt. Ms. Nueva said, "What are other symbols that are here?"</blockquote><blockquote>One of the kids in class said, "There are skulls and a head and a snake." Ms. Nueva asked "What do you think a skull head means? You have to be in one condition," she hinted. A student in the back of the room said, "Dead. " Ms. Nueva then asked, "What does a snake mean?" and Luke responded, "Evil." </blockquote><blockquote>Then Ms. Nueva asked what an example was of an early story in which a snake stood for evil, and I told her it was about Adam and Eve. Ms. Nueva asked us then if a snake is evil in all cultures. I said no. She asked, '"How about when snakes come from a basket?" And Luke said, "That's India." "What about the Aztec god?" she asked; and I couldn't believe it, but Mark actually knew the name of the Aztec god that was in the shape of a snake. "So," Ms. Nueva said, "We have two cultures where snakes are seen as wisdom."</blockquote><blockquote>Then she went ahead and talked about how snakes can mean wisdom because they understand what goes on below the earth, and she asked us to write this down on our notes about how Goodman Brown was going to ask three questions in this story, which were also going to be answered by symbols like the ones we had been talking about.</blockquote>Mary:<blockquote> I guess that's a little like what we were starting in our Pathways class when Mr. Allen had a guest lecturer. We spent an entire class with the lecturer reading a passage which had what she called "word pictures" in them and she would tell us, "Go back over the paragraph and pick out any set of words that give you the picture of his grandmother or something like that." She said that the reason she was doing this was to have us pay attention to the language being used by the Native American authors to describe and create images. I guess those are sort of like symbols. Of course the only ones of us that engaged in that conversation were the ones that decided to take part in talking with this guest lecturer. I don't know where Joshua went for that session.</blockquote>Bradley:<blockquote> In our Pathways class we learned that John Hancock was a smuggler, and our teacher Mr. Griffith told us that our Constitution was based on smugglers, liars, cheats, etc. He's really cool because he knows a lot.</blockquote>Perry:<blockquote> In Pathways we are studying the romantics and reading Greek myths. This week we got to write our own myths. Mine was about how a nerd came to be. The way I write has to do with the way I'm feeling. I included the laugh and how they dress. Now we are reading parts of the <cite>Odyssey</cite>. It's hard to understand at first, and we help each other figure it out. Now it's becoming clearer. This is a whole different experience. </blockquote>Ronnie:<blockquote> We didn't do too much in Pathways this week, but we sure had an interesting time around the election. I was voted by the class to be the Republican leader and we had all kinds of speech making.<p>		The teachers were not involved. We made the decisions. We had to support how we felt. The teachers were just there if we had questions. They said to tell us to stop if they tried to get involved. The teachers made up the syllabus so they had it planned. It wasn't a class decision to have the debates or elect the leaders; we had to follow guidelines. But once we were elected we were in charge.<p>		Our side won. It was good to hear all the sides about the issues. We were representatives of the parties and explained what the party stood for on urban policy, health care, abortion, and some other topics. I didn't do any research at all. I introduced all the groups. I researched our groups and their groups so that I could be knowledgeable about what everyone was going to say. We wanted to watch the elections very closely. I went to my friend's house because my parents were for Clinton.</blockquote>	Several others in the group nodded that they had really enjoyed the debate involving the Democrat, Republican, and Independent parties at election time. One student commented, "My mother couldn't get over how I would argue with her about politics. She wasn't used to me being interested in those kind of things." <p>Greg:<blockquote> I want to tell you about my Pathways class with Ms. Geyer this week. She started by asking us to help her design how we were going to work with the research paper. When we started, she reminded us of how we had defined "a memorable learning experience." Then she told us how we were going to be working on a bunch of skills.<p>		She had us write down the names of three heroes. Our group before included Stockdale, Magic Johnson, Bill Clinton, JFK, Madonna, and Harriet Tubman. My friend got in trouble when he told the teacher that there weren't more women on our list because "women aren't worth it--women didn't do anything ever." But I pointed out that it's because most history is written by men. We spent quite a bit of time getting our groups organized so that there were both boys and girls in the group. Then we decided that each group would pick five names per person as a starting point to developing our project on heroes. 	The next day, Ms. Geyer went over different ways of organizing information and covered a twelve-page handout about research papers. She told us that we would negotiate aspects of the final grade, but the rough drafts of our research papers will be read by her and one other adult, probably a parent, maybe another teacher. Then she will give us time for a revision.<p>		We're using an evaluation sheet with ten categories, each of which gets a number of points. The main categories on which we will be graded are, "importance, accuracy, to the point, well organized, and comprehensive."<p>		We worked in the MRC on our heroes paper on Wednesday and then spent more time on it in class on Thursday. I decided to do Patrick Henry. I don't know who he is but I'm going to do him. I'm not sure why Ms. Geyer wouldn't let my friend do Magic Johnson. <p>		Anyway, the last day of the week we focused on grammar. Ms. Geyer started out the lesson writing a sentence on the board: "In 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed to the New World with three ships." Then she asked for prepositional phrases and diagrammed the sentence.<p>		She kept this up for some time, doing four sentences before she moved to the new stuff we were to do on Friday. She taught us all about predicate adjectives and predicate nominatives.<p>		For example, she would read a sentence that we would copy for our folders like, "Her judgment was correct," and then diagram the sentences for us. After a while, she would call on students to diagram sentences. Once she threw in a sentence with a direct object but that didn't fool any of us.<p>		Some of the older kids in class say this is boring but I think it's important for us, so that we learn how to write and get ready for college. When we had all ten of the new sentences for the day in our folders, then we were finished and put them away.</blockquote>Mary:<blockquote> It sounds like you had a busy week in Pathways. We had some problems in science. Ms. Hansler had to go to the district office for two days, and we had a substitute. The first day we watched a video and were supposed to make notes. The second day he gave us a quiz. Most of the kids kept talking all the time they were taking the quiz and a lot of them were looking on each others papers.<p>		When we were through, Mr. Black, the sub, went over the quiz with us and then told us we could work on a late current event, a timeline assessment, or our essay, "What is Science?" Not many of the students did much work though.<p>		I don't really like the focus of this class because the focus is on biology and chemistry and I've had some of the material in other classes. This was billed as physical science credit and I was told that I had to take this first before going into advanced classes in chemistry, and so on. So I am bored. When I was at St. Jude's, they called the class "biology" but it was really like a general science so I feel like I'm repeating. There was more variety in what we did at St. Jude's. </blockquote>Greg:<blockquote> I don't agree with you, Mary. That's my best class. I think that most of the kids like that class, and they want to learn what Ms. Hansler is teaching. She really helps us.</blockquote>Mary:<blockquote> Well, I really like my computer class because we do things that are really useful.</blockquote>Danny:<blockquote> What do you mean? </blockquote>Mary:<blockquote> Well, for example, last week I had to get some tickets ready for a dance our club was sponsoring, and Ms. Eisley helped me develop a way of keeping a record of them using the computer. Another girl in the class figured out how to use the computer to track the result of the voting on which flag is best. </blockquote>Danny:<blockquote> What do you mean, which flag is best?</blockquote>Mary:<blockquote> You know, the ones that are in the showcases in the hallway that we are voting on to decide which one will represent the school and be flown from one of the towers like the United States flag and the state flag.</blockquote>Bradley:<blockquote> What I don't get is all of the group work that we do. In Mr. Allen's class he was telling us about the paper that we have to write, and it was to be about our dreams, and he reminded us that it was to be like our birthday essays. He told us, "When you write, you need to define your dream and explain your dream. Why is it your dream? It does not have to be outrageous. It should be something that will give us satisfaction. So think about the best, not the most expensive." What I don't understand is why we have to have a group help us write about our own individual dream. When I asked Mr. Allen, all he said was it would help us with ideas.</blockquote>John:<blockquote> The best thing about our Pathways class is that the teachers have agreed that five of us can read more higher up [<cite>sic</cite>] literature like the classics. We will be independent. The gifted teacher will help us. We will read <cite>Julius Caesar </cite>this nine weeks because in history we are studying the Roman Empire, with the theme being human rights. After we read <cite>Julius Caesar</cite>, we will meet and start a new one that has to do with what we are doing. We'll read it together and write critiques.<p>		Actually, I like the direction things are going this year. In drama I'm doing more directing instead of acting. In Pathways we've been allowed to do independent study. And some of the classes like chemistry, French 2, and trigonometry are more difficult than what I had last year.</blockquote>Danny:<blockquote> The reason I like my math class with Mr. Holden is that he uses so many different approaches. Listen to some of the things he did this week to help us learn:<p><ol>	<li>	He had individual conferences with several of us who were having trouble with certain problems.<p>	<li>	He would put a problem on the board and have each of us do it in our notebooks, then we would discuss it.<p>	<li>	He had us working in groups to help each other with our pre-tests--some groups had as many as six, others as few as two students. Also, when we were trying to get help from him as we worked on problems, he encouraged us to help each other and then come to him only if we couldn't figure it out.<p>	<li>	He has us keep a sheet with all the theorems on it which we have proved in class. It helps us know which ones we can use to help solve new problems. At first he wouldn't let us add the one we worked with this week; then when we showed him we really knew it, he said it was OK to use it from now on.<p>	<li>	Once during class he had me make a physical model to show the class what he meant by lines being in different planes.<p>	<li>	He had us keep our homework in notebooks and then checked it while we were taking our test on Friday.<p>	<li>	He led a class discussion of a problem by saying he was a secretary and would only write on the board what someone in the class would tell him to write. We all had to watch and make sure he did the problem correctly because he would write anything a class member said.<p>	<li>	Several times he asked how many of us agreed with an answer and then challenged those who agreed or those who disagreed to prove they were right.<p>	<li>	He encouraged us to get involved in the university math competition so we could learn how to work more challenging problems and to help us with our records for college admissions.<p>	<li>	He gave us strategies that we can use to solve certain kinds of problems. For example, he helped us understand the order of importance in asking questions about one kind of problem having to do with parallel lines. Another time he said we should begin by looking for true vertical angles, then look for linear pairs, then look for linear triples, quadruples, and finally, we should turn to angles from parallel lines.<p>	<li>	He always had roll taken by the time the bell rang so we didn't waste time at the beginning of class.<p>	<li>	Sometimes he worked problems at the chalkboards, and sometimes he had us work problems and explain them to the class.<p>	<li>	He told stories to help us understand what he was talking about. Like, when he was trying to get us to understand the need to have a strategy for attacking problems, he compared it to having a way of dealing with a problem such as a flat tire in the desert. You know," he said, "you could call AAA, stand by the road and look pretty, get out your jack," but we had to have something in mind as a way to approach our flat-tire problem . . . we couldn't just stand there looking at it.<p>	<li>	He assigned us problems in the book for the whole week at the first of the week, then gave us a practice test over the material before the real test at the end of the week.</ol></blockquote>	As the PA system does rather frequently, it interrupted the students' discussion to remind them of some plans for the coming week.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="twta"><h3>Talking with the adults  about Change </h3>In addition to observing and inquiring about classroom instruction, we were interested in learning more about how the leaders at the school, district, and state levels support the school in its stated desire to become an Essential school. Our understanding of the internal and external supports for school change, or the lack of these supports, comes from individual and group interviews of teachers, parents, principals, central administrators, and state officials. Our observations of a faculty meeting during our visit also gave us important information about the context for school change at Crossroads. <p><h4>Internal Supports for Change</h4>Leaders within the school, whether teachers or administrators, struggle to agree on a direction and on workable processes for pursuing it. Two settings in which one can observe this struggle are meetings of the school's Governing Council and staff development and administrative meetings of the entire faculty. Consider the following examples of such meetings.<p><b>The Governing Council</b>. While at the school, we heard numerous descriptions of the Council's meeting the week prior to our visit. Drawing on those descriptions as well as the minutes from the meeting, we reconstruct it as follows. Although we were not actually present, we present the meeting as if we were in order to make the description more immediate.<p>	When we arrived, we were met by a teacher who begged us to visit a Council meeting to learn of their problems. We did so, joining them for one of their meetings held, as usual, during lunchtime. The meeting began by the chair's saying it was an unofficial meeting, which led a member to challenge her as to why. The chair then changed her terminology and called it a "special meeting." <p>A Council member:<blockquote> We have accomplished little. Last summer we worked for a week, modified the attendance policy. Anything we get done hits a roadblock. Why isn't the principal here?</blockquote>The chair (defending herself):<blockquote> I sent out notices.</blockquote>A teacher:<blockquote> I hate to do this, but I second everything that has been said. There is so little chance of anything taking place, I feel like this is the last resort. [The PA system interrupted the meeting with an announcement that the meeting was being held.]</blockquote>Another teacher:<blockquote> There are too many personalities involved. We bring up something which needs to be dealt with, and everyone says it is impossible. There is no building taking place in this group.</blockquote>Another Council member:<blockquote> I am confused. You mentioned that this is a special meeting, but the reason for the meeting is not clear to me. Why should we meet with Dick Clark and air our dirty linens?</blockquote>	As the discussion continued, one of the school's assistant principals arrived. The conversation shifted back to the value of work done by the Council during the previous summer and from there to the role of parents. When a parent representative indicated the parents wanted to be more involved, she was asked what kind of involvement they wanted. As the parent responded, one teacher suggested that questions such as the teacher was raising should be addressed to the administration, not to the teachers, while another assured the parents that they had the requested information and could give it to the parents.<p>	In response to these comments, the parent emphasized, "It is not information we want; we want to be part of the decision making at the school, and we want to be there to help you in whatever way we can." <p>	Displaying annoyance at this parent's comment, a teacher explained, "It boils down to not having time." <p>	Another teacher complained that they had been told a group was going to follow up on the previous week's in-service. He asked when the group was going to meet. "When are we going to do something about it?" <p>	A third teacher suggested that he and his wife understood the complaints of parents because they could never get teachers to respond to their concerns about why their kid never has homework. "We can't even reach teachers to talk about it. We have given up. We teach her what she is not learning here."<p>	After a few more comments another teacher said, "It comes down to the fact that the Governing Council has no power or authority. We come up with new things and it does not go anywhere. We go through all the old hoops. We get 85 percent of the faculty to agree to block scheduling. The administration vetoes it, so it makes no difference." <p>	The discussion continued with comments about the district's lack of support for their efforts at site-based decision making. The chair reminded them that in the past they had succeeded in disbursing more than $200,000 in grants to the faculty.<p>	As the discussion returned to the earlier rejection of block scheduling, the assistant principal joined the conversation. She said the principal was sorry he had not been able to join them. She then said that she wanted to emphasize, "[As an administration] we want to work with you." She said one of the problems was that as soon as the Council acted, others on the faculty would run to the principal to assure him that the Council did not reflect their thinking.<p>	As this conversation progressed, the bell rang and teachers began to leave. The assistant principal continued, trying to explain why the administration had rejected the faculty's proposed block scheduling. High on the list of reasons was one that others had mentioned: <p><blockquote>We have teachers who can't hold the students fifty-five minutes. How can we expect to hold them for two hours? We are trying to crack down on those who can't, but until we can work with those teachers and get them on track, we can't go to the longer schedule. </blockquote>	As members of the Council continued to drift out of the room, a teacher observed, "When they have kids for two periods, they'll learn how to handle them for two periods." Thus the meeting ended. The assistant principal returned to the office area and conferred with the principal. The parent remained to talk with one of the teachers. The other teachers and the student representative hurried off to the class that met immediately following this lunchtime session.<p>	All in all, twenty minutes of the Council's time was spent on problems with garbage on the campus, and twenty minutes was spent in complaints about interruptions by the PA system. When the issue of the interruptions came up, a teacher was not happy with a comment from the principal and walked out. A student then said, "If you want to talk about interruptions, my teachers spend the first twenty minutes getting ready for class." [Actually we noticed less of this kind of teacher behavior during our visit this fall than during the visit a year earlier.]<p>	However, between the principal's request that the complainers suggest solutions, a teacher's walking out, and a student's complaints about time wasted in class, the meeting deteriorated rapidly.<p>	Information from several sources subsequent to this meeting suggested that follow-up sessions have proceeded much like the meeting reported here, as well as like the faculty meeting described below. Seeing the Governing Council operate in this fashion, we were curious about how faculty meetings are used to provide leadership for change.<p><h4>A Look at a Faculty Meeting</h4>While we were at Crossroads, a general faculty meeting was called. The meeting was held in the auditorium on the day following our visiting team's feedback dinner with a group of faculty. A number of teachers were not present because they had chosen to prepare for class sessions or to tend to supervisory duties.<p>	Pacing back and forth on the stage, the principal began the 7:30 a.m. meeting (which began at 7:44) by explaining the agenda to the group, which was seated in chairs scattered throughout the room. It was cold, and the lights above them flickered as the meeting progressed.<p>	The principal said that the Xerox Corporation had a representative who would tell them about a study which would help provide better copy service for each of the district's schools. He emphasized, "We will have to put up with counting how often we use the machines. I am not looking for abuse here. You will not be asked to rationalize your particular needs." <p>	The principal then noted he had one more thing to talk about:<p><blockquote>Last night when we had dinner with the Coalition representatives, we had reflections of how we are incorporating some of the nine Common Principles in the school. It is happening in various departments. One of the most positive things is that in meeting with you all during the last five days, they are spreading the word of the positive things that you are doing with students. You are teaching students, not just content. The frustration that I have felt, behind closed doors, is with social workers, police, juvenile courts. I have to change my focus to something more positive. I think that part of the tone that I have set, personally, is negative and that has to change.</blockquote>The principal continued, still pacing as he spoke, <p><blockquote>One thing that is crucial is that we are talking about change. The Governing Council and I will be making an effort of how to hear your views, how to have talk among us all about change. We will be meeting very shortly to figure out how we can integrate interests, to see how we can share our concerns, how we can talk about these things, how we can have more communication. I want you to begin talking with these members, so we can hear your concerns.</blockquote>	The principal then mentioned the upcoming visit from the state department and encouraged teachers to speak their minds. He spoke of the need to communicate to people in the central office what was really happening at the school. <p>	With these opening remarks concluded, the principal noted that the Xerox representative was there, introduced her, and left the stage and room with no opportunity for questions or comments. As the Xerox spokesperson began her comments, she was interrupted by a teacher who asked, "Will this mean a new big machine for this building?" The rep said, "No." The teacher walked out of the meeting, saying, "<cite>This </cite>is where we need that machine." <p>	Although there was another speaker to follow (it was about 7:51, with classes slated to begin at 8:00), other teachers began to leave. A teacher asked when they could leave Crossroads to do the copying at the central office.  The rep answered "Anytime."<p>	"Great! We can leave anytime," the teacher said wryly and left.<p>	"We are talking about morale!" yelled a teacher. <p>	Another said, "We need machines <cite>here</cite>, not at the warehouse and not at the central office." <p>	Of the approximately fifty teachers present at the beginning of the meeting, about thirty-five remained as the Xerox presentation came to a close. <p>	A faculty member on stage then announced that six people from support services had gone to training sessions to use support groups: <p><blockquote>Thanks for staying five minutes. We have guests. The principal is going to hold the bells for us. We want to get started, and we need your input in terms of which students might need support-group help.</blockquote>	One women talked about what can happen with these support groups. She passed out an information sheet. Another women spoke about how they would like to set up the process. By now most faculty had left the auditorium, and the woman was talking to just a few people. There was no formal conclusion to the meeting. <p>	Teachers told us that this was a typical meeting. Information was usually presented rather than processed. Little forethought appeared to have gone into planning the processes used in the meeting. Time was limited. The setting detracted from thoughtful discussion. Participants displayed a lack of respect for each other and for presenters. Many simply did not attend. Of those who did, many left early. <p>	The seventh of the nine Common Principles begins, "The tone of the school should explicitly and self-consciously stress values of unanxious expectation ("I won't threaten you but I expect much of you"), of trust (until abused), and of decency (the values of fairness, generosity, and tolerance)."<p>	The fourth Common Principle says in part, "Decisions about the details of the course of study, the use of students' and teachers' time, and the choice of teaching materials and specific pedagogies must be unreservedly placed in the hands of the principal and staff." Neither Governing Council nor faculty meetings revealed a climate or process consistent with these Principles.<p><b>Staff Development as a Support for Change.</b> Opportunities for faculty work sessions include pre-school-year in-service times, regular faculty meetings, and school days when students are dismissed so the faculty can work together. The faculty used several days prior to the start of school to help each member of the faculty become familiar with various school procedures and services offered by various departments at the school. Faculty reported mixed reactions to these days. Some saw them as a valuable chance to learn about practical matters; others saw them as time wasted on trivia. <p>	When we visited, several teachers shared their enthusiasm for the workshop on portfolios and other Exhibitions of student learning which had occurred on a student-release day, the Friday prior to our visit.1 The session had been planned by a teacher-leader. The principal who spoke at the beginning emphasized the importance of developing assessment processes consistent with the approaches of the Coalition of Essential Schools. While many faculty members had missed the meeting, those in attendance developed a number of specific suggestions which were being typed up and categorized by students in a computer class. The follow-up committee  mentioned by the principal in the Governing Council meeting was to plan the next steps.<p>	<b>The Challenge of Transitions. </b>Transitions within the staff, as well as the problem of finding time to pursue the dialogue on school reform, may have contributed to some of the unevenness we observed in classroom instruction. Faculty members we interviewed told us that other than the conversation with Yale professor, Seymour Sarason, when he visited the school the previous year as part of this study, and the discussion of portfolios on the previous Friday, there had been no serious consideration of the nine Common Principles in recent years. Expressing his frustration at sustaining dialogue on reform, the principal noted that two or three teacher-leaders, in whom he had invested by sending them to other Re:Learning sites to learn about Exhibitions last spring, had then left the school, leaving him with the task of starting over to recruit leaders. <p>	In fact, the pervasive change already present in the school is itself a serious challenge that Crossroads faces in its attempts to sustain whole-school reform. <p>	We first noticed the changes in the students. Our field notes are full of comments such as the following:<p><blockquote>Mary arrives. She is a little heavier than last year and has that "look" that says she is an upper classperson.</blockquote><blockquote>While Sara wiggles less this year (after all, she's a junior), she still seems as if she has energy that she is barely containing.</blockquote><blockquote>I can see that Roger is clearly in the prime of his adolescence. He is more interested in things outside of school and has developed interests in his car and motorcycle that are taking some of his time.</blockquote><blockquote>Boy, have they grown up! One student comments, "We have a vested interest in paying attention because we are seniors. We need to take our time, think about things more, and don't use the first thing that comes in your head. My teacher is having us apply the things we know." All of them are still a group, with the exception of the girl who left last year--the one who had a baby and difficulty with child care, but who was "brighter than bright," according to Frankie.</blockquote><blockquote>Rose is articulate and very involved in school as well as sports activities. She seems older to me, more mature, and she seems to have clear directions for her life as a student right now. She wants to do well so that she can play in varsity athletics, and she seems involved in her learning as well as in her sports.</blockquote><blockquote>Cindy told me about a teacher who shows concern. She said, "Ms. Abbott really listens to me. She can tell when something is bothering me, and she asks if she can help. My parents are divorced, and I don't know how to decide which one to live with, and she is helping me think this over." Cindy has two younger siblings who live with their mom, and she has lived there also for the past ten years. But as she said, "Times change."</blockquote>	Besides these changes in students themselves, one example of continuous change that is the norm in a high school, the arrival and departure of new students, is another example of change. When one thinks of new students, freshmen are the people who come to mind. This year's seniors describe them in the disparaging tone only seniors can use: "The 'frosh' think they are gangsters. They think that they are all bad. Their hair is boring. They wear red lipstick--redder than anything. They even wear fake beepers!" They are a new group for teachers and administrators to become acquainted with--a group that will have stamped its own image on the school by the end of its stay.<p>	Students of all ages come and go as well. Parents told us of students who had dropped out or had transferred to another school. Board members and the local media expressed concern about these changes. <p>	Adults at the school also come and go. One science teacher was the second new teacher teaching a class since the beginning of the year, three months earlier. Beginning in November, another teacher's departure for a job with the state Re:Learning initiative generated a domino effect on several classes. In addition to the new crop of teachers, support persons working in discipline and Chapter I changed. The central office person assigned to supervise Crossroads also changed while we were there. As noted earlier, contractors were at work on a new classroom wing. Even the spaces available for students and teachers to park their cars changed as a result of the construction project and a decision not to reserve parking spaces. <p><h4>External Leadership and Support</h4>Besides changes in staff, there have been changes in the larger context. While we were visiting, the state began experimenting with a new process of program review which included visitations to the district and school. A new state collective-bargaining law provided opportunities for union contracts between the district and the teachers and raised questions of altered relationships. <p>	During the second week of November 1992, some of the problems with tone and decision making at Crossroads could be traced to financial difficulties in the broader community. Consider the following excerpt from an editorial in the local newspaper:<p><blockquote>Yogi Berra might describe it as "déjà vu all over again." Members of the [city] Board of Education must have been too benumbed by administrative folderol even to utter Yogi-isms Wednesday night when they discovered that the superintendent . . . had pulled another fast one.</blockquote><blockquote>In this bad budget year, one during which [city] teachers got no pay raises, [the superintendent] has managed to squeeze out some extra money for front office staff.</blockquote><blockquote>First, there was $4,000 for assistant superintendents, raises that escaped School Board attention.</blockquote><blockquote>Then there was $5,000 for some principals. The Board <cite>did </cite>know about those raises; in fact, it's members approved them in an illegal, clandestine session. . . .</blockquote><blockquote>The pay raises should be embarrassing enough for the Board. While the $13,000 in administrative pay increases wouldn't amount to much if it were spread out among our teachers, it <cite>would </cite>buy plenty of school supplies, supplies our more dedicated teachers buy out of their own pockets.</blockquote><blockquote>More important is the principle: when the Board is forced to declare "no pay raises," that's what it should mean.</blockquote>	Like the snow melting on the second day of our visit, signs of support by teachers for administrative leadership were fast vanishing. In fact, they were turning downright ugly. <p>	The central administration expressed frustration at diatribes like the preceding editorial. They told us that it contained some false and some misleading information. Whether it is accurate or not about the facts, it accurately reveals the anger and general resentment felt by faculty at Crossroads as they viewed the lack of support for schools in their community.<p>	Central administrators expressed concerns about progress at the school. "Families" of school and central administrators have been structured to help the school-based leaders with issues such as how to deal with at-risk students and how to organize for annual evaluations of principals. 0With the board, the administration is also developing new policies related to school-based management and goals for educational programs. The school board is also engaged in satisfying various ethnic constituencies, sometimes, in the view of school-based staff, without regard to the needs of the school. Board members and central administrators said they want to be supportive of the leadership at Crossroads, but they acknowledged there are problems.<p>	The following statement is representative of what we heard in our talks with several of the central staff:<p><blockquote>Principals feel disenfranchised with all these changes and they don't believe the board is behind them. One minute they feel they have support and the next minute they feel they don't.</blockquote><blockquote>We're dealing with human beings [on the school board], and one day [they] may say yes to them on a project, and the next day [they'll] say no. . . .</blockquote><h4>The Problem of Inadequate Financial Support</h4>Next to the lack of administrative support, the teachers most often mentioned decline in monetary support as the greatest impediment to their efforts. One teacher suggested that the instructional budget had been cut by 50 percent, and all teachers we talked with complained about their lack of a raise and the impropriety of the administrators' receiving one under the circumstances. (That administrative salaries are ridiculously low for all positions demonstrates that such concerns are based on circumstances facing people at the moment rather than on some absolute set of standards.)<p>	Teachers read about budget cuts and raises for administrators in the local paper and then experience sessions such as the faculty meeting described above, where they perceive they are being asked to help justify copy machines for the administration building. They talk of leaving for places where pay is decent, where they will be appreciated--and good teachers have left.<p>	The local community includes people of wealth and people who exist with minimal income. Generally, the people in the school do not believe the wealthy are being called on to pay taxes that are adequate for supporting the schools. They complain about property tax rates which were lowered during earlier boom times, but not restored when the state tax base was no longer artificially inflated by mineral values.<p>	Because the state maintains its stranglehold on the fiscal support mechanism, it prevents the local community from raising more funds even if it chooses to. The state has recently introduced a "density" factor to help offset the problems faced in the five largest districts. It has increased funding for schools in each of recent years. However, the urban districts believe that the density factors are not sufficient to meet their urban problems, and the increase in state funds has not equaled the combined effects of the increased student population and the larger numbers of students needing special education assistance. <p>	Another problem facing the people at Crossroads is accessing assistance. Rumors persist that state Re:Learning assistance can only be obtained if the school is willing to pay per diem and travel costs to Re:Learning staff. Foundations offer support, but the school has trouble finalizing arrangements. State and district officials speak of a willingness to provide assistance, but seem to have trouble actually providing it. State initiatives have been taken to coordinate policy making concerning various children's services, but we see no effects of that yet at Crossroads.<p><h4>The Need for Informed Decision Making</h4>There is little evidence of the use of hard data concerning Crossroads or any other school as a basis for decision making at either the board or central administration level. The state engages in collecting masses of information regarding various aspects of school operations, but legislators and other decision makers seem more influenced by consultants' descriptions of current trends, by personal experiences, and by input from various interest groups than by any hard data concerning what is happening in schools. <p>	Since the school follows this central example, the lack of information-based decision making continues to be evident at Crossroads. One state contact expressed frustration about lack of specific information on the progress students are making. <p><blockquote>With Re:Learning in particular . . . one of the issues I have difficulty with when it comes up is showing the progress. We see progress in terms of how many schools are involved, what's going on with trekking,2 what's going on with the actual school itself, and what they are doing in terms of assessment and so on, but we never see any results. It takes long, I know, to get results, but what do we have to show that these kids are really performing better? Unfortunately, that is one of the areas the legislature always wants to know about: . . .  what the bottom line is. Using progress in terms of who is involved and all that is really exciting . . . , but you also need the quantitative. Are these students really performing better? Every time we ask we are told, "Well, they are really involved, we're doing assessment, we're doing all this stuff," but it's all very loose out there. You know how it goes when you're looking for factual information.</blockquote>	Stories about the ability of Crossroads to obtain waivers from state regulations that restrict them from making desired changes leave us confused. On the one hand, we are told that such waivers can be obtained and that schools are not taking advantage of them. On the other hand, state people tell us they are trying to get permission to waive the regulations and laws that serve as significant barriers to local schools' progress.<p>	People at the school are not the only ones who expressed concern about support from the state. Even people from the state level expressed concerns about the role some of their colleagues play in supporting reform. Speaking to the difficulties of changing entire systems, one state official said, <p><blockquote>The more significant the progress you're making, the greater the resistance is. Let me give you some specific examples in our own agency, because not everyone is as supportive of the direction we're taking as some of the rest of us are. So when you think you are just on the breakthrough of having everyone understand what you're trying to do in terms of the accreditation process, and being a facilitator, and building capacity at the local level, you have people even within the agency who enjoy the power and the control role. They're undermining what the board's and the superintendent's direction is. You know, making deliberate steps to undermine the efforts with the local school districts themselves. </blockquote>	On the other hand, another person said, <p><blockquote>The state barriers are in people's minds--there have been so many changes made already to allow schools more flexibility. The way people interpret those changes is to see them as more of the same. They don't recognize that so many people involved in change processes have some say in what they'll do.</blockquote>	Still, perhaps most telling, was a comment by one person from the state level: "If we ever just lay our turf issues aside and work together toward a common vision, that would be a miracle, I guess."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rots"><hr><center><h2>Reflections on the Snapshot</h2></center><hr>By following Mary and Danny through a day's schedule and listening in on students talking about their classes, we have tried to give a flavor of what has been happening instructionally at Crossroads High School. <p>	In the classrooms we visited, some students were using their minds well, some teachers were requiring the students to be workers, and some teachers were attempting to get students to focus on essential questions. Teachers we interviewed shared with us their increasing desire to pay attention to authentic means of assessing student progress.<p>	In balance, we saw some classrooms in which teachers were using a variety of instructional techniques and other classrooms where the instruction was progressing in an encouraging fashion, given the conditions surrounding the classroom environment at the school.<p>	However, we also saw students mired in routine activities, teachers doing most of the thinking in the classroom, teachers using perfunctory assessment, and teachers attempting to cover material rather than focusing on essential items. Classrooms were frequently interrupted, either by the public address system, by students coming to the door for other students, or by students arriving late to class. <p>	There was a lack of consistency between teachers in Pathways, as different members of the same team appeared to interpret essential questions differently. But there were signs of collaboration, as in Ms. Nueva's teaching Ms. Knorr's students and the team of four teachers' showing the <cite>Scarlet Letter </cite>video on the same day, using the school's distribution system, which allows multiple-classroom viewing of a single video tape. <p>	However, as Mary and Danny had observed, the agreement which had existed on the tardy policy in the spring appeared to be breaking down. Since some teachers did not perform their sweeps and others did not insist that students arrive on time, the students saw the consequences of tardiness as insignificant, while the teachers complained that it was the administration's job to see that students be in class on time. One consequence of this breakdown was lost instructional time in several classrooms we visited.<p>	Just as there is little sense of community, family, or team, at the school, there is little sign of community support and leadership for the school. By contributing actively to the instability of the school and tensions within it, the community and school district make it difficult for the school-based personnel to sustain reform.<p>	Lack of informed decision making, as seen in the difficulty of obtaining solid assessment information for Re:Learning, also hinders Crossroads' attempts to improve education for its students.<p><h4>The Problem of Ever-present Change</h4>Finally, the thing which is most <cite>constant </cite>at Crossroads (and at most high schools) is change. Critics complain that people in our high schools are unwilling to change, when, in truth, they are always in the midst of change. (In fact, one teacher suggested, it is <cite>chaos </cite>rather than change.)<p>	A school such as Crossroads, with its ever-shifting population of students and teachers and the changing demands from the district and state, may be more a river than a road. The image of the students flowing through the halls, bumping into each other, pausing and turning as the water in rapids bounces off boulders, more adequately connotes life in a school than a picture of asphalt stretching motionless into the distance.<p>	Those who promote school change need to keep this continuous change in mind. Instead of criticizing people in schools as being "unwilling to change," reformers should ask how <cite>more </cite>change can be added. Rather than suggesting that a school is apathetic because the people in it have not taken up the latest "movement," reformers need to examine the capacity to add <cite>more </cite>change to that which is occurring.<p>	It may be that in the midst of massive changes in student body, faculty, facilities, and support systems, change has to be built on <cite>strength and stability</cite>. Strength and stability come from clear vision and effective processes for building consensus around this vision. They require strong support from internal and external forces. These are ingredients that the are absent in the environment surrounding the renewal efforts at Crossroads. <p>	In spite of such problems, individuals are making heroic efforts at all levels. To the extent that real progress depends on family effort, rather than on individual efforts, however, the dysfunctions of leadership and support systems in and surrounding the school make such collaboration unlikely.<p>	As we finish our reflections on this third visit to Crossroads, we continue to be warmed by the smiles and enthusiasm of the students. We feel invigorated by having looked in on some really good teaching and on classes where students appear to be actively engaged in activities; even if occasionally these activities are only moderately challenging.<p>	However, we are angered by the lack of financial support that leaves good teachers looking for work elsewhere and poisons the attitudes of those who remain.<p>	Also, we are saddened by the internal conflicts and failure to provide the support required to develop the administrative and teacher leadership needed to manage the conflicts in the school in a coherent process for improvement.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><h3>Notes</h3><ol><li> The term <cite>Exhibitions</cite>, described in the sixth Common Principle, refers to a kind of assessment used for high school graduation.

The purpose of our visit was to produce a "snapshot" of what is like to learn and teach at the school at this point in its process of whole-school change.<p>	Home to about eleven hundred students, Crossroads High School is located in a culturally rich city in the beautiful southwest. For the most part, Crossroads' students are drawn from the town's low-income population. Seventy percent of the students are Hispanic, and another 3 percent come from other minority groups.<p>	We gave the school its pseudonym because we believed that it was at a crucial point in its evolution: poised to become a vital, Essential school or to follow the paths of so many American high schools and fail in its efforts to tend to the diverse needs of its students. Although created to be innovative, Crossroads has faced many serious challenges that have held back its progress, including problems related to transitions in leadership and staff, financial support, decision making, and lack of a common vision.<p>	Created five years ago to be an innovative school, Crossroads features a multi-age, interdisciplinary Pathways program, with blocked periods, cooperative learning, and assessment through Exhibitions of written, oral, and visual presentations. A second innovative feature at Crossroads is its Governing Council, in which students, a parent, teachers, and administrators participate in shared decision making for the school.<p>	In addition, since its creation Crossroads has been involved in Re:Learning, a partnership between the Coalition of Essential Schools and the Education Commission for the States. Through Re:Learning, Crossroads has received funding and support for whole-school change efforts. Crossroads' mission statement, drafted before the school's opening and adopted by the faculty and Governing Council in May 1991, is the school's version of the nine Common Principles of the Coalition. (See Appendix B for a listing of the Principles.)<p>	As part of the School Change Study, we produced a snapshot of our first three visits to the school. These snapshots included classroom observations, or "close-ups," as well as conversations with people in the school community: students, parents, teachers, and administrators. Our conversations with the people at Crossroads regarding the snapshots have left us convinced that the first three snapshots were not as helpful to the school as we had hoped. While some people at the school have found our comments to be on target, others have been offended by our earlier descriptions, and the most common response has been to ask whether we could offer more suggestions about what to do about the conditions we were describing.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="htsi"><H3>How This  Snaphot Is DifferentFrom The Others</H3>As a result, we have decided to make this fourth snapshot different from the first three. We have added, largely in question form, some options to be considered regarding possible directions for the school. In doing so, we do not intend that the school adopt all the options we have listed throughout the snapshot.<p>	We have continued to resist prescribing a set of actions because we believe that the only people who can really determine what, if anything, needs to be done at the school are the people of Crossroads themselves. Instead, we hope the snapshot, with these suggested options, will serve as a reflective tool to help generate discussions among the people in the school community about what should be done at the school. <p>	This snapshot is different also in that it is based on three days of observations and interviews by four people, rather than on five days of information gathering, as was the case with the first three visits. During this visit we talked with more than thirty students, visited sixteen classes, spoke to twenty-two teachers and administrators, and interviewed a group of ten parents. We also gathered information from teachers and administrators at one of the junior highs whose students attend Crossroads.<p>	We sought this information in order to be better informed about how others in the community, particularly those teachers who are preparing their students to attend the high school, view Crossroads. In addition, we continued to review journals prepared monthly by two teachers and a student and to review copies of minutes and other documents shared with us during and between our visits. <p>	While the previous snapshot focused greatly on classroom issues, this snapshot concentrates on schoolwide issues. In particular it focuses on those issues which seem to be having the most pervasive influence on the experiences of adults and students at the school: the establishment of a schoolwide vision and the development of leadership and cooperation within the school community. <p>	The final difference between this snapshot and earlier ones is that it has been prepared in two parts. The first part reflects our view of Crossroads as of April 1993. The second part was written mainly by a committee at the school. It provides an indication of changes Crossroads intends to make for the 1993-94 school year. Each part should encourage reflections concerning the difficult tasks of whole-school reform based on principles advocated by the Coalition of Essential Schools. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="parti"><HR><CENTER><H2>PART I<BR>Current Progress and Problems at Crossroads</h2></center><hr>During the April 1993 visit, we posed a question to the adults of the school community--teachers, administrators, and parents--concerning the progress they believed the school was making. We gave them a chart describing how a hypothetical school's patrons viewed its progress and asked them to draw their own version of how Crossroads was coming along. Chart 1 reflects the general response to this question.<p>                         <p>Chart 1<P>Progress as Seen by Adults in the School<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="hvgv"><H3>Hpw Various Groups Viewed The School's Progress</H3>While some drew their charts with more or less pronounced degrees of change, almost all their charts followed the same pattern. They explained their drawings in various ways:<p><blockquote>My chart reveals that we started out rather confused, but things started to happen: Governing Council, Pathways, etc. came into being . . . but now we are headed downward.</blockquote><blockquote>The superintendent we had when we first opened had a vision for this district. Many of us bought in. Lots happened to support student learning in those early two years of Crossroads. . . .After he died, the momentum was lost and the dream has slowly begun to die.</blockquote><blockquote>The reason for the up slope was the new school, vision, teachers coming to Crossroads; down slope: . . . high teacher-student ratio, low morale, money.</blockquote><blockquote>Progress was encouraged because of the new, fresh Re:Learning ideas. We lost [our original principal] and other leaders. New teachers, little staff training, and new superintendent have brought progress down.</blockquote><blockquote>The previous principal had a vision for CHS. If there was some resistance from central administration, he fought for what he believed in and for what we, as a faculty, wanted for our students. . . .We are at a standstill more than a decline. . . .What has declined is probably the morale and the excitement for what we are here for.</blockquote>	The early high points in progress were clearly related to enthusiasm for a new venture and charismatic leadership from the district superintendent. For a number of teachers, the leadership of the principal was also important. By the end of the first three years, the superintendent was gone and the factions within the school, including those who opposed the principal and felt he played favorites, contributed to a general slowing, if not decline. <p>	The appointment of a new principal was followed by a stable period as staff waited to see the direction he would provide. His first year finished on an upward swing.1 However, teachers cited such reasons as turnover of faculty, financial shortages, leadership problems, low morale, high class size, lack of training, inadequate support from the central administration, and bad conceptualization of needed changes as explanations for the downturn during 1992-93.<p>	The views of parents who took exception to the view contained in Chart 1 are depicted in Chart 2.<p>                       <p>Chart 2<p>Dissenting Parents' View of Crossroads' Progress<p>	This small but diverse group of parents, each of whom had been active at Crossroads for several years, drew charts that were quite different from those of the administrators and teachers at the school. All of these parents drew the same general pattern. For some, the upward trend was more abrupt than for others; but for all, the last two years reflected considerable progress.<p>	Their reasoning was remarkably similar: "The new principal deserves the credit;" "The new principal has high expectations for kids;" "Chaos is being diminished;" "Kids are more respectful." They acknowledged the initial leadership from the superintendent, but then suggested that after his death little progress was made until the new principal took over. They stressed that there has been continuous progress since the principal's arrival.<p>	In neither case is the sample of people who drew graphs constructed such that we can be confident it represents the entire population of parents or teachers. Other parents or other teachers may see the school differently. Still, there was remarkable consistency in both the drawings and explanations offered within both groups.<p>	When we first shared this snapshot with the people at Crossroads, we included another chart, which follows, for the other parents and teachers to complete. We suggest that the reader fill in the chart as well.<p><h4>A Suggested Activity for the Staff and Reader</h4>Given what you know about Crossroads, draw your own graph of progress at the school in the space below. Then, make notes of your reasons for completing the graph as you did.<p>                           <p>Chart 3<p>Reader's View of Progress at Crossroads<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="dacv"><H3>Developing A Common Vision</H3>A frequent theme of those who see Crossroads losing ground is that the members of the school community do not have a common vision of what they are trying to accomplish. During an interview one teacher commented, <p><blockquote>The day I started teaching, [the superintendent] spoke to his vision for this district, and I believed it and fought for it. I cried the day I came into this district and I heard about his dreams and hopes for us. Since he died, I think the dream is slowly dying. </blockquote>	As this teacher and a number of others at Crossroads observed, that vision no longer seems to drive the school, let alone the district. As one teacher put it,<p><blockquote><cite>I think I'm understanding what direction we're going--we're not going anywhere. </cite>It's becoming "do your own thing" without any serious direction about what we are trying to accomplish. We used to have a vision; I don't know what it is now. . . .There is no direction for the whole school. </blockquote>Another teacher related her concern about the lack of a common vision as it affects students:<p><blockquote>Right now, I don't know that we're doing that much to find the ways to keep kids in school. This year is the worst it's been. We're not establishing our values as a school clearly enough to students.</blockquote>	Although the officially adopted school vision is expressed in a philosophy statement which is a paraphrase of the nine Common Principles, during this visit we heard comments such as the following:<p><blockquote>The Coalition has been distracting. People emphasize the Coalition more than they emphasize what is going on in the classroom.</blockquote><blockquote>Re:Learning is organizing and renaming methodologies that have been in existence for a long time.</blockquote><blockquote>Re:Learning has less of a presence than it had before. . . .I think they are hard workers, but quite often I have the feeling they are out for spreading the gospel with new people and forgetting the people in the trenches.</blockquote><blockquote>At our Pathways meeting it has been said that we do not want to have any conversation with the Coalition or other stuff--we don't want to bother with all that gobbledygook. . . .The trouble with the nine Common Principles is that they are unattainable; the budget doesn't allow for the student-teacher ratio. . . .</blockquote><blockquote>We are offering a critique of Re:Learning--it is nebulous. I think "less is more" is horrific because, in fact, it's yielded less. It is a disaster. Coalition of Essential Schools means absolutely nothing to me.</blockquote>	A conversation between two teachers reveals strong feelings about the teachers' roles in Coalition change efforts: <p>First teacher:<blockquote> I think teacher-initiated change is really part of what the Coalition is all about. . . .So maybe you don't think all these things are important, but a lot of us do. </blockquote>Second teacher:<blockquote> All this stuff will have no effect, because we don't have enough good teachers here. </blockquote>First teacher: Re:Learning helps us to connect with what's going on in the outside world.<p>	Not all faculty members and administrators with whom we spoke were rejecting the Coalition in the vigorous terms quoted earlier. Also, rejection of Coalition and Re:Learning activities does not automatically imply rejection of the printed school philosophy. For example, several teachers shared the view noted above that the nine Common Principles are just a renaming of old ideas. Unfortunately, the next thing they were apt to say was that some of the Principles, which are included in their philosophy statement, make no sense.<p>	For some teachers, Re:Learning is not a set of ideas, but a committee which can be worked with if time permits. As one teacher said: "I'm on Re:Learning and have only attended two meetings so [I have not been] talking about this [the nine Common Principles] much. There is not much contact with those people." In such instances, the Principles obviously are not integral to the driving ideas of the school. However, in considering the lack of common vision at Crossroads, we are concerned about more than rejections of the Coalition or its Principles by some faculty members. <p><h4>Differences in Envisioning Pathways</h4>There is a similar problem with vision concerning the structure and content of the Pathways program. Since Pathways has been at the core of efforts to take the school in a new direction, these differences may be crucial. <p>	Pathways enrolls all ninth-, tenth- and eleventh-graders in social studies and English classes that are supposed to be multi-graded, heterogeneously grouped, and designed around essential questions which guide each year's instruction. One Pathways team received the go-ahead to teach only ninth-graders next year and then to take that group through the next two years--a practice which breaks the original multi-grade pattern.<p>	The principal and one of the Pathways coordinators helped the group gain an affirmative vote for the new program from most of the Pathways teachers.<p>	The originators of the new program place an emphasis on what they call "a more demanding curriculum" that may prove worth considering by all Pathways teachers. Since we were unable to discover the details of that curriculum, we will have to wait for subsequent visits to know just how challenging it will be for students.<p>	Some faculty expressed concerns that the originators of this new program are elitist and will end up working with only the best ninth-grade students. They were also concerned that the teachers will not integrate subject matters or engage the students in the kind of collaborative learning activities advocated for Pathways students. On the other hand, the new Pathways unit could pilot some ideas about personalization of instruction. <p>	Those advocating the new program believe it will be stronger, because over the two-year period they will get to know parents better and will increase their ability to provide guidance to the students. In several such ways this program could become a prototype for a much-improved Pathways. However, the new effort is being led by people who tell us they want nothing to do with the others in the school and who reject collaboration outside their group.<p><h4>Teachers' Withdrawal from the Change Efforts</h4>While this team is insisting on separating itself from the others in Pathways, a number of individuals are simply withdrawing from interactions in the school. As one teacher put it, "Everyone is in their own little boxes."<p>	When pushed to explain their reasons for withdrawing, faculty members usually responded by indicating they were tired of fighting a battle without getting any reward or recognition, or they simply indicated they had all they could do to keep up with their classes without taking on "other people's problems."<p>	One teacher said, "I'm disappointed in the lack of leadership and direction. We don't know where we stand, so we keep to ourselves." Another said, "Some teachers are simply saying, 'What's the use?--it doesn't make any difference.'" Finally, a teacher told us: "I can't feel like I exist to the exclusion of everyone else, but it is coming down to that. I just avoid spending time outside of my own class area."<p>	The adults in the school do not have a common vision of where they are headed. As we have noted, people reveal this absence of vision by rejecting the stated philosophy of the school, by rejecting the idea of collaborating with one another to strengthen basic reform elements, and/or by deciding to retreat into their own departments and classrooms and ignore the task of whole-school change.<p>	In light of such problems, what can be done about this situation? <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="v:sft"><H3>Vision: Suggestions For The Staff</H3>We invited the staff to consider the following suggestions, and discuss whether any of them would be helpful in strengthening the extent to which there is a common vision within Crossroads.<p><ul>	<li>	Would it be helpful to revisit the printed philosophy statement during the August meetings prior to the start of the school year? Would there be benefits to day-long discussions in small groups in which each group discusses a particular issue? Should such discussions be to gain better shared understanding of the existing document or to redesign the philosophy statement to be satisfactory to the current school community?<p>	<li>	Is there work related to accreditation of Crossroads which could be used as a basis for building a common vision?<p>	<li>	Could the administrator assigned to the school from the central office meet with the Governing Council to discuss ways of building faculty consensus on a vision?<p>	<li>	Would the vision be strengthened if the school invited the school board to meet at Crossroads next fall? During that meeting would the board and the Crossroads community both benefit if elected members from each department at the school explained to the board members how their department contributed to the written aims of the school?<p>	<li>	Would there be benefits from inviting state Re:Learning representatives to conduct a modified Trek for the faculty in the fall of 1993?2 Would this help bring on board the many new people who have joined the faculty since early conversations about the nine Common Principles?<p>	<li>	Could the state's Re:Learning staff meet with a random sample of faculty in order to develop suggestions for forging common direction?<p>	<li>	What if Pathways students prepared a video about Crossroads from the perspective of a broader, shared vision, which they could share with incoming eighth graders whose teachers now say they know little about the school? Could the video be structured to emphasize some values that faculty members agree on?<p>	<li>	Could the teachers who are creating the new Pathways program agree to monthly coffee sessions in which they discuss the progress they are making with other Pathways teachers? Would it be helpful to establish opportunities during the year for this group of teachers to meet with non-Pathways teachers who may be interested in their progress?<p>	<li>	Could the Governing Council agree on an orientation plan for new students at all grade levels for the fall of 1993-94 and then recruit students, parents, and teachers to help carry out the plan? Would such an orientation help build a common understanding of the school's direction?<p>	<li>	Are there other ideas which could be added to this list and then discussed within the faculty?<p></ul><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="dlac"><H3>Developing Leadership AndCooperation</H3>While discussing issues related to the establishment of a common vision at Crossroads, we have touched on our second theme: the status of leadership and cooperation in the school. The two themes are obviously closely related, since leaders help develop a common vision, and the sharing of goals is, in itself, a cooperative act.<p>	To us, leadership is the responsibility of faculty and administrators, not a responsibility assigned solely to a principal or department head. Moreover, cooperation has to exist throughout a school, not simply within a teaching team or between a principal and a faculty. One teacher's comment helps clarify the present conditions related to teacher engagement in leadership and cooperation: "There are teachers who would take a leadership role but they are so tired of fighting with everybody else that they have just said 'to heck with it.'"<p>	The matters of leadership and cooperation are often raised as finger-pointing exercises in which teachers lament that they have no one up front showing them the direction, and administrators express concerns about the unwillingness of teachers to work together toward any common end. In this section however, we wish to concentrate on these two matters as they relate to accomplishing Coalition reforms. <p>	In the spring of 1993, Crossroads teachers and administrators were considering several important new activities. Senior projects were to be implemented which, consistent with Coalition Principles, would serve as final Exhibitions of student learning. Each student would be expected to construct a portfolio which would reflect his or her academic progress. All students would enroll in advisory classes where teachers would guide them in their academic and personal growth. Block schedules would be implemented throughout the school, giving other academic areas the advantages of extended time heretofore allowed only for Pathways classes. Finally, Pathways classes would be changed through the introduction of a new format by one of the teams. This is a very ambitious reform agenda. Significant progress on such complex items requires the presence of effective leadership from administrative and teacher ranks and close cooperation among all elements of a school. <p>	The last of these, the modification of the Pathways program, we have already mentioned. Effective cooperation was required within the group initiating this change in order for them to complete their design. Outside their group, the principal and one of the Pathways coordinators, who crafted the agreement about the conditions under which the new program could operate, asserted their leadership to secure the vote of other Pathways teachers to support it. There appeared to be agreement among all parties that the new program would be implemented in the fall of 1993. <p>	Unfortunately, at this point both leadership and cooperation appeared to be breaking down. Some of the Pathways teachers who voted against the implementation of the new program continued to speak out against it. Pathways teachers absent when the vote was taken to modify the program spoke openly against it.3 Teachers who were not part of the Pathways faculty expressed their concerns about the new program in vigorous fashion, frequently attacking it as elitist, and occasionally as racist.4 The teachers within the group implementing the new program explained their unwillingness to cooperate further with their peers by asserting that the other Pathways teachers fail to conduct courses that are intellectually demanding or well taught. Students and parents expressed confusion about the program, reflecting, no doubt, the different stories about it that they had been hearing from various faculty members. <p><h4>Lack of Clarity about the Block Schedule</h4>The implementation of a block schedule for 1993-94 is a topic about which people were much less clear than the change in the Pathways program. As we noted in previous snapshots, the faculty voted in the spring of 1992 to adopt a block schedule. The principal vetoed this action, indicating that he believed there were too many teachers who could not use a single period effectively, let alone a period two hours long. He also indicated that he could not coordinate the proposed schedule with other schools from which some teachers (mostly coaches) came to Crossroads to teach the final period of the day. Moreover, he said, the proposed schedule would not fit with the vocational programs offered off campus for some Crossroads students.<p>	For several months, the faculty members' only response to this veto was anger over their wishes having been thwarted. However, in the spring of 1993 a department chair, who also serves on the Governing Council, proposed a new block schedule, which was the topic of conversation during the April visit.5 <p>	Consider the following dialogue between two teachers:<p>Alice:<blockquote> We are trying to handle student advisory, block scheduling, and portfolios. Isn't that enough?</blockquote>Nick:<blockquote> [The principal] said he loved the block scheduling as proposed, but we have seen no forward movement with this. [The principal has] had it in his hand since before spring break, and we don't know when our next in-service is.</blockquote>Alice:<blockquote> [A teacher] did the block schedule. I don't really know if everyone likes it. . . .I think that with some of the teachers, block scheduling will be a disaster.</blockquote>Nick:<blockquote> We had some consultants come in who had the statistics that show that blocks really work. They have three subjects that they study for one night; their concentration is more focused.</blockquote>Alice:<blockquote> My biggest worries are the teachers who can't do an hour. And again, that's an administrative job, not mine.</blockquote>	We could list a number of other interview responses and conversations that reveal basically the same feelings in many adults at the school. However, the preceding conversation incorporates many of the typical concerns: <p><ol>	<li>	The proposal itself and the benefits expected from it are not clear.<p>	<li>	Teachers and administrators are not sure of each other's views on the proposal.<p>	<li>	The process for gaining clarity and understanding of each other's views is not clear. ("We don't know when the next in-service will be.") If anything is true about Crossroads, it is that processes for gaining and maintaining agreement are not well designed or commonly understood.<p>	<li>	Teachers and administrators lack confidence in what some of their colleagues can do.<p>	<li>	Teachers and administrators tend to see the job of making improvements as someone else's. ("This is an administrative job, not mine," or "The teachers have to assume responsibility.")<p>	<li>	Teachers are not sure of the principal's position on the proposal. One teacher claimed that the principal had told him, while they were both at an athletic event six weeks earlier, that there would be a secret ballot on the proposal. Another teacher in the same discussion said, "This was the first I have heard [about the block schedule] since last year."<p></ol>	Students expressed some of the same confusion about the block proposal that adults connected with the school expressed. One told us, <p><blockquote>I think the block schedule will be one class for two hours, and then you won't have that class the next day. The math and sciences want that a lot because of the labs. Some of the teachers I have talked to aren't real excited about this. They say that kids lose interest after the first hour. I think that as long as the teacher can break things up into intervals, it would be OK.</blockquote>	For most of the students, queries about what would be different next year led to discussion of a seven-period schedule with shorter passing times--a schedule that apparently reflects conversation about the proposed addition of an advisory period. During our visit no one, student or adult, linked the block schedule and advisory room proposal together except for one teacher who said he thought the new proposal for a block schedule had a once-a-week advisory period built into it.<p><h4>Confusion about the Advisory Program</h4>The students, however, are not the only ones confused about the proposed addition of an advisory room program. Students' comments that passing time will be three, five, or seven minutes reveal the different stories they have been hearing from teachers about the impact of adding an advisory period into their schedule. Some of the students talking about next year's schedule were convinced the changes were being made simply so they would not get into trouble by having such a long passing time. Teachers and other adults in the school are in disagreement concerning who will conduct the advisory section, with some noting that all professionals (including administrators and counselors) are to have such groups and others saying it will be just the teachers.<p>	According to some teachers, a part of the confusion seems to have started because after a decision had been made to initiate advisory periods, a visit to another high school revealed problems with the proposed model. The story of what has happened since the identification of these problems varies depending on who was describing it. One group of teachers described the advisory proposal with the following comments:<p><blockquote>We're to meet with fifteen to sixteen students for twenty minutes a day, between second and third. We're the conduit for relating to parents. Other teachers can come and talk to us. </blockquote><blockquote>We are also supposed to be talking with students about portfolios and making sure that there are credit checks and that they are in the right classes.</blockquote><blockquote>There will be four students of each grade level and each teacher will have an advisory.</blockquote><blockquote>I know that we voted on the daily advisory, but is that in stone? I understood that there was a possibility that we wouldn't because it didn't work. There were problems with it at [the high school visited by some Crossroads faculty].</blockquote><blockquote>It will come up with Governing Council.</blockquote><blockquote>There must be someplace in between every day and only a few times a year.</blockquote><blockquote>I think we are rushing it to start in the fall. I don't think we are ready.</blockquote>	This conversation reveals another aspect of the problems of leadership and cooperation detailed in the seven items listed concerning the discussion of block scheduling: <cite>Once decisions are made at Crossroads, they are understood variously by individuals and have a tendency to unravel. </cite><p>	Such was certainly the case during 1992-93 with the decisions made concerning students who were tardy and those who were absent. In the spring of 1992, the faculty worked out a consensus position on these issues. Several weeks later the tardiness provisions in the policy were being implemented as agreed upon, but disagreement was already evident within the faculty concerning what their decision had been regarding attendance. By the spring of 1993, the prior agreements on both aspects of student attendance appeared to have vanished, and it was every teacher and administrator for him- or herself.6<p>	Such breakdowns in agreements seem to be a combination of unclear communication from those in leadership positions and the deliberate rejection of agreements by various faculty members. When these factors are played out over several years, the high turnover of faculty and the failure to acquaint new faculty with a clear set of expectations also contribute to the problem. In any event, these communication breakdowns point to problems of leadership and lack of cooperation within the school community. <p><h4>Disagreement about Portfolios</h4>Part of the confusion associated with the status of the advisory room plan appears to be caused by disagreement about the closely related plan to initiate portfolios for each student. Some teachers were convinced that beginning in the fall of 1993, portfolios would be kept as part of the new advisory room responsibilities; others thought the matter was still subject to discussion. Students had obviously heard various interpretations of this decision, since some of them indicated that teachers were already requiring them to keep information in their portfolios that would be part of their senior Exhibition.<p>	One teacher's comment sums up the situation: "I don't know if that [particular approach to portfolios] was approved. There's some multiple feelings that we have talked this to death and others feel that we should do more. Everyone agrees that it should happen." The response to this comment by another teacher reveals that it is a situation not unlike the others we have been discussing: "I'm surprised about the reactions in this group because I thought this [decision regarding portfolios] was <cite>it</cite>."<p><h4>Confusion about the Senior Project</h4>Uncertainty about the decisions concerning the advisory and portfolio initiatives is directly connected with the confusion concerning the senior project. Some teachers believed that the senior project was to be the ultimate outcome of the portfolio project and was to be implemented during 1993-94. Some students about to become seniors had the impression that they would be required to complete a senior project in order to graduate; others had not heard of such a project.<p>	Students were also confused about what such a project was. One student emphatically told us, "It sounds like a really stupid idea." He said faculty members had been talking about such projects ever since his class were freshmen. "An example they use every year," he said, "is building a canoe. I think that building a canoe as the only way you get to graduate doesn't make sense." When we asked this student whether the project was supposed to be related to portfolios, he said he had never heard about portfolios so he couldn't answer that.	Unfortunately, the teachers' conversations about advisory, portfolios, and senior projects suggest that they are as bewildered as the student. Teachers' and administrators' failure to cooperate produces confusion. The absence of leadership in the faculty and administration perpetuates the confusion.<p><h4>Disagreements about the Governing Council</h4>In addition to the differences within the faculty and between the faculty and administration with regard to each of the major innovations being considered for next year, members of the school community continue to disagree about the efficacy of the Governing Council. A new leader has been chosen for the Council, and meetings have resumed on a once-a-month basis for one hour during lunchtime. We observed meetings of this group during our previous visits; during this visit we attended one operating under the new leadership.<p>	The April Governing Council meeting began with a discussion of whether there was a quorum and of how many it took to achieve a quorum. The parent and student representatives were not present. Most of the meeting was devoted to debate over a proposal for a locker check to locate books. Tension seemed unusually high in the room, considering the apparently routine nature of the issue. Eventually the motion to have such a search passed with ten favoring, one opposing, and one abstaining.<p>	After the vote, discussion continued: "I don't think it will work--take too long. . . ." "Did we just vote on this or not?" . . . "We're discussing how . . ." After more discussion, two more votes were taken about the details of implementation. In one sense this discussion is a micro-example of the way the school seems to function on most major decisions: make it, then discuss it, then end up confused about what was decided.<p>	Following this discussion, the chair mentioned that he had a flow chart that had been used to guide decision making at another Coalition high school. He told the Council he would copy it and distribute it to them. He asked for questions, but there were none.<p>	The Council then turned to the upcoming Spring Fest and to concerns that the senior class was not following procedures adopted earlier by the Council. Ten members voted in favor of the senior class's being required to follow the rules; one person abstained. The meeting closed with an announcement of the showing of a school video all day on channel 4 and an announcement of the date of the next meeting: May 5. <p>	Teachers complained that the Governing Council does not have any authority--that administrators veto actions. They also complained that it does not deal with significant issues. Within the Council a few individuals dominate the conversation. Discussion tends to be confrontational. Some longtime faculty members told us they believe that the current Council members do not really care about the Council.<p>	During our visit, the status of the Council in relation to district policy on school-based management was unclear. Subsequent to our April visit, the school received authorization from the central administration to assume more responsibility for dealing with budget issues through its Governing Council. Whether this central recognition will really make a difference in the school's view of its Council remains to be seen.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="mtof"><H3>Missing The OpportunitiesFor Collaboration</H3>In a high school there are many possibilities for leadership and cooperation that relate directly to the instructional program. The computer science teacher did work with faculty committees and with individual teachers to generate specific projects for her class. The librarian collaborated with teachers in science as well as teachers in subjects more traditionally associated with the library, such as social studies and English, to help develop reference sources for major projects.	Pathways teachers described a project in which students studying social movements and environmental issues did a tour of the building. On that tour they discovered a problem with ventilation in industrial education classrooms. As a result of their findings they decided to raise money for masks for students working in the area.<p>	Too often at Crossroads, these possibilities do not become realities. Pathways teachers and the drama teacher told us of making use of student productions such as <cite>Working, Our Town</cite>, and <cite>Into the Woods </cite>to help each other develop students' literary and dramatic knowledge. But when the drama department produced a musical which won rave reviews and made more money than any other of its productions, we are told, there was no collaboration with the strong music department or with visual arts.<p>	Athletes had their most successful year, leading students to attend tournaments during school time; yet we saw no evidence of any department's taking advantage of this success. When chances were there for mathematics, science, and English assignments that used student enthusiasm about their peers' success, the teachers in these fields complained instead about the interruptions to their classes. Teachers in mathematics and foreign language classes demonstrated skills in a wide variety of instructional techniques, but we have seen no evidence of the sharing of such skills outside of departments. Drafting and vocational teachers received praise from students, but we saw no evidence of cooperation with them when Pathways teachers dealt with an essential question focused on work in America.<p>	In fact, we have seen little evidence of collaboration of instructional content or methodology among teachers in any segment of the school. Not only did we find no examples of such cooperation, we saw no evidence of leadership's creating forums for such sharing and cooperative planning. Maybe, as some schools are concluding, the faculty of a comprehensive high school is too large and diverse a group to expect authentic cooperation without creating small houses or families which enable teachers to communicate across grade levels and subject matters.<p>	As we talked with teachers and administrators at the school, it became more and more apparent that there are problems of leadership and cooperation:<p><ul>	<li>	Faculty and administrative leaders have not been able to create consensus around proposals to move ahead when that consensus has been required across the faculty rather than within a teaching team.<p>	<li>	The Governing Council as an agency officially designed to help with these tasks falls short of accomplishing its mission. <p>	<li>	Cooperation and leadership are also lacking when it comes to focusing the curriculum and taking advantage of the many skills possessed by different faculty members.<p></ul>As we turn to possibilities for the future, we offer a variety of suggestions for developing stronger leadership and cooperation. Many of the options identified draw on strengths of the people of Crossroads.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="l:sft"><H3>Leadership: Suggestions For The Staff</H3>We invited the staff to consider the following suggestions concerning leadership. We asked them to discuss whether any of them would be helpful in strengthening the quality of leadership and cooperation at Crossroads. We asked them to be explicit in describing what would have to be done to implement any one of them.<p><h4>Among Administrators and Teachers</h4><ul>	<li>	What if each department in the school elected an individual who would meet weekly with the principal to determine topics for all school faculty meetings and establish priorities for Governing Council discussions?<p>	<li>	Would the principal benefit from convening a small group elected by parents and teachers who could have monthly breakfast sessions with him to review how matters are going at the school?<p>	<li>	Would the school benefit if the principal delegated more responsibility for discipline and routine management to the assistant principals in order to free himself to work with instructional teams?<p>	<li>	Does the district administration, Re:Learning, or the State Department of Education have a process-oriented individual who could be invited in to work with planning and carrying out meetings?<p></ul><h4>In the Governing Council</h4><ul>	<li>	Could Governing Council meetings be held twice a month, with every other meeting being held in the evening to accommodate increased parent participation and more extended discussion of significant issues?<p>	<li>	Could a member of the central administra-tion be encouraged to attend the Governing Council meetings on a regular basis so the school would have a better idea of support they could expect when they make decisions that require district-level review?<p>	<li>	Would it be useful for the video class to videotape a Governing Council meeting with the Council members committed to viewing the tape during their next meeting as a means of helping them strengthen their processes? Would having regular tapes available of each Governing Council meeting increase knowledge of Council actions among faculty who are not on the Council?<p></ul><h4>On a Reform Agenda</h4><ul>	<li>	Would something be gained if the school decided to concentrate on a single reform agenda for 1993-94? For example, would it be beneficial if it focused only on trying to make a block schedule or advisory rooms work? Could agreement on such an agenda be reached during a pre-school planning retreat?<p>	<li>	For at least the first three months of the year, would the school develop better understanding of the expectations concerning matters such as block schedules and advisory rooms by holding one-period meetings which each faculty member was required to attend during his or her free period? If each member attended two such meetings twice a month for three months, would there be better understanding of proposed initiatives and expectations for cooperation regarding them?<p>	<li>	Could consideration be given to breaking the school into four families of approximately three hundred students? Could the school allow each family to determine, within parameters of a generally held schoolwide vision, the extent to which it wished to block instruction and give it discretion in how to implement ideas such as Exhibitions?<p>	<li>	Is there someone from one of the local colleges or from the nearby state university who is an expert on portfolios and could be used, with support from Re:Learning or district funds, to help the faculty learn more about this approach to keeping track of student learning? Would learning more enhance cooperation on portfolios?<p>	<li>	Could those teachers who want to adopt block schedules devise a plan where they take leadership in helping teachers who may be fearful of this approach? Could special mentoring arrangements be set up with these teachers so they use the extended time to the benefit of students?<p>	<li>	Could music teachers and athletic coaches who have developed effective parental support for their work share ideas with the faculty concerning how this could be done with other programs?<p>	<li>	Could the journalism class take on the task of reporting, on video and in writing,  the results of school discussions ? For example, could they do an interview program once a week where they talked with the principal and the chair of the Governing Council about recent decisions on matters such as the block schedule or tardy policies? Maybe this show could be watched during the new advisory periods.<p>	<li>	Could the video class in the school be recruited to work with a group of teachers in preparing tapes showing examples of senior projects, so students and teachers alike could understand the potential power of such events? Could this class or some other source be used to obtain samples of projects in other schools that could serve as object lessons?<p></ul><h4>Building Cooperation into the Culture of the School</h4><ul>	<li>	Could each new teacher be assigned an experienced teacher as a mentor, beginning the week prior to the opening of school in the fall? Could a part of such mentoring be an orientation to the school's vision and to new activities of the school such as advisory rooms or block schedules? Would a pre-school-year meeting of mentors help them be consistent in the suggestions they make to the new faculty members?<p>	<li>	Could teachers who are concerned that others in the school do not understand the culture from which their students come help conduct informal discussions that would expand this understanding?<p>	<li>	Could the Spanish teachers we watched, who tend to make good use of class time with students engaged in a variety of learning activities, share their approach with other teachers?<p>	<li>	During each visit we have heard increasing complaints about morale at the school. Much of the morale problem at Crossroads seems related to salaries that are obviously too low. What if the faculty decided to conduct summer seminars for other teachers throughout the nation? The community is one which many people love to visit. Perhaps sessions could be developed that would demonstrate how to work with advisory programs, how to conduct good senior projects, how to make use of portfolios to guide student progress. Teachers and administrators from elsewhere in the country could pay fees to Crossroads to conduct the sessions.<p>			Getting ready to conduct such sessions, teachers at Crossroads would have to develop expertise and agreement among themselves. The connections several teachers have with the local fine arts community could be used to develop valuable cultural experiences for the visitors. A local college could be invited to provide some staff and give credits to the educators attending the sessions. Incoming ninth-graders could be used as students for the program to give them an introduction to the expectations at Crossroads before their school year begins. <p>	<li>	Are there other options which should be added to this list and then discussed within the school community?<p></ul><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="conc"><H3>Conclusion</H3>During this visit the students shared with us their interpretations of challenging classes. They gave us examples from math, science, Pathways, music, drafting, Spanish, drama, and athletics. They told us stories of teachers--good and bad. They expressed concerns about the turnover of teachers, particularly in physics and English. They responded with facility to open-ended questions, similar to those used in the new assessment process in Kentucky. They shared their hopes and fears about the future.<p>	In class, we watched them tangle with basic economic concepts, play the stock market using a simulation developed by a nearby university, and, in other cases, engage in many traditional learning activities. We saw them celebrate as they received good report cards and mourn when the grades were lower than expected. <p>	Along with the students and many of the teachers at Crossroads, we continue to worry about the large number of students who drop out and about the attendance problems which interfere with learning. We also continue to worry about the lack of solid information about these problems, and we worry about comments from some adults in the school which suggest that the student behaviors are all that can be expected from "this kind of student."<p>	If the adults associated with the school can develop a common vision and agree on ways to strengthen leadership and cooperation, they will have made progress in selecting the right road to constructive whole-school change. The direction they choose will be vitally important to them and to the students. The lives of all these students are too important to allow them to receive less than the best possible education.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="partii"><HR><CENTER><H2>PART II<BR>From the Crossroads School Change Committee</h2></center><hr>When early drafts of the first part of this snapshot were submitted to the Crossroads faculty and administration for review, several responded with copies of the material which makes up the bulk of Part 1.

This process bridges the gap between student and adult roles as well as helps children contribute to their own present and future well being and to that of the family, school, and community to which they belong.	The portfolio will include the following nine performance areas:1.	Autobiography	Each year an aspect of the autobiography will be implemented:	Four Year Plan: Reading--Research--Remembering-Writing		 9th Grade -	Reading Autobiographies		10th Grade -	Research--Cultural History/Family Tree		11th Grade -	Remembering--Vis a vie--Journal		12th Grade -	Writing--Autobiography	Objectives:		* Build self-esteem		* Synthesize life's experiences		* Communicate a sense of history		* Create a sense of family, community, and culture		* Establish lines of communication with extended family and 						community		* See evolution of self through choices they've made		* Prepare for their future role as a family/societal member2.	Resume	A resume provides an impression of preparedness, helps students identify strengths and skills, provides a scope for a vision of what needs to be developed throughout their secondary school years, and is an essential tool for employment. The students will refine career goals, upgrade resumes, acquire higher education goals and community service related to career objectives, interview, and meet the format criteria for resumes.3.	Post-Secondary Component	The purpose of this component focuses on necessary exposure to preparation for career plans after graduation.	Four-Year Plan:		9th Grade - Early career exposure and articulation of future goals		10th Grade - PSAT and PACT testing		11th Grade - Credit checks, school correspondence, interest inventory, campus visits		12th Grade - Credit checks, SAT/ACT testing, reaffirmation of goals and intent, final correspondence and commitment4.	Communications	The ability to write skillfully, read widely, and speak effectively is a practical component of everyday life. Along with media literacy, these survival skills combine interpretive and organizational abilities. Evidence of developmental growth in these areas will be included for each high school year and should be drawn from various scholastic disciplines.5.	Health Component	The purpose of this component is to increase awareness of health concerns. Emphasis: help the students develop and maintain healthy lifestyles, including recognition of nutrition, exercise and disease, awareness of school and community services available that promote good health and treat disease. Assessment will be generated from a student survey, projects and research into healthy foods, physical education and teen issues.6.	Senior Projects	Beginning freshman year, students prepare to do a presentation around an essential question of choice. This will include a research paper and oral/visual components. A team of four from the school community will advise and mentor the students' progress. Evidence of synthesis and organization of information will exhibit thoughtful habits of mind through critical use of knowledge.7.	Ecological Awareness	Environmental problems are the most compelling problems faced by modern human society, and environmental science is a rapidly growing job field. Many diverse problems of social organization have become environmental in nature. Each student must choose an area of ecological awareness as a research project. The criteria will require a research and a physical model. The timeline for this component will require completion by the end of the sophomore year.8.	Community Service	Community service projects will provide wholistic learning and allow for community participation with the school and vice-versa. Each student will select their sites and complete 25 hours per year. All hours will be completed by the first semester of senior year.	Objectives:		* Build critical thinking skills		* Develop a service ethic		* Teach leadership skills		* Increase sense of social responsibility		* Provide career exploration9.	Growth Continuum	The growth continuum component is designed to facilitate educational and career planning and goal setting on a personal level. The four-year plan includes such elements as graduation requirements, a four-year schedule, completion of tests (PACT, ACT, PSAT, SAT, etc.) and interpretations, official transcripts, etc.</pre><p><hr><hr><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tscc"><H3>The School Change Committee Material:Questions For The Staff And Reader</H3>We asked the staff to consider the following questions about the School Change Committee material. We invite the reader of this snapshot to do the same. Use the memo from the School Change Committee and pertinent information in Part 1 to help you prepare your responses.<p><ul>	<li>	If you were the principal or a faculty leader at Crossroads, what would you do to be sure the moves to block schedules, advisory periods, and student Exhibitions were explicitly tied to the school's philosophy?<p>	<li>	What questions remain to be answered concerning the innovations (block schedule, advisory, portfolio) from the point of view of students? Of parents? Of teachers? <p>	<li>	What process should be followed to answer questions which remain for each group? To what extent does that process appear to be provided for by the memo?<p>	<li>	If you were responsible for planning the full-day orientation for parents on Friday of the first week of school, what would you include on the agenda?<p>	<li>	To what extent do the central administration and board need to approve the changes indicated in the memo? What process is needed to be sure they are taken?<p>	<li>	How should the success of these changes be evaluated? Who should be responsible for the evaluation?<p>	<li>	The <cite>Horace </cite>article referred to in the memo on page 15 is in volume 7, number 1, for September 1990. What other resources might be helpful to people asked to understand the proposed changes? (For example, would reading the sample Exhibitions and other content in Ted Sizer's <cite>Horace's School </cite>be helpful?)<p>	<li>	Although this memo has been mailed to all faculty, now that school is nearly ready to start, some faculty believe the proposed block schedule and the advisory period should be changed so that the advisory does not meet as listed. Apparently, some believe such a session should be longer, others think it should be less frequent, while some still are not convinced it is a good idea. How should these views be processed at the school?<p>	<li>	What is likely to be the biggest obstacle to successful implementation of these innovations? What acts, by whom, are most apt to assure success?<p>	<li>	What other questions need to be considered?<p></ul><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><hr><H3>Notes</H3><OL><li> See Richard W.

From our week of observations in classrooms and conversations with people in the school community--students, teachers, administrators, and parents--we produced the following "snapshot" to describe what it is like to learn and to teach at Crossroads at this point in its process of whole-school change. <p>	Located in a culturally rich city in the beautiful southwest, Crossroads High School draws its eleven hundred students mainly from the city's low-income population. Over 75 percent of the students are Hispanic, and another 3 percent are from other minority groups. <p>	Crossroads was created to be an innovative school. One of its innovative features, the Pathways program, features multi-age, interdisciplinary learning in blocked periods, and assessment through Exhibitions of written, oral, and visual presentations.1 Its second innovative feature, the Governing Council, includes students, a parent, teachers, and administrators, who participate in shared decision making on school issues. In addition, Crossroads' mission statement is the school's version of the nine Common Principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools. (See Appendix B for a listing of the Principles.)<p>	When we first visited this high school, we named it <cite>Crossroads </cite>because it seemed to be at a critical point on its path to restructuring.2 If it turned one way, we thought, it could make major progress toward becoming an Essential school; taking another course could leave it a typical "shopping mall high school."<p>	This snapshot, produced during the third year of our visits, depicts Crossroads at the beginning of its sixth year as a high school. While it is still not clear which road the school will take, several changes were in the air as school opened for the 1993-94 year.<p>	During this visit we were particularly interested in finding out three things: what changes had occurred since our previous visit, how the school was progressing in its change efforts, and what problems the school was facing at this point in time. We conclude the snapshot by reflecting on our visit in terms of the three themes of the School Change Study: how schools move from partial support to whole-school change, what factors support the momentum of change, and how ideas guiding change--particularly, the Nine Common Principles--are translated into practice.<p>	At the end of the main sections of the snapshot, we include suggested questions for reflection. Originally these questions were given to the people at Crossroads following the visit; we invite the reader as well to use the questions as guides for reflection and discussion.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="whca"><hr><center><h2>What Has Changed at Crossroads?</h2></center><hr>Since our last visit, several major changes occurred at Crossroads. Among these were the new schedule; the new performing arts program, which functioned as a school-within-a-school; and the new classrooms. The advisory program and the implementation of portfolio assessments were both in the process of development.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tnmb"><h3>The New Modified-Block Schedule</h3><blockquote>Many things have changed at Crossroads this year. One of the most talked about changes is the new schedule. Some students like the changes but some don't. (Editorial from the September 1993 issue of school paper)</blockquote>Of the many changes referred to by the student editorial writer, the most obvious was the new class schedule, the result of a compromise between advocates of a block schedule and those who wanted to preserve the school's traditional seven-period schedule.<p>	As of the end of October (the schedule was still undergoing revisions after our visit), in the new schedule, first and seventh periods continue as single, fifty-five minute periods each day. Fourth period is lunch. On Mondays and Wednesdays, second and sixth periods meet for 120 minutes as a block of time. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, third and fifth periods meet as blocks. All morning classes meet for forty-five minutes on Friday, with a thirty-minute advisory period inserted in the morning. Afternoon classes on Fridays meet for fifty-five minutes.<p>	An essential ingredient in the compromise that led to the establishment of this schedule was the commitment to daily first- and seventh-period classes. It is during these times that athletic turnouts begin (girls during first period and boys during seventh) and several teachers come to the school from other locations to teach and coach.<p>	We arrived at Crossroads a few days after a parent open house, at which several teachers reportedly blasted the new schedule, leading some parents and faculty to conclude that it had a short life ahead of it. On balance, however, we found more support than opposition for the new schedule.3 Consider the following examples of comments shared with us by people at the school.<p><h4>Students' Reactions to the New Schedule</h4>Many students had positive remarks concerning the new time arrangements.<p><blockquote>I like the new schedule. Students now have more time in class to ask questions and are able to get a better understanding of what's being taught. If students are having trouble with a particular problem or concept, they can ask the teacher for help instead of struggling with it at home.</blockquote><blockquote>I think it is a good change. I find it easier in classes, such as science or math, when you are doing a lab or learning new material. But I think it can make it more difficult when it comes to tardies. If someone is absent one day, it can be difficult to make up work or get notes that you might have missed.</blockquote><blockquote>I really like it because it gives me more time to do my work and it also gives other students more of an opportunity to finish up their work without trying to do it in a rush. </blockquote><blockquote>I really enjoy having two hours of my humanities classes. I have more time to do my work in class. . . .Also, since I have only four classes a day, I have less homework. This is important to me since I have a job and get home at about eleven at night.</blockquote><blockquote>It allows the students to get a better grasp of the concepts taught in class, especially in difficult classes like science or math.</blockquote><blockquote>I think the new scheduling will help me in the future when I have to sit in class and listen to a long lecture in college.</blockquote><blockquote>It will prevent ditching because missing an entire class will leave the students severely behind in class.</blockquote><blockquote>I like it. . . .You don't have to interrupt things; you can carry over and accomplish things. You don't have to see the same teacher every day. Most of the people I talk to like it. Some people don't because of lectures and the style of teaching. </blockquote><blockquote>It's pretty hard. It helps a lot of students. They have time for homework and for learning and not so much pressure outside of school with personal lives. . . .Fridays seem twice as long as the other days. . . . </blockquote><blockquote>Half of the teachers like block, some don't. . . .I think it depends on the attitude of the teacher.</blockquote><blockquote>It helps in AP classes. I don't want to think how it would be if we did not have block for them, because we barely finish the work. It's also good in science because we can complete labs.</blockquote><blockquote>Bakery and industrial arts have more time to work on what they are doing.</blockquote><blockquote>I really like the block schedule and I have three classes a day where I can get concentrated homework done every night.</blockquote><blockquote>At first I wasn't sure of the blocks. But actually, for some classes, like calculus and physics, they are really good. We have time to do our labs . . . and I think most of the kids like it. Teachers' complaints about it are that when they lecture, they are done with forty-five minutes left in the period and they have nothing left to say.</blockquote><blockquote>My senior year is going to be better than I thought. It seems like it's more fun being here. . . .I think the blocks are making the difference. . . .The teachers who don't like it really let you know it. It seems that more like it than not.</blockquote>	As the school's paper said, some students were not happy with the schedule.<p><blockquote>Personally, I think it is worthless at the high school level. The students' attention span is shorter than an hour. In my foreign language class, the two hours are so boring. Science is great because of the labs. But for the rest of the classes it is worthless. I hear complaints from both teachers and students.</blockquote><blockquote>Some students don't like being in typing for two hours. [Other students offered different examples of classes that, to them, were "boring" or "too long" with the block schedule.]</blockquote><blockquote>Blocking is stupid because if you miss a class you miss two days.</blockquote><blockquote>We shouldn't have blocks because I am bored.</blockquote><blockquote>I think block scheduling could be better if we had the right teachers to do it--but my teachers are still doing it regularly. They should have time management for teachers.</blockquote><blockquote>I don't care for the block scheduling because it is too confusing, and it's hard to concentrate for two hours on the same subject.</blockquote><blockquote>As a student of three years attending Crossroads High School, I find it difficult to keep up with the constant changes. I, like many other students, feel we're playing the part of a  guinea pig. . . .The new block schedule prohib-its people from using the restroom. . . .</blockquote><blockquote>Also, teachers spend more time giving work that doesn't mean anything, or help the student, because by the middle of the second hour the student's attention span is short. Teachers need to know what to plan for two hours, so work won't be overloaded or students won't be left for forty-five minutes not knowing what to do.</blockquote><h4>Teachers' Reactions to the New Schedule</h4>Many teachers spoke positively concerning the new time schedule.<p><blockquote>I love the block schedule. The school is divided about it. The loudest complainers are Pathways. There is one teacher in particular who is leading the fight. When I talked to her, she said her lesson plans from last year did not work--kids can't do grammar for two hours. . . .Teachers have to come up with new approaches. As far as I'm concerned, I love it. I'm in a lab situation and that helps. . . .It takes five or ten minutes to get started in any class so, in percentage of time, I lose more time in my one-period class. </blockquote><blockquote>I enjoy it with my language classes, especially with second- and third-year classes. . . .I am enjoying block classes more than others. You can get into grammar and vocabulary and are able to accomplish a lot of work. </blockquote><blockquote>I love it in word processing and business math. It gives me time to go around and check on student progress. </blockquote><blockquote>All my students in blocks are learning more than students in single-period classes. [At least four teachers made this  assertion.] </blockquote><blockquote>I like it--no problems. Doesn't seem to be middle ground among the faculty members; either people like it or they don't. </blockquote><blockquote>I like the block classes because I am able to go at a slower pace and give the kids better practice, so they really understand what I am teaching. My block class is really ahead of my first period class in the same subject--I could tell when I was correcting papers this weekend. Some teachers are having trouble with the block and we have offered to help them, but they refuse to work outside of school to adapt their work to the new schedule.</blockquote><blockquote>The block schedule means more work for me. In order to keep them working for two hours, and to break up the monotony for the kids, I work two lessons. It's harder, but I don't mind it. I think it helps the kids prepare for college.</blockquote><blockquote>I'm ecstatic over the block schedule. Kids are doing things I have never seen before. . . .In theory there is the same contact time for all students, but the ones in the block are getting sustained teaching and attention.</blockquote><blockquote>I like the block scheduling, although those of us in Pathways have been blocking all along. I do have a tough fifth-period class. It takes me an entire two hours to cover basic material. They are very needy. I am thankful for the two hours, because to start up every day is too tough.</blockquote>	As was the case with students, not all teachers agreed with the block schedule. Some had no use for it; others had suggestions for altering it.<p><blockquote>The schedule is physically killing me. I hate it. I don't have a prep two days a week. With thirty-three ninth-graders for two hours--they don't even have a place to sit.</blockquote><blockquote>I don't think it affects Pathways. It's fine with me because we've always done our classes this way. The only difference is that it is confusing for knowing when to plan in advance for which days. I don't have a prep two days out of five and this is exhausting.</blockquote><blockquote>I love it and I hate it. Two hours in the afternoon with ninth-graders is too much. I spend too much time to settle them down.</blockquote><blockquote>I can't get away to go to the bathroom. I don't get to go but once a day. I can't leave my classes unattended. One boy hit another today.</blockquote><blockquote>If we keep the blocks I am leaving.</blockquote><blockquote>Have you talked with the PE teachers? They said they are exhausted. They need to change what they are doing. </blockquote><blockquote>That's one of the weaknesses--teachers did not get methods classes in college or they have the same curriculum that they've been teaching for twenty years and all in fifty-five-minute blocks. </blockquote><blockquote>Blocks don't work for the middle track of students. I have made my opinion known to the principal based on my many years of teaching. . . . You need planning for using a whole long period like a block and we don't have it. We should change the schedule so that there is just a block on Tuesday and Thursday, rather than on four days each week. </blockquote><blockquote>I see little hope. I need to make a disclaimer that you shouldn't even be interviewing me. I started out the year really depressed--with so much controversy over block scheduling. . . .</blockquote><h4>Parents' Reactions to the New Schedule</h4>Parents, too, had their own mixed reviews of the new schedule.<p><blockquote>I know the parents are not happy with blocks where kids have to sit for two hours. </blockquote><blockquote>The block schedule prevented my daughter from being in a cooperative work program. [After another parent asked if this meant the Distributive Education Clubs of America program had been dropped, this parent clarified:] Well, what I meant was she would have had to drop two classes to be involved in the program.</blockquote><blockquote>I can see good and bad things about the blocking--cuts down on skipping because they are in class longer. But if they are going to have a big test they don't have a chance to review questions with the teacher the day before the test. [This point of view was clarified by another parent who pointed out that the teacher whose tests the parent was talking about is always at school by seven in the morning, so the daughter could still get help before the test.]</blockquote><blockquote>For some classes it works well. For others it is twice as boring as before, only now they have to stick it out for longer periods.</blockquote>	Parents with whom we spoke insisted they had not been engaged in discussions concerning the block schedule before it was implemented. One parent pointed out that it had been discussed and acted on by the school's Governing Council, which includes parent representation. However, most agreed with one who indicated that the first time he heard anything about it was when kids signed up for school this year. <p><h4>Administrators' Reactions to the New Schedule</h4>In contrast with people at the school, all of whom identified the block schedule when asked what was new in the fall of 1993, two of three central administrators interviewed failed to mention it. When prompted, one of those two acknowledged that some changes in the schedule had been made, but, since there had been little parent reaction, there was little concern about the changes. A board member echoed this central administrator, noting, "I haven't heard any negative things towards it. I've heard very little about it. If there were anything negative, I would hear." <p>	At the school, the administrative staff members' reactions were generally in terms of the reduced confusion in the hallways as a consequence of students being inside classrooms for longer blocks of time. One building administrator perceptively summarized the situation as follows:<p><blockquote>The block schedule is working where teachers are being innovative at looking at instruction and not doing the same thing over and over again for two hours. They are engaging students in hands-on acts. Those that are doing the same thing are frustrated. This is reflected in the students. When they have different methodologies, then they are happy. </blockquote><h4>Has the Block Schedule Changed Instruction?</h4>During the first two years of our visits, one of the most frequent complaints by a group of teachers was that a majority of them had voted in favor of operating a block schedule but had been denied the opportunity by the administration. Now that that opportunity had been realized, at least in a modified form, the key question becomes, what changes can be noted in the classroom? Opinions of various groups aside, is what is happening in the classroom now any different from what was happening before? <p>	There are several problems in answering this question definitively. Turnover in faculty (close to 30 percent each year, or approximately fourteen new staff members during each year of the study) makes it hard for us to compare teaching from one year to the next. Also, our observations in the fall of 1993 were made early in the implementation of the new schedule, while teachers and students alike were trying to learn how best to take advantage of it.<p>	Although we observed twenty-nine periods of instruction across a number of disciplines with a variety of teachers over a four-day period, what we saw is hardly an exhaustive sampling of instruction. Therefore, some of our views of what was happening in the classroom are shaped by reports from interviewees. <p>	As several students, teachers, and administrators observed, the change in schedule seemed to have no impact on what happened in some classrooms. In fact, some teachers seemed to make an extra effort to make sure they continued with business as usual.<p>	One Pathways team, for example, was careful to pass students from one teacher to another at the end of the conventional periods within the block. To prevent the students from "getting loose" as they moved between the teachers' rooms, the teachers formed a human wall separating the passing students from the school hallways. Once inside the classrooms, students diagrammed sentences or listened to lectures and responded to short-answer questions, much as they had done in previous years with the same teachers.<p>	Across the hallway from these teachers, another pair working with similar students in the Pathways program made much different use of the expanded time schedule. One of the teachers, working with half of the students assigned to this pair, used the extended period to show a feature-length video of a classic literary work. Meanwhile, the other used the extended time with her students for several learning activities. <p><h4>One Teacher's Use of the Blocked Schedule</h4>Because one teacher (we will call her Mary) seemed particularly able to make effective use of the new extended period, we turn next to a detailed description of what happened as she worked with her students. In thinking about this class, particularly close attention needs to be given to the ways she took advantage of the longer period to gain student commitment to a long-term project.<p>	Also, the reader should note the way different activities were selected to reinforce each other in a manner that would be hard to achieve if they had been spaced out over several days. She used the double period for four activities:<p><ol>	<li>	Reading an excerpt from an autobiography by Linda Ellerbee and discussing it in a way that tied it to the next three activities<p>	<li>	Negotiating details of a five-week homework project with the students<p>	<li>	Having students report on cooperative group assignments related to creation myths<p>	<li>	Having students begin idea development for their own creation myths<p></ol>	Mary used the first ten minutes of the ninth-grade class to handle routine affairs such as taking attendance and establishing the atmosphere that she wanted for the remainder of the period. At one point she asked, "What is the first rule in this class?"  As the students responded, "Show courtesy and respect," they began to do just that and to listen to Mary as she reviewed with them a previous conversation about the characteristics of myths. She concluded, "That's what myths are. How do I explain what I don't understand?" She then asked them to get comfortable as she read the Ellerbee excerpt. <p>	<b>The Five-Week TV Project. </b>The story she read begins with Linda and a young girlfriend engaged in imaginative play. Linda falls from a tree, breaks her arm, and then with her friend begins to develop theories of how they can fly so that they don't have to worry about such mishaps. However, just as their imaginations are beginning to create wondrous possibilities, her friend is called into her house with the message that her father has brought something for her. That is the last Linda sees of her friend.<p>	Eventually, she learns that a television was the surprise the father had for the friend. Never having heard of television, but painfully aware of the disappearance of her playmate, she begins to derive her theory--her myth--that television ate her friend. As the story continued by revealing the ways television changes people and the effects it has on family life, it is evident from student comments and non-verbal messages that they knew what Linda is talking about. As one student said concerning television, "I'm obsessed with it."<p>	From this story, Mary began a general discussion of television viewing and compared it with reading. She asked the students how many of them had had the experience of watching TV and of wanting to make a comment, but had been told, "Shh." All raised their hands. "Yes," Mary said, "you sit there and it is like talking to empty space, because people are so immersed in TV."<p>	Then she asked how many had read a Stephen King book and had seen a movie of the same book. A number raised their hands. At first the students asserted that they preferred the movies; then several began to comment on how certain books seem more vivid than the movies. Several said, for example, that <cite>Jurassic Park </cite>was better as a book than a movie, because the movie left out some of the best descriptive parts. <p>	At this point Mary let the students in on why she was using the Ellerbee story. <p><blockquote>Usually I use it when I'm on my soapbox about not watching television, but it seemed like a perfect example of explaining what we don't understand, that is in our minds, as a myth. She had tried to explain the loss of a friend somehow, so I thought this might be a good time to try an experiment.</blockquote>	With these last words, students began to mutter to each other. It seems they had caught wind of what was coming from conversations with their parents who had recently attended a back-to-school orientation session with the teacher. <p>	Mary said, "This is a five-week project."<p>	A student responded, "Oh God!" and there was general laughter.<p>	Smiling and continuing, Mary said,<p><blockquote>It has been my contention that TV has great potential but eventually it is like many things that we abuse. We talked about--now who is moaning? It's OK to watch TV to <cite>vege</cite>--when we don't want to be intellectually engaged--when we are just being mindless. But I want you to learn if you have a reason for watching TV, then watch it. The second thing I want you to learn is that there are options to watching TV.</blockquote>	She then proceeded to define the project with them. First she had them write on their papers: "Number 1: For one week I will watch all the TV  I want and I will keep a journal and that journal will be a daily log telling what I watch and why." <p>	In response to this first item, a student asked, "What if I barely watch TV?" and students shared in friendly laughter as Mary responded, "Pedro, why tell fibs?" She then continued by having them write the next item in the assignment. "Number 2: For two weeks I will watch TV only one hour a night." This elicited a number of student comments. <p>	"After school too?" <p>	"What about the World Series?" <p>	"That sucks." <p>	"What if it's a movie? Can we only take an hour for one day?"<p>	At this point, Mary modified the assignment:<p><blockquote>OK, let's change that and make it: Watch TV for only seven hours a week. That way if I want to watch the World Series, I can watch it for three hours. If there is a twenty-hour mini-series, you are out of luck.</blockquote>	Next, she had them continue writing, " . . . and I will log what I watch and why (I don't care what your reasons are; I just want you to list them)." This again generated student comments. <p>	"Does a movie count if you go to see a movie?" 	"Are you really going to make this count?" <p>	"I have a question: What if you have to watch a movie for a test like the one going on in the room next door?"<p>	"What if you are watching something scientific?"<p>	Rather than stopping to respond to each of these comments, Mary observed, "We will finish all the directions and then deal with these questions." The she had them write the next item: "Number 3: For one week I will watch three hours." <p>	Students again interrupted, "Ugh! A night or a week?"<p>	"The whole week?"<p>	"Oh my God, I can't do that!"<p>	"You mean I can't watch cartoons on Saturday morning?"<p>	"Monday to Friday?"<p>	In response to this last, hopeful question, Mary responded firmly, "No, Monday through Sunday," then continued with the third direction, "I will log what I watch and why. Number 4: For one week I will watch no TV." <p>	Again students responded, "Oh God!" and "Really?"<p>	Mary continued, "Furthermore, what I want you to tell me is what you are doing in place of watching TV." Then she said, "Number 5." <p>	This produced the following exchange between two students: "There are already five weeks." "She's the teacher." <p>	Mary ended: "Number 5: Draw some conclusions." This last portion of the assignment led to an exchange with one student with limited English proficiency, during which Mary recognized that he did not understand the idiom <cite>draw conclusions</cite>, and helped him with an example. He said, "Oh, like if you decided whether TV really eats people." Another student chimed in with an example, "TV is like drugs." Mary agreed that was an example of a conclusion that might be drawn. <p>	Having laid out the basic rules for the assignment, Mary was now ready to negotiate with the students on some interpretations. Working together, they decided that "movies at theaters don't count." Then a student asked whether video games should count. Everyone started talking at once. Mary paused and asked if they needed to stop and talk about discussion techniques. She asked, "Carmela, should video games count?"<p>	"No."<p>	"Why?"<p>	"You are not watching something."<p>	"Danny?"<p>	"No."<p>	"Why?"<p>	"You are using your hands." [<cite>Laughter</cite>]<p>	"Darrell?"<p>	"No, you are doing work." [<cite>Applause</cite>]<p>	"Since this sounds like punishment, Sega should go too."<p>	"Maybe Mark has a point. How many believe the project is punishment?"<p>	Only one hand went up, and that student explained she felt that it was punishment because, she said, "You can't do what you want."<p>	Mary responded, "Well, it is intended to be a project and not punishment."<p>	Another student observed, "It is an experiment to see if TV really does not eat people."<p>	Mary nodded and said, "That's the whole point!" [<cite>Laughter</cite>]<p>	With great and grave emphasis a student announced, "Whoever can't do this project, you don't have a life!"<p>	Mary then returned the conversation to the rule regarding video games. A student explained why he thought they should be included. Others commented: "Well, you're still watching it and it doesn't matter whether you're using your hands"; "It is still just sitting there"; "It is like sitting and watching TV with a remote control."<p>	Mary called for a vote. Eighteen supported including video games in the ban on watching, two opposed. A second rule had been negotiated and written on the chalkboard: "No video games."<p>	Another student raised the question of whether taping movies on a VCR and then watching them could be allowed. After a brief discussion the students agreed, in spite of their earlier rule permitting watching movies, that was still watching TV . <p>	There were several outside interruptions at this point in the class, and Mary gave the students permission to talk among themselves for a few minutes. A teacher delivered some mugs that were being sold as a fund raiser by one of the student groups, another teacher put her attendance slip in a folder by the door, and the phone rang in the office adjoining the classroom. <p>	Then the conversation about the TV assignment continued. Mary commented, "Karen had an interesting question. She wants to know, what if you don't watch television very much?" A quick survey of students' viewing habits showed that they watched between one-and-a-half hours a week to "most of the time" when they were not in school. Clearly a reduction to seven hours a week, the first level of the assignment, would produce a major change for most in the class. <p>	There was a variety of comments from individuals about the assignment. These were followed by the announcement that the project would not begin for a week, to make sure they could watch the World Series if they wanted to. Mary then said that printed contracts containing the rules they had developed in the class would be ready soon for them to take home for their parents to sign.<p>	<b>Group Presentations on Creation Myths.</b> Next, Mary asked them to set aside the assignment, to "change gears" and make their group presentations on creation myths. For several days students had been working in cooperative learning groups. Using an anthology of creation myths from different cultures throughout the world, each group had prepared a report answering a series of questions about the myths. Presenting from the front of the room, the students talked about such matters as the what characteristics of gods were shared among myths in a particular part of the world and whether humankind was viewed as positive or negative in the myths of a particular region. Each member of the group was responsible for an individual report. <p>	With the conclusion of a group's presentation, Mary encouraged students to ask questions of each other. Then she posed some of her own. For example, she called on them to compare findings of one group with that of another. In one instance she helped them see connections between creation myths of some of the Native American cultures and those of the Judeo-Christian traditions. <p>	One group included several students with limited English proficiency. She praised them for the clarity of the report which, while delivered with some halting phrasing, had responded well to the questions posed for the groups. The other students had responded well to this group also, applauding them at the end as they did with several of the reporting groups.<p>	While the groups reported, Mary also gave attention to presentation skills. Several times she helped students speak more loudly, clarify points that they were making, adjust the way they were standing as they spoke, and, in general, think about their audience. She checked the notes being taken by the students who were listening and praised the quality of several students' note taking.<p>	<b>A Creation Myth Writing Assignment. </b>After the fourth group had reported, Mary noted that they would finish the last couple of group presentations during the next class meeting. Then she turned to the last activity of the class: beginning a writing assignment.<p><blockquote>Pretend you don't know as much as you really do. Imagine yourself as sitting around a campfire starting to discuss the world and I say to you, "How did this world come to be? How did you and I come to be? How am I going to explain this?"</blockquote><blockquote>What I want you to do is to write the story you would use to explain the world--you and me. I want you to write a creation myth.</blockquote>	When a student asked, "As if I did not know anything about it?" Mary continued,<p><blockquote>This is your chance to reach into your creative pocket. Start brainstorming now. Just write down words and phrases and I will collect them at the end of the period and give them back tomorrow so you can keep working on this paper. You will do more of the drafting and outlining tomorrow.</blockquote>	A student asked, "Can we make up our own gods and stuff?"<p>	Mary nodded, "That's it. Make it all up! Brainstorm!"<p>	As the students began to write, Mary circulated throughout the room, stopping here and there to encourage or prod. After talking with one girl, she interrupted the class, "Angie just made an interesting observation. She asked if we realize that in most of the myths we have been reading, men are created first."<p>	This prompted a couple of girls to respond, "But not in all."<p>	Mary said, "That's right. We will hear some during the next class meeting where that is not the case."<p>	As the class period ended, Mary collected the students' work and they exited. Those who left were replaced by a classroom full of students of various ages who came to this popular teacher's room to eat lunch and share conversations about the day's events at Crossroads.<p><h4>Other Uses of the Extended Time</h4>In another Pathways class we observed, the teacher used the extended time to prepare students for a field trip and to have them write in their journals, consider vocabulary necessary for their reading, work in cooperative learning groups to study original examples of historical journals, and read independently. Like Mary, this teacher included a brief break during the class rather than trying to keep students on task the entire time. Unlike Mary, she struggled to keep the students attending to the various assignments.<p>	Student conversations wandered from the topic, with much attention to questions of personal grooming and social life. Consider, for example, the following exchange during a time when a cooperative group was supposed to be studying an explorer's journal.<p>	"I had breakfast, but I'm hungry."<p>	"I saw Ms. Brown. She was all offended."<p>	"Jacob writes like he's left-handed."<p>	"You don't even care if I'm upset."<p>	"Yes I do. I just solved your problem."<p>	"My dad is in the hospital--a biking accident."<p>	Later, during time when students were supposedly engaged in silent reading, we noted the following conversation as a further sign that the students had not really "bought into" the assignment.<p>	"I'm leaving in two weeks."<p>	"I'm getting twenty dollars a week."<p>	"What's a <cite>coxswain</cite>?"<p>	"I don't know. This is all dumb."<p>	"I'm going out to lunch."<p>	"I'll go with you."<p>	"I can't take you. I always spend too much money."<p>	"I'll spend two dollars."<p>	"I like your beads."<p>	"I like them too. I don't know if they're glass or not."<p>	Interrupted at this point by the teacher's asking, "Why are you talking?" one of the students responded, "Because girls do that a lot."<p>	As students, teachers, and administrators had told us, science, industrial arts, computer, and business education teachers throughout the school engaged students actively in learning during the extended block. Individual project work at various levels of difficulty in computer classes kept students engaged in learning skills and problem solving. Lab exercises in science gave students an opportunity to test theories read about in texts and described in class lectures. Math teachers used the extended period to provide guided assistance to students doing homework.<p><h4>Reflections on the New Schedule </h4>We asked the staff to consider the following questions  which may be helpful in thinking about the new schedule. <p><ol>	<li>	Some teachers say that students are making much more progress when they are taking a class in the extended blocks. If this is true, what is the justification for offering some sections of the same course in block format and others in single periods at the beginning and end of the day?<p>	<li>	What were some of the long-range benefits Mary gained from negotiating the long-term student assignment with the students rather than just handing it to them on a xeroxed assignment sheet? Would she have been just as able to obtain these benefits in a forty-five minute period? <p>	<li>	Examine Mary's teaching and the three assignments with which she worked with the students in terms of the Coalition's nine Common Principles. For example, what examples are there of students being expected to use their minds well, of students being expected to be workers, of personalization? <p>	<li>	What kind of help is needed for teachers who are still not able to make good use of the extended periods? Given the work routine for teachers, when can such help be provided? Who are the people in the best position to provide the help? <p>	<li>	Could (should) adjustments be made in the schedule so that certain classes meet daily for shorter times and others meet less frequently for a longer time? Which classes seem to benefit the most from different class lengths?<p>	<li>	Is it possible that teachers need to have classes of different lengths on different days? If so, is there a way to accommodate this need for differentiation?<p>	<li>	Who will decide the fate of the new schedule? When will it be decided? What will be the criteria used for making the decision?<p></ol><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tns"><h3>The New School-within-a-school</h3>The schedule is not the only thing which has changed. When we asked a central administrator about changes which had been made at Crossroads for 1993-94, the first thing which came to his mind was the new Crossroads Academy for the Performing Arts (CAPA). Our observations of this program, intended to advance students to mastery levels in the performing arts, helped us understand the enthusiasm of this administrator.<p>	Three teachers with backgrounds in teaching and performing in drama, music, and dance formed this new academy. One hundred twenty students are enrolled as the first cohort. Currently, they can satisfy physical education and health requirements through the new program. Eventually, the teachers plan for the students to remain within the academy for all course work, except that in science and math. They hope students will be able to enroll in special sections of those subjects which are developed by the science and math departments with the CAPA teachers. <p>	The teacher initiating this academy is recharged: "I don't feel like part of a labor force now, but like someone with my own program." Although the effort is on its way to becoming a semi-autonomous school-within-a-school, interaction between the teachers in CAPA and others in the school continues, as they send students from their classes to help other classes with video needs and to assist with schoolwide activities.<p>	Brief observations of classes in this new academy were exciting. We watched as the dance teacher helped a large class master some of the fundamentals of the traditional soft-shoe routines. She capitalized on the talents of some students who had obviously studied dance privately and were able to recognize similarities between Spanish steps and some she was introducing. Simultaneously, she helped some students discover latent talent. This was particularly true for some boys, for whom a formalized notion of dance was clearly a new idea. She quickly introduced a number of new steps. In a remarkably short time, students exhibited reasonable representations of the desired routines.<p>	Meanwhile, the music teacher was using electronic keyboards to introduce some students with no previous musical background to reading music. Mixing simple classical and popular jazz arrangements, he kept the students, even those who found rhythms and notes most perplexing, working hard and enthusiastically.<p>	In the drama classroom, students were beginning to use cuttings from plays to learn characterization. Quickly, they learned that one had to understand the entire play to be able to interpret a scene adequately.<p>	One student, with an anthology of cuttings in hand, soon learned that she could not know how one character related to another unless she knew more than was revealed in the cutting she had selected. Reading the line, "We are not going to suffer anymore; Martha is dead," she realized that she needed to know whether Martha being dead was going to be greeted with relief (Martha is finally dead and we don't have to suffer anymore) or sorrow (Martha is dead and the suffering we have shared with her is at an end).<p>	Students seen reading rather passively in literature classes elsewhere in the school seemed to begin to understand some of the ways authors work with characters, setting, and plot to generate moods and meaning.<p>	Students worked with excerpts from such plays as <cite>Taming of the Shrew, Comedy of Errors</cite>, and <cite>Crimes of the Heart</cite>. With guidance and coaching from the teacher and one another, they advanced from halting readings of the scripts at the beginning of the period to more sophisticated renditions by the end of the time. Along the way, the teacher described acting methods used by people such as Dustin Hoffman and Marlon Brando to help students understand different approaches to characterization.<p>	Not all is roses for the new program. Some students formerly active in various components of the performing arts clearly are jealous of the attention the students in the new program receive. Launching the academy without any new resources has forced the teachers to seek grants to obtain the capital needed to initiate a program of the quality they desire.<p>	The program is attracting students from Main High School, the original public high school in the same city. This is a mixed blessing ,since it requires time to coordinate efforts with the programs at that school and to provide assurances that the CAPA does not want to put music and drama programs at Main out of business.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="nwc"><h3>New, Well-equipped Classrooms</h3>When we arrived, a new wing was nearly completed on the school. It houses science, business, and technology classrooms as well as several general education rooms. The chemistry teacher showed off his new combined lecture/lab room with great pride. Glitches in clock systems and other minor construction problems did not dim his enthusiasm for the spacious, well-equipped facilities. The preparation room adjacent to the classroom, separated from that room by windows, enabled the teacher to set up experiments, as well as to oversee students working on special projects. Hooded, vented work stations, computers and files for teacher use, even the telephone in the office adjoining the classroom, were among the features of this state-of-the-art room, which in its completeness also served to highlight the inadequate supply budget of the school.<p>	Teachers and students expressed appreciation for the four rooms in the wing equipped with extensive arrays of computers and office equipment. When viewing these facilities, however, one could not help reflect on the dismal pay levels for professionals in the school. As is the case in several parts of the country, the community in which Crossroads exists is allowed by the state to raise funds for capital expenditures. The community is more severely limited by state laws and regulations, as well as its own desire (or lack thereof) in the contributions it can make to the operating budget to support public education.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cbd"><h3>Changes Being Developed</h3>When we came in October, advisory periods and new kinds of assessments were being developed, but there was still considerable confusion and uncertainty about their implementation.<p><h4>Advisory Periods</h4>As we noted in our last snapshot, the school had intended to initiate an advisory program in the fall of 1993. Summer 1993 plans announced to the faculty by the principal and the school's Re:Learning Committee called for the advisory to meet for fifteen minutes each day. Friday of the second week of school was to be devoted to a full-day advisory meeting for parents, to help orient them to changes being made in the school.4<p>	The first advisory class for 1993-94 met on Friday, October 29, 1993. By that time the decision had been made to hold advisory for thirty minutes but to meet just once a week. During our visit at the beginning of October, there was considerable confusion regarding the status of advisory.<p>	In spite of the mailing during the summer, some teachers claimed they had received no information about advisory during the summer. That claim, the large number of new teachers, and internal disagreement over the frequency and the length of advisory sessions all contributed to the principal's decision to delay implementation in the fall.<p>	Not all faculty members were happy with this decision to delay the advisory program. As one teacher put it,<p><blockquote>We all knew what was going on, and when we were interviewing new teachers, we told the new people the new things that were planned, and they accepted the job. They should have been ready. We went with the block schedule right away; why not advisory?</blockquote>	Several straw ballots were taken to choose the approach which would be implemented regarding advisory. The option of not having advisory was not reviewed again because, by the fall of 1993, the program had won support from the central administration as well as from the school's administration. Administrators clearly hoped that the greater attention to individual students, provided by advisory sessions, would help deal with problems of attendance and dropouts, which were of increasing concern to parents. <p>	Meanwhile, students, parents, and teachers all told us they were unsure what the plans were for the advisory--why it was being initiated and what would actually happen when it was started. Student names were drawn for each teacher, but plans to assign advisories to counselors and administrators were abandoned. Special education teachers expressed concerns that their students would not be mainstreamed for this activity, because they were not included in the draw.<p>	Some teachers were worried that they would be expected to engage the students in "touchy-feely" activities that were outside of their expertise. As one teacher commented sarcastically, "We will use it for love and hugs!" Another said,<p><blockquote>The whole thing has created so much confusion for the kids that they view it as one more unorganized thing. . . .A lot of teachers complain about this counselor role. It's more bookkeeping.</blockquote>	Students used their usual blunt language to express their concerns:<p>	"The stupid advisory--they are going to give us fifteen or thirty minutes. I think it is the student's responsibility to keep up on those things like credits earned."<p>	"This will be a talking period."<p>	"It should be for certain students and not for everyone."<p>	"Teachers are trading names to get the students they want."<p>	"It will be like the homeroom period was in junior high."<p><h4>Portfolios and Exhibitions</h4>If there was confusion concerning advisory, there was even more uncertainty about the use of portfolios and Exhibitions to assess student learning. Some students insisted they had heard nothing about them. Other students said teachers were keeping portfolios of their work. Some said this year's seniors had to have portfolios.	<p>	Holding the same variety of opinions as the students, teachers expressed opposing points of view with equal conviction. Parents generally indicated they knew nothing about portfolios. No one talked with clarity about why portfolios should or should not be kept or how they might relate to learning.<p>	There was no differentiation by teachers between Exhibitions by seniors as a means of determining whether students had met the school's expectations for graduates and reports that students might make as part of a class project. In this case, at least, the Coalition's notion of "planning backwards," which involves envisioning a goal and then planning the school program to attain it, does not appear to have intruded into the everyday life of Crossroads. <p>	Interestingly, several central administrators expressed the belief that the school was making real progress in authentically assessing student learning. These same administrators shared with us a new document describing outcomes expected of all graduates in the school district. Not one of the teachers, students, parents, or administrators whom we interviewed at the school identified these district outcomes as answers to our question of what should be expected of a graduate of Crossroads.<p>	In fact, one teacher was observed looking at copies of the district document which appeared in the faculty room while we were visiting. She simply shook her head and said she wondered "where they get this stuff."<p>	While a number of the people at the school perceived that portfolios and Exhibitions were somehow related to the planned advisory sessions, no one described the relationship in the terms outlined for them in the letter they had received from the school during the summer. These changes in assessment, which properly carried out are consistent with many Coalition principles, seem to have a long way to go before they can be said to have been implemented.<p><h4>Reflections on Changes Being Developed</h4>We asked the staff to think about the following questions regarding the programs and changes being developed at Crossroads.<p><ol>	<li>	Should the CAPA be a one-of-a-kind program? Does it suggest a possible trend toward the development of a campus of schools-within-a-school that are focused around career and academic interests?<p>	<li>	How should students in the CAPA be integrated into the school as a whole at the same time they are developing a strong loyalty to their program?<p>	<li>	How should the new advisory program be evaluated? What are the expectations of the program? Who will decide whether these expectations are met and what process will they use?<p></ol><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ucop"><hr><center><h2>Unplanned Changes, Ongoing Problems</h2></center><hr>During our visit we learned of some unanticipated changes, as well as several problems that continue to face Crossroads as it seeks to improve student learning.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="uc"><h3>Unanticipated Changes</h3>Not all changes at Crossroads are a result of intended innovations. Some of the unanticipated changes include the closing of the library, increases and discrepancies in class size, turnover among the staff, and failure to implement intended changes resulting from students' resistance to change.<p><h4>The Closing of the Library</h4>One big change at the school in October was a consequence of a series of unfortunate personnel decisions. A story in the local paper reported on October 7, 1993, "Crossroads High School students and teachers have been locked out of their own library for the better part of the school year, school officials said this week." <p>	When the school's media resource coordinator took a leave in the spring of 1993, school officials thought this might be a good opportunity to test the role of the Governing Council in dealing with personnel matters and resource allocations. With the urging of the principal, the Council agreed to leave the position vacant and use an aide to run the facility. The resultant savings would then be plowed back into other staffing needs.<p>	After at first agreeing to the arrangement, the aide decided that she was being asked to do a librarian's job for much less than a librarian's pay, and backed out of the arrangement. By the time of our visit, five weeks into the school year, a new person was not in place. Meanwhile, some teachers with keys to the library were continuing to bring their classes to it. For others, particularly new faculty, who were unable to use these resources, the library closing was particularly bothersome, as they tried to design instructional activities for the extended periods. Rumors abounded about teachers and students making off with books and equipment from the library without following the normal check-out procedures.<p>	Most teachers were unable to access the distribution system, which permitted the central playing of video tapes for classroom observation, since it was part of the library complex. However, as with the use of the facility for classes, some experienced teachers were able to use this equipment, while newer ones remained unable to show video tapes. <p>	When the parents arrived at the school for the fall open house, they were upset to learn of the library's closing, although some insisted that the collection at the school was so limited that their children relied on public library facilities anyway. Their reactions led to the news story quoted above and increased the pressure on the school to get a fully qualified librarian in place.<p>	Without further consultation with the Governing Council about the matter, a new librarian had been hired and was to begin work the week after our visit. Arrangements had been made for the regular librarian to return to help the new person restore order to the facility, so that it could fulfill its essential function of supporting the instructional program.<p><h4>Class-size Issues</h4>A reported increase in class size caused by district-mandated budget cuts also upset teachers. We do not have data to tell us exactly how class sizes in 1993-94 compared with the previous years, but students joined with their teachers in making complaints about the size of some classes. Analysis of class enrollment at the end of the first week of school in the fall of 1993 suggests, however, that there may be more factors than the budget at the bottom of the class-size problem. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="csd"><hr><center><h2>Class-Size Data: Fall 1993</h2></center><hr><p>Average (mean) class size: 25<p>Number of classes with 15 or fewer students: 21<p>Number of classes with 10 or fewer students: 8<p>Number of classes with 35 or more students: 9<p>Examples of teacher loads (total number of students for 5 periods) in Pathways: 109-147<p>Examples of teacher loads in PE: 152-186<p>Examples of teacher loads in foreign languages (.8 person): 75 -160<p>Examples of teacher loads in technology--business--Industrial Arts: 114-154<p>Examples of teacher loads in math/science: 105-144<p>	The complaints were not about classes with the average of twenty-five students, nor about the total load for teachers of 125 students, which five average-size classes would produce. Obviously the complaints were coming from those situations where class sizes were much above the average. Total loads in excess of 140 students for teachers of basic subjects such as math, science, English, and history are clearly out of line with the Coalition of Essential Schools Principle of no more than eighty students for each teacher. They make it difficult to achieve the kind of personalization necessary to really help all students use their minds well or to have all students achieve common goals.<p>	Students, as well as teachers, are aware of problems of class size. One told us,<p><blockquote>In my Pathways class it's impossible to get an education. It is so loud I can't think. I think the teachers care here, but they have to care about so many people. How do you individually work with 150 students in one day? </blockquote>	To some extent the heavy loads for some teachers reflect lighter loads for others. Small classes in some subjects create large classes in others, as long as there is a finite number of teachers available. <p><h4>Staff Turnover </h4>Turnover in the faculty is another kind of unintended, ongoing change. One of the products of the turnover in teachers was the creation of a four-person Pathways team that consisted entirely of teachers who were new to Crossroads. While these teachers, as well as many of the other new teachers at Crossroads, appear to be adding strength to the faculty, the creation of a group with no experience whatsoever at Crossroads made it difficult to carry out the Pathways concept. The absence of sufficient textbooks and the closure of the library made their task even more difficult. This group expressed appreciation for the assistance they were provided by the Pathways teacher-leaders, but both they and the teacher-leaders acknowledged the lack of time within the workday to provide such mentoring.<p><h4>Students' Resistance to Change</h4>One of the unintended changes we continue to observe is the failure to implement program changes the school claims to have adopted. That is, the program is changed, but not in the way it is supposed to be. As we talked with students and teachers during this visit, we became more and more aware of the role that student resistance to change plays in making change difficult.<p>	For example, students continued to tell us that they are not "really doing English" unless they are studying grammar and diagramming sentences. As one student observed, "Last year our teacher went back to grammar and I did learn some things, so it wasn't totally a waste." For such students, writing papers just isn't English. Math teachers tell us similar stories about their students who want to do worksheets because that is really "doing math" and working on cooperative learning activities is not.<p>	Other students described with enthusiasm advanced placement classes where they spend full periods dealing with short recall questions asked by teachers about information in the text book. Teachers defended the approach as necessary to prepare the students for tests that will require them to recall information, rather than to use information for thinking. In contrast, students rejected as soft, or not "real work," courses in which they engage in cooperative projects.<p>	It is this resistance to change by students (frequently reflecting views of their parents) that clearly leads some teachers to stop short of implementing new approaches. This becomes particularly true when students share with them the critical remarks about innovative approaches which they hear from other teachers in the school.<p>	Students at Crossroads sometimes generalized this resistance to change in statements, such as the following, that we heard during our visit: "We all complain that the school should not make so many changes so often--no other school is doing Pathways as we have been doing it. Change is good, but not every single year." Others expressed their feelings by complaining about being treated as guinea pigs.<p><h4>Reflections on Unanticipated Changes</h4>We asked the staff to consider the following questions regarding unanticipated changes at Crossroads:<p><ol>	<li>	With the availability of new facilities, are all the school's classrooms and special facilities being used in an ideal fashion to support the instructional goals of the school?<p>	<li>	As Crossroads develops its ability to make personnel decisions at the school level, what actions would prevent situations such as the closed library from occurring in the future?<p>	<li>	What changes in utilization of staff are suggested by examining the current information on class size and teacher load?<p>	<li>	What additional data concerning the use of teachers would be needed to make improvements in class size and teacher load?<p>	<li>	How can Crossroads develop effective systems for mentoring new teachers within the time and resource limitations facing the school?<p>	<li>	How can teachers, students, and parents be helped to understand the rationale for changes that are being made? What specific activities can be planned so that resistance can be changed to support?<p></ol><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="op"><h3>Ongoing Problems</h3>Several ongoing problems continue to present serious challenges for the people at Crossroads. These problems, some of which are interrelated, concern the school's identity, tracking, dropouts, and attendance.<p><h4>Seeking Identity in a Changing Community</h4><blockquote>I'm new here. I used to go to Main High School but Crossroads blows the doors off Main. (Student quoted in the September 1993 issue of school paper)</blockquote><blockquote>If I had my choice, I would rather have my child in Crossroads than Main. (District administrator interview, October 6, 1993)</blockquote>	Not everyone in town agrees with this student or this administrator. Some cling to the notion that Main is still the school where students desiring to be challenged academically should enroll.<p>	Crossroads' image does not seem to have changed significantly during the years we have been observing at the school. A part of the reason Crossroads has been slow to catch on with some elements of the community is that it has been known from its beginning as a school which seeks to be innovative, and from the outset, as the school with a higher percentage of so-called "at-risk" students and a higher percentage of Hispanic students.<p>	As one central administrator said during an interview:<p><blockquote>Parents are bailing out of Crossroads because they are unhappy with enriched courses in English and social studies. They have lost some quality students to Main because there will always be some who disagree with heterogeneous groupings. </blockquote>	The city in which Crossroads is located is changing. As newcomers have begun to discover the climate and the cultural riches of the community, Hispanics have lost their position as the majority ethnic group.5 Still, Hispanics continue as the major group within Crossroads and the public school system of which it is a part. While the city searches for its new identity, Crossroads, serving a population which is more than 75 percent Hispanic, continues to seek its own. As one teacher said in an October 1993 interview, "We are still trying to find our identity. All we know is we don't want to be like Main."<p><h4>Tracking--Another Cultural Question</h4>One difference between Crossroads and Main relates to the issue of tracking. From the school's beginning, tracking has been officially opposed at Crossroads. In light of that official position, consider the following exchange among teachers--an exchange which captures the tensions expressed by many at the school around this subject:<p>First teacher:<blockquote> I'm a true believer in heterogeneous classes, but we need help. When is this district or this state ever going to look at the nine Common Principles?</blockquote>Second teacher:<blockquote> First of all, heterogeneous grouping is bullshit. Therefore, you have to fit it into what you are doing. It can be a dumping ground. Instead of saying this or that subject area lends itself to heterogeneous grouping, we do it for all subjects.</blockquote>First teacher:<blockquote> But I don't want to see tracking here. It breaks down on cultural lines.</blockquote>Second teacher:<blockquote> Let me ask you a question. What if one year, all Anglos can swim and all Hispanics can't. Shall we force them all out into the same ocean?</blockquote>First teacher:<blockquote> That's not a good example. If you look at all our schools, it breaks down along ethnic lines. If you were to look at Main High, you would see tracking all over the place. </blockquote>	As the school continues to search for its identity, resolving the issue of whether to track students does not seem like an imminent possibility. If anything, supporters of tracking seem to be gaining power. As the preceding comments suggest, issues of race, cultural biases, and community politics are deeply entangled in this issue. As too often happens, intellectual considerations tend to give way to emotionally packed dialogue. <p><h4>Dropouts--A Third Cultural Issue</h4>Some other aspects of Crossroads are not changing. Student attendance and dropouts, for example, continue to be a problem. Consider what one teacher had to say about the matter: "The central administration and board of education are so concerned about lowering the dropout rate that they don't care what is going on in the classroom as long as the kids are there." Central administrators are indeed concerned about dropouts. We were told by one central administrator, "Thirteen percent of the boys drop out in the ninth and tenth grades. . . .Our dropout rate is around 50 percent by four years from when a class of students enters the ninth grade." <p>	In spite of the severity of the problem, a teacher expressed the views of many of her colleagues: "The central office worries about dropouts at any cost--the cost is to us." Costs to more than teachers seemed to be on the mind of the central administrator who spoke of the severity of the problem: "We are still losing half of the population from the time they enter the ninth grade until they are supposed to complete the twelfth grade--a large percentage of these are Hispanic males." An article in the local newspaper confirmed the ethnocentricity of this problem: <p><blockquote>According to a 1990 census survey of people older than 25:</blockquote> <blockquote>86 percent of the people who dropped out of school before the 9th grade were Hispanic.</blockquote> <blockquote>79 percent of the people who dropped out before the 12th grade were Hispanic.6</blockquote>	The Crossroads student newspaper added a personal touch to these impersonal statistics in a September 1993 story that related conditions of several students who had dropped out or were considering it. The paper quoted one student as saying, "I would do anything to get back into school and just be a teenager, but I can't; I have to support my mom and little brothers." Another student, currently in school, remarked,<p><blockquote>This school year was supposed to be great, but now I am thinking about dropping out again. I don't want to; I love being in school, but I have to survive somehow. And I am not getting any help from anyone, so I have to help myself.</blockquote>	Seniors with whom we spoke were painfully aware that of the well over three hundred of them who began their careers at Crossroads four years ago (299 survived as sophomores when we first visited the school), there were now fewer than 150. In fact, several projected that the number graduating would be closer to 125. Of course, not all have dropped out. Some have transferred to other institutions, but still the toll has been high. <p><h4>Attendance, A Related Problem</h4>Concerned about this problem, the community has pressured the board of education to take action. Because the board and community sense that one of the reasons students drop out is that they skip school, fall behind, and give up, they want action taken to emphasize better attendance. The status of this effort to correct attendance during our visit somehow captures the difficulty the setting seems to have in attacking any problem. A central administrator explained to us,<p><blockquote>The board is concerned with attendance and dropouts. They believe that parents are not pulled into the loop until it is too late, so they have set up stiff requirements that school be the reporting agency, with parents required under law to see that children attend school. The new policy requires that if a student is absent for one full day, then the parent has to be notified . . . absent for three days, the school has to send a certified letter notifying parents, with a copy going to the central office. This is not a policy yet. It has just been introduced for first reading.</blockquote>	We asked the administrator about the provision of resources to carry out the new policy: <p><blockquote>Well, we have added some telephone lines. We have met with schools to find out what they will need. All of that is under study. The policy requires two readings before it is official.</blockquote>A board member explained the situation:<p><blockquote>The board had to do something about the failure of schools to notify parents of absences. The newspaper conducted surveys and reported an alarming number of students ditching and not coming to school. We need to keep kids in school after the first forty days because of funding. Parents are to be notified immediately. We are going to pursue that parents be held accountable, by jurisdiction of the courts, for their child's attendance.</blockquote>	When this board member was asked about resources, the response was,<p><blockquote>Of course we did not provide resources. We didn't say they couldn't bring in resources of their own. Teaching--especially administration--is not an 8:00 to 5:00 job. Schools are griping because we did not give them resources. They are looking at this as the bottle is half empty, not half full. . . .This new policy passed about a month ago--September. </blockquote>	When asked how the schools knew of the proposed new policy, the board member explained,<p><blockquote>There was a first reading--don't remember the exact date--then the next meeting there was a reading, then we adopted it. The schools knew this was going to happen. They had sufficient warning that we were looking for a policy. This was in the newspaper. Then there was discussion among board members, and then the administration came up with the policy that we wanted. </blockquote>	At the central office, in response to our request for a copy of the new policy, an administrator directed his secretary to give it to us. She gave us a copy of a new policy on teacher attendance instead.<p>	School administrators' responses to the new policy included a resignation by the principal of Main, who cited this policy as the latest example of why he could not get his work done. At Crossroads, administrators provided us with a copy of a sheet that would be used to indicate to the central administration how they planned to comply with the new policy. The form, provided by the central administration, lists five requirements:<p><ol>	<li>	Daily notification of parents for <cite>all inexcused </cite>absences. (Documented phone call)<p>	<li>	Notification of parents after the third absence (any type). (Documented phone call)<p>	<li>	Notification of parent of <cite>required </cite>conference after the third inexcused absence from any <cite>class </cite>period. (Documented phone call or letter)<p>	<li>	Referral to FINS and notice to parents after tenth inexcused absence from any given class period per semester. (Letter to FINS, certified letter to parents)<p>	<li>	Notification of parent after tenth <cite>consecutive </cite>inexcused full-day absence. (Personal service or certified letter)<p></ol>	It was obvious to us that there was confusion. The version of the requirements shared at the school was different from the later version shared with us orally by the central administration. The board thought they had acted on second reading, while the administration thought that second reading was still to come. What, then, did the teachers have to say? "If there is [a new policy], I have not heard about it." "First I heard was rumor. This person was going to collect notes. Then I heard she was going to make phone calls." "Only thing I am aware of is an article in the local paper."<p>	In light of this confusion and apparent lack of information, we were interested in finding hard data about the size of the problem. When we asked one of the administrators responsible for dealing with attendance at the school about the extent of the attendance problem, he replied:<p><blockquote>I don't know what the average absenteeism is. One time I heard it was something like one hundred and another day a clerk said it is close to two hundred; might be around 10 to 15 percent [that would be 110 to 165 students]. I don't know the number of students who may be here for most of the day but miss one period, but we have to notify those parents. </blockquote>	We told this administrator that we had heard that the average student misses forty-four days a year. The administrator replied,<p><blockquote>I disagree. I think the report from the end of last year was something like an average of twenty-five days a year. Problem is that we have some students with excessive amounts, so the average is not too meaningful.</blockquote>	Within a changing community the school continues to lack clear identity. Students--particularly Hispanic students--continue to drop out. Confusion continues to be the norm in efforts to deal with problems such as student attendance. Hard data continue to be scarce. There are still few signs that decisions are based on careful analysis of information. When decisions are made, communication about them is lacking. In some instances these difficulties in communication seem to be willful rejections of messages being sent from one party to another.<p><h4>Reflection about Ongoing Problems and about the Snapshot</h4>We asked the staff to consider the following questions about problems at Crossroads and about the snapshot as a whole.<p><ol>	<li>	What steps does the school need to take to develop clear agreement regarding its identity? Can available in-service days be used to gain greater agreement on issues such as tracking and dropout problems?<p>	<li>	To what extent are teachers and parents who raise concerns that the school is not dealing adequately with its Hispanic students raising significant issues? What should be done about these expressions of concern?<p>	<li>	What should be done to increase the amount of hard data used by the school in its decision making? For example: How many students really do drop out? What are the ethnic and economic factors involved in the dropout population? How many students are absent on an average day? What happens to students after they leave school by dropping out? What happens to students after they leave school by graduation?<p>	<li>	Does this snapshot describe the school accurately? If not, what is missing? If so, does it raise questions that need to be answered? Should cultural issues of race, gender, and socio-economic class  be considered? What should be done about the questions raised in this snapshot?<p></ol><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="co"><hr><center><h2>Concluding Observations: The Study Themes </h2></center><hr>The School Change Study for which this snapshot has been prepared examines three major themes. We conclude this look at the school with some brief comments about where the school is in relation to those themes.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wc"><h3>Whole-school Change</h3>We are interested in learning how schools move from partial support for change to whole-school change. Observers have noted that, particularly in high schools, change tends to occur within small units of the school: individual classrooms, teaching teams, or departments. This often leaves significant numbers of students untouched by whatever innovations are occurring. <p>	One reason we chose Crossroads as a school to study, three years ago, was that it had already made considerable progress toward whole-school change by having created the Pathways program for all ninth-, tenth- and eleventh-graders. During our observations to date, other schoolwide changes have been implemented. The new schedule and advisory programs described in this snapshot represent the most recent of such changes. <p>	In spite of such changes, much of the activity of Crossroads occurs in smaller units. For example, we have observed promising developments in the new performing arts program, changes in the approach to Pathways initiated by a team of four teachers, and an individual teacher's development of creative approaches in technology classes. <p>	Some of these changes, like the CAPA and individual teachers' efforts, have led to real change in the learning experiences for students. Other attempts at whole-school change have been implemented so unevenly that the best we can report is captured by our subtitle for this snapshot: some things change and some things don't. In some teachers' classrooms, students' experiences are much richer because of opportunities afforded by the new schedule; in other settings the students continue to experience life much as they had before. For some ninth-graders this year, the Pathways program was considerably changed from previous years; for others, the teachers were struggling to figure out what was expected of them and to find the materials needed to provide the basic elements of the program.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tmoc"><h3>The Momentum of Change</h3>Our second theme of the School Change Study is closely related to the first. We are concerned not just with whether change is occurring schoolwide, but how well the change effort is sustained over time. Do changes in administration and teachers affect momentum? How does external support influence the sustainability of change?<p>	We began our work at Crossroads at the same time a new principal had been appointed. Shortly before we started our study, Crossroads' school district experienced the loss of a charismatic superintendent. During our study, several individuals in the central office have been charged with the overseeing of the school. There has been significant turnover of teachers each year at Crossroads, as well.7 Among those leaving the school have been some of the individuals who have played key leadership roles.<p>	As we began the second year at Crossroads, the principal expressed considerable frustration because two of three individuals he had counted on to lead the development efforts for advisory programs and new work on student assessment had decided over the summer to leave the school. He had invested time in sending them to attend Coalition of Essential Schools meetings and to visit other schools, and then discovered that they would not be helping support change efforts. <p>	In this snapshot we noted that several of the new teachers appear to be people with much to offer the school. This has been true each year we have come to observe. However, faculty turnover of nearly 30 percent each year and the loss of established leaders create a situation in which the school is constantly starting over. Established people become frustrated with this lack of momentum and begin to withdraw into their own classrooms, offering less and less to schoolwide reform efforts. <p>	The overall feeling generated by these conditions is one of an institution which jerks ahead for a little, then stops and appears to lose ground for a while before starting fitfully again. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ic"><h3>Idea-driven Change</h3>Our third interest is in observing the extent to which a set of ideas drives the changes which occur in a school. Specifically, we are interested in the influence of the nine Common Principles on the school. <p>	Crossroads was selected for study partially because it had formally adopted the nine Common Principles as its guiding philosophy. During our first year of visits, the faculty affirmed its support for these ideas by endorsing the Principles as a statement of their philosophy. However, for the most part, we have seen little direct influence from these ideas.<p>	Generally, students and parents have been unaware of the Principles. When asked directly about one or the other of them, they tend to confuse them with specific instructional techniques, such as cooperative learning, or with the Pathways program. We have been told that prospective Crossroads teachers are frequently asked about the nine Common Principles during interviews, but when we talk with the new teachers, they display little awareness of the Principles. <p>	Some Crossroads faculty have been outspoken in their opposition to certain of the Principles. Concepts associated with the aphorism "less is more" and "teacher as coach" receive particularly strong criticism, while teachers are quick to emphasize the problem of teacher load discussed in this snapshot. The ratio of one teacher for each eighty students, which the Coalition envisions, seems to be completely unattainable to the faculty, and they express little interest in assuming the "generalist" roles which would enable them to attain such loads within existing budget constraints. <p>	The Principles suggest that the school should have high expectations for all students. At Crossroads, as we have noted in this snapshot in particular, students with Hispanic backgrounds and students from lower socio-economic classes are not expected to achieve as well as other students. In fact, many at the school believe that such students are as likely to drop out of school as to achieve even low academic goals.<p>	Changes are occurring at Crossroads. The school is making many of the structural changes common in Essential schools and in other high schools throughout the country that are seeking to restructure. However, we do not see signs that the changes are occurring as a result of thoughtful reflection about the nine Common Principles or, for that matter, about any particular set of ideas or data.<p>	We look forward to our next, and last, visit to Crossroads and to the additional opportunity that visit will afford us to understand schools that attempt to innovate. We will continue to seek information which helps us understand the school, enables us to describe the school in a way that is useful to the people in it, and helps us understand each of the three major themes we are exploring.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><h3>Notes</h3><ol><li> The term Exhibition refers to a kind of assessment mentioned in the sixth Common Principle.

The purpose of our visit was to find out what it is like to learn and to teach at Crossroads at this point in its process of whole-school change.<p>	When we first visited the school in 1991, after its first three years as an innovative school, Crossroads seemed on the verge of becoming either an exemplary Essential school, or a school with low-performance teachers and students; for this reason we gave it the pseudonym of <cite>Crossroads</cite>. After observing the school over the course of the three-year study, we believe that the school is still at that same crossroads.<p>	This does not mean that there have not been many people working very hard--there have been. The people at the school could easily have given up and allowed Crossroads to become an unproductive setting. Instead, many people have continued to strive to make Crossroads a successful high school.<p>	On the questions we have been examining, however, it remains unclear what the ultimate direction of the school will be. <p>	Located in a beautiful, culturally rich southwestern city, Crossroads draws its approximately eleven hundred students mainly from the city's low-income population. About 75 percent of Crossroads' students are Hispanic, and another 3 percent come from other minority groups. <p>	Crossroads was created in 1988 to be an innovative high school. Crossroads' mission statement is a version of the Coalition's nine Common Principles. (See Appendix B for a listing of the Principles.) One of its innovative features is the Pathways program, a multi-age, interdisciplinary humanities program with blocked periods, cooperative learning, and assessment through Exhibitions of written, oral, and visual presentations.1 A second innovative feature is the school's Governing Council, in which students, a parent, teachers, and administrators participate in shared decision making. Crossroads has also been involved with Re:Learning, a partnership between the Coalition and the Education Commission of the States, which has provided funding and support for Crossroads' whole-school change efforts.<p>	As we have done each time we have visited a school as part of the School Change Study, we produced a "snapshot" of our visit based on classroom observations and on conversations with the people in the school community--students, teachers, administrators, and parents.2 This snapshot consists of three parts: (1) the staff's views on current issues related to change and the researchers' comments about these issues; (2) classroom observations, or "close-ups," and researchers' comments about instruction, and (3) overall impressions developed during the three-year study of Crossroads, particularly in relation to the major themes of our study. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="parti"><hr><center><h2>Part I<br> Issues Facing Crossroads in Spring 1994</h2></center><hr>During our final visit in March we discussed with the staff what had been happening at the school and what progress the school had made since our last visit. We organized the feedback we received on these issues into three major areas: communication and leadership, the advisory program, and the block schedule. We begin this final snapshot with the summary of how the school seemed to us in the spring of 1994. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cal"><h3>Communication and Leadership</h3>While the overall direction of the changes we have learned about is positive, there are some concerns and suggestions we would like to share.<p>	The recent changes began in January 1994 with the High School Summit, a meeting of professional and community people sponsored by the school district and the Panasonic Foundation. Shortly thereafter, at the request of the Crossroads principal, staff members from the state's Re:Learning initiative facilitated an "analysis" of the school. Other factors that led to the Summit and the Re:Learning analysis included a general frustration with the ineffectiveness of the school's Governing Council and a sense by some affiliated with the school that there was an urgent need for improved communication among the staff. As an outgrowth of these activities and concerns, the faculty and administration at Crossroads appear determined to strengthen communications and leadership in the building.<p>	As a result of several days of schoolwide meetings, a strategic plan was developed. This plan, the High School Action Plan, was refined by a committee facilitated by Re:Learning staff. The High School Action Plan was never completed in the full, detailed manner anticipated, but it includes attention to such items as development of better communications, creation of a "zero tolerance policy" for tighter enforcement of school rules, curriculum (including the block schedule and advisory programs), lobbying and other activities to get more resources, and improved accountability for all people connected with the school.3 <p>	The most evident outcome of this planning process was the shift to decision making through use of schoolwide faculty meetings. The faculty desired to have these meetings at the end of the day on Friday, during time that would be created through early dismissal. The early dismissals have not been possible, however, because the district transportation office does not see how it can adjust its routes this late in the year without increasing costs or adversely affecting other programs. Consequently, the faculty has been meeting between 3:30 and 4:30 p.m. every Thursday since January 27. <p>	Our observation reports of the February 24 and March 3 meetings and the minutes and participants' comments for the other meetings (including some later in the spring, as we note below) show several elements of these meetings to be praiseworthy. <p><ul>	<li>	Knowing that there are factions within the school, the faculty has determined to use these meetings as a vehicle for pulling people together. <p>	<li>	Planners have chosen the MRC (media resource center, or library), which provides a warmer, friendlier ambiance for faculty meetings than was provided by the auditorium that was used previously. <p>	<li>	An effort has been made to establish procedures to be followed, not only for the faculty meetings, but for the entire policy-making process. This effort responds to the concerns about process raised by a Re:Learning facilitator during the January analysis meeting. As part of this effort, committees have been created to study specific issues, and provisions have been made for discussion of issues among groups of teachers sharing common prep periods. Written agendas which include time allocations for each topic have been available prior to meetings, written minutes have been distributed for each meeting, and rules have been established (if not always remembered and agreed upon) for voting. <p>	<li>	In the context of these meetings, and in other aspects of the school, new leadership is emerging, and some long-time staff members appear to be rejuvenated. Volunteers facilitate each meeting. By design, these include some new people at each meeting. For example, on March 3, the meeting was chaired by an intern. This intern was assisted by two teachers who were long-time members of the faculty. Two relatively new faculty members took the lead in reporting on the block schedule discussion, which appeared to be the main item on the agenda.<p></ul>	During these meetings there were a number of problems, most of which can be remedied with fairly simple changes in process. The following examples are only suggestions of how improvements might be made; they are not offered as prescriptions.<p><ul>	<li>	The agenda needs to be prepared with greater specificity. That is, policy motions to be voted on should be stated on the agenda, background material regarding the reason for items being on the agenda should be included, actions to be taken concerning items should be stated explicitly, and, when known, information regarding desired follow-up on an agenda item should be listed. The agenda should be circulated among the people responsible for conducting prep-period discussions well in advance of the meeting of agenda items known to all. (Distribution to all participants on the Monday prior to a Thursday meeting would seem to be a good idea.)<p>	<li>	Each agenda must include fewer discussion/action items than before. Sufficient time must be allocated for discussion or it should not be undertaken. Two- to three-minute sound bites may be the norm for television news, but they will not suffice for policy deliberation. The inclusion of more items on the agenda than can be digested in a one-hour meeting leads inevitably to deferring decisions, which in turn leaves participants frustrated with their lack of accomplishment. <p>	<li>	The weekly changing of meeting facilitators contributes to the development of new leaders and helps spread the workload. However, not every volunteer has the same skill level for facilitating meetings, and the constant changing of leaders makes continuity difficult.<p>		To correct these problems we offer two suggestions. First, the principal should meet on the Friday of each week with the facilitators for the next meeting to help plan the agenda and see that it is printed and distributed. Second, skilled facilitators within the faculty should be identified and used as process observers for each meeting. As long as the faculty wishes to use parliamentary procedure, these process observers need to be familiar with <cite>Robert's Rules </cite>as well as good communications practices. At the conclusion of each meeting, time should be set aside for the observer to comment. He or she can also be called on for assistance if process problems come up during the meeting.<p>	<li>	Additional attention needs to be given to creature comforts. Coffee, juice, and snacks will help the mood of all. <p></ul>	Appendix C contains a sample of what an agenda might generally include, as well as an example of an agenda which might have been prepared for the March 3 meeting. In the sample we have tried to adhere for the most part to the rules established by the school for decision making, but we have also tried to address some of the concerns mentioned here. Of course, there are other ways this agenda could have been prepared and still provide better direction for the meeting.<p>	In addition to concerns about process, we have some systemic concerns about how these meetings are progressing:<p><ul>	<li>	Students and parents were present during the analysis sessions facilitated by Re:Learning and during some of the subsequent discussions. More of them will need to be included more often if the new efforts at decision making are going to be successful. Such policies as early dismissal for teacher planning, zero tolerance for the enforcement of rules, changes in daily schedules, and in-house suspension programs requiring parent attendance at school can probably be determined by the faculty working alone. However, these policies will not succeed when implementation is tried without the agreement of the parents and students who will be affected by them: we govern only by the consent of the governed. Just as faculty participation is most likely to be obtained if faculty share in making the policy decisions, students and parents are more apt to cooperate if they are authentically engaged in decision making. In a related matter, efforts should continue to get central administrators to attend the meetings. Their attendance could go a long way toward avoiding implementation conflicts with the central office after the school has arrived at a decision. When one of the assistant superintendents attended a meeting and learned of the impending zero tolerance policy, she was able to alert her fellow administrators to this forthcoming tightening of rules.4<p>	<li>	We are also concerned that there appears to be a tendency to rush too quickly to either/or decisions. To some extent, this is a potential danger of using parliamentary procedure, which requires the stating of unambiguous motions that must be voted on aye or nay. If sufficient attention is given to thoughtful committee work, to general discussions of issues at the meetings prior to scheduling for any action, and to structured prep-period discussions, then voting on motions should allow the school to reach policy decisions that will be generally accepted. If any of these steps are bypassed or cut short, key individuals will feel disenfranchised and, perhaps more problematically, good alternatives may be overlooked in the haste to reach closure.<p>	<li>	As we have noted in previous snapshots, decision making needs to be based on better use of information. Minutes of past meetings indicate some use of survey data as a part of the discussion of block schedules. However, the conversations about items such as the advisory program and block schedule generally proceed with more heat than light because there are no evaluation plans established when the innovations are initiated, and thus no thoughtful information about their progress when it comes time to decide on their fate. <p>	<li>	During our visit the status of the Governing Council was unclear. Some people interviewed in March stated emphatically that it had been eliminated. On March 3 one of the teachers indicated he was the current chair of the Council and that the next meeting would be the following week. We noted at the time that if the Council still exists, its role in relation to other elements of the emerging decision-making process needs to be clarified. There was a suggestion by one person that having the Council meet and deal with some routine matters would be a way of pacifying students and parents who are seeking more of a role. If the shoe had been on the other foot, and someone had suggested that teachers could be pacified through similarly inauthentic engagement in decision making, we suspect that many faculty would have been outraged. <p>	<li>	Finally, participants in the meetings (and elsewhere in the school) need to treat each other with more respect. Individuals we interviewed told us of efforts to improve personal interactions. We saw some signs of faculty members being sensitive to each other's feelings as we observed discussions. However, there are still too many situations in which one faculty member directly attacks another. It is possible to differ with someone without demeaning them. Besides, <cite>ad hominem </cite>arguments rarely accomplish the ends intended by a person who attacks another person. <p></ul>	The new commitment to communication offers much hope for the future of Crossroads. This commitment will best be carried forward and kept from becoming another short-lived initiative if the principal and teacher-leaders work with outside assistance such as that which can be provided by Re:Learning and which should be available through the school district's central administration. Such assistance would enhance communication processes within the school community and help deal with some of the systemic issues identified above. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tap"><h3>The Advisory Program: Fragile Beginnings</h3>In the fall of 1993, following several years of discussion, Crossroads initiated an advisory program to which all students were assigned randomly. The desired distribution was approximately four students from each grade to each teacher. (Because there are many more freshmen and sophomores than upperclassmen, the desired even distribution of classes was not obtained, and there are more underclassmen in most advisory sections.)<p>	Earlier, during the summer of 1993, a planning group had prepared a package of suggested activities and procedures for teachers to follow. Other than these materials and the understandings of advisory that had emerged as the faculty had discussed the idea since the opening of the school, there was no in-service provided for teachers.<p>	We talked with students, teachers, administrators, counselors, and parents about this new program. Many of the students were seniors with whom we had been speaking for the past three years. Their general response is captured in the following comment by one senior:<p><blockquote>From a senior point of view, it is basically a waste of our time. We are just stuck in there because there is no place else to put us. It will probably help the freshmen because they are supposed to be in there for four years. I am sure it will help with tests and senior portfolios to feel you are actually known and not just a number. But it will only be worthwhile if teachers do their job, too.</blockquote>	Perhaps the most telling response from students was their exodus from the campus as the advisory period began. One staff member observed that the scene of cars departing the parking lot resembled the start of lunch period. From our observations and teacher comments, it appears that between one-third and one-half of the students were absent from each advisory room during the Friday of our spring 1994 visit.<p>	We do not know how many of those absenting themselves at that 10:00 a.m. time returned to participate in the rest of their classes. <p>	Teachers shared a range of opinions about the advisory program; some were not unlike those held by the students. The lack of training was a common complaint: "I would like some training because we got squat--we got a little package with ideas--no focus." "It could have worked well, but it has to be done now and there is nothing that helps."<p>	While they acknowledged that they had been given some materials to guide them, they were not sure that these materials express official positions, and some teachers had obviously not read the materials carefully. Also obvious from comments was the absence of any thoughtful discussion of the suggestions contained in the proposed package. Nevertheless, the teachers acknowledged the good intentions and general competency of their colleagues who had provided these materials.<p>	Some teachers worried that they were unprepared to provide counseling for students with emotional problems. Others fretted that the advisory program represented an additional load, when they already had too much to do.<p>	Still others said they had sought a suggested list of goals to be emphasized during each of the advisory sessions which remained in the year because they were unclear about what they were expected to do. This confusion was evident during our visit when a number of the teachers used the advisory period to discuss the proposed zero tolerance policy with students, and other teachers said they were not supposed to discuss it--that nothing was to be said until the principal announced it at an all-school assembly. Some teachers said, <p><blockquote>We need flexibility; some kids will not come because they won't come to teachers they don't like or won't come to a class that has kids they don't like. But the administration will not let us change student assignments.</blockquote>	Finally, teachers were worried about the future direction of the advisory program. One proposal apparently called for fifteen-minute advisory periods every day during 1994-95. Under these conditions several teachers said, "We will not have time to do anything." They were also concerned about who would be involved as advisory teachers, since they had originally understood that every professional staff member would have an advisory class.<p>	Counselors shared anecdotes of how the advisory program has helped them assist students with their program planning and identify students who need help. Like the teachers, they worried about the high absenteeism among students during advisory, and they acknowledged that the staff need added training. <p>	Parents were supportive of the concept of the advisory program. For example, one commented, "One thing I think this school is doing a great job on is the advisory program--this is terrific, but each teacher needs to have some training."<p>	While they frequently expressed reservations similar to those shared by the children, parents were supportive of the school's effort to increase personal attention to students and recognized that there are too few counselors at the school for each of them to know every student well. <p>	Because the advisory program meets only on those Fridays designated as "flex days" and does not meet during any week that includes a holiday, there have not been very many advisory sessions. The debate about the continuation of the advisory program is tangled up in the debate about the block schedule. Since there was no formal evaluation plan for the advisory program, the decision on its continuation and the form it will take if it is continued may be made based on considerations other than either its long-range promise or success to date.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tbs"><h3>The Block Schedule: What Will Its Future Be?</h3>As the future of the program is debated, Crossroads would do well to remember that there are several ingredients to successful advisory programs elsewhere in the country. <p>	First, such programs involve all professional staff in order to keep the size of each advisory group as small as possible. From among the teachers and administrators at the school, the only people not assigned an advisory session are usually those who have explicit responsibility for assisting in the implementation of the program.<p>	Second, a definite curriculum is prepared and scheduled for teachers. In addition to assistance with program planning and career and college assistance, such curriculum often includes violence-reduction activities, anti-drug information, conflict resolution training, and general study-skills development. Third, teachers are given early and continuing training on the implementation of the curriculum for the advisory program.<p>	Finally, as decisions are made, the people of Crossroads should keep in mind, as the current seniors have stated, that the values of such programs are likely to be recognized only after teachers have had a chance to work with a group of students over three or four years. In short, with regard to the advisory program, we hope that the faculty will continue it--working as necessary to refine its value to the students. <p>	The newly implemented block schedule was the main topic of conversation during our previous visit in fall 1993.5 Since that time, the faculty decided to continue the schedule for the remainder of 1993-94. In March the faculty was in the midst of trying to determine what the schedule should be for 1994-95. <p>	The responses to the schedule that we obtained in our interviews this time, with the exception of responses from one teacher and one student, were positive. However, many of the people responding positively to the schedule, as it was implemented this year, qualified their support. Some expressed the belief that all periods should be blocked, not just those in the middle of the day, as is the case now. Others wanted the blocks to be shorter--perhaps an hour and a half, rather than two hours.<p>Several teachers expressed concerns that the blocks seemed to work better for some things they taught than for others, but they did not specify matches between specific courses and particular schedules.<p>	As in past years' debate on the block schedule, one of the major conflicts during current discussion has been the effect of block schedules on the sports and PE classes, which meet first period for girls and seventh period for boys.6 Teachers in these programs are particularly concerned because they believe they need to meet their students daily, and blocked classes do not meet every day.<p>	While we heard a few references to the issue from some professional staff and several students at Crossroads, there were fewer concerns this spring about the competency of teachers to manage an extended block than there had been prior to and at the beginning of its implementation. Still, as with the advisory program, this is clearly a case in which additional in-service is needed for the teachers.<p>	As the debate on the schedule moves forward, several concerns are apparent. Trying to find a solution that will satisfy everyone equally will be very difficult.<p>	The school needs to be careful not to substitute the rigidity of one schedule for the equal rigidity of another. The goal needs to continue to be to find the best way to arrange time so that it fits classroom instruction, rather than the other way around.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="eftm"><h3>Events Following the March Visit</h3>After our visit, student and faculty journal writers and others reporting on continuing progress at Crossroads gave us glimpses of how the issues we discussed in March played out during the remainder of the year. <p><h4>Discussions about the Schedule</h4>In March and April, discussions concerning the 1994-95 schedule continued in many forums.<p>	At an in-service meeting on the afternoon of April 27, marred by the late arrival of several key staff members, considerable debate about the subject took place under ground rules laid down by the principal:<p><ol>	<li>	The elimination of advisory is not debatable.<p>	<li>	People are not to attack programs or individuals.<p>	<li>	Compromise is the key; listen to each other.<p>	<li>	The bottom line is what is best for the students, not for you or your program.<p></ol>	Ten alternatives were considered during this extended discussion. As discussions continued in prep-period meetings and among various groups in the building, a proposal drafted by one of the interns at the school emerged as the favored solution.7<p>	At the full faculty meeting on May 11, decisions were made on the advisory and block programs for 1994-95. Forty-six people voted for the new plan, while twelve opposed it.<p>	The principal's ground rules for that meeting, which had changed since the last meeting, reflect the ongoing dialogue within the building:<p><ol>	<li>	Block days (if any) are Tuesday and Wednesday.<p>	<li>	Blocking periods 1 and 7 MAY be discussed.<p>	<li>	No Blocking MAY be discussed (traditional).<p>	<li>	Do not attack programs or individuals.<p>	<li>	REMEMBER what is best for a majority of the students.<p>	<li>	One mind, one heart (CHS Staff?).<p></ol>	The approved proposal called for block classes two days a week, and for seven-period days three days a week. Two advisory sessions of twenty-five minutes would meet each week--one on each of the days when blocked classes meet. <p>	One of the more ingenious aspects of the final compromise was the solution to the debate over first and seventh periods. Athletics advocates got their way and were able to continue meeting every day. Those who desired an extended period for their first- or seventh-period classes also prevailed. The approved schedule permits first and seventh periods each to meet for eighty minutes once a week.<p>	Other classes meet four times a week, once for ninety-five minutes. Details concerning implemen-tation were referred to the Governing Council for fine tuning.<p>	According to some of the reports we have received, the success of the faculty in reaching general agreement on the schedule reflects a continuation of the general improvement in communication we noted earlier in the spring. A Pathways teacher who led the meeting, who had expertise in parliamentary procedure, was assisted by one of the newer faculty members, who concentrated on assuring everyone that they would all have a chance to participate.<p>	The ground rules laid down by the principal (while not greeted enthusiastically by all) spoke to some of the problems that had been impeding progress by clarifying the issues under discussion and setting standards for group behavior. <p>	The Governing Council, which at one point had been declared dead, has reappeared as a legitimate part of a whole system of communications. Other important ingredients in this revised system have been the committees working on specific tasks and renewed roles for department heads. <p>	However, all is not ideal. Although the May 11 meeting was well attended, conflict persists concerning faculty attendance at the meetings. Many continue to insist that it is the principal's responsibility to see that all faculty attend. Just as they cannot see that students must develop responsibility for their own behavior, and thus insist on establishing various controls for students, these professionals believe that the only way their peers can be expected to be accountable is if the principal forces them to be so. Also, unfortunately, parent and student roles in the decision making remain ambiguous.<p>	The school is attempting to deal with still more problems. In an attempt to help with concerns about teacher loads, the school has been experimenting this spring with computer-assisted scheduling that it hopes will lead to a better balance in class size.8 Thus far, there are mixed reports concerning the success of this initiative.<p>	In an event which may have an effect on the school, the superintendent announced his retirement, and the school board indicated it will seek outside candidates. A new superintendent may lead to different roles for the central administration in relation to Crossroads.<p>	One action taken by the district school board on April 6 may be much more significant than the faculty at Crossroads seems to realize. Four months after the Summit, the board issued a draft resolution concerning high school education in the city. The resolution reported that a survey by the Public Agenda Foundation revealed considerable dissatisfaction by the community about its high schools.<p>	Among other things, the resolution announced that the board would be encouraging the creation of smaller learning communities within the existing high schools. It specified that such communities within the schools were to be accorded considerable fiscal and programmatic autonomy. In what seems like a contradictory action, the board also emphasized its intention to establish "high content standards" that reflect either state or national standards by 1996.<p>	For schools that have not been able to figure out what school-based management means on a schoolwide basis, the implementation of it for "subschools" could be a significant challenge. Also, for teachers and administrators who invariably testified to us that individual classroom teachers had almost complete independence concerning course content and teaching materials, the imposition of external standards in any kind of substantive manner could be quite a shock. <p>	On April 14, in the only record of Crossroads' consideration of this resolution we have, the principal reported that the board's resolution was mostly about policy that "Crossroads has already formulated."<p>	The creation of small communities within the school does seem consistent with some of the directions we have seen Crossroads take during the three years of our observations. However, the notion that these communities would, as the board resolution suggests, be "autonomous or semi-autonomous," is a departure from the current approaches.<p>	One of the most promising late-spring events has been a state act waiving grade-level meeting time. This will permit the faculty of Crossroads to use several days at the end of the school year for much needed in-service. At the same April 27 in-service which discussed the 1994-95 schedule in depth, an hour was spent on portfolios, with in-house "experts" taking the lead.<p>	Following up on the renewed interest in portfolios, one-and-a-half days in June will be used for the entire faculty to engage in "planning backwards"9 seminars that will allow them to accelerate their efforts to develop student Exhibitions. Topics slated for this end-of-the-year in-service include "bodies of knowledge," "diploma by Exhibition," "authentic assessment," and a curriculum update.<p>	Next, we turn from these schoolwide matters to what is happening in classrooms.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="partii"><hr><center><h2>Part II<br>Classroom Close-ups</h2></center><hr>In this final snapshot of Crossroads we include some classroom scenes, or "close-ups," as promising examples of the direction which the school may take in terms of instruction. They should not be construed to reflect common practices. <p>	Join us first in a classroom where students are learning how to use animation software on computers. Throughout the classroom, students are working sometimes in pairs, sometimes in threes or fours.

[<cite>Meaning, of course, that it was good</cite>.]</blockquote>Paul:<blockquote> It's all perfect, dude. Doesn't have sound, though. It's messed up a little.</blockquote>	Mike and Paul continue to watch the animation in a new program which had just been opened by Carrie.<p>	Carrie says,<p><blockquote>This is a demo? We need a bunch of sound cards now. Jeff, they have this program running. This thing is huge! Twelve megabytes. I think we can use this to help Pathways students put their portfolios on disks.</blockquote>	For many of the students at work in this class, their products are directly useful to the school. Some are helping create the next course description booklet. Others have created summaries of teacher discussions of how to use portfolios. Earlier in the year, they created a program for calculating the results of balloting at Crossroads on choices of a school flag.<p>	Similar ties between instruction in the use of computers and learning in other classes is evident in Jerry Johnson's classroom. Telling us about his students, he says, <p><blockquote>[They] are now applying the technology that they have learned in the first part of the year to work on projects for other classes. So, for example, several of my seniors in here are working on English projects focused on, how does it work? One is doing fuel injection, another is writing about the Volkswagen Beetle. They have decided their own topics and have had to research the working, both the mechanical and conceptual, of their projects. Now, here, they are working on pulling them together into written research reports, with graphs and charts that they have learned to create in this class.</blockquote>We see a student in Jerry's room working diligently at the task of creating a sign, which is a project for his marketing class. He explains, "It's learning how to use the graphics and to calculate the size of the letters. Stuff like that. It's fun here compared to other stuff in this school."<p>	We cannot help but noting that "fun" as used by students in relation to this work means much more than that they enjoy the activity. Students seem to use <cite>fun </cite>to describe work which is meaningful, work at which they have a sense of accomplishment and of having contributed something useful, work which requires them to use their imagination and to thoughtfully seek solutions to problems. Certainly they use it to refer to classes in which <cite>they </cite>are working, and not to classes where the teacher is doing all the work. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="avtp"><h3>A Visit to Pathways</h3>For our next look at classroom instruction, we turn to Martha Watson's Pathways class, which we visit on two different days. <p><h4>Our First Visit to Martha's  Class</h4>Martha begins the two-hour block by asking the student leader for the day to lead some physical warm-up activities.<p>	Then Martha asks the students to pull out their journals and take ten minutes to write about a Mark Twain quotation on the board. As the students write, she circulates throughout the room, sometimes commenting on what they are writing, sometimes offering a suggestion for how they might overcome a block. After ten minutes, there is a soft <cite>ting </cite>from the timer and students put their writing away.<p>	Martha then introduces the writing work for the day. She tells the students that, while they have done very good work, she feels that they need to work more on descriptive writing. She reminds them of other times they have done a similar exercise and explains that the numbered pictures on the wall are of different things related to their essential question: "How have immigrants helped shape and form this country?"<p>	She asks the students for examples of what makes good descriptive writing. Several students raise their hands and offer explanations. After each comment, she acknowledges the student by saying "Good," or by highlighting how what the student has said would work for today's exercise. <p>	Students then go to the board, look at the pictures, and make their selections. As they do this, they comment to each other about the pictures and occasionally ask what a picture is about. Then they return to their desks and begin writing. Occasionally a student gets up and looks at a picture again.<p>	After about twenty minutes, having circled the room and made a few suggestions and comments, Martha calls the class back together. She asks them to take time in their groups to read each other's papers and to make suggestions to one another. She reminds them that the papers should be rich with description. The students immediately turn to a sharing of their work.<p>	Next, students are asked to share some of what they have written and to comment on what they hear as others read. When several have read, Martha instructs the class to consider the feedback they have received in their groups and use it to refine and rewrite their papers, which will be due tomorrow.<p>	Martha then challenges students to ponder what she is about to read. She asks them, <p><blockquote>If you were the characters in this story about Ellis Island, would you have the same reaction? Why? What does it mean to these people to have come as far as they have and then have to go to this island? Are there any parallels in what is happening with these people and other groups we have studied or that you are aware of?</blockquote>	Following the story there is a lively discussion. An hour has passed and it is time for a break. When they continue during the second hour, they will work in groups to prepare for their presentation on immigrant groups they have been researching. <p>	There are several differences between this class and a number of others we have observed at Crossroads, and in other settings where the student population is similar to that at Crossroads. The student activities were varied and designed to have students think--to manipulate ideas and symbols. In one hour, the students in this classroom engaged in five separate but related learning activities. For much of the discussion there was no "right" answer. Students were asked to share ideas in small groups and in the larger group. The teacher responded with encouragement as the students ventured opinions.<p>	From the very beginning activity until the end of the first hour, students were expected to take a role in managing and leading the class. When questions were posed about Ellis Island, they were not recall questions, but questions designed to help students evaluate what they were hearing and base their evaluations on their experiences--experiences from their reading or their own life. <p><h4>A Second Visit to Martha's  Class</h4>In another visit to Martha's classroom, we observe a culminating activity by a group of students who had been studying prison reform. The students begin the class by displaying posters they had created and explaining some of their general conclusions. Next, they introduce a prison guard who tells the class about life in a prison and shares with them a video from a recent riot in a nearby penitentiary. He had been seriously injured during the riot. The students then help facilitate a discussion between the speaker and the class by asking questions and offering comments.<p>	"What is a <cite>shank</cite>? [A weapon made out of available objects by prisoners.] <p>	"How many gangs are there in the prison?" <p>	"Are you still working at the prison even though you were stabbed?"<p>	"Do you still talk to the guard who made the mistakes that led to you being stabbed?" <p>	"What disciplinary action was taken against the prisoner?" <p>	"What is your background?" <p>	"Where were the guard dogs the day you were stabbed?" <p>	"How will the "three strikes" bill affect things?" <p>	"I hear that prison is like a Holiday Inn for inmates."<p>	"What have we learned since the riots?" <p>	"Are the conditions of prison so bad that we need new ones?" 	<p>	"How would you get gangs out of prison?" <p>	"I think I read in a research paper that prisoners get paid twenty-five cents a job?"<p>	"Do you know how the riot started?" <p>	"Are there murders in prison?" <p>	"It's a place where we don't want to go!"<p>	As the students continue with their questions and comments, the contrast is evident between their honest inquiry and the desultory conversation between adult and students that often serves as discussion in a classroom: the posing of recall questions by the teacher and the recitation of correct answers by the students. <cite>In this class, students are trying to learn</cite>.<p>	Another teacher tells us about the ways in which students become involved in his Pathways classes:<p><blockquote>We just finished the war between Sparta and Athens. We spent two days simply gathering data for our own city and then had a civil debate about education. We discussed the views of the world held by these two places. In each class we had formal arguments. We designed a war and Sparta won. Also, we've done a mock trial. We bring in another class and they are the jury. This spring I hope to have an archaeological site outside and dig it. We will work on inventory and records. When I'm having a good day, the students take over the conversation.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="bc"><h3>Biology Class</h3>In Harold Swift's biology class we listen as students engage in fairly sophisticated, reflective conversations at the concluding stages of a study of genetics. They had participated during the previous week in an experiment which drew their parents into trying to determine what might be genetic contributions to a possible disease. Consider the following dialogue:<p>Harold:<blockquote> I've thought about doing this for a year, a problem-based way of learning genetics. And then I graded the tests. I tried to give you questions that help you learn genetics. So, what do you think about the process? [The students had been writing self-evaluations of the assignment for the first ten minutes or so of the class].</blockquote>Cindy:<blockquote> I think it was good, very good, but we probably needed more class learning time. </blockquote>Juan:<blockquote> Frankly, I don't think that we thought it was that important to look through the book. Next year, tell them to really study the book too.</blockquote>Sam:<blockquote> We found a lot of the same information in the articles. Maybe we could find a lot more to supplement it. We learned a lot about the treatments and maybe not enough about genetics.</blockquote>Andy:<blockquote> I don't know if I want to be a doctor anymore!</blockquote>	The conversation continues with Harold's reminding the students of the importance of the developments in genetic engineering during the 1980s. Then the conversation turns to some implications of what they had been studying.<p>Andy:<blockquote> Do you think ethnic groups should only marry each other?</blockquote>Several:<blockquote> No! Not necessarily! No way!</blockquote>Andy:<blockquote> But maybe it would help keep the diseases down.</blockquote>Cindy:<blockquote> But we've learned that each race can develop its own diseases, like the Jews.</blockquote>Helen:<blockquote> No, I don't think so, because then I wouldn't be here! Hispanic means a whole lot of different things.</blockquote>Harold:<blockquote> A white snow goose, if it has a choice, will mate with a white snow goose, not a blue one. But they also will interbreed. If there are options then both will stay within their subspecies.</blockquote>Juan:<blockquote> My step-mom married her fifth cousin and she didn't even know it. She's Native American. She was supposed to stay within her pueblo.</blockquote>Harold:<blockquote> Usually they will identify their clan as soon as they are introduced. They do try to prevent inbreeding. They are taught that in their culture.</blockquote>	Turning the discussion to the general examination of the value of the recently completed project, Harold asks the students to draw on specific examples of their work during the project. The students, who had not performed as well on the test at the end of the project as they had wanted to, for the most part take the responsibility for their poor performance. As Andy puts it, "We didn't study the book enough, and we can see how you emphasized a lot of these things, now that we can look back on the whole thing."<p>	Certainly, in this class Harold is helping students develop habits of thoughtfulness. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="pc"><h3>Physics Class</h3>On another day we watched the physics teacher engage students in a thoughtful examination of sound waves by getting them to consider the problems with using the PA system in the school gym. Students speculated about different changes that could be made in the structure of the gym to improve the acoustics, and then related their discussion to some of the explanation of sound waves and nodes in their texts.<p>	They talked about why the football coach and the principal could be understood more easily than most student speakers. From this discussion they continued their examination of sound waves by looking into ways in which music from heavy metal bands has a physical effect on listeners. <p>	As the discussion progressed, a student became excited with having grasped the idea and volunteered a drawing on the chalkboard to represent the concept being considered. The teacher and another student refined the drawing, and the discussion moved on.<p>	While the class continued, there was some good-natured bantering between students as one of them identified the correct Newton law of motion but assigned it the wrong number. This issue arose as they moved to a consideration of some of the experiences with sound and motion that astronauts have that are related to inner-ear functioning.<p>	The class was not a lecture or a typical teacher-led question-and-answer session. It was a conversation in the best sense of the word--one in which students and teachers took turns using anecdotes and drawings, working with equations, and building on each other's ideas.<p>	As the class ended, students were reminded to complete their practice problems (a conventional assignment) and to bring their favorite CD and tape players so that during their next class meeting, which was to be a two-hour block, they could use sound detectors to learn more about sound quality (a less conventional assignment).<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rocv"><h3>Reflections on Classroom Visits</h3>These pockets of exciting instruction have become more evident with each visit. Prior to the recent interest expressed by the school board in a proposed policy about subschools, small, essential learning communities within the school have been expanding. For example, during this visit we learned that grant funding has enabled two teachers to combine in an interdisciplinary effort known as "Spanglish." One objective of this combination is to strengthen the learning of grammar in both Spanish and English. But the connections go beyond that as the grant uses older, successful students as cross-age tutors to help students study myths in English and family stories in Spanish. Spanglish students will also be able to add studies of drama and dance as part of their cultural lessons. These classes will be taught with help from grant-funded resource people. Eventually, as the English class studies Cervantes, it hopes to do so by reading the text in Spanish. <p>	This Spanglish effort joins Pathways and the new Creative and Performing Arts Program as an intentional small learning community within the larger framework of the whole school.10 Another initiative by a computer education teacher and an English teacher seeks to develop collaborative courses involving English and technical and business education classes, using computer facilities to advance writing and other communication skills. The school is also initiating a year-round program for "at risk" students called YES. Such efforts, grounded somewhat in similar approaches to student learning, may prove to be the means by which Crossroads eventually is able to spread its professed vision schoolwide.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="partiii"><hr><center><h2>Part III<br>Major Lessons Learned from Three Years at Crossroads </h2></center><hr>As we look back over the three years of our visits to Crossroads, the following five themes emerge:<p><ol>	<li>	Communication requires continuing attention.<p>	<li>	Leadership is a significant concern.<p>	<li>	There is an evident need for extensive and continuing staff development.<p>	<li>	Time is also needed: time to teach, time to plan, time to reflect.<p>	<li>	The context surrounding Crossroads influences much of what is accomplished. <p></ol><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="crca"><h3>Communication Requires Continuing Attention</h3>We have commented on communications at Crossroads in most of the snapshots. Throughout our study, the school has struggled with its formal systems, which were designed to enhance communications. <p>	Crossroads has identified for itself many concerns related to communication during the recent analysis exercise with the state Re:Learning staff. Meetings of the parent group, Voice, have been sparsely attended. The Governing Council has found it hard to determine its own role. It has had procedural difficulties, and it is the object of much criticism by faculty members. Until recently, faculty meetings did not produce clear understanding about direction.<p>	Only the most recent reports offer hope that the work of Re:Learning, Panasonic, and committed members of the school faculty and administration are beginning to pay off in the development of constructive systems. Even then, parent and student involvement in school improvement discussions is lacking. In its draft resolution the school board has made it clear that it expects greater engagement of parents in decision making at the school level. How this will affect the emerging patterns at Crossroads is not clear at this point.<p>	At Crossroads, as in a number of schools, a core of people learn new ideas or develop proposals, and there is either little interest by other faculty members or there is no way to share these ideas. As a result, the whole school does not become supportive and engaged. This lack of engagement appears to be related to the problems with the communications systems mentioned above. As multiple layers of communications develop, involving committees, the Governing Council, and whole-faculty meetings, the level of engagement and support may change for the better.<p>	Teachers get information from various sources and frequently construct different interpretations of that information. Consequently, rumors, innuendos, and misinterpretation about what they hear are common. Students hear conflicting stories about what is happening from different teachers. One recent example of this was a conversation about the pending implementation of zero tolerance for deviation from established standards for student behavior. Another incident, involving a math teacher's views of easy grading for classes taught by teachers from the athletic department, erupted this spring. This incident was discussed with considerable factual variation by teachers and students.<p><h4>How Pervasive Is Caring at the School?</h4>A matter closely related to a discussion of communication is the way in which caring is demonstrated at the school. Students provided us with numerous examples of teachers who have gone out of their way to help them. They generally stated that the teachers at Crossroads care about them and are willing to provide extra help as needed. For the most part, parents hold a similar view.<p>	However, there is evidence that caring is not pervasive. We note that in spite of the general concerns which teachers have for students, there are no organized responses for helping students caught in personal tragedies. Faculty pointed to the student center as ready to help in such situations. It may be. What we did not see was a general response to widespread problems among students. Whether the problem is a serious accident, the death of another student, or a crisis in a student's family, we have not seen an organized effort to help comfort students.<p>	Teachers take potshots at each other--sometimes in the hallways or in classrooms in front of students. Students told us of teachers who talk at length in a critical fashion about other teachers. Such behavior seems to us to be unprofessional and unproductive. We are pleased to see that it is receiving attention at the same time that a focus has been placed on improving the formal communication systems.<p>	The social relationships that can bind a faculty together do not seem to exist at Crossroads. There are several contributing causes to this problem, one of which may be the high faculty turnover at the school.<p>	Also, in order to make ends meet, numerous members of the faculty have second jobs.<p>	Another reason for this problem may be the absence of social gatherings that would help the faculty get to know each other and care for each other better.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="l:occ"><h3>Leadership: of Crucial Concern</h3>Throughout the entire School Change study, a number of leadership issues have arisen. This topic has been receiving attention by the Crossroads school community as a follow-up to the Re:Learning team's analysis.<p>	There is a tendency for too many people to equate leadership in a school with the position of the principal. As is beginning to happen now at Crossroads, leadership must be spread throughout the school.<p>	The principal has leadership functions to perform, but so do many others. The recent committee leadership and meetings facilitation by new faculty will help build a broader leadership base. Ultimately, the school should become a community of leaders in which everyone takes responsibility for accomplishing the mission, rather than assuming that some positional leader has that responsibility.<p>	This need for broad-based leadership does not excuse the principal from responsibilities for assessing progress, helping to define the vision, supporting and coordinating groups as they work, asking hard questions, or stimulating the thinking of the school community. All of these, and more, continue to be direct responsibilities that come with the position.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tnfe"><h3>The Need for Extensive and Continuing Staff Development</h3>The staff at Crossroads have been willing to try many new approaches to educating students, but too often teachers (and administrators) are left trying innovations without the systematic and continuing support which is needed for proper implementation. <p>	Some of the most effective staff development that can happen in a school grows out of careful examination of information about the students and how they are performing. We have not seen evidence that this kind of examination is occurring. With one or two notable exceptions, such as an examination of writing results in the Pathways program, decisions about program changes do not seem to be based on concrete information about student performance.<p>	The professional staff at Crossroads have considerable talent. Faculty members demonstrate that they are adept at a variety of teaching modalities, but little use is made of their expertise to help the school. Too often school faculty leave the school and work with others rather than assisting their peers. Rewards for working at the school need to be established that equal the rewards of working elsewhere.<p>	The school has demonstrated commendable commitments to such changes as integrated curriculum, modified schedules, advisory programs, and the use of portfolios to help assess student learning, but more, sustained training is needed. This is particularly the case at Crossroads because of the high turnover of faculty. The plans to spend one-and-a-half days in June 1994 on subjects such as "planning backwards" are encouraging, but the school needs to establish a long-range plan for professional development. In these plans topics will need to be returned to again and again. Those seeking to develop new skills will need opportunities for repeated, guided practice. Those seeking to implement innovative programs will need support from school administrators and peers as they run into the inevitable difficulties faced by all pioneers. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tnft"><h3>The Need for Timeto Teach, to Plan, to Reflect</h3>The debate over alternative student schedules, which has occasionally become quite heated, has been fueled by frustrations about the incompatibility between the normal student-teacher schedules and what it takes for someone to learn. There is no evidence that learning occurs best and most often in fifty-minute bites. Faculty members must continue to seek a way of organizing their days that will support the constantly shifting demands for time needed for different kinds of learning.<p>	As promising as the compromises are, in the adopted schedule for 1994-95, the schedule still has class meeting times of fixed lengths. Those teachers whose activities include extended field trips or lab assignments will still end up in conflict with those teachers who desire their students to be present for each class. Those seeking ways to deal with the struggle for time may find the small learning communities that are evolving, such as the Creative and Performing Arts Program, good places to watch for possible solutions.<p>	Teachers also struggle for the time that is needed to acquire in-service training, analyze their progress, and plan new approaches. To some extent the schedule is the culprit here also. Until the faculty (and parents and students) derive an approach to using time that allows large chunks for reflection, there will continue to be confusion concerning what decision has been made, and there will be decisions made without sufficient thoughtfulness.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="caad"><h3>Context as a Determining Factor</h3>Crossroads teachers have done an amazing job of seeking grants for fine-arts experiences, programs for at-risk students, science opportunities, work integrating English and Spanish studies, and support for outside speakers. The experts within the greater community who have been invited into classrooms enrich the resources of the school with their presentations. Assistance has been secured from the state university, and other higher education connections have been used by teachers to help with such diverse learning activities as learning about the stock market to developing skills in drama. (Fundraising activities are so constant that the band teacher from <cite>Funky Winkerbean </cite>could learn lessons from Crossroads High School.)<p>	At times the scramble for resources seems almost frenetic, and one begins to wonder whether it distracts as well as adds to the school. Certainly if there were adequate support in the first place, such pursuits of external funding could be approached with less urgency.<p>	The lack of financial and other external support makes progress at Crossroads difficult. In the midst of a community which is wealthy in many ways, the school (indeed the school system) is impoverished. Teachers tend to look at administrators as overpaid, and administrators tend to look at higher-up administrators as overpaid. Truthfully, pay for all educators appears to us to be indefensibly low. <p>	But lack of support is not limited to finances. A school should expect and receive assistance to help it solve the problems of which it is aware. From what we can see, little outside assistance has been forthcoming for Crossroads during the past three years, except that generated by entrepreneurial teachers and administrators. One exception which we note is the apparent increase in support from Re:Learning this year. Some hope that the selection of a new superintendent for the school district will reestablish the visionary leadership and support which came from that office when the school was first built. <p>	The surrounding context of Crossroads also contributes to there being important issues of race, class, and gender associated with the school. The changing nature of the community described in the fifth snapshot and the uncertainty among staff about how to deal with these changes are parts of this context. During the March 1994 visit, one of the teachers of non-academic classes complained that his classes tended to be dumping grounds for non-performing students. He told us,<p><blockquote>It's just a place they put the kids who don't do well or who make problems. I can keep them busy in here, and sometimes I can get them really interested. But nobody really cares what I do here. I think that I need to start looking for another job.</blockquote>	Believing that this difficulty relates directly to racial issues at the school, the teacher said, "We have two classes of Hispanics here." He was concerned that the heritages of these groups are not being honored. This notion of "two classes" of Hispanics plays out particularly in the expectations teachers have for student performance and in the support available to help the "lower class"--the recent immigrants--pursue education beyond high school. As one teacher put it,<p><blockquote>I do think there are different expectations. The ones who stick out are the kids from Mexico. I was grading papers last night and gave some extra credit for some of these students, because I knew it was a tremendous effort for them.</blockquote>	Tendencies to stereotype students by ethnicity (and by subgroups within ethnic groups) and to make assumptions about how students from different social classes will perform have been evident during each visit. Ongoing efforts at reform will need to be made, with careful sensitivity to the needs of different populations. Having high expectations for all students will need to replace the tendency to treat some as people with less potential.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ttlo"><h3>Through the Lens of the Study Themes</h3>We are interested in viewing the three years at Crossroads in terms of the major themes of the School Change Study: (1) examining the extent to which change is "idea-driven"--more specifically, the extent to which the nine Common Principles are instrumental in guiding change efforts; (2) finding out what factors determine whether momentum is maintained over time; and (3) finding out what factors influence schoolwide change. <p><h4>Is Change at Crossroads Idea-Driven?</h4>Crossroads has adopted a statement of philosophy which closely parallels the nine Common Principles. However, there is little evidence this statement or any other set of ideas has been used explicitly to stimulate thinking about what the direction of the school should be.<p>	While the nine Common Principles seem to receive little attention, their indirect influence can be seen in various parts of the school. Various individuals talk about individual Principles, and we find examples of them being implemented.<p>	For example, there are numerous examples of the "student as worker" in our files, as well as in the classroom scenes reported in this final snapshot. In spite of an apparently general desire for the school to be a "shopping mall," teachers persist in efforts to focus on essential questions and to seek an understanding of the Coalition's notion of "planning backwards" as a means of designing an education that culminates in student exhibiting what was learned. <p>	If we are going to understand the influence of a set of ideas such as the Coalition's nine Common Principles, we are going to have to look beyond the questions of whether or not they have been discussed in meetings and in-service sessions and concentrate our examination on whether they are intentionally reflected in practice.<p><h4>Factors Affecting the Momentum for Change</h4>Turnover of faculty, the lack of staff availability for meetings due to second jobs and coaching assignments, and the absence of extended staff development efforts are clearly major factors in limiting momentum for change. Leadership and communication issues have also affected the momentum. Still, in spite of obstacles presented by the context around the school, the faculty have persisted in efforts to improve their program.<p>	Why do people persist in the face of the many obstacles found at a school like Crossroads? Why do they keep going when salaries are atrocious and rewards for their efforts lacking? Why don't they take the easier approach and retreat to purely didactic teaching, give up on experimentation with schedules and courses, forget about different ways of assessing student learning, and retreat to their individual classrooms and avoid team-teaching and interdisciplinary studies?<p>	When the external support systems of the district and state seem to send the message that what they really want is a place where there is no controversy, why do administrators and teachers at Crossroads persist in generating new structures and thinking about initiatives that are bound to be criticized by influential people in the community?<p>	One of the reasons for this persistence is surely in the commitment of teachers to the individual students with whom they work. Perhaps the answer to some of these questions lies also in the powerful vision of the man who was superintendent when Crossroads opened. He is frequently referred to as their inspiration by teachers who were present at the school's beginnings. It is also possible that the ideas which lie behind the change efforts are sufficiently compelling that the school continues to try them just because they make sense. We will continue our search for other answers as we study the boxes of interview and observation records, journals, and documents from the school, district, and state. There must be some clues to the resiliency of this school community which we still have not recognized. <p><h4>Factors Influencing Schoolwide Changes</h4>As mentioned previously, the emerging communication system, with its promising use of a mixture of whole-school meetings, committee sessions, and Governing Council meetings, may contribute to the change efforts becoming more schoolwide.<p>	At Crossroads, as at other schools, starting with a small unit of the school has proved problematic when it comes to spreading changes schoolwide. Communication and leadership pose problems in extending the reform effort from its initial beachhead to other parts of a school.<p>	At Crossroads one starting point was with the Pathways program. Turnover has made maintenance of this effort difficult, while perceptions that Pathways teachers were favored contributed to dissonance in the staff.<p>	As innovations have developed in other departments--and some have in all areas--it has been difficult to see what schoolwide vision they relate to. Here, again, the emerging communication system may help the evolution of additional new programs such as the Creative and Performing Arts program, Spanglish, and the technology/business/<p>English initiatives. The district emphasis on creating these new programs should also help them evolve. <p>	Our visits to Crossroads have helped us develop greater understandings of problems associated with each of the major themes of our investigation. As we continue our analysis of the information we have gathered from all the schools, we expect to see more clearly the actions which are needed to produce whole-school change.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cr"><h3>Concluding remarks</h3>We depart from Crossroads, sad that we are leaving young people we have come to know and admire for their resiliency and the articulate ways in which they have shared their understandings of their school. We leave with admiration for the teachers and administrators who persevere in the face of unconscionable limitations in the resources they are provided and the remuneration they are awarded for the work they do.<p>	We remember many good people who have left, seeking employment where they will be better paid. We share the depth of concerns for those who have remained and continue the battle. We take hope from the professionals newly arrived at Crossroads who are demonstrating their determination to serve the students of the school. We know that we are struggling to find the answers to what can lead to schools becoming Essential schools, just as Crossroads has been struggling to find its own answers for its students. <p>	We thank all connected at the school for the opportunities they have given us to look closely at their work. We hope that the information we have shared with them has been helpful as they seek to perform their difficult tasks. To all who have permitted us to share in their lives we say, thank you--<cite>muchas gracias!</cite><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><hr><h3>Notes</h3><ol><li> The term <cite>Exhibition </cite>is described in the Coalition's nine Common Principles. It is a culminating, public demonstration of what a high school student knows and can do.<p><li> Our team has made six visits to Crossroads as part of this study. The visits have been three to four days long, and the study team has included three or four people. During each visit we have interviewed twenty-five to thirty teachers, individually or in groups. We have also talked with about the same number of students and shadowed three to five students as we observed various classes. We also spoke with ten to twenty parents during each visit, and four to six school and district administrators. In addition, we have collected many documents from the school and school district, another team member has interviewed state officials, another researcher studied newspaper clippings, and two teachers and two students provided monthly journals, often enclosing documents such as committee minutes. This effort has left us with much information to digest. Preliminary findings have been reported to the school in five previous "snapshots," each of which has been critiqued by about ten Crossroads staff before it was put into final draft form.<p><li> Consistent with planning problems facing the school throughout the study, the document provided us still had not stated the outputs expected from the planning, nor had it clearly assigned responsibilities for various tasks.<p><li> At first glance it may seem strange that central office review would be needed for a decision to enforce existing rules more stringently. However, the reality is that central administrators will be bombarded by distraught parents if such a practice is initiated and, if they are not forewarned, may not provide the support the school needs.<p><li> See Richard W. Clark, "Some Things Change, Some Things Don't," Studies on School Change (Crossroads No. 5), Coalition of Essential Schools, Brown University, Providence, February 1994.<p><li> Because of concerns raised in the media by one teacher about grading practices in the sports/PE classes and about the appropriateness of using school time for extracurricular activities, these classes were the subject of considerable conversation during the spring of 1994.  Because of the large number of legal and ethical issues as well as educational questions which have been raised in these discussions, we have chosen not to treat these matters at length.<p><li> One faculty member who reviewed an earlier draft of this snapshot suggested that the version prepared by the intern and eventually adopted appeared only at the last minute and was not well understood by those who voted for it. This reviewer said that future discussions of it in the Governing Council revealed flaws, and left many disenchanted with their decision. If such is the case, it serves as one more example of the inability of the faculty to make a decision and stick with it once it had been made.<p><li> For a discussion of problems of imbalance in class size and total student loads at Crossroads, see Richard W. Clark, "Some Things Change, Some Things Don't," note 5.<p><li> "Planning backwards" refers to envisioning the goals of a school's program and then planning the program accordingly, in order to attain them. See Joseph McDonald, "Steps in Planning Backwards: Early Lessons from the Schools," Studies on Exhibitions (No. 5), Coalition of Essential Schools, Brown University, Providence, April 1993.<p><li> A fuller description of the Creative Performing Arts Program (CAPA) appears in Richard W.

It is fall, and the treestoss and whirl their brightest colors in a last, gay dance, an all-out, riotousfling before the sobering winter grays and whites. <p>Summerville began as a resort community for those escaping the summer heat of thenearby city. Originally, folks lived in ethnic or philosophical enclaves-theIrish on the Point, the Italians in town, the "communists" on Blue Mountain. Asthe town developed year-round residents, it began a tradition of fine education.As if to state that loud and clear, a new high school was erected in a place ofhonor-a little hilltop just up from town. <p>Built in 1924, Oak Hill High School, a grades 9-12 high school, is of solid,enduring American Gothic architecture, red brick with white trim. It overlookshomes with wide, wooden porches and a wonderful, old hillside cemetery thatrambles up and along the curve of the hill. The school seems to remind both theliving and the dead of the enduring importance of a good education. At lunchtimeon the open campus, students eat among the gravestones or walk the two blocksdowntown to eat at the Soda Fountain (yes, the Soda Fountain!) or at one ofseveral delicatessens. Today, Oak Hill is a safe and trusting place, ahomogeneous place, a fine setting for a Norman Rockwell series. <p>Outside, the school looks dignified and carefully reworked. Some windows havebeen bricked in. An air conditioner has been added. A gym complex juts outbehind. Workmen are digging a trench to the football field to install anelectronic scoreboard. <p>Inside, the school reflects a constant process of modernization. The oldauditorium has been cut into two sloping classrooms, following the addition of anewer, more serviceable auditorium. The library is small: a graceful oldfireplace frames one wall while computers frame another. On the first floor arethe offices, several classrooms, the music wing, the physical education wing, thecafeteria, the faculty room, the new technology center, and the learning center.The guidance center, classrooms, and lockers fill the second and third floors.<p>Students, teachers, parents, and administrators describe the predominant and mostoften mentioned characteristic of Oak Hill:<p>"It's a caring place," says the vice principal. <p>"We like each other. We support each other," say the teachers. "We're all on thesame side here, trying to provide the kids with the best education possible." <p>The students agree: "Our teachers are our friends. We can talk to them. We knowthem really well. Besides teaching, they coach us in sports. We go on tripstogether-like to France if you make it to French 4." One student says, "Therearen't cliques here. We have all grown up together since kindergarten, so we knoweach other pretty well."<p>A teacher adds: "My students baby-sit our own kids. We have the kinds of kidshere that I'd like my kids to grow up to be." <p>"We are like a family here. When people come, they stay. Four teachers have diedhere!" <p>The superintendent has been with the district seventeen years, a phenomenon giventhat the average tenure of superintendents nationwide is three years. Many of theteachers have more than thirty years of service in the district. The previousprincipal was at the school for sixteen years. The vice principal is retiringthis year with thirty years of service in the district. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="change"><H3>A HISTORY OF CHANGE</H3></a><P>Despite its stability, Oak Hill High School is no stranger to discussions aboutchange or to study by outsiders. In 1952, a report developed by severalprofessors from a nearby university studied the school to see if the program wasmeeting the needs of "its boys and girls." At that time, the goal of the schoolwas to "produce able, alert, moral citizens who would reflect the highestpossible development appropriate to their native ability." Bowling, dancing, gunclub, archery, drama, and riding took place after school, while the academicprogram was largely similar to the program in place today. The report recommendedthat a full-time principal be hired, a work experience program be developed,staff work collaboratively to determine staff assignments, and the library bemade more usable. All these recommendations were estimated to cost a total of$14,000.<p>The late sixties was a period of change. In a clash over authority andinnovation, the principal walked out. The superintendent left the next year,followed, over three years, by three different superintendents and twoprincipals. The elementary school changed to an open-concept school. The highschool did extensive work on curriculum; teachers had a significant amount ofrelease time. With the increase in social unrest as the Vietnam war dragged onand with the infiltration of drugs, staff and students pulled back into a moreconservative position, which lasted through much of the seventies. <p>In the 1980s, the district operated distance-learning courses for two years,using a small television studio in the high school, in conjunction with anotherschool district and the local cable company. Students were offered additionallanguages and higher-level physics and math courses. The district alsoexperienced a drop in student population. While the high school at one time had600 students, it now has 320. <p>In 1985, in response to another high school accreditation report, thesuperintendent, several board members, and the principal were instrumental inbringing a writing project to the district. The project, run by two universityconsultants, cost $120,000 for the original three years and provided significantrelease time for forty-five district teachers and administrators. (A group stillmeets, coordinated by Jane Leonard, one of the teachers at the high school.) Theproject helped teachers understand the role language and writing play in learningacross all disciplines. <p>A 1990 study called <i>Learning Change</i>, by Onore and Lester, described theintentions and the outcomes of the Oak Hill writing project. Some teachers movedaway from beliefs and practices about teaching based on the transmission of factsand evaluated by short-answer tests. Others adapted the project strategies totheir existing beliefs and practices. <p>The book summarized a major, unresolved issue that the authors believed thedistrict faced:<p> <blockquote>Another critical issue is to take seriously the common sense view of knowledgethat is held by the educational community in the Summerville School District.This view is consistent with what has been clearly demonstrated by educationalresearch in the last five years for the vast majority of schools in the UnitedStates. The continued use and support of, for the most part, fact-basedtextbooks, internal and external short answer examinations, teacheraccountability based on achievement scores and the like represent merely thetangible testimony of objectivism, a belief system that supports the transmissionof facts, the banking metaphor of learning, the commodity metaphor ofknowledge.1</blockquote> <p>The authors suggested that until teachers and administrators examined theirfundamental beliefs about teaching and learning, the daily conduct of the schoolwould be largely untouched by innovation. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="today"><H3>OAK HILL TODAY</H3></a>In 1988 Dr. Nancy Brenner was hired to replace the retiring principal. While theschool was in good shape- the previous principal had run a very good school,according to the superintendent-the high school was ready for change. During the1988-89 school year, Dr. Brenner hosted after-lunch dessert sessions, at whichshe and the staff would explore ideas related to school reform. She studied andtalked at length with teachers, students, and parents about what it might mean tojoin the Coalition of Essential Schools, and she invited parents in to examinethe Coalition's nine Common Principles.2 <p>During the 1989-90 school year, the staff voted to join the Coalition and to worktoward translating the Common Principles into their daily practice. Over the nexttwo years, the staff made a number of important changes, some related to theCoalition, others not: <p><UL> <LI>	Special education students were mainstreamed so that they now attendclasses with the rest of the students. They receive support from the specialeducation staff in their regular classrooms and in resource rooms. Because theyare a significant population, mainstreaming has had a major effect on almosteveryone in the school. <p><LI>	The staff implemented a six-day, nine-period, rotating schedule and addedadvanced placement biology to the other advanced placement courses. <p><LI>	To ensure greater student participation in decisions made about theschool, they established a Student- Faculty Congress and a Fairness Committee tohear student and faculty complaints about rules, procedures, and consequences.<p><LI>	Two teams of interdisciplinary teachers, one in ninth and the other intenth grade, joined forces in English and social studies. <p><LI>	All ninth-grade students were enrolled in state board exam-level earthscience in an effort to detrack and upgrade the level of science for all ninthgraders. <p><LI>	All ninth-grade English students moved forward with a portfolio of theirwriting; the development of progressive portfolios in English was the eventualaim. <p><LI>	Staff have recently instituted and volunteered to coordinate "Seminar," aprogram designed to give kids a home base in the school. In Seminar, studentsdiscuss their academic progress, their personal lives, their class plans, andissues related to student government. </UL>All of these changes required significant work, discussion, debate,experimentation, refinement, and reflection. Each required that staff andstudents think hard about familiar practices, imagine new possibilities, and findthe courage to change. During the two years, the staff moved quickly on a numberof fronts and demonstrated uncommon spirit and colleagueship in the pursuit ofbetter schooling.  <p>In October of 1991, Oak Hill, along with other high schools belonging to theCoalition, joined New Partners for Better Schools, a collaboration with the statedepartment of education to develop systemic support for the kinds of changes theschools are trying to make. The governor had recently established new legislationwhich required that parents and students of every school be involved in thedecision-making process within three years. While the legislation was vague, itwas designed to involve schools in changes. Some staff and administration sawthis new partnership as critical to their continued exploration of the nineCommon Principles, as many of the current state requirements were incontradiction to the kinds of practices suggested by the Principles.<p>In the fall of 1991 a number of other projects were under way to experiment withchanging practices in the school. In her annual opening speech to the faculty,Dr. Brenner expressed hope that the year might bring more connections betweenmath, foreign languages, and the rest of the academic program; more breadth anddepth in analysis of classroom practices; and exploration of portfolioassessment. <p>Teachers are responding; a number of them are exploring alternative methods andtechniques. Mr. McDonough, the chemistry teacher, conducts mid-term interviews asan alternative to pencil-and-paper tests. Although these tests aretime-consuming, he believes he can assess students' knowledge better with themthan with conventional tests. Mr. Wiley, a math teacher, has his students work ingroups to produce short videos to learn math concepts. Mary Shea, a scienceteacher, experiments with extended labs done outside the classroom. Mr. Lacerrecently published an article on an integrated English-social studies unit hedeveloped. Finally, the faculty as a group are exploring portfolio assessment.<p>Besides these changes in the program, there have been several changes in thebuilding itself. The old wood and auto shops are under reconstruction to keeppace with current technological needs. The new technology center will include alab and a student center which will have computer stations for student use. <p>Underneath its dignified fa&ccedil;ade and its calm setting, staff and studentsat Oak Hill High School seem poised at a familiar, but nonetheless disconcerting,juncture. A number of changes have been made. These have moved the staff off someof their old, very familiar paths. The terrain is as yet uncertain and fragile,and still, a number of paths stretch out before them. Some are very familiar,well worn, easily trod; others are less so. Still others veer off into sheeruncertainty. The staff intend to go further, but where? Should they pause toreflect while most practices are still familiar? What would be best for the kids?What might be better for those who live and work in Summerville? What would bebest for those who work at the high school? <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="snapshot"><H3>A "SNAPSHOT" OF OAK HILL</H3></a>It was at this point that theSchool Change Study entered Oak Hill. Our first task was to take a quick"snapshot" of the school to attempt to capture what was going on inside andaround Oak Hill. Our snapshot, which included conversations and classroom"close-ups," was intended to provide an overview of what happens at Oak Hill on atypical day. <p>First, we listened to students, teachers, administrators, and parents talk aboutthe changes the school is attempting. Then, we took close-ups by visitingclassrooms to better understand what is expected of the students and to betterunderstand what teachers actually do. Once we had the snapshot of the whole, weexamined all the parts in detail to see what questions the snapshot raised forthe reader, the researchers, and for the people of Oak Hill High School. <p>It is important to realize that this snapshot does not represent the entireschool; rather it is a sampling. Many important pieces of the school as a wholeare missing: music, drama, physical education, counseling, the office, thelibrary. The reader will not see, for example, how mainstreaming works in thisschool. These omissions have nothing to do with their perceived importance, andeverything to do with the limits of time. We hope that later snapshots willinclude those elements not seen here. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><hr><a name="candid"><center><h2>Candid Conversations</h2></center></a> <hr>The following section presents a reconstruction of conversations and interviewsconducted at the school by the Oak Hill research team during the course of a weekin October 1991. <p>Forty-seven students were interviewed during the week. These students wereselected by a faculty member to represent a cross section of the studentpopulation. The conversation with students was reconstructed by creatingcomposite students to represent the most common strands of students' issues andconcerns. While actual quotations have been used, no individual statementrepresents the opinions of all forty-seven students we talked with, unless soindicated. At the same time, no quotation was included unless it represented anissue which emerged for several students. Students' names and gender have beenchanged to protect their anonymity. <p>The adult conversations were similarly reconstructed, using actual quotationswhich represent the general concerns of at least a small number of thoseinterviewed. The parent interviews were conducted with only a few people, all ofwhom have had some involvement with the school, although a larger conversationwas held with others at a group meeting. Because of the necessity of dealing withspecific disciplines, it was more difficult to mask the identity of the adultswithin the school. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="lunchroom"><h3>IN THE STUDENT LUNCHROOM </h3></a>In the lunchroom, juniors and seniors are organizing and selling makeshiftlunches and snacks to raise money for class functions. Meanwhile, a group ofstudents from ninth, tenth, and eleventh grades has agreed to meet with us todiscuss how their school is changing, what makes the school a good place to be,and what is most annoying. <p>They spend the majority of their time talking about the extracurricularactivities in drama and athletics. They have ample opportunity to participate inthese activities and a great variety from which to choose. They love the actualgames and the performances. For many of them, they point out, it is the mostabsorbing part of their school experience. They appreciate getting to know theirteachers outside the classroom as well as inside. <p>In addition, they talk a great deal about the advantages of a small school. Whilesome believe it is too limiting, most of them agree that they have smallerclasses than they would in a large school, their teachers know them well, andthey can get help when they need it. <p>In their classes they like variety, choice, and the opportunity to do "real"things. They are willing to put forward more effort when the work seemsmeaningful to them. They prefer to study deeply rather than to skim the surface;at the same time, they are torn about the value of the state board exams. Tosome, the work they are given in school appears superficial and disconnected fromtheir concerns, yet everyone also mentions assignments that they really enjoy.<p>Their relationships with their teachers are important to them. They agree thatteachers in the school are dedicated and willing to help them. Clearly, the newStudent-Faculty Congress is also important to them. They debate their role in itfrequently. Told that they can make decisions, it seems to them more often thannot that the adults are not totally honest in this regard. The studentsdemonstrate that they are articulate about their experiences in school andwilling to talk about them with seriousness. <p>We are interested in their thoughts on what actually happens while they are inclasses. Their discussion weaves back and forth across a range of topics:Student-Faculty Congress, Seminar, changes in instruction, math, biology,English, and the effects of the state board exams. <p><p>Jeremy (a junior): <blockquote> Not much has changed here, I don't think. Atleast, it doesn't seem much different to me. Kids go to class, they take notes,they listen, then they go to their next class, and then they gettested.</blockquote> <p>Tracy: <blockquote> I don't agree with that. We did group work sometimes in ninthand tenth grade in English and social studies, and our teachers in ninth gradewere working on integrated stuff . . . and the writing process-we had to get peerresponse on our work. What about Student-Faculty Congress and the FairnessCommittee?</blockquote> <p>Jeremy: <blockquote> You're right. All those things have happened, but we don'tsee much of it in eleventh grade, and I'm not sure that Congress is any differentthan regular Student Council. Dr. Brenner controls it pretty tight.</blockquote><p>Lyle (a sophomore): <blockquote> Some students really feel that the Congress is afarce. It hasn't clicked for everybody. Until that happens, you're not reallygoing to get student support for the Congress, and you're not going to get thechanges. So, you know, it's kinda a circle . . . until you get student interest,you aren't going to get the changes.</blockquote> <p>Sean (a sophomore): <blockquote> When I came into the Congress, I thought therewas a majority of kids on the Congress so that we could do stuff that we reallywanted to do. But then we came up against the board of education and the statelaw, so we couldn't actually deal with curriculum, we could only deal with a fewother things in the school.</blockquote> <p>Tracy: <blockquote> Everybody has the opportunity to participate. If kids wouldonly pay attention in Seminar, tell their representatives what they want, andthen come to Congress, we could make changes.</blockquote> <p>Jeremy: <blockquote> Seminar is doughnut time. What a waste! Everyone sits aroundtalking. Nobody listens.</blockquote> <p>Tanis: <blockquote> Our representatives don't represent us! They go to Congressand say what they want.</blockquote> <p>Tanya: <blockquote> I've noticed that the sophomore Seminar teachers are reallytrying to make sure we accomplish something this year in Seminar. They don'treally seem to be sure of what it is they want to accomplish, but they know theremust be something there of importance for us to learn. Every six days we have asophomore Seminar agenda meeting. They try to rotate kids into the meeting, andwe make suggestions about what will be discussed in Seminar. <p>We need to do two things-we need to raise money, and we need to select a theme.In both cases, the teachers have vetoed our ideas, even though students disagreedwith them. In the beginning, they made it seem as though the students would bebasically in control. We mistakenly thought we would have some responsibilities.I suppose the support of the teachers is definitely a plus, but I think it wouldhave been good for us to have been able to make our own decisions.</blockquote><p>Tracy: <blockquote> What about the smoking area? We won that.</blockquote> <p>Another student: <blockquote> Yeah, but what about eligibility? [Eligibility, newthrough the Congress last year, requires that students be in good standing intheir classes to participate in extracurricular activities.]</blockquote> <p>Jerry: <blockquote> Yeah. Teachers decide independently if a student isineligible. On the surface, it sounds great. But teachers are going hog- wild andusing eligibility in all kinds of ways. In health you are ineligible if you don'thave a pen. In Spanish you are ineligible if you have a failing test average. Youare ineligible in gym if you take two zeros. Eligibility was invented to helpstudents to get their work done. Some teachers are now using it whenever astudent messes up. </blockquote><p><p>The conversation turns to their personal lives. Many of the kids feel that Dr.Brenner is over-involved in their lives outside of school. She seems to knowwhere parties are and hauls students into her office for what they do on theweekends. Disgruntled and in agreement, they share a number of examples. <p>The conversation then returns to whether instruction is changing in theschool.<p><p>Sean: <blockquote> About change . . . I've heard that the Coalition is working tomake changes in the school in the way things are taught. Instead of the teacherstanding up and lecturing, it's more the student-as-worker, teacher-as-coach typething. All through elementary school and middle school, you're sitting there andlistening to this person talk and talk and talk through the entire class, andsometimes it's boring as hell.</blockquote> <p>If the changes come through, you're going to have to work a little harder tolearn the things yourself, with help from the teacher. It's most likely a betterway of learning because you probably remember it better if you sit there andactually learn it yourself instead of just writing it down and studying it thenight before the test. <p>It's not happening in all classes. It's hard to do in math. I think a lot ofchange is up to the teacher, since it's really up to them what we do in class. Inscience she told us to go and summarize a chapter and teach it to the class, andwe did it; in math you have to sit there and listen, so we listen and take notes.It's really up to the teachers how much it changes. <p>Tim: <blockquote> I don't think the Coalition is working in every subject. Youcan't really do student-as-worker in math. I think you have to lecture in math.The book is confusing. If you have questions, the book won't answer them.</blockquote><p>Tanya: <blockquote> Everybody says that math is a class you can't use Coalitionmethods in-you have to teach it the traditional way. I don't agree. I feel thatit is important that we look for new methods of teaching math, because it seemsto be a class that the majority of students have problems with, and it is alsothe class in which people seem to blame their teacher for their troubles. Mathseems to be a class that you have to understand your teacher's train of thought,otherwise you can get lost even on simple things. I like the idea of time beingallocated to work with another person in the class, one-on-one.</blockquote><p>The discussion about math is lengthy. Many of the students admit that they haveproblems. In some classes, students are assigned homework they cannot do. Theyfeel trapped by having to do work for which they are unprepared. <p>"I can't do the homework from dittos when I don't understand what the wordsmean." <p>"The worst part about math is that it is the same almost every day. There is novariety, and that can be so boring."<p>Some kids report a similar situation in one of their language classes: the sameevery day. On that issue, the kids agree-doing the same thing every day is hardon them.  <p>The conversation returns to the kinds of changes students are seeing in otherclasses, and from one grade to the next. <p><p>Mark: <blockquote> It's become more [of a] student-helping-student kind of thing.In science, our teacher gives us assignments. Every couple of weeks we do areport; he doesn't teach anything. In English, we don't get a lot of responsefrom the teacher; we've really been doing it ourselves. In social studies, everytime we have a draft we give it to a friend and he proofreads it. <p>But there are some classes that really haven't changed and I don't think theywill. Most of my classes are not interesting. We don't do anything that meansanything. I can't see any connection between what we do and my life. It's so hardto get interested in it. </blockquote><p><p>Students in the ninth grade believe that high school is harder than middle schooland that their teachers expect a lot more from them. One says:<p> <blockquote>In English, we have to write a lot and do a lot of drafts. When we write, ourteacher writes too, so she is not watching over us. She can really teach.Sometimes she does activities which don't make sense at first, but we havelearned to bear with it because in the end we find out. </blockquote><p>Sam (a ninth-grader): <blockquote> What's good in social studies is we used toskim the surface; now we go into depth and learn more. You are a native of aparticular country you have adopted. The point is to find out who the people areand what their culture is like.</blockquote> <p>Sarah (a ninth-grader): <blockquote> Yeah. The way we're writing this is reallygood. You have to write as if you're living it. You learn from other people. Youhave to pay attention.</blockquote> <p>Karen, a sophomore, says school has made her a mediocre student because it is soboring. But she continues:<p> <blockquote> The adopt-a-country project was myfavorite. I worked on Tiananmen Square with Sally. Sally is really smart, and soI had to do a lot to keep up. I didn't want her thinking that I was just hangingonto her work. We worked on the weekends and after school and did a newscast. Wespliced films together, wrote our papers, and everything. I still know a lotabout Tiananmen Square.</blockquote> <p>The juniors note that they can see the differences in teaching in the ninth- andtenth-grade years but can no longer see them in eleventh grade. They debate aboutwhich way is better. Their English teacher this year does not have them writedrafts in the way their ninth- and tenth-grade teachers did. Their teacher thisyear is more critical of their writing, and it is harder to know how to do whathe wants and how to revise a piece of work. They debate whether he is hard onthem to better prepare them for college.  <p>The topic turns to the state board exams and the tension between coverage of thecurriculum and depth of understanding. All of the students wonder how much thestate board exam has to do with the kind of instruction they get. The kids agreethat they cannot delve into things too deeply because they have too much tocover. <p><p>Cheri: <blockquote> Doesn't feel like we get enough opportunity to learn.</blockquote><p>Jeremy: <blockquote> The state board exam is idiotic. It doesn't measure yourintelligence. It's whether you can memorize or not. </blockquote><p>Tim: <blockquote> I think it is better to focus on something than to cover itsuperficially. I think this is good, but we're falling behind. For instance, wehave global studies and we have been studying the Armenian massacre. The stateboard exam doesn't cover it. We spent a week on it. You learn a lot from that-youlearn that it's not just the Armenians, it's the Jews in World War II. It happensto a lot of people. I think it is better that we do it the Coalition way, but forthe test we are now a week behind and we have to do everything morequickly.</blockquote> <p>Howard (a junior): <blockquote> I always wanted to learn more about the Incas,but we didn't have time. </blockquote><p><p>The kids agree that they like to go into more depth than they do now when theyare studying a topic. <p>They debate whether one of their tenth-grade teachers, who was very annoying butgot them through the state board exam, was a good teacher or not. Clearly, thosewho had taken the state board exam were grateful because they did well. Theydescribed him as hard-working, difficult to understand, hard to access, and verycaring. The current sophomores agree with the analysis, but the group does notcome to consensus about the value of the exam or its relationship to goodteaching. <p>The discussion moves to the instructional changes the kids experience in biology:<p>"In biology, we do reports and then we have to, like, teach the rest of theclass, and it's hard for some kids to learn that way." <p>"And it's just as boring as when the teacher teaches. We are still sitting theretaking notes."  <p>"It's really hard for me as a student to teach myself, to just go read a book."<p>"I'm really bad about teaching, especially when I don't understand what I'mtalking about." <p><p>Tim: <blockquote> Yeah, that's a problem. I did my report on specieization [sic].I worked really hard so that I knew it. I could explain it. I read and read andread until I got it. I liked doing this. But not all the kids understood whatthey were explaining, so I am not sure that this approach is working all thatwell.</blockquote> <p>Tanya: <blockquote> Last week we learned about mitosis. It was one of the firsttimes this year that we learned about something from our teacher first. Usuallysomeone in the class has to teach an idea, and then if everyone is confused, shetries to get it all cleared up for us. I'm glad she taught us this because it isan important idea that could get confusing if taught wrong. <p>On Friday we did a lab on genetics-dominant and recessive genes. Depending onyour genes, some people can taste certain chemicals and others can't. It was fun.Some students were running out in the hall to get a drink of water because thepaper tasted so disgusting to them, while others were sitting there, frustratedbut laughing because they couldn't taste anything. I could only taste one of thechemicals very lightly. <p>I think this lab worked well because I know the information I learned from itwill stick in my mind. I think that's one of the main problems a lot of us havewith learning: it's not that we don't understand it, it's just that we haveproblems remembering what we've learned; and simple memorization of facts doesnot work, though many teachers don't seem to agree with that. </blockquote><p><p>The talk moves to how they like to learn, what they enjoy, and what they findfrustrating. <p>"We need to study stuff so that it means something to us." <p>"Yeah, we like to discuss, to argue, to hear different points of view." <p>"At least we want to hear about things that are interesting, things you areinvolved in in your life. You can get into things if you care about them." <p>It is very annoying, they say, to study things they cannot relate to. Thesophomores who are taking French debate whether studying pronunciation and thehistory of France is really helping them to learn more French. They all agree,though, that the trip to France is a big "carrot" and that their class is toobig-twenty- seven students.  <p>Continuing, they describe those assignments or classes in which they haveexpended the greatest energy. <p>"If whatever we are doing is interesting, then we really are willing to put timeinto it. A lot of what we do is superficial."  <p>"We like to work together, in a more relaxed atmosphere." <p>"We like variety." <p>"I like to choose what I get to do, but we hardly ever get to. I wanted to startmy community service requirement a year early but couldn't." <p>"Sometimes it seems to me like we could choose how we want to do something." <p>"A lot of our teachers are our friends. Some of them, like Ms. Stewart, developreal relationships with us. We can go to them when we need help." <p>"Our classes are small so our teachers have time to help us." <p>"I don't dislike any of my teachers as people. I just get angry sometimes withtheir teaching methods. One of my teachers argues a lot with the class. I hatethat!" <p>"I know that our teachers are out there trying the best they can all the time. Soyou may credit them with really trying to help us." <p>"To be a teacher, you must be intelligent and educated. To be a great teacher,you must be able to make children understand." <p>As they pack up to go back to class, we scan the littered lunchroom. As they go,the students debate whose responsibility the cleanup is: <p>"The janitors get paid to do it." <p>"Shouldn't kids pick up after themselves?" <p>"What are the janitors there for?"<p>"There aren't enough garbage cans and the few there are are already full. . .."<p>These are students who are used to discussing rights and responsibilities. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="faculty"><h3>IN THE FACULTY ROOM </h3></a>  The faculty room is a livelyplace-bright and cheery. Many teachers and administrators gather before school,during planning periods, and after school to talk, eat, catch up, and check theirmailboxes. There are frequent outbursts of laughter, deeply personalconversations in quiet corners, and rousing professional exchanges. <p>While they may not see each other with regularity outside of school, the facultydescribe themselves as good professional colleagues. They respect each other andhave learned over the years to accept differences in opinion about how thingsshould be done. There is a marked lack of the divisiveness between those who wantto change and those who don't that is a major stumbling block in so many schoolsacross the country. It dis- tinguishes this group and makes them most unusual. Asa group, they seem willing to consider better practices while allowing differentpoints of entry and differences in beliefs about how things should be done. <p>Today, the faculty's conversation is focused on their school, their students, andthe changing context of their work place. As the conversation moves back andforth, the faculty illuminate several topics of importance to them: whether thechange they are engaged in is real and pervasive enough; Nancy Brenner, theirprincipal; the state board exams; the nine Common Principles; and finally, whatthey want and where they are going. <p>Jane Leonard, who has been at Oak Hill for six years and teaches on one of theinterdisciplinary teams, starts the conversation. <p><p>While some things have changed, we have to look to see if they've really changed.We have adopted a rotating schedule, but other than the fact that it rotates, Idon't think we use the time any differently. We are still basically forty minutesa block. Kids stop and start every forty minutes just like they do all over thecountry. <p><p>Several of her colleagues disagree; they think that the schedule is rejuvenating.Abby Steiner, a social studies teacher, believes that change is more pervasive:<blockquote><p>When Nancy brought the Seminar idea to us two years ago, she wanted kids to havesome place to go with their problems. A close relationship with the studentstakes time, but it has been much more gratifying than time-consuming. I see kidsin a different light. One of my student's father is on chemotherapy. Anotherstudent is a dancer and spends six hours a night dancing. The Seminar has taughtme that school is only one part of their lives. <p>[Also,] I'm working with Margaret Michaels to integrate English and socialstudies this year. We are teaching the Middle Ages now. She is reading Chaucerwhile we discuss feudalism. We try to line up periods of history. Everyone isinvolved. Everybody's doing an Exhibition.3 Everybody is working in groups. Manyare doing portfolios. It's rejuvenating. </blockquote><p><p>Tom Lacer (who works closely with Abby): <blockquote> Everybody? I don't thinkthat's true. I think everyone likes being part of a changing place, but not manypeople want to change themselves. I think we have a long way to go beforeeverybody is involved.</blockquote> <p>Alta O'Malley (who has been teaching for more than thirty years and has seen herown teaching change significantly): <blockquote> When I first started teaching, Iwould go home and read the whole chapter; [in class I would] lecture and putnotes up on the board. Kids would copy them down, and then at the end of eachchapter we would have a test.<p>Right now in our state board exam science class, we're finishing up a chapter onevolution, and I had kids pick a role of someone representing a particulartheory. For instance, one would be Darwin, another LeMarc or Devries, and theywould have to explain their theory, and the other kids in the class would askquestions. I would chip in if I noticed a particular question or point they hadmissed. In AP, they do the same thing on their own. Instead of me outlining thechapter, they are responsible for reading and outlining the chapter andformulating their own questions. They use the text as their primary source, but Ialso ask them to consult one other source. <p>I am working with Abby on some interdisciplinary work. What's very exciting aboutthe Coalition is the idea that there might still be a better way of doing things,that we can help kids to learn better by trying something new.</blockquote><p>Donna Martin (a health teacher): <blockquote> Some of the changes are not for thebest. I worked for months on a unit to help kids quit smoking and then Congresspassed a smoking area.</blockquote><p>The conversation turns to the principal, Nancy Brenner, and some of the ideas shehas brought to the school, like the Student-Faculty Congress. <p><p>Tom: <blockquote> Nancy started the Student-Faculty Congress so that the kidshave some means by which to get involved-to understand democracy. We can talkabout the system of checks and balances as they work here. The kids can reallysee how it works. </blockquote> <p>Steve: <blockquote> Last year Nancy vetoed the kids' request to have a wine glassas a memento of the prom. The kids took her to Fairness Committee.</blockquote><p>Alta: <blockquote> I think Congress gives the kids a real voice.</blockquote> <p>Mary: <blockquote> Nancy just vetoed the sophomore waiver of PE. The sophomoreswere hoping that, like the juniors and the seniors, they might be exempted fromPE if they were involved in after-school sports programs. I feel as if adultsalways dominate in schools, no matter how hard we try to dootherwise.</blockquote> <p>Emily: <blockquote> Nancy has created a strong academic focus here. She has lotsof energy, she is bright and has great intellectual curiosity. Schools and howkids learn is of high intellectual interest to her. It's a happy conjunction oftalents and interests.</blockquote><p><p>The staff move back and forth between celebrating the principal's energy,acknowledging that the school is a more exciting place to work than ever before,and airing their feelings about issues she has raised related to change. Somestaff suggest that they are curious to know whether change is an option in theschool anymore. Someone else raises the issue of absenteeism and tardiness,problems that are unresolved between the faculty and the administration.<p>Nearly everyone agrees that Nancy encourages and supports experimentation andmakes a wide range of experiences available to the faculty. Ken Fried remarkswryly that "what people want here is a visionary leader who cleans thecafeteria."  <p>Mary Shea says that Nancy encouraged her when it was difficult for her to try newthings, since she had already experienced a great deal of success. "I can tellyou it has been painful to get me to move off the beaten track. And I would neverhave done it if it hadn't been for Nancy." Mary designed two new kinds of labsfor her science classes and moved all ninth-grade students into state boardexam-level earth science. She says,<p><blockquote>I had tremendous success on the state board exam. I thought I wasdoing things right. I didn't want to change. I thought I was using the nineCommon Principles in labs. Students worked with other students and I coached. Ionly helped them when they needed to move on to the next step. I wanted them tofigure it out themselves. I thought that I was an engaging teacher. I don't givevolumes of notes. I thought they were doing hands-on things and that they wereinvolved. It's hard to understand that what you think you've been doing is notwhat you think you've been doing. <p>Anyway, I was confused because Nancy wants the kids to do well on the state boardexam but wants me to experiment with new things. So, I backed off and tried tolet go. Letting go for the kids is the hardest. I developed a lab where kids hadto record cycles of the moon. I had no idea if it was going to work. The kidscame in and started talking science to me. I was shocked. They became morecurious about what was going on. They learned about "frame of reference" whenthey needed it. Didn't matter whether they were the smart kids, the bright kids;they all enjoyed it. They were using terms like analysis, angles of declination,ascension, tide markers, compasses. <p>They enjoyed it. But we lost time. It was wonderful and it was a good experience,but I was two weeks behind at the end of the year. The excitement is seeing thekids involved in science. Refreshing. Kind of got me out of the [rut of] "startat the beginning of the year and run the race without looking left or right."</blockquote><p>The conversation turns to focus on the state board exams, which are given in avariety of academic subjects. This is not an exam in the basic requirements, butone which indicates accomplishment in more rigorous course work. Those who teachstate board exam subjects are much more constrained in what they teach than thosewho do not. <p>Abby: <blockquote> From September to May, I try to do essential questions.4 InMay I finish the curriculum and spend an entire month studying for the stateboard exam. I feel that as long as we have the state board exam, we can't do anymore. </blockquote><p>Bill: <blockquote> And the requirements are growing. I see it both as a help anda hindrance. I think that they are standards that can be used with thousands ofkids. Covering a little bit of everything has a positive side to it. We don'thave depth in any one place, which may be the lesser of two evils. But it is ahindrance to substantial experimentation.</blockquote> <p>John Nelson (a math teacher): <blockquote> It works for public relations-makesfor a degree that means something. It is a syllabus that has only been around forthirteen years. It is just getting wide acceptance around the state. Overall, inmath it covers the things you need to know if you want to go on inmathematics.</blockquote> <p>Ken: <blockquote> Well, we have the new partnership with the state department ofeducation, which suggests that we be given consideration if we want to challengethe state board exam. I am confused about our agreement with the state, theCoalition, and the governor's New Partnership for Better Schools. I don'tunderstand the relationship between the three. </blockquote><p>Emily: <blockquote> Me, too. [Several people nod agreement.] </blockquote> <p><p>After a moment's lull in the conversation while everyone thinks about the variouscomponents of change in their state and school, the discussion turns to the nineCommon Principles. When someone says, "I struggle with the nine CommonPrinciples," many agree. <p>For instance, some believe that the brief aphorism "less is more" is illogicaland out of sync with the program they have carefully constructed over the years.It is also out of step with the state board exams, which demand that teacherscover a broad range of topics quickly, and with the advanced placement courses,which come with a full curriculum that cannot be reduced if the students are todo well. Some of the faculty do not want to reduce to less; some of the teachersbelieve that the Principles require unstructured learning and a curriculum thatrevolves around student interest. <p>One teacher brings up another area the faculty find confusing: essentialquestions.<p><p>What are essential questions? Who should think them up? What makes them"essential"? Essential for whom? Biology teachers can go into raptures about allthe things they think are essential, because they happen to really like biology.Do kids need to know all the things biology teachers would call essential, orshould the general public let us know what is essential? <p>Nina Giambello: <blockquote> I have a hard time figuring out theinterdisciplinary stuff-teacher-as- generalist. With computers it's easy becausecomputers can be used anywhere, but it's harder with math and withlanguages.</blockquote> <p>Jane: <blockquote> I wonder what would happen if Tom and I just grouped ourclasses and said the kids get one credit in social studies and one in English.Things are still very teacher-centered here. I'd like to push some of thePrinciples further. </blockquote><p>Bill: <blockquote> I wonder about "student-as-worker" and "using their mindswell" and "student engagement." Some subjects just have to be learned. Unless youknow some chemistry, you're going to have a hard time discussing the role thatchemistry plays in our society.</blockquote> <p>Mike Torno: <blockquote> About "student-as-worker" and being a "generalist" . . .I like to give the kids information and let them take that and apply it. Forinstance, the students have to design a beam, and I give them a certain amount ofwood and tell them they have to span so much space. The things that they come upwith are totally amazing.<p>Then the kids come to reducing a fraction. Some of them don't have the skill todo that. So I have to jump into math and do a lesson on that. The kids can seewhy they need to do that; but, again, the basic skill is not something anyonewants to have a party about doing. You've got to knock heads, and you have to putit in there and drill it and drill it and give an exam on it. </blockquote><p>Bill (who worries whether changing the way he teaches chemistry will bedetrimental to the kids): <blockquote> I'm concerned that we as a nation areslipping behind so many other countries in the world. If I graduate a bunch ofvery happy people who have learned some chemistry, but can't go on and take adecent chemistry course in college and can't go on and work in industry becauseof that, then I haven't really done my job.</blockquote><p>Amy: <blockquote> I think we need to prepare kids to do things.</blockquote> <p>Trisha: <blockquote> I think we need to teach kids to plug throughthings.</blockquote> <p>Sarah: <blockquote> I would really like to come out of this with a betterunderstanding of the balance between rigor and the disciplines. If you read anewspaper article on acid rain, you ought to have some knowledge of what acidrain is and what causes it. You can't get on your crusading white horse unlessyou've got some knowledge of what is causing the problem and how to solve it. Youneed that background.</blockquote> <p><p>Several teachers raises some broad concerns about the Common Principles. <p><p><blockquote>Initially my feeling was that the Principles sounded very sensible.As time has gone on, I am concerned that they have become a new orthodoxy. Thelonger this goes on the more vague the Principles become. "Less is more,""authentic," "essential" . . . what do these words mean? Some days, I feel anorthodoxy closing in on me.</blockquote><p><p>Robert: <blockquote> I don't believe in all nine. Some of them are excellent.Others I can't bring myself to accept. I don't believe that less is more in math.</blockquote><p>Ken: <blockquote> I think that we are moving, and Oak Hill is now a much morevibrant place to work. It was never a bad place to work, but I needed theintellectual ferment that has come with the investigation of the nine Principles.I needed the discussion of educational issues.</blockquote><p>Thoughtful, the staff falls to silence. John acknowledges that change is hard toaccept: <p><blockquote>You know, as a parent and as a citizen, I want the best for kids. At the sametime, we are traditionalists. We want the same things for the kids as we had, butthe world is changing. I want mom, apple pie, Chevrolet, and baseball for thisschool. </blockquote><p>Amy: <blockquote> I want the freedom and the good atmosphere we have here to dothings better. </blockquote><p>Alta: <blockquote> Still, it is a bit foggy out there. There is still a bigquestion about what it should look like. I've been to a few schools andconferences, and the people I talk with don't seem to know much more about whatan Essential school should look like. So, I can't see what we're headed towards.I know you do things like essential questions and Exhibitions and portfolios,that aren't totally new ideas, although the idea of using these as therequirements for graduation is an extreme idea. I'm not quite sure where we aregoing and how different it will be from what we have now!</blockquote> <p>Warren: <blockquote> I think that this is a problem. I think the school isgrasping at all kinds of straws. We don't have a focus. We are doing too manythings, going in too many directions without really looking to see if the thingswe have done have merit.</blockquote> <p><p>Again, there is a lull. Jane, sensing that it is time to stop, sums up:<blockquote> <p>Truth is, we have just begun the conversation, done some initial first steps. Wehave hit the crunch point. Now the stuff gets really, really difficult. We arenow talking about teachers functioning in other ways and collaborating inchanging the way they look at time and what they ask of kids. The driving forceof the course may no longer be the test that we are giving in two weeks or at theend of the year. I see that as a huge jump. I'm not sure what needs to happen forthat, for people to feel that the leap is worth taking. And that is where weare.</blockquote> <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="library"><h3>IN THE LIBRARY WITH PARENTS </h3></a>One evening we meet with a group of thirty-six parents to talk about the school,the study, and the changes the school is making. Summerville is a small place;the parents know each other from various school functions over the years. Theatmosphere is comfortable, easy; clearly, the parent community is interested inand supports the children, the teachers, and the school. <p>The parents ask informed questions: What are the nine Common Principles? Wheredid they come from? Isn't parent involvement the critical factor in a goodeducational program? How is parental involvement changing across the country?What should our role be? Once their questions are asked and answered, most of theparents leave to return home. <p>After the formal meeting, a few parents settle in around a table in the libraryfor a more focused conversation. The talk shifts to their personal experienceswith the school. Rita Shore, who has a special- needs ninth-grader, tells howrecent changes have affected her son. <p><p><blockquote>School has been tough for him. He spent years in self-containedclassrooms in a basement with one teacher. Now he is mainstreamed. The fact thathe is mainstreamed is such a boost to his ego. He feels good about himself at thetime when most adolescents don't. And he's not out there on his own; he has anetwork of support. We are thrilled about it.</blockquote> <p><p>Susan Parker has been involved in the school for a number of years. One son justgraduated. Her second son, who is in tenth grade, has had difficulties in schoolbecause of a learning disability. He has always had resource room help for somepart of his day. Originally she opposed mainstreaming because she thought itwould penalize the students. She explains how she feels: <blockquote> <p>I became indoctrinated at a meeting where Nancy and the special educationteachers presented their plan to the parents. Even though my son isn't in aself-contained classroom, I began to see how kids' self-esteem is diminished whenthey cannot interact with everyone else. Nancy changed my mind a second time. <p>I used to teach, and so I feel that I know a lot about schools. I was not infavor of the Coalition because I felt that it was probably another experimentalprogram which would leave our kids with fewer skills.<p>Nancy brought thirty to forty parents together to begin to explore the Coalition.She asked people to talk about what they actually remembered from their highschool careers. We went around the room. It came down to when they had been in aplay or a sporting event. All of the examples were Exhibitions-demonstra- tionsof what they could do. It drove the message home to parents that when kids haveto show what they know, they work harder. <p>Then we had a more general conversation about the Coalition Principles. I got itvery clearly in that meeting. I understood and I'm very supportive. I also thinkDr. Brenner is an excellent role model for young women, and she is veryimpressive with a crowd.</blockquote> <p><p>Rita: <blockquote> Several years ago, we talked about deadwood in the highschool. Now friends who sent their kids to private or parochial schools want tocome to the high school. Things have turned around since Dr. Brenner arrived.Teachers are more involved, parents are more involved. You get the feeling thatthe teachers have a voice.</blockquote><p>Moira Christian: <blockquote> I am very excited about the changes in the schooland I see it in three ways: the kind of language that I hear teachers using asthey talk about teaching and kids; the element of respect, kids to kids andteacher to teacher; and the leadership in the building-change has taken place ina relatively short period of time. <p>I am excited about the Seminar program doing things like teaching kids abouttheir learning styles and providing kids with a mentor to interact with otherteachers on behalf of the students. I'm enthusiastic about the interdisciplinaryteaming and the topics -the Holocaust and the Renaissance that are scheduled forthis year. I think the Congress is great-to give kids a voice. I think all thesethings are great! I'm all for them. <p>The trouble is that I don't hear what I'm hearing from the principal and theteachers from my daughter. I guess I'm not seeing it reflected in my child or atleast not hearing her say some of the things that I see. Sometimes I think we seetwo different worlds. I walk through the school, and I'm excited and I hear theteachers talking. I mean, it has to be going on, and yet I don't necessarily seeit reflecting back with Neta. There is a real level of frustration in that.Where's the love of learning for her? </blockquote><p>Susan: <blockquote> Both of my kids have had a math teacher who is very rigid. Ihave argued with him several times. He uses the same stuff year after year afteryear. But he is using peer tutoring sometimes. Another teacher is having the kidsmake presentations. The social studies and English teachers are integrating.Tommy has done a film with a couple of friends on a myth. They worked hours andhours on it- after school, a whole weekend. I couldn't believe the amount ofenergy they poured into that assignment. While it may be a small change in somecases, at least I am seeing it. </blockquote><p>Moira: <blockquote> Last year was better. We could see more then. The kids had todo something with the moon or the tides and the phases of the moon. They had tokeep a journal and they had to keep some kind of a data record and they had todraw some conclusions. That was very engaging. Neta did the tides of theSummerville River, and she went out to measure it at eight o'clock every nightand had to keep track of when the moon came out. She was religious about doingthis!<p>This year, though, she's in biology. It all seems to be coming from the textbook.Although I think the teacher has a real interest and love for ecology and theenvironment, the class seems to be a lot of textbook lecture. And she says inSeminar they just get together and sit around. </blockquote><p>Marv Freeman: <blockquote> You know, I had a lot of kids come through thisschool. Seven, I think. Yeah, seven. My daughter Kitty had to adopt a country twoyears ago. I'm telling you, she and her friends were on the phone talking aboutit every night. I know; the phone is in the living room! They worked on it on theweekend. I called Tom Lacer and said, "Whatever you're doing, do more of it. Withall my kids, I have never seen anybody work so hard!" To be honest with you,Kitty isn't the star pupil in the family either.</blockquote> <p>Moira: <blockquote> Don't get me wrong. I'm hopeful. I have a lot of confidencein Nancy Brenner. She is a real reader-up on these things. If something isn'tworking or looking right, she's checking it out, asking questions.</blockquote><p>Susan: <blockquote> I'm waiting for them to throw out the state board exam.Wouldn't that be great?</blockquote><p>The group considers the implications. What would that mean? More Exhibitions?They were all for that. How would the kids get into college? What would the statesay? Would the teachers want that? <p>It is getting late. As the parents move out to their cars, they mull over thepossibilities. The group is open to them but they need more information. <p>The parents reveal interesting perspectives. While we have visited with too fewto draw any general conclusions, those with whom we talked seem supportive ofchange and supportive of the school. Three see evidence of the changes under wayin their children's work; one sees the evidence in the school but does not see itthrough her child. They all agree that the school is more academically focusedand energetic than in previous years. Given adequate information, they appearwilling to entertain more changes. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="principal"><h3>IN THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE </h3></a>Nancy's door opens as sheconcludes a discussion with the student-body president about whether Congress hasthe right to discuss Nancy's involvement in their personal lives. She switchesgears as we come in and begins by describing her respect for the faculty andstudents of Oak Hill. <p><blockquote>I came here from two previous school districts-both were excitingplaces to be. I wondered whether I'd like it here; at first it seems like asleepy kind of place. Fortunately for me, everyone I have worked with has beenjust great. I feel lucky to be here. The superintendent has taught me a greatdeal and has been very supportive. The faculty is willing to tackle newchallenges. The kids are, too. So are the parents.</blockquote><p>She pauses for a minute and then describes what it is she and the faculty areworking on. <p><blockquote> Every year, I give a speech at the beginning of the year. I trackwhether we actually do the things I hope we'll do. So far, our record is good. Wehope to establish shared goals for all kids. I think that mainstreaming and stateboard exam science for all ninth-graders is a step in that direction. We hope forrigor for all, shared decision making, parental involvement. We hope to create acaring environment for kids and to prepare kids to participate in ademocracy.</blockquote><p>One of her speeches, she says, draws on ideas from Joseph Featherstone:<blockquote><p>At both universities and schools, there is a relationship between the means-howeducation is taught- and the ends-citizens capable of taking part for a lifetimein communities of free thought and action. Students can't learn to be activecitizens in a democratic community if they are treated as passive ciphers.Similarly, school teachers who are treated as cogs in the great school machinewill scarcely look the equals of kings in front of their students. Activelearning and active teaching are essen- tials for democratic education, andpassivity at all levels is its enemy.5 </blockquote><p><p>Nancy values good scholarship and is always reading and passing good things alongto the staff. She still likes Featherstone's point. <p><p><blockquote>I believe that, and I believe we're trying to do that with theCongress and with the Fairness Committee. We've developed a Seminar program tohelp support the kids. This is moving along slowly; the role is foreign to manyof the staff. It's hard to figure out how to spend the time and to ensure that itis meaningful for the kids.</blockquote><p>A small, lean, attractive woman, Nancy looks to be the human embodiment ofprofessional energy, not dither nor bounce, but purposeful energy. Shearticulates her thoughts clearly and with precision. She doesn't waste words, nordoes she over-simplify or aggrandize what the school is trying to do. She alwayssees it as a work-in-progress. <p><blockquote>This year, we're exploring portfolio assessment. I hope to link math,the foreign languages, the other electives, with other classes so that kids cansee the connections. We have to go deeper in our analysis of classroom practices.I think we've made important structural changes here. It is now time to make thepersonal/professional changes in daily practice. <p>Change is, needless to say, difficult. We take it one step at a time. Everybodyhas to grapple with this on their own. It is not something that can be mandated.I am appreciative of the fact that the faculty is willing to pursue betterschooling. They have voted on everything that we are doing; we are verycollaborative here. Without their support, their agreement to try new things, wewould be conducting school as usual, no question. I spend my time removing thebarriers for people when they figure out what they want to do. People havestarted at different places-one person starts with a lesson plan. Another startsby experimenting with alter- native assessment. We didn't move from one gradelevel to another here; the staff had their own ideas about what they wanted todo.  <p>When I really let myself dream, sometimes I think about a school day where mathand foreign language were at the ends of the day and staff worked oninterdisciplinary teams and took responsibility for the middle. Wouldn't that beexciting? Other days, I see different possible configurations. The faculty willshape their vision as we move along. </blockquote><p>Her energy level rises as she dreams. She turns from dreaming to her frustrationsand worries. <p><p><blockquote>Sometimes it is frustrating for me. I am a cheerleader, and that'swhat I need to be. People need encouragement when they try new things. Often thechanges I see are beginning steps. I understand that people must move at theirown pace, and so I cheer away. I worry sometimes that I mislead people. As Icheer, do I lead them to believe that the changes we've made are enough? I try tobe honest, to be supportive, to recognize differences, and remain true to my ownvalues and hopes. I also struggle with the budget. Going to conferences andvisiting other schools helps us all to consider what we're doing. Like everybodyelse, we face limited resources. Complicated business! </blockquote><p>The phone rings. It's the local media. Nancy had called the reporter earlier tolet her know about the letter the school has just received from the state,promising support for change. They make an appointment so Nancy can explain itfurther. <p><blockquote>I am also aware that this will be a tough year all by itself. We negotiate thecontract every three years. This is a contract year, in the midst of diminishingresources. The superintendent is retiring and Karl, the vice principal, is too.Both have been terrific to work with; I will miss them both. So we have manydecisions to make, more hurdles. . . </blockquote><p><p>Karl pokes his head in. Nancy is needed in the back. A water main has broken as aresult of the digging in the football field. She grins and says, "Did I mentionthat we have an old building?" and races off. Karl walks out with us to surveythe damage. He says: <blockquote><p>Frankly, I am sorry I am retiring. I am having a better time here than I have inyears. I call her "The White Tornado." She has good ideas and the energy of atornado. There is no petty crap with Nancy. No sign-in. She pushes. The facultyrespect her as a true leader. With the dicky-do stuff, she stinks. She's been aquick study here, read what the village wanted-quick to praise, quick to pointout what could be better. And the staff knows that they're not going to be at theend of a branch and get sawn off!<p>The current school situation is like a great cloudy day. We are seeing more sunthan ever before-it comes in patches. What is exciting about seeing more sunthrough the clouds is seeing combinations of teachers working together. Thathelps everybody get stronger. <p>Without staff development, nothing would have happened. It was not twisting arms,but expanding minds, opening the eyes, clearing out the ears, and pushing peopleout to go visit other places. Teachers here are less reluctant to share. Theirself-esteem and self-confidence are continually going up, the way she treatsthem. They're varsity players. They feel like they're on the starting team. . . .Yeah, I never thought of that before. They feel confident that they're doing agood job. This has always been a caring school. But it's more in focus now, moreconfident and more academic. </blockquote><p>As we round a corner, we can see water spilling out across the parking lot. Karlacknowledges the mess and hurries forward, still talking. <p><p><blockquote>"Less is more" is my favorite. I'd like to teach about a just war.Gimme a war, any war. We could get into the causes of all wars by looking at one,then letting kids pick a different one they'd like to know more about-a lotbetter than the chronological approach.</blockquote><p>The administrators are enthusiastic and energetic, yet they are thoughtful, too.They acknowledge that the school community supports change, but that change iscomplicated. Administrators have to re-create their roles just as teachers do;they, like the teachers, feel their way as they go. Nancy recognizes that thereare a number of paradoxical tensions as she recasts her role: cheerleading,giving staff accurate feedback on progress, allowing staff to establish their ownpace while working to move the school forward, encouraging them to establishtheir own agenda, and providing leadership. She worries about the appropriatebalance between these tensions, while at the same time caring a great deal forthe school community. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="classrooms"><hr> <center><h2>Classrooms Close-ups </h2></center> <hr></a>We look in classrooms for two reasons: to better understand what students'experiences are like in this school and to see evidence of the kinds of changesteachers, parents, and students describe-changes they believe provide studentswith more engaging and rigorous work than they had before. <p>During our week-long visit, the study team visited twenty-two classrooms, fromwhich we have selected nineteen to describe. The ones we chose represent a sampleof the kinds of instruction we saw. These nineteen "close-ups" are presented aswe saw them, without analysis. They do not reflect the full range of activities astudent might encounter during the course of a given unit; they represent asingle day taken out of context, and should be considered in light of this andother limitations. <p>You as the reader do not know what instruction has come before or what comesnext, nor do you know the students-which ones have special needs or who is in themidst of a personal dilemma that affects classroom behavior. You don't know whatday it is-a Friday, sixth period before a big game; or a Tuesday, first period ona rainy day. Furthermore, all disciplines are not represented. Still, brief asthey are, these close-ups do reflect what students report to be activities theyexperience frequently.  <p>Classrooms are private places where common practices have endured for many years.For the last century, teachers have worked behind classroom doors, conducting andscrutinizing lessons alone, without the benefit of collaborative examination.Teachers who are currently practicing were taught to teach by teachers who usedthese same practices. We believe that the examination of classroom practices isnot common in most schools; we believe that the staff at Oak Hill demonstrategreat professional courage as they open their class- room doors to reveallong-private domains. <p>Selecting from these nineteen close-ups, one can picture a day in which studentsexperience a range of activities. Each classroom has its own pace and places itsown set of demands on students. Old but important questions aid us in theexamination of classroom work: What are kids doing in the classroom? What are theteachers doing? How many kids are involved? Do the kids have to think? Is thethinking they are doing rigorous? Are they gaining experience that will help themmeet the school's goals, that will help them parti- cipate in a democracy?  <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="calculus"><h3>ADVANCED CALCULUS</h3></a>Mr. Nelson works at the board while students are seated in rows at their desks.Writing an equation, he asks the students to determine the laws at play in it.Some students call out suggestions, and he works out their suggestions on theboard. When students spot errors, they call them out. He gives explanations as hegoes and connects their questions to things they know. The pace is brisk.Students take notes. A couple of the kids get it; others don't. Some of those askquestions; others sit quietly. Students and teacher exchange comments easily. Hereminds them that calculus emerged after years of mathematical study-it is acomplex subject. He assigns problems 23 through 40 for homework, as many as theyneed to do to make sure that they understand what they are doing. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="math1"><h3>MATH</h3></a>The students are reviewing for a quiz by themselves. Mr. Macon paces back andforth, clarifying frequently what will and what will not be on the quiz, eventhough the students are not asking (e.g., postulates, definitions, logic, proof,reflexive, symmetric, transitive, addition, subtraction). "There won't be anytheorems-and no geometry." The kids seem nervous. They ruffle pages of notes. Theteacher seems ill at ease, too. He demonstrates the first problem on the boardand acknowledges that everyone will at least get the first question right. Hehands out the quiz. Students stuff notes away and go to work. Someone asks, "Howmuch will this quiz count for?" Mr. Macon replies, "Well, it's a double-edgedsword, isn't it? The kids who are prepared want it to be worth their while, andthose who are failing won't want it to be worth anything. I'll see how you do."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="math2"><h3>MATH</h3></a>Working in groups, students are reviewing their homework on irrational and realnumbers. They review for ten minutes while Mr. Wiley moves from group to group.Then, he moves to the front of the room and announces, "Section Five: Roots andRadicals." He writes a square root sign on the blackboard. "You want to know whatturns me on? The square of a number is one of two equal factors." <p>"Oh my God," says a student. "That turns you on?" Another student, who is keepingtrack of Mr. Wiley's bon mots, marks another tick on his sheet.  <p><p><blockquote> The square root of nine is positive three or negative three. I claimthat this is one of two equal factors. Everyone gets turned on by somethingdifferent. This is one Dr. Brenner would like: in the principal square root ofnine, the principal is positive. The square root symbol has to be bigger than orequal to zero.</blockquote><p><p>He introduces the topic of cube roots, amidst moans and groans, and discusses itsrelationship with what they studied last year. He mentions the state board examfrequently in the course of his lecture. Some of the kids look lost; othersappear confident in their understanding. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="home"><h3>HOME ECONOMICS</h3></a>The students are baking cakes. Some groups are making theirs from a mix, andothers make theirs from scratch. Students are analyzing the differences in termsof cost, quality, flavor, and time. Ms. Stewart moves between the groups,visiting with the students. Students are busy, attentive to her. As the cakes goin the oven, the kids move to clean up. Two boys who are kicking a small leatherball back and forth with their feet, playing hacky sack, are not responsible forany additional tasks. Ms. Stewart hugs some students, talks with others, andnotes that they will decorate their cakes tomorrow. The atmosphere in the room isfriendly, cheerful, and fun. As the students leave, the cakes are still in theoven. Ms. Stewart rolls her eyes: "I need more time." <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="french3"><h3>FRENCH 3</h3></a>Twenty-seven students are crammed into the room. Speaking French, Ms. Lahtonbegins the class by introducing the day's activities. Students, working in pairs,then recite conversations in French. They move on to a new activity: alltogether, the students recite a poem which they have in their folders. Theteacher moves around the room, listens to individuals, and corrects them quietlyby giving the proper pronunciation. As a transition, she signals the students totake turns reading the poem with feeling.<p>Ms. Lahton flicks the lights to signal the end of that activity and sets a timerwhich she also uses to signal transition. Students review their notes for twominutes. Buzz. Then a quiz. Buzz. Two minutes to compare the quiz to their notes.Buzz. Activity with les mots clef ("key words") on the blackboard. The studentsyell out which ones to erase. Buzz. Students turn to their texts for a discussionabout the Romans, the barbarians, and Julius Caesar. A five-minute quiz. Buzz -the bell rings. Ms. Lahton stands at the door. Students rattle off some bit ofthe conversation to her in French as they leave. With the variety of activities,the time has flown. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="spanish"><h3>SPANISH</h3></a>Students sit in a semicircle. Ms. Giambello moves from student to student, askingthem questions in Spanish to which they must respond in Spanish. With therecitation over, the students pair up and work on creating a conversaci&oacute;nin Spanish. They develop the scripts and memorize them for presentation to theclass. Two students are writing a script about surfing that sends them into galesof laughter. Ms. Giambello checks with them: one surfer is drowning the other.She helps with vocabulary but allows the crime. One of the students grins: "Asort of a fantasy." The student pairs perform, some stumbling and halting, otherswith verve. Ms. Giambello corrects pronunciation and vocabulary as they go. Theysing a spirited rendition of "La Bamba" at the end of class.  <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="english1"><h3>ENGLISH</h3></a>"Antigone, Creon, Ismene, Jocasta, Oedipus are the acceptable characters for thisassignment." From a reading of Antigone, Ms. Michaels is teaching how to write athesis statement. Twelve students sit in a horseshoe. Some students appearotherwise engaged, while the rest attend to Ms. Michaels; she directs hercomments to the latter. She describes what a thesis statement is and where it islocated. She outlines what supporting material is. "If you have extra stuff inthere, I'll write `Fluff.' You don't need filler." She reviews the content ofeach paragraph and writes again on the board. "Remember, you're trying topersuade. This is like a debate. You want to restate the thesis. I know you havean idea of who to write about. In my opinion, the first four are most important."Describing how each goes from happiness to sadness, Ms. Michaels talks her waythrough each of the characters in the story. Students spend the remaining fewminutes finishing their reading of the book or filling in the diagram of thefive-paragraph theme she has given them.  <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="english2"><h3>ENGLISH</h3></a>Ninth-graders are working on short stories and are at various stages in thewriting process.

Class continues as students work on their own drafts. Sometwosomes do peer reviews; others ask for Ms. Leonard's personal reaction. Somestudents, ready to move to a more formal editing step, submit their work with anattached editing-request form.

She is thorough, quick, and gives examples. A couple of students argue abit. She tells them that they must find an angle that they care about. The paceis very fast. <p>Ms. Francis shows a video in which contemporary journalists report as if theywere covering the Constitutional Convention. Even the advertisements are incharacter: "Pony Express Mail-Only Takes Two Months!" The film is engaging anddemonstrates the myriad viewpoints and interests that competed in theConstitution's creation. The film is not over when the period ends.  <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="social1"><h3>SOCIAL STUDIES</h3></a>Ms. Steiner shushes the lively group of sophomores every few minutes throughoutthe class period. First they talk about big papers which were due. Some kids arearranging their papers furiously, calling for scissors, stapler, paper clips.Others are writing. Several are talking. She tells them how the few papers shehas read came out and makes some suggestions. Then they move on. "You have acurrent events article due on Friday. You must do a summary. It can be radio,print, film, TV. It needs to have the who-what-when-where-why stuff." <p>She introduces a video of a CBS special: "Has the Middle East changed in the wakeof the Persian Gulf War?" The film deals with Baghdad first, then Kuwait, thenSaudi Arabia. While they are viewing the tape, Ms. Steiner indicates importantpoints on which the students need to take notes. One of the questions theinterviewer asks is whether the war changed women's roles in the Middle East. Heimplies that that was one of the purposes of the war and suggests that noprogress was made. As the period ends, the film is put on hold- to be finishedtomorrow. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><a name="social2"><h3>SOCIAL STUDIES</h3></a>The students in this other class of Ms. Steiner's are working on Exhibitions orperformances. In her classroom, Exhibitions appear to be defined as end-of-unitskits or reports. Students are given a little class time to prepare.(Requirements and terms of evaluation for the skits were handed out with theassignment.) "Presentations can be either a presentation or a skit. Use this timeto brainstorm for creativity. Use it for whatever you want." <p>Tom and Joe are sitting side by side at a table for six. They want to do aninterview of a Kuwaiti during the Gulf War. On their right, two boys drill eachother for a forthcoming English vocabulary test and alternately discuss theBengals-Bills game the night before. On their left, two girls talk about thetennis team and their project. The girls have sheets and puppets for props. <p>As Ms. Steiner moves around the room, snatches of conversation rise above the humof voices. Tom says, "We wanna do this like how it felt to be there." <p>"Yeah." <p>"We'll need two desks, a tape recorder, music from CNN-like a `Larry King Live'introduction." <p>Joe: "I'll write up my part." <p>Tom: "Think up the questions now so I can write the answers tonight."  <p>"It's August 2, 1990.

The kids are quiet, reserved. One girlmentions that it was easy once she got going. He shows an overhead of the writingprocess and talks about where they are now. Several students take notes. <p>They move on to discuss the film Gandhi. "Why does the film start with hisfuneral?" one student asks. Another answers, "So you can see how important hebecame."  <p>A question from a third student: "Who started the wars they were having inIndia?" Mr. Lacer explains. He gives them four questions to help them understandthe film, and they work in groups of four. He moves from group to group.  <p>One group asks, "What was the maharani supposed to do?"

Mr. Sagor acknowledges right answers and asks foramplifications, examples, clarifications. He seeks reactions from other kids:"Agree? Disagree?" Then, "What were the goals of the Five-Year Plan?" Answer."What did Stalin concentrate on first? What were the difficulties in theFive-Year Plan?" Answer. "You satisfied with that? Not bad!" They move on to newmaterial: a market economy.

She has them write theirnumber on the map in the space which corresponds to their location. She hands outthermometers, reminding them not to touch the mercury bulbs. She tells studentsto place the thermometer on the floor. Standing in the front of the room, shecounts out loud slowly, to twenty, to give the thermometer time to register thetemperature, then asks each student to call out his or her reading. The pace isslow. There is very little temperature variation in the room. Everyone is torecord all of the temperatures in the appropriate slot on their own sheet. Next,they measure the temperature on their desks, repeating the counting andrecording; then they stand on their desks with their thermometers in the air,again repeating the counting and recording. <p>When they are finished, Ms. Shea asks them what else they could measure in theroom.

At firstglance, they look lovely, quite happy-a cheery group. Every now and then I lookmore closely to see if I can know them better. I notice that my Aunt Gerry's grinlooks a little strained, as if my mom were pinching her. My mother looks like theperfectly posed image of wistfulness. Aunt Helen looks as if she is just barelycontrolling a mad fit of laughter. My grandmother, serene from a distance, seemsexhausted around the eyes and a little sad. Aunt Pauline looks haughty, as if sheknew she was lovelier by far than the rest. And Aunt Bernice looks deeply sad andsomewhat withdrawn. She is just a tiny bit removed from the rest of the group.<p>What is missing from the picture is equally revealing. Where is my grandfather?Why did they choose to leave him out? Was this a picture for his office desk? <p>This photograph, which captures one moment in my family's history, raisesquestions for me as a viewer and as a family member. The photograph provides anoverview of the whole, for it shows several members of the family together. Yetit also offers individual close-ups that, when examined thoughtfully, suggestmany questions about the family as well as the individuals themselves. <p>Examining our snapshot of Oak Hill is a little like looking at my mother's familyportrait. The school also displays a generally caring tone, a happy cast. And oncloser scrutiny, one can see more, can find the same kind of beauty, quietdiscomfort, energy, and flashes of emotion seen in my family picture. Oak Hill,too, reveals questions, suggests little mysteries, contradicts and clarifies allat once. <p>The first task in examining the snapshot is to determine which of thecircumstances, situations, and acts it reveals are worth preserving. We saw anynumber of things worth preserving at Oak Hill High School: the caring atmosphere,the easy relationships between students and staff, the relationship among staffand the parent community. The faculty is more open, better able to discussdisagreements, less divided than many we have seen in other places. The communityis supportive. The principal is at once respected and a provoca- teur. Teachersare honest with one another and with the administration.<p>We sat through classes, read students' work, saw and listened as studentsdescribed times when they were using their minds well. We heard about theadvantages of a small school that far outweigh the negatives. We listened asstudents described their meaningful involvement in extracurricular activities andtheir schoolwork with candor and thoughtfulness. They demonstrated the sameability to entertain differences of opinion as the faculty did. These parts ofthe picture should be preserved.<p>A second task is to see what aspects of the snapshot bear further scrutiny.Because it captures only a moment of isolated activity, such a snapshot leavesthe viewer with many questions:<p>Does the school use the nine Common Principles in its efforts to change? How andwhen do staff discuss them in order to forge common understandings or to clarifydifferences in interpretation? How do individual teachers' interpretations ofstudent-as-worker and Exhibitions square up? Does the faculty, like the planningcommittee in Ted Sizer's Horace's School, discuss the meaning of "less is more"as it pertains to their goals, disciplines, and students?6 When does the staffgrapple with their shared concerns about "less is more"? Can a set of ideasgenerated outside the school support its work? <p>To change or not to change? For some faculty and for the administration this is avery real question. Given the new agreement with the state department ofeducation-the New Partnership for Better Schools- and continued involvement withthe Coalition, is change optional? Can individual teachers decide to ignore it?Can people decide to change their curriculum but not their teaching, or changeassessment practices without changing the curriculum?<p>What is the principal's role in assisting change? How do we know which changesare the most productive for student learning? And since learning occurs indifferent ways and at different rates for everyone, how do the faculty and thecommunity respect the individual's pace, progress, and right to choose, whilemoving forward toward ever-improving schooling? What kind of time do people haveto work on these issues? <p>Another question emerges from the predominant characteristic of the school:caring. Students and faculty at Oak Hill are rightly proud of the caringatmosphere they have created throughout the school. The importance of caringcannot be underestimated; all of us want caring schools for our students. Still,one wonders whether other characteristics are sacrificed for comfort and goodrelationships, or whether other characteristics coexist with caring. What are theother primary characteristics of the school? <p>Kids are seldom asked to describe what school is like for them. It is true thatthey, like everyone else, are bounded by their own limited experiences. Still,one hopes that, in a caring place which encourages critical thinking andthoughtfulness, the kids would be able to provide some valuable insights. What dothe kids say about their schooling? What valid points do they make? Where do theyprovide guidance about what changes might be most successful?  <p>The state board exam raises more questions. Everyone in the school mentions theseexams. Some see them as limiting the possibilities for change; others see them asappropriate measures of student accomplishment. It appears that, given the NewPartnership agreement with the state department of education, the faculty and thecommunity have the right to "examine the exam." Do the state board exams providestudents and teachers at Oak Hill with the kind of target that supports excellentlearning opportunities? Do students retain what they learn for these exams? Canthey apply the knowledge gained in fresh and new contexts? Given the opportunity,what might the staff construct in place of these exams? <p>Finally, one wonders about the charge given by the authors of Learning Change.Onore and Lester suggested that teachers and administrators must confront theirbasic assumptions about teaching and learning, because these undergird the degreeand the seriousness with which change is undertaken. We heard important debateabout whether kids should know things or do things, or both. What does the staffat Oak Hill believe? How are these assumptions examined? <p>So, with the snapshot taken and briefly examined, several things become clearer.The road to more challenging and rigorous schools is a long one, a seeminglyendless one. Just when it seems that so much has been done, so much new groundhas been turned, new challenges emerge and new vistas appear: the Student-FacultyCongress suggests previously unconsidered possibilities; a new approach likeinterdisciplinary instruction suggests new techniques and new materials, and thensuggests that changes previously made need to be remade-another new schedule isneeded! <p>For Oak Hill High School and the Summerville community, some of the paths thatstretch out are predictable: a new superintendent and a new vice principal needto be hired before next fall. Other, less predictable paths offer choices. Thestate has suggested that the faculty has the right to reconsider both classroompractices and accountability measures. The staff is already in the midst ofsubstantial exploration and experimentation. They agree that they are at aturning point: while the changes made thus far have been hard won, difficult intheir own right, perhaps they were the easiest. Most serious change begins thatway. <p>But the staff wants to continue the change process. They acknowledge that thenext steps will be difficult ones: they will involve examination of long-held,common practices and recent changes; they will require personal courage andcreate vulnerability. They will require more time, more discussion, morethoughtfulness, and, yes, more energy. The choices weigh heavily-the right pathsare important because they will affect the vigor, the raw potential, theenthusiasm, the persistence, and the confidence with which their students leaveOak Hill High School to enter an ever-changing, very complicated world.  <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><hr><a name="notes"><center><H3>NOTES</H3></center></a><ol> <LI>This belief system, in which teachers are obliged to pour factsinto students, is sometimes called the empty vessel theory of learning.

Sizer outlined nineCommon Principles which might motivate the redesigning of American secondaryeducation. (The full text of the Principles is given in Appendix B.)

Everyone commented on thisand felt a little disconcerted. While nature delivered cold surprises, Oak HillHigh School prepared for snow days in March and unearthed surprises of its own asit continued on its journey towards better schooling for its students. <p>This is our second of six visits to Oak Hill High School as part of the SchoolChange Study of the Coalition of Essential Schools. As we do each time we visit aschool as part of the study, we came to Oak Hill for several days to speak withpeople in the school communityfaculty, students, administrators, andparentsand to visit classrooms in order to produce a "snapshot" of a typical dayat Oak Hill. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rd"><h3>Recent Developments </h3>Since our visit to the school in the fall of 1991, one important change hadoccurred in the larger educational context of Oak Hill. The state department ofeducation launched the governor's new program, New Partners for Better Schools,to improve schools statewide, and selected Oak Hill along with ten otherEssential schools to foster and develop the partnership. (For a furtherexplanation of this partnership, see Appendix B.) Visits were exchanged betweenstaff of the state board of education and the school to begin collaborating withthe school in its work of change.<p>Changes in the district's and school's administration also occurred since ourfirst visit. The superintendent announced his retirement, and after a search wasconducted, the high school principal, Nancy Brenner, was selected to be hissuccessor. While some students were not sorry to see her go, they wonderedwhether the new privileges that Nancy institutedthe Student-Faculty Congress andthe Fairness Committeewould be protected. The high school vice principal, also,proceeded with his plans to retire. A search for his successor was begun but wasthen put on hold until the new principal was selected.<p>The elementary principal was not recommended for tenure, to the dismay of some ofthe parents in the community. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fts"><h3>Focusing the Snapshot</h3>Before this second visit to Oak Hill, we reviewed the first snapshot, based onour visit of fall 1991, with the staff and students of Oak Hill.1 Some felt itwas a fair assessment; others thought it was prescriptive, judgmental, andmean-spirited. One staff member noted that when the faculty got upset, theresearchers backed off. Feeling that the researchers should not have done so, heasked, "What's the point?"<p>Karl Oberman, the vice principal, remarked, <p><p><blockquote>I thought it was pretty accurate, but a few people got very upset.Teachers are used to holding the red pen. They don't have calluses. It's almostlike the first time you're out in the sun. No matter how you're prepared, you getburned. Then after that you can get your tan.</blockquote><p>One teacher described her growing realization of its value: <p><p><blockquote>Initially it was a negative experience. In little snippets ofconversation, you could just see the angst bubbling up. It brought stuff out onthe table that had never been out before. We had a faculty meeting whereeveryone's opinions got heard without anyone being identified. People really gotto see a very wide range of reactions and all the personalities were gone.Suddenly, the whole staff was saying, "There are things we need to go back andlook at. There are decisions we made and we thought we knew what we were doing atthe time, but we didn't." And, I think it's been positive. I think sometimes youneed a sort of jolt to get you to step off dead center and look at things. Ithink it's provided that. </blockquote><p>While the staff read the entire first snapshot, the students read their sectionof it. The students reported that the snapshot was an accurate portrayal of whatthey had told us. One student remarked, "It was exciting to think that ourteachers were going to read what we said."<p>After working hard to communicate their assessment of the snapshot to theresearchers, the staff then asked the research team to focus on two topics forthe second site visit. In this way the feedback from the first snapshotinfluenced the direction of our interactive research work. The two topics theyasked us to focus on were: (1) the staff's interpretations of the nine CommonPrinciples, already one of the study themes; and (2) a more thoroughinvestigation than before of the kinds of changes on which people are currentlyworking. Added to the other study themeswhat it means for a whole school toattempt change and what it takes to sustain the momentum of changethese two newtopics helped us to focus our observations during our second visit to Oak HillHigh School.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="mitc"><h3>Membership in the Coalition</h3>When Oak Hill joined the Coalition four years ago, the school made a commitmentto use the nine Common Principles as guideposts for changing its schoolpractices. (See Appendix C for a listing of the Principles.) The faculty feltthat if they were using the Principles to guide them in their work, they shouldexplore what they understand them to mean. <p><h4>A Conversation about the Nine Common Principles</h4>A full discussion of the researchers' conversations with the faculty about thePrinciples during the second visit appears separately in another School ChangeStudy publication, "Interpreting the Nine Common Principles."2 Overall, thediscussion revealed that the staff have very different interpretations of thePrinciples. From the discussion, it also became clear that many staff have notexamined many of the ideas the Principles contain. In addition, the staff'sattitudes towards the value of using the Principles are very diverse. As a resultof having the discussion, the staff realized they have a great deal of work to doto understand what the ideas in the Principles mean and how they can apply themin their own school to create better possibilities for student learning. <p><h4>The Value of Membership</h4>In addition to discussing the nine Common Principles with the staff, we askedthem whether joining the Coalition had proved helpful. Several people believedthat it had brought resources to the school, gained recognition for Oak Hill, andfostered educational discussion at the school. <p><p><blockquote>It's made people think about what they're doing and question oldtechniques. It's easy not to think about your practice, but when everyone elseis, you tend to do it more. It's also caused internal disagreement. There arepeople who don't want to deal with the Coalition. You can't push them beforethey're readythey've got to see that it works.</blockquote><p>Some others felt that joining the Coalition had its negative sides. The physicaleducation department felt that joining the Coalition was related to a decline indiscipline in the school in general and a decline in the win-loss record. Theynoted that River View had been a prestigious school before it joined theCoalition but that its reputation had dropped. Another teacher felt suspicious ofthe Coalition because she felt it was prescribing a common denominator of goodteaching, while her experience has led her to believe that simply is notpossible.<p>Karl Oberman challenged the Coalition: <p><p><blockquote>Why the hell isn't this better developed? We're fishing around withportfolios and demonstrations, and how to get a committee together to view aportfolio. The cop-out I hear is "It shouldn't be the same for every school."Bull. You must have learned some suggestions. You must have some descriptions.Can't you say, "Here's what we've learned. We've made these kinds of mistakes"?Real wise people learn from other people's mistakes. </blockquote></blockquote>Now, as we return to Oak Hill High School in its fourth year of connection withthe Coalition as an Essential school, we see the staff continuing to rethinkcommon practices and to participate in schoolwide discussions about change.Inside Oak Hill the pace seems frenetic at times, more calm at others. As wereacquaint ourselves with the people of Oak Hill and the Summerville schooldistrict community, we notice what has changed in the school and what is beingworked on. <p>Through conversations and classroom observations, or "close-ups," we can get apicture of the kinds of changes on which people are working. We will includedetailed observations of two classrooms, English and social studies, which areworking on interdisciplinary connections. We move from the school visits tomeetings with parents, district administrators, and, finally, educators at thestate department of education. We conclude by asking questions which emerge forus as a result of looking back across the snapshot.3<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr><a name="conversations"><center><h2>Conversations</h2></center> <hr>We turn to the primary focus of this snapshot: an in-depth examination of thekinds of changes that the staff are working on at Oak Hill. We begin with areport of our conversations with the faculty.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tftac"><h3>The Faculty Talk about Change</h3>The faculty told us that the changes they have been involved in occur on manylevels. Many staff are working on schoolwide changes, while others are working ondepartmental changes. A variety of individuals are involved in changing their ownclassroom practices. Two innovations, mainstreaming and interdisciplinarylearning, have pulled in large numbers of staff. A few people are involved in allaspects of change, while others are involved in two or three projects. Given thelarge numbers of staff involved, the school is a swirl of meetings, anddiscussions we heard focused on educational change. <p><h4>Mainstreaming </h4>After the principal, the special education director, and the special educationstaff at the high school had conversations with one another about the issue ofmainstreaming, they agreed to follow the national trend to provide support forspecial education students in the regular classroom. Rather than simply followingthe guidelines provided by the state, however, they considered their own studentsand devised their own model. Special education students attend regular classesand are assisted by special education staff who sit in on classes with them;there are no self-contained classrooms. As a result, mainstreaming has affectedevery teacher in the school and will continue to do so. <p>The first full year of mainstreaming meant complete role changes for the specialeducation staff, new students for the rest of the faculty, and a need for closercoordination among teachers.<p><p>Kara:<blockquote> We developed a cooperative-teacher model instead of consultantteachers. We do see some students in the resource room. Other students we workwith in their regular classrooms. For instance, I see some of the kids in theresource room to work on whatever projects or assignments from any class thatthey might need help in. I go to social studies because there are eight resourceroom students in that class, and it helps to have two of us there. We go to math,English, science. When we work in the regular classrooms, we find that we cangive help to more kidsanyone who needs itand it enables us to work withdifferent kinds of kids. The teachers have been very receptive.</blockquote>Amy:<blockquote> Teachers are responding in a variety of ways, actually. Some arevery frustrated by the fact that their program has slowed because they have towork at a different pace. And special-ed kids sometimes have a whole slew ofpersonal upheavals to contend with. They can't seem to separate school fromfamily life, so teachers become their teachers, their mothers, their socialworkers, their guidance counselors, their friends. The frustration isparticularly severe in the state board exam and AP classes. </blockquote>Kara:<blockquote> Our role is to diagnose where kids are in their regular work.In some cases we delete some of the work. We compare the state board exams withthe State Board Competency Test to make sure that the kids get what they need.Then we adjust the course requirements. In some cases we grade their work andhelp with the reporting to parents.</blockquote>This has been a positive experience for the kids. They are less stigmatized. Theyare not so isolated. They are making more friends. They know they can get help.It prepares them better to participate in the world; they won't always beisolated by themselves. This teaches them that they have to learn to deal withthe total population, with their peers, with adults. Gives them time to developsome coping mechanisms. We like it better, too, because we feel more a part ofthe school.</blockquote></blockquote>Faculty responded to mainstreaming favorably. They told us they like working withthe resource room teachers and feel good about the moral implications of thedecision to mainstream. At the same time, they acknowledged that they areexperiencing difficulties. Several mentioned that they have not been trained todeal with this student population. The resource room teachers said they believethat this is good since it allows them to treat the kids just like everyone else.<p>Twenty percent of the student population has been classified as needing specialeducation services. One wonders, since the national average is much lower,whether such a high percentage of identified students is in itself a form ofaggressive trackinga way to provide more support for those students who commonlyhave difficulty.<p><h4>Interdisciplinary Learning </h4>Several efforts are under way among the staff to increase interdisciplinarylearning at Oak Hill. <p>First, many staff are working together to increase interdisciplinary learning atthe school. Tom Pacer and Jane Leonard are working with Abby Steiner and MargeMichaels to rethink the ninth- and tenth-grade English and social studiesexperience. The team would like strengthen their curriculum, review theirmethods, and create more significant, year-end Exhibitions. The eleventh-gradeEnglish and social studies teachers, who are looking for ways to connect theirdisciplines, met with the principal to begin their interdisciplinary planning.<p>Teachers in other departments are collaborating as well. The business educationdepartment met with teachers in other disciplines to build connections withvarious computer software programs: Harvard Graphics in science, Lotus in math,and word processing in English and social studies. The language teachers areworking on closer connections with other teachers, both within the languagedepartment and outside of it. The technical drawing teacher is looking for moreconnections with other staff in order to create experiences such as the one kidshad when they made a discovery that they could calculate ellipses in two waysinmath and in technical drawing. <p>Second, staff development activities have focused on interdisciplinary learningas well. Heidi Jacobs, a professor at Columbia University and specialist incurriculum development, came for a day to talk about interdisciplinary learning.One of the interdisciplinary team teachers enrolled in a seminar at a localcollege. She said she hopes for time to share what she is learning with thefaculty. <p><h4>Other Changes</h4>Since the fall, the faculty has reexamined the schedule. The counselor designedsome possible models with which the faculty has experimented. After trying out acouple of schedules, the staff decided that they would change the schedule asneeded for extended classroom work. During our visit the faculty was in the midstof an eight-day experiment with a schedule which gives every class a double-blockperiod once a week.<p>The science teachers have worked on changes related to assessment and teachingmethods. The earth science teachers thought long and hard about how to assessstudents, since all ninth-graders were taking state board exam earth science forthe first time. A couple of them worked on oral testing as an alternative topaper-and-pencil tests. They also worked on an experiential unit about rocks, totake place out on Summerville Point. Mary Shea developed another hands-on uniton predicting weather conditions. One of the physics teachers is working onasking more questions in class than before.<p>The math department spent two days together to determine their direction. As aresult of their discussions, they constructed a new class for students not readyfor the state board exam math sequence. <p>The French and Spanish teachers worked together to organize their respectiveexchange programs. Some twenty-four students, two teachers, and a principalarrived from France for a three-week exchange. <p>Advisory seminar teachers at each grade level worked together both to understandtheir role and to help students raise money for charity. The regular advisoryseminars which met once a week will expand to the senior class next year, so thatthe whole school will be involved. Teachers noted that advisory seminars needstrengthening because the kids seem to hit low points over the course of theyear. One teacher suggested that she would like to keep her students for the fullfour years. <p>The community service program is under reconsideration to give kids earlierexperience and to help give a focal point for the advisory seminars. Juniors andseniors fulfilled new requirements in community service. The juniors hosted asmashing formal 1950s dinner dance. They prepared the food themselves, under theexpert eye of a local caterer, and, in the end, donated fifteen hundred dollarsto the Oak Hill Caring Community to assist with programs for the aging and theinfirm. <p>Teachers involved with the Student-Faculty Congress agreed that it is much morepowerful than their old student council, but they commented that they need moretime to think about strategies and to examine the ways in which they have beenworking. They noted that, interestingly enough, they do not find themselvesdivided, adults against students, in their discussions.<p>Grant Wiggins, who has written extensively about authentic assessments, spent aday in the district talking with the whole faculty about authentic assessment.After hearing him speak and discussing authentic assessment with him, all of theteachers explored portfolio assessment in a faculty meeting. The Englishdepartment, grades 612, worked for two days to strengthen the portfolios theyare developing and to build in more consistency in their use of portfolios. <p>In addition, the faculty was engaged in an ongoing debate about the value of thestate board exams. These exams, given in a number of core subjects by the statedepartment, have traditionally been high-stakes tests. Published in local papers,the test results are a source of worry for students, parents, and staff. Parentshave perceived them to be the ticket to college entrance, and staff have beenevaluated based on their students' success rate on the exams.<p>The debate revolves around whether the test is detrimental to student growthbecause of its emphasis on curriculum coverage, or whether it provides alegitimate measure of academic progress. <p>The writing project teachers met for one full day and two half days to continuetheir work by exploring Socratic seminars, peer coaching, and reflectivepractice. Dennis Gray, one of the developers of the  Socratic seminar method, andone of his colleagues worked with faculty twice. Dennis is scheduled to returnagain, as faculty noted that it is difficult to get the hang of the instructionaltechniques needed for these seminars.<p>Several faculty were involved in staff development aimed at moving the schooltoward change. For example, a second staff member went through the CoalitionCitibank training, which includes five weeks of intensive classroom andfacilitative training at Brown University, and he would like time to share whathe has been learning. The principal participated in the Thomson Fellows program,another intensive, though shorter, training experience. Two teachers willparticipate in a two-week course this summer to help staff buildstudent-centered curriculum. Another teacher will attend a seminar at Harvard ondeveloping "post-arithmetic mathematics." Others are working to develop computercompetence, and a grant has recently been secured for math and science teachersto explore change.<p>This is just a sampling of the activity undertaken on top of the regular teachingand administrative responsibilities to make the school a better place forstudents. There is a great deal of ferment among the faculty about what goodteaching means, what the best practices are, and what ought to be changed. <p>Some of the projects, like the writing project and the foreign exchange program,were in place long before the school voted to join the Coalition of EssentialSchools. The community service program began some time ago, but is in a constantstate of redesign. Other projects, such as the Student-Faculty Congress andadvisory seminars, have been undertaken more recently to provide a more engagingschool experience for students. Still others, such as the double-blocked period,new interdisciplinary units, and new forms of assessment, have been designed toprovide students with a more rigorous educational experience than they hadbefore.<p>No one on staff can avoid participating in at least some of the changes that havetaken place: the whole school is involved in mainstreaming and in double-blockedscheduling. The variety of avenues and the wide range of possibilities fosterextensive involvement. <p><h4>Reflecting on the Changes</h4>Individual teachers have been struggling with different aspects of change. AltaO'Malley described the year: <p><p><blockquote>We're really exhausted. Change is a frustrating and very tiringprocedure. It has its moments of despair when you say, "What are we doing and whyaren't these kids in academic time slots?" The different schedules of X days andCongress days and double-period days are very confusing. If we're trying totrain the kids to be flexible, I think we're doing a good job. It's just thefaculty that's having problems! Still, I think our faculty is unique. Besidescaring, it's a serious faculty. There's a real commitment to finding the bestways to do things so that our kids learn.</blockquote><p>One of the math teachers shared that he does not always get from an innovationwhat he wants: "Sometimes they just take so much time." Other times, he is notsure the students get out of it what he hoped they would. Sometimes the problemis that the students want to be told what it is that they have to know. Hewondered whether he is alone in this. <p>Several people mentioned that some of the kids are not "kicking in." Mary Sheaelaborated: <p><p><blockquote>There's this whole group of kids May Dartor calls "the able but notwilling." At a school like this, people go out of their way for kids and there'sa certain amount of anger on my part with some of these kids. I feel as if I'veoffered them the menu in every way I can think of to make it enticing andinteresting, and I'll be damned if you're going to sit there period after periodand not attend. And still there are kids who just sit there in a kind of zone ofdeadness. It's as if they are saying, "I'm here, but I don't want to be here andI don't want to play this game and I refuse to play!" It's not a kid who'ssaying, I don't understand. It's a kid who just isn't there. They are zombiekids, and somehow they are making us feel tremendously guilty, like we'resupposed to solve the problem of student engagement.</blockquote><h4>Future Directions </h4>While in the midst of so much change, the faculty continues to look ahead to thefuture. The principal and one of the counselors attended eight small-groupluncheon conversations with the faculty to discuss the school's progress and todetermine its direction. In order to bring some coherence to their many efforts,the faculty gathered together in small groups all through the spring to plancurrent activities and future directions. <p>Almost everyone agreed that selecting a good "nudger" principal and a viceprincipal who worked as well with students as Karl did was their biggestchallenge and most important undertaking. One of the teachers described a<cite>nudger </cite>as someone who points out to you when what you are doingdoesn't match what you are saying. Others said it means finding someone who willpush them toward better practices, rather than allowing them to be satisfied withthe status quo. Nancy, most agreed, was a superb nudger. They want someone likeher. Still, the staff seem happy for Nancy. They respect her and, for the mostpart, appreciate what she has done. They are hoping for improved relations withthe central office and feel that she will shake up the entire district. <p>The staff also hope to review attendance policies and are looking for somesupport from the new administrators. To date, there has been an ongoing debateabout the attendance policy. Some think the policy goes back as far as thirtyyears. Currently, attendance issues are the responsibility of individualteachers, but the group expressed the belief that administrators should offersome support. <p>The administrators hope for more personalized, less formal, and less negativerelations between teachers and their students' families; in other words, theywould like closer connections between the home and school. <p>Another major challenge emerged. In the first snapshot, teachers of the stateboard exam courses claimed that they could not move any further withinstructional change because of the restraints of these state-mandated exams.Decisions about change seemed out of their hands. This time, many staff agreedthat doing away with the state board exams and with their prescribed "coveragecurriculum" is the next task the faculty faces, even while they recognized thatthere is not yet consensus about this. Faculty members said they feel that theyare in a good position to do something now that they have the relationship withthe state department of education that should allow them some consideration. <p>In addition, both the administration and the teachers expressed concern aboutdiminishing financial resources. <p>So, while staff catch their breath, shore up their energy, and hone expertiseduring the summer months, they look forward to selecting a new administrativeteam and to rethinking some long-sanctioned assessment practices. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="twts"><h3>Talking With the Students </h3>We are delighted to see the students again, five months after our initial visit.Time makes a difference: there are more braces; the seniors know where they aregoing to college; and kids tell us of new jobs, grandparents' deaths, falling inlove, and personal conversions. <p>In this second visit to Oak Hill, we did two things differently from before: weadded a group of eight seniors in order to give us a sense of the full fouryears. And, although we learned from before that students were anxious to talk,we asked particular questions which could probe beyond simple responses, toelicit specific examples and experiences. Interviewing fifty students, we askedthe students questions that were rephrased but parallel to those we asked theteachers. We asked what had happened in the school since we had met last, whenthey felt that they were using their minds well in school, whether they prefer tolearn a little about a lot or a lot about a little. We talked about how theyreceive feedback on their work and what their most important learnings are forthe year. We asked what motivates them, what they gain from theirextracurricular activities, and when they felt that they work well with theirteachers. Again, the students were thoughtful, argued among themselves, andshowed a range of opinions and attitudes. <p>As in our first visit, we could see differences in experiences between the agegroups, and similarities across them. Two of the students seemed to be verydisengaged and feel quite hopeless. Others struggle in some classes and loveothers. Several students are good scholars who do very well overall. The picturethey painted goes beyond adolescent complaining about the unfairness of theirforced march through school; it illuminates when learning seems like an activityworth pursuing with some vigor. <p><h4>What Is New?</h4>When we asked them what is new, two topics dominated: the new superintendencyand the double-blocked schedule with which the school has been experimenting foran eight-day period. <p>"Since you were here last, we've been experimenting with a double-blocked periodso the teachers can try different things...." <p>"And Dr. Brenner is going to be the new superintendent, and the vice principalis retiring, too." <p>"I was on a search committee for the VP's job, but it had to be put on hold whenDr. Brenner was considered for the superintendency." <p>When the juniors tell about their dinner dance that raised fifteen hundreddollars for Oak Hill Caring, the sophomores and freshmen groan: they are justbeginning to raise money. <p>We slowed down and returned to the double-block periods. We asked for examples ofthe kinds of activities they are engaged in and whether they feel that the doubleblocks are serving the purpose or not.:<p></blockquote><blockquote>We're making a large map of Summerville for the French visitorscoming. Another day, we spent two periods reviewing for the state board exam inmath.</blockquote><blockquote>We're studying for the state board exam in my language class, too.When you're following the state board exam syllabus, it's hard to be imaginative.And when you're drilling for the whole period, it gets a littledragging.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>We've been doing what we usually do and then getting movies.</blockquote><p>Students agreed that forty minutes is enough in a class where they drill, thatthe state board exam constrains teachers' ability to do things differently, andthat they like the double block when it gives them time to concentrate.<p>The conversation returned to the transitions in leadership at the school. Dr.Brenner irritated the students with whom we spoke because they see a discrepancybetween her description of student empowerment and the decisions she has made.They are no longer allowed to leave study halls. While that was always the rule,it was never enforced. They see the new student center as a public relationsploy; they were promised computers and there are none there. <p>Some told us they felt they have had inadequate information on the changes takingplace in the school. The kids showed interest in knowing what the Coalition isand what the School Change Study is about. They know very well that some of theirteachers disagree with the effort to change and that others think it isworthwhile. <p>Students who made presentations for the state board of education said it was aridiculous experience. They did not know why they were going, and then one ofthe board members slept through their presentation. The students were alsorepelled by the treatment the adults conferred on the visiting board members:"It's like they are royalty or something!"<p>What most offended them was the green hair incident, which another studentexplained: One girl, who for a long time has dressed differently, came intoschool with her hair sprayed green. She also had sunglasses on. The principalcalled her into her office, claiming she thought the girl was stoned, which shewasn't. Dr. Brenner sent her home to wash the spray out of her hair. Everyoneended up upset over the whole thing. There is no written dress code in theschool, so why was she singled out?<p>The next day, many students had colorful hair in protest to what the studentsfelt had been unfair treatment. Some kids were called into the office by theprincipal and vice principal and had to call their parents; others were leftalone. Why the varied treatment?<p>Still, several students indicated a kind of grudging nervousness about Dr.Brenner's leaving: <p><p><blockquote>There's trepidation that I hope we get someone who works as hard asDr. Brenner did, because even though the kids didn't get along with her, it doesseem like she's done a lot for the school. Now people are afraid that we won'tget someone like her. </blockquote><h4>Using Their Minds Well </h4>We asked students to describe for us what they are doing in school when theybelieve they are using their minds well, which we described as thinking hard, ormoving through confusion to understanding.4<p>Their first reaction was to answer the question by pointing out where they feelthat they are using their minds the least well. While several of the students inour sample said they feel competent in math, the majority reported difficultiesand felt least competent in math. The students' grade level makes no difference:math class is the place where the majority of the kids feel inept. They ridiculedthemselves:<p>"I must be really dense; but it doesn't make sense to me." <p>"I am just plain stupid in math." <p>"I am hopeless in math."<p>"Math is hard for losers like me." Another agreed,<p><p><blockquote>I've been lost all year in math, and I feel so stupid. I can'tunderstand what my teacher is talking about. I don't even like to work in groupsbecause I don't know what they are talking about. I hate it!</blockquote></blockquote>A number of the students have tutors. A majority of the kids we spoke to stayafter school for help. Several feel frustrated because they felt that they cannotget adequate help; there are too many kids around to get real help on individualproblems, or their teacher coaches after school and has to leave.<p>When we asked why kids have so much trouble in math, they suggest that it isbecause the class is the same day after day after day, and the methods do notvary enough for them to really learn. One student remarked, "The only class thatwasn't hands-on this year was math." In some classes they feel labeled, whichmakes them feel defeated before they begin. In other classes they noted that theteacher does not walk them through the new material first; students are supposedto do it on their own. They find this enormously frustrating. <p>Relevance is also a major issue: <p><p><blockquote>To help me? Maybe show some examples of where some of the stuff weare learning might be used in outer life. I guess a lot of times I just feel thatI'm doing something that I am probably going to forget and that I am not goingto need. I just feel like it is pointless.</blockquote><p>Another student argued with him:<p><p><blockquote>Math and science teach critical thinking. You may not remember a lotof the stuff like a hyperbola, but the critical thinking you learn from it isvery important. With word problems, you really have to think about it.</blockquote><p>Unfortunately, while several of the students felt this way, the others felt tooinsecure about their own competence to agree. <p>The discussion then moved back to when the kids feel that they do use their mindswell. Many of the students said that they do not have to work hard at school.They said that they do a lot of busywork and could not think of an example:<p>"I spend most of my time in school listening to teachers talk and taking notes.It isn't hard." <p>"I can't think of a time when I had to think hard at school." <p>"School is a grind. It makes us zombies." <p>"We feel pushed to cover, not think hard." 	Others, disagreeing, offered theirinsights: <p>"We have to read, think about it and be prepared to discuss in social studies."<p>"We do things in labs." <p>"I like the integrated stuff we do in English and social studies."<p>Another student described learning by doing:<p><p><blockquote>I remember all the hands-on projects I've done this year, but I don'tremember the tests I've taken. We did this experiment with beads in science tolearn about permeability and water retention. We worked with it. We did a groupproject in science. I was a photographic journalist, sent to Kenya to takepictures of endangered animals. It was a three-week project. At the end of thethree weeks you were paid money. She had a store in the back of the room where wecould buy stuff. </blockquote><blockquote>It was a pain in the butt, but what I learned is that photojournalismis hard. There is a lot of preparation. A lot of things you have to be carefulof, a lot of stuff to do. We used an atlas and had to say what clothes to bring,how to transfer your money, where to find hotels, what airport you'd be landingat. We had to go to a travel agent. We had to list the equipment we'd need. Wehad to do a journal about what we did every day.</blockquote><blockquote>In my English class, it's different from all of my other classes,where I can expect the same thing every day. Whenever we go in there, anythingcan break out. It's a challenge.</blockquote><p>Two students said that they are using their minds well when they are takingnotes. One said that he likes taking lecture notes because then he does not haveto read. The other student said, <p><p><blockquote>I know I'm getting something accomplished when I'm taking notes. Ilike it because you don't get mixed up. When I have to put my own opinion in, itmight not be correct, but when she is saying it, then I know it's right. It'seasier that way.</blockquote><p>Two students said they do not use their minds well at school, but they do whenthey are working on their homework or when they are talking to teachers afterschool. Others said that their time is well spent doing community service work.They use their minds there or in other out-of-school activities. <p>In conclusion, students indicated that they feel the least competent in math.They suggested that the tedium, lack of individualization, and lack of relevancecontribute to their difficulty. A number of students said that they do not usetheir minds well in schoolthat it is not hard and that they are not challenged.Others suggested that they are using their minds well when they are doing things:reading, discussing, working in groups, tackling new material, and working onsimulations.<p>Two students indicated that they believe they are using their minds well whenthey are copying notes; but they suggest that the reason for their belief is thatthen they know they are getting right answers, rather than developing anything asuncertain as an opinion. <p><h4> A Little about a Lot or a Lot about a Little </h4>When asked whether they think it is more important to know a little about a lotor a lot about a little, the students, without any prompting, answered withspecific examples:<p></blockquote><blockquote>Studying things in depth sometimes is boring. We do that for socialstudies. Several chapters ago, it seems like it was taking forever. We were doingIndia and China and all those things, and it just kept dragging on. There wasn'tmuch the teacher could show us. It was basically dictating to us and peopletaking notes.</blockquote><p><blockquote>Probably a lot about a little. If you know a little about a lot, it'snot much help. You can't explain too much. But maybe it depends on the subject.Like in math, it's probably better to know a lot about a little bit. Because withmath, there is probably a definite right and wrong answer, and on a test you aregoing to have to know how to do it.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>I'd like to learn as much as possible, but I'd like it if they madeconnections. Like if we learned a lot about one thing and then we took that onething and we connected it to every other thing. Like this year we learned aboutKarl Marx and the Russian Revolution. We learned it was the lower class thatrevolted because the majority were being treated unfairly. They were in povertyand revolted against the ruling class. She asked us to read in current events tosee where this is happening now, like in Haiti. </blockquote><p><blockquote>I'd like to go into more depth because then you have a greaterunderstanding of it. Our social studies teacher is tied down by the state boardexam. She'd like to go into more depth with the interdisciplinary class with Ms.Michaels. A lot of it is standard social studies, because we have to keep moving.One day a couple of months ago we had a Socratic seminar on medieval art. Sheshowed us a couple of pictures, asked questions on it, and people had to back uptheir answers with evidence. Now she's trying to play catch-up. Science has thesame problem of coverage for the AP exam.</blockquote><blockquote>I'd like to go into more depth on almost everything. Now we're onrespiration. We've spent two or three days on it. With all the questions peoplehave, we could spend four or five days on it, but we have to move on. I like tosee how things develop. </blockquote></blockquote>A majority of the students would prefer to learn about things in depth. They wereable to cite examples of when they already go into depth and when they wouldlike to spend more time on a topic than they do now.<p>The students said they are also interested in making connections and in placingnew knowledge in a context.<p><h4>Assessment and Feedback </h4>As the students moved on to a discussion about how they are assessed and how theyget feedback on their work and on their progress, the freshmen described theirexperiences first:<p><p><blockquote>A lot of times we are given the opportunity to self-evaluate. Theyare very particular that you know what it is you have to work on. Theself-assessments include categories in which they must rate themselveslikeresearch, development, skills, visual aids, presentation, etc. In social studieshe gives us the actual form that tells us how he's going to grade us, so we knowexactly what areas we have to improve on.</blockquote><p>They told us they like self-assessment: "You have to learn how to presentyourself to other people. We're going to have to do that in our lives."<p>The freshmen also told us they like the Exhibitions they are doing. (Whileteachers note that they have not begun to work on Exhibitions for graduation, asdescribed in the nine Common Principles, they use the term to describe someend-of-unit projects.)  One student said,<p><p><blockquote>The Exhibitions help you to remember things, because you have toscript your Exhibition, you have to research it yourself. There's one categorycalled mastery. At the end, when your Exhibition is over, people in the classraise their hands and ask you questions about your topic. It really takes a lotof studying to produce a script; you have to know it. We put a lot of work intoit. And you feel good afterwards because you've really learned something. When Iget a good grade on a test, I'm happy, but I don't know anything. It's juststraight memorization.</blockquote>The sophomores listed the variety of feedback they get: math tests, checks onhomework (which often mean reading chapters in their texts and answeringquestions), vocabulary tests, multiple-choice tests, and essay questions. Essayquestions often mean writing the answers to very specific questions, such as,what are the parts of a cell?<p>A view of a week's activity gives a sense of what they are expected to do and howthey get feedback on it:<p><p><blockquote>In health we are still learning about stress. We had a bit of time inclass to talk to the people in our group about what we want to do for ourprojects. We've had a lot of people give individual reports about theinformation that they got in the library about stress. We sit in a sort ofsemicircle. I think it's better because you can see everyone. He hasn't told usyet what we'll do for a final. </blockquote><blockquote>Math: On Monday, we reviewed for the test which we had on Tuesday. Itwas a very difficult test. We won't get the test back until everyone has takenit, because our teacher wants to avoid cheating. </blockquote><blockquote>Spanish: The usual. We had the first sixty points of a test onFriday, and we have the other forty points on Monday. The first half wasmemorizing a list of forty-two verbs and then forty of those were on the test.The second half will be filling in sentences with reflexive verbs. We've alsobeen doing more practice letters for the state board exam. </blockquote><blockquote>English and social studies: All week we have been watching a movie of<cite>The Tale of Two Cities </cite>and working on our essay. [The assignment wasto take the part of two peoplea nobleman and a peasant, for instancewhodescribe the historical events from two perspectives.] It seems like most peopleare very stressed about the essay, because they either don't have enoughinformation and have pure story, or the other way around. On Friday we had ahomework assignment on the Industrial Revolution. </blockquote><blockquote>Biology: On Mondaywe took a practice AP multiple-choice section. We corrected them ourselves andfigured out what our AP grade would have been. </blockquote><p>Another sophomore commented, "I just thought it was interesting to note that thelast quarter of the year is basically just used to review for finals. It seemskind of strange, because then it means that you're not really learning theinformation in a year, you're learning it in three-fourths of a year."<p>The sophomores noted that they are working on their portfolios for the shortstory unit. They said that they get to choose their topics in English, they haveto get peer responses, and they have evaluation guides. They like the variety ofassignments they have done in that class; they mentioned it over and over again.They feel as if they are learning new forms of work, and while they might notlike some of them, they are appreciative of the range.<p>They agreed that they like the "cross-over," or interdisciplinary, work theyhave done in English and social studies. Students in technical drawing aredesigning an invention which will be evaluated. The group mentioned that they donot have as many Exhibitions this year as they did last year.<p><p><blockquote>Exhibitions are more workbecause to display something well, youhave to have a fair understanding of it yourself. And a paper can be taken froman encyclopedia and you can rephrase everything. For an Exhibition, you have towrite it, then think about what you want to tell people, then you have to thinkabout the questions they might ask.</blockquote><p>The sophomores also talked frequently about their confusion about gradingcriteria and described it as a kind of moving target. They cited a number ofexamples in health, English, social studies, keyboarding, math, and languageclasses. Students reported that at times they are able to negotiate with theirteachers. Sometimes they feel that their teachers are not clear about what theyintended or what the criteria mean.<p>Worst of all, these sophomores believe that it is sometimes hard to get out ofthe pigeonholes teachers put them in: "Once you're a 70 percent student aroundhere, you always are." There was considerable discussion about this, and studentsgave a number of examples. <p>The juniors noted that they have standard tests in most classes. In English,however, they do self-assessment with their teacher. They explained that as longas they keep working on a paper, they can improve their grade. They debated aboutwhether the paper really ever has to get any better or whether it really has tobe good. They, too, have the greatest difficulty in math, and celebrate that theyare finally in non-state-board-exam classes; they feel much less pressure tocover things. They agreed that teacher tests are generally harder than the stateboard exam because teachers know more about what the kids know than the statedoes. They said that they have not had Exhibitions, but that they liked thembecause Exhibitions allowed them to play to their own talents.<p>All of the students described assessment methods that we all had, as students aswell as methods that are new. Besides taking multiple-choice tests and answeringthe questions at the end of the chapter, students have been engaged inself-evaluation, peer review, and portfolios. They seem to like Exhibitions,which to them mean oral presentations, following some research and preparation,and a defense of one's work. The students reported that these are more difficultthan traditional assessments, because one has to know the material better.<p>These students indicated that they like to choose their topics, and thatmemorization is less satisfying than working on Exhibitions. They did not suggestthat they are unwilling to do the work of preparation which involvesmemorization; they said that they like the opportunity to develop someapplication of what they know. One student reflected that the amount of timespent preparing for state-mandated tests significantly reduces the amount oftime she spends learning. <p><h4>Motivation</h4>We were interested to know what makes students want to work hard in school andwhat makes them want to do their very best. For the most part, their answers arenot surprising. Students are motivated by grades, siblings, college, the future,their parents, and by their own intrinsic need to succeed: "I just want to begood at things." <p>They are also motivated by teachers:<p><p><blockquote>In dance band, when we play a song, our teacher gets up and dancesand he gets so into it. That is the best feeling in school that I can have...when we're all working on something and he really likes it. He appreciates ourwork. Praise really helps a lot.</blockquote><p>The kids appreciate constructive feedback. Two English teachers seem to give veryhonest but constructive feedback. One of the  social studies teachers is verycaring. Two others make class very interesting; they care whether the kids arelearning, and make sure that they read and discuss interesting things.<p>Negative criticism has the reverse effect. The sophomores were particularlysensitive on this point: "How do they expect us to be motivated when we hear overand over again that we are the worst class?" <p>The kids are clearly motivated by classes that engage them. They like sciencelabs for that reason. One student likes math when it is taught by a combinationof demonstration, practice, and tests.<p>Students also revealed that they can tell when their teachers are "not intoteaching." One such teacher "uses charred lecture notesthat's how old theyareand he parachutes out of the building at three o'clock." Students findclasses like these more difficult than engaging classes.<p>Students also pointed out how deflating it is for them to work on assignmentsover and over again to get the same grade from a teacher: <p><p><blockquote>I wrote the best paper I've ever written. My mom thought so, so didmy friends, but I got what I always get. It's like the teacher has only one gradefor me. </blockquote><p>One student concluded the discussion by saying, "In my experience, there are twotypes of teachers: those who believe in conformity and those who believe inintelligence." The kids feel more motivated by those who encourage thedevelopment of intelligence. <p><h4>Important Learnings </h4>At the end of the session, we asked students to describe their most importantlearning this year in school. <p>Two students commented on teachers: "When my teachers care about what I think, Ilearn from them." <p>Several students offered personal maxims like taking responsibility, bucklingdown, and being disciplined.<p><p><blockquote>I heard about "know thyself" from Socrates and I've been trying to dothat. Trying to face problems. You don't have to solve it to know yourself. Youjust have to realize that you do have a problem and you have to know what you canwork on.</blockquote><blockquote>The second step is that you have to accept yourself. That's probablyharder than knowing yourself.</blockquote>One student mentioned that  learning how to do blow molding and learning abouthow plastics are made has helped him to "live in the world." The rest of thestudents talked about learning to work with others.<p>Four students offered their own perspectives:<p><p><blockquote>I learned you can't get upset when you work with other people if theyare trying. You can get upset if they don't do the work at all, but if they aretrying as hard as you are trying, that's fine. Even if the products aren't thesame as you'd like.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>There is always somebody around to help you, a teacher or a student.The National Honor Society seniors who have free periods are willing to helpunderclassmen. I've learned in classes, in general, when you're doing projectswith other people, that everybody should work. It's hard when some kids don'tcare.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>I've learned the importance of being able to work together withpeople, with sports and all the different projects I've done with partners andgroups. If you can't get along, your life will be more difficult. I've learnedthat working in a group, you have to accept their ideas as well as working withyour ideas, without stepping on anyone's toes or offending anyone. It's not easy;it's twice the challenge.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>When my father went to school, they didn't teach you to work ingroups. Now that he is in a corporate office, he has to go back to school tolearn to work in a group. We're taught from the start to worktogether.</blockquote><p>When the kids talked about what they have learned, they pondered for a fewminutes, thinking the year over. They showed thoughtfulness and an interest intheir own progress. <p><h4>Extracurricular Activities and Congress </h4>Most of the students with whom we talked are involved in extracurricularactivities. In the last snapshot they indicated that extracurricular activitiesare among the most meaningful they had at school. This time we asked them to tellus what they learn from these experiences. They suggested that extracurricularshelp them to budget time and to feel more worthwhile. Extracurriculars were mostoften mentioned as self-esteem builders, whereas self-esteem was seldom mentionedin relationship to school, except when students acknowledged that the task theyperformed was worth doing. <p>Students talked again about the Student-Faculty Congress. While many were stillskeptical about whether it is really working or whether their voices count indecision making, more seem convinced that they are making progress. They repeatedseveral times that students and faculty do not divide on issues along role-grouplines. The students were proud of this; it suggests that they are really workingwith the adults. Those involved lamented that some students continue to claimthat the Congress is a farce, but will not participate. <p>Students said they like having the opportunity to think about school and theirown work there. Their conversation points out how their lives are affected by thechanges the faculty are working on. They were quite clear about when school isabsorbing and when it is problematic for them. They were also self-critical; theyacknowledged when they could have worked harderwhen the responsibility for amissed opportunity was theirs. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="twtp"><h3>Talking With the Parents </h3>Eleven parents joined us for an evening's conversation about change in the highschool. Scheduled to stay for two hours, they stayed for three and were stillgoing strong at the meeting's end. The groupall womenhad children in differentgrades in the high school. Their children's experience was varied. Four of thestudents were having a very good year, four were having a very tough year, therest were mixed. The students ranged from those taking AP courses to those withspecial needs. <p>The questions we asked the parents paralleled those we asked their children andthe teachers. We asked the parents to describe the year thus far: to think abouta teacher who worked well with their children, how they knew when their child wasusing his or her mind well at school, how their kids got feedback on how theywere doing, whether their teachers knew the students well enough to really helpthem, if school was different for their children than it had been for them, andwhat they thought needed changing in the school. <p><h4>What's New?</h4>We start off the conversation by discussing the new developments since our lastdiscussion. Moira Christianson began by saying that her son, Tim, is having atough year in math. <p><p><blockquote>This is the second year he's had difficulty, but he does his homeworkand works hard at it. We've hired a tutor for him with whom he's working well. Itry to be objective about my feelings about Timmy and math, but I don't havepositive feelings about the relevancy of the course. I don't think I've seen alot of changes in math instruction, as I have in other courses, either. The mathteacher uses a methodology that he uses with all kids across the board, and thereis very little alteration in terms of learning styles, no accommodation for kidsthat don't get it. You do the homework and you take the test. It doesn't work forTim. I don't think there is real understanding on the part of the math teacherabout how kids learn. I feel frustrated.</blockquote><p>Most of the parents concurred: math is the most difficult subject for all butthree students. Another parent commented:<p></blockquote><blockquote>My daughter, Bett, has never been a strong math student. She wantedto drop her math class but was talked out of it. Just now it looks as if she willfail the course, but it is too late to drop. She is very discouraged. She wouldhave taken a different course in which she would have done much better. Now she'sworried about her transcripts and whether she will have enough credits tograduate. I feel angry about this. When a kid comes home and asks, "Will I everneed to know why <cite>y2-x2=z?</cite>" and you can't tell him why, it makes itdifficult.</blockquote><p>Jenny Tate said, "I don't like the kids being labeled in math classes. It's notgood for the kids. It discourages them early on." There was some debate. BethTurnkey's daughter did well in a class where students were put on learning teams.<p>Another parent of a freshman special-needs student said that math has made senseto him for the first time. The other parents disagreed, and discussion waspeppered with examples of teachers' unresponsiveness. They lamented that mathseems to be the most difficult subject to change, teachers seem unable to doanything except what they have always done, and that the parents cannot helptheir children with it at home. <p><h4>Using Their Minds Well</h4>The parents said they know that their children are using their minds well inschool when the kids come home and talk about what they have done. <p></blockquote><blockquote>Tommy comes home and tells us about it. He has a sense of enjoymentor accomplishment about what he's learned a sense of mastery or understanding.He did a poetry piece where he had to pick the theme out of several poems by onepoet. He came home, put it on the computer, and read the poems to me. Heresponded to the language of it.</blockquote><blockquote>He did something beautiful with bacteria in biologywhere he had todraw diagrams, to prepare note cards. He showed it to us.</blockquote>The positive examples abounded. The interdisciplinary activities were mentionedagain and again; several parents read the poetry piece and the paper about theFrench Revolution. They gave other positive examples: preparation for a trumpetconcerto, process writing, Socratic seminars, kids teaching kids, having theFrench kids here, the apartheid assignment, a film explication, the moon-trackingassignment, reading and loving Shakespeare. The assignments mentioned are piecesof work in which students have some long-term investmentproducts in which theycan feel some pride. <p><h4>Assessment and Feedback </h4>The parents moved on to talk about how their kids get feedback on their work.They mentioned tests, labs, and papers. Only two were aware of the portfolios.One talked about an Exhibition she saw:<p><p><blockquote>The kids, who were learning about apartheid, were doing a role playfrom a courtroom scene. They wove the facts they had learned in and out. They haddone research and put their emotions in itit was really critical and creativethinking in action. What was coming out of it was much more effective than ateacher talking.</blockquote><p>Another parent expressed dissatisfaction with current assessment practices: <p><p><blockquote>I see the same things I had: math tests, a lot of tests. I haven'tseen any Exhibitions or heard about the portfolio. I have tutored kids for thestate board exam. I feel that it is not appropriate to study so long for such alimited thing. My sense is that they are using the same methods that we had: readthis chapter and answer these questions.</blockquote><p>Everyone was eager to comment on the state board exam and its relationship to thePrinciple "less is more." <p><p>A parent:<blockquote> I can't even estimate what my son learned from the moonexploration over a few weeks. That was the unit they did in earth science wherethey had to record the position of the moon every evening and they measuredtides, too. Things that I never could have or would have remembered reading in abook. He was writing, thinking, predictingall skills that are necessary to be aproblem solver. </blockquote>A second parent:<blockquote> Absolutely. If we don't change to depth, we won'tchange anything. You hear all this talk about creative thinking and problemsolving. You can't do it all in the same length of time. We know that they don'tremember the large volumes of stuff from one year to the next.</blockquote><p>For a moment they debated whether moving toward Exhibitions favors the studentswho have the most moneywho can do the best visuals. Some noted that the stateboard exam does not provide equal access to students now; the same students getshut out of those tests year after year. One parent asserted, <p><p><blockquote>The state board exam should be demolished. There are a number ofstates who don't have such a test. It is a tremendous mistake to study for atwo-hour test all year long. </blockquote><p>Lela:<blockquote> They should be redesigned. A perfect example is in mydaughter's biology class. During Back to School Night, the teacher gave a list of230 vocabulary words that would be covered on the test. Bett didn't understandthe importance of the words. If I were in the teacher's shoes, I'd probably dothe same thing, because teachers are evaluated on how well their students do onthose tests.</blockquote>Jenny Tate:<blockquote> I'd like to see the kids tackle a problem. Rather thanasking the kids to learn all the vocabulary associated with biogenetics, I'drather see the kids take on a problem like: "Design a regulatory agency forbiogenetics internationally." The kids won't know what the words mean, to start,but that's the kind of starting point they need.</blockquote><p>There was more discussion. Will kids work without a test? Who decides whatknowledge kids should have? Can you change from a test-driven system when thekids reach high school? Doesn't it have to start earlier? One last stand wasmade: <p><p><blockquote>In my opinion, a few things in great depth and all the skills thatyou could apply to any learning situation would be far better than this breadthof information. If I hear one more time that we have to cover it for the stateboard exam, I'm going to vomit. They are just now beginning to review. It'sMarch!one-fourth of the year spent reviewing for a test. That just drives mecrazy. I think it is time that the teachers take some control and set their owndirection, instead of having to worry about kids passing those tests that drivethe curriculum. </blockquote><p>In a final consideration of testing, assessment, and feedback on studentprogress, the parents expressed their dislike for the computerized report cardssent home at the end of each term. The parents felt that the reports areimpersonal and in contradiction to the whole direction of the school. Theybelieve it is an example of a technological innovation which has not improvedthings. <p><h4>Teachers and Their Kids </h4>We turned the discussion to teachers who have worked particularly well with theirstudents. As expected, not everyone had the same experiences with the sameteachers, but everyone gave positive examples. <p><p><blockquote>Alta O'Malley is great. When Tommy asks her whether he's located an<cite>e. coli </cite>bacteria, she says no. And that's it. Then he has to figureit out himself. She doesn't give them all the answers. He is doing really wellwith her. He's become more investigative.</blockquote><p><blockquote>Emily Francis brings out the best in my daughter. She makes them feelcompetent about their knowledge. She is interesting herself. She knows a lot. Sheencourages the kids to discuss what they know.</blockquote><p><blockquote>Margaret Michaelsthis is the class where my son thinks the most. Shegives them an enormous amount of reading. She's interested in the kids.</blockquote><p><blockquote>Henry Walters is my son's ninth-grade English teacher. He is verydedicated. It is difficult to challenge my son, as we set very highexpectations for him. Mr. Walters has given him feedback on his papers thatsuggests that Todd might work harder. </blockquote><p><blockquote>My son is working with Mary Shea. He's doing a hands-on approach toearth science. He's been keeping track of the tides. He's been writing in ajournal, keeping logsevery kind of educational experience I'd want him tohave.</blockquote><p>Someone else added, "She's known everywhere. She has an excellent reputation. Shehas empowered the whole class by keeping the kids together." <p><p><blockquote>My son loves Ms. Capraro. She's a resource room teacher. He alwayssees the whole and gets anxious about the work, and doesn't know where to start.She shows him how to look at one thing, resolve it, and move onto the next. Thathelps so much. </blockquote><p>The parents agreed that, except in math, generally the teachers know their kidswell enough to help them with their individual academic problems. The schoolseems accessible to students and their families. They appreciated the sessionDr. Brenner conducted to help them determine the kinds of skills their kids needfor the future. They were pleased that their list closely matched the teachers.For the most part, they seemed pleased with the direction in the school.<p>They did reveal some worries, however. For one thing, they are anxious about Dr.Brenner's leaving. The fact that both the principal and the vice principal areleaving increases their anxiety. They hope that the new principal will continuein a similar direction and continue to involve parents.<p>Parents of ninth-graders were worried about the fear their kids have of the olderkids. They wish Freshmen Fridaysdays when upperclassmen haze their youngercolleaguescould be eliminated, and they stew over what to do about the weekendparties. Obviously they have to trust their children, but they agree that theycan also work together as parents to know who is home and who is not. They seethe school as a positive force in their community, and they seem ready tosupport change and instructional experimentation. <p>The parents with whom we spoke seemed very supportive of the teachers, theadministration, and the school in general. Contrary to what staff might haveexpected, the parent group is very eager for and supportive of change if it meansthat their children demonstrate at home that they are more engaged in school thanbefore. The parents' comments suggest that at least a portion of the parentpopulation is ready to move away from standard measures of student performance. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="twta"><h3>Talking with the Administrators </h3>Oak Hill is a small school district, with some overall coordination among theschools. Currently the three-school system is set up so that each of thecurriculum committees includes grades K12. Traditional department meetings, heldonce a month, include both middle school and high school teachers. Administratorsin the district gather once a month for administrative team meetings. While closecoordination is possible in a place of this size, it is not yet strong, nor dothe meetings which are currently in place seem to foster a very coherent approachto curriculum. <p>We visited with all the administrators outside the high school to check theirperceptions of the effects of the changes under way, as it seems likely thatchanges in the high school will affect the rest of the district. Notsurprisingly, they were most interested in Nancy's move to the superintendencyand relished the opportunity to speculate about the challenges facing her andto note progress made to date. <p>Howard Jones, the director of pupil services for the district, commented on thechanges at Oak Hill:<p><p><blockquote>Change can be both positive and negative. I try to look at thepositive side of things. I think it's exciting that Nancy is going to be thesuperintendent. I am looking forward to her educational philosophy and her focuson staff development. I worry about the technical, day-to-day stuff. Where thereare enormous changes, you just hope it all comes together. There will be threenew people in key positions in the district.</blockquote><p>He was positive about Nancy's involvement with the Coalition because he supportsthe principle that the goals of the school should apply to all students. <p><p><blockquote>The fact that all students at the high school are heterogeneouslymixed is quite a statement. We've developed a model of collaborative consultationbetween the resource room teachers and the regular teachers to mainstream ourstudents. The ninth-grade resource room teacher in English is working with ateacher who is big on portfolio assessment. He is almost a co-teacher with her,because he can do the same thing she can do. Another period, in earth science,the teacher is more lecture-oriented. There he spends less time teaching, butconcentrates on helping the five special needs students. Where we have thegreatest problem is with tracking in math.</blockquote><blockquote>There are other things I see. The students are far more outspoken.The school newspaper has certainly whacked the system. I see that as a positive.At the same time, I've been in the district a long time, and there are lots ofthings that are just the same as they always have been at the high school.</blockquote><p>The middle school principal, Beth Reiger, described her respect for Nancy and herstaff's nervousness about whether they would be made to do what the high schoolis doing. Since the middle school has a blocked schedule for core subjects andthe teachers have collaborative planning time, the teachers believe that theyhave already been doing much of what the high school is working towards. Shesuggested that the middle school teachers are nervous about whether they will beforced to join the Coalition, too. She also noted that while the middle school isincluded in the monthly department meetings, their connection is weak becausethe teachers in the two buildings are working on different things. She said shehopes for some coordinated goal setting. <p>The elementary principal just learned that he would not be tenured in thedistrict. A number of parents were fighting the board's decision, and subsequentto the decision, he was still working with parents to overturn the decision. Hefeels that the elementary school has been working on many of the conceptsembedded in the nine Common Principles, and noted that they all needed strongercoordination between buildings. <p>A board member shared the board's feelings: <p><p><blockquote>I am in favor of the Coalition and the New Partnership in the state.We need to get more people involved. We have a young board. They are notentrenched, and are willing to listen to people.</blockquote><blockquote>The major issue we face with the new superintendent is a financialcrisis. We want to maintain the current level of quality with fewerresources.</blockquote><blockquote>We'd like to see the Coalition's goals adopted through site-basedmanagement throughout the district. We'd like the district to be more cohesive.Now we are not sure that kids are always challenged. High school comes as quite ashock to some kids.</blockquote><blockquote>We are looking for a high school principal who can carry on the workbegun at the high schoolsomeone who is a team player, who can work with parentsthe way Dr. Brenner did. When she had a budget crisis in the sports program, shebrought people together and let them decide. Other people pay lip service tosite-based management, but we have a community where people want to be involvedand they can't be kept out.</blockquote><p>The retiring superintendent had the last word:<p><p><blockquote>I think Nancy has come a long waythe school has come a long way. Anumber of the faculty have. A significant number of parents have been pleased.The fact that the board selected Nancy sends a message to everyone in the highschool. Doesn't matter if they were lukewarm, hot, or cold on change. "Thereain't no turning back!" That goes for the rest of the district as well.</blockquote><blockquote>Nonetheless, Nancy will have challenges. Negotiations will be tough.Superintendents are hardly ever fired for the educational issuesit's the sportsprogram or the bus schedule. In a district this size, the superintendent doesn'thave much supportit would be nice if she had an administrative assistant. It'llbe interesting to see whether she can let go of the high school. On the otherhand, she has advantages. She has an active board. She'll hire two new principalsand, so, will build her own team. And, she has history in the district. That canbe both a disadvantage and an advantage. I feel that I'm leaving the district ingood hands.</blockquote><p>Administrators and teachers also expressed concern about negotiations anddiminishing resources. The elementary principal was not retained. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr><a name="cc"><center><h2>Classroom Close-ups </h2></center> <hr>In the long run, what happens in classrooms is what everyone at Oak Hill is mostinterested in, concerned about, and hopeful for. We want to better understandhow students spend their time, how teachers work with students, what kind ofinstructional repertoire teachers have in order to help students learn, and howteachers are interpreting the nine Common Principles in their classrooms.<p>In the last snapshot we glanced into a number of classrooms to get close-ups ofwhat was happening in them, so that the reader would have a feel for a day instudents' lives. By constructing a hypothetical schedule from the range ofclasses portrayed, we gave an overview of a student's day in school. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="gisc"><h3>Glimpses into Sixteen Classrooms</h3>This time, we observed in eighteen classrooms and saw a variety of instructionaltechniques, styles, and approaches. We will describe sixteen classes briefly andtwo English and social studies classes in depth.<p><h4>Business Education</h4>We watched a double-blocked business education class where students had threeactivities to work on. The teacher managed by walking around the room helpingindividual students. <p><h4>Art</h4>Students worked on several different assignments during the class. When a younggirl asked the teacher to help her, he referred her to another student. When shestill had difficulty getting started, he quickly sketched an example. <p><h4>Biology</h4>The students reviewed for a quiz, took the quiz, and moved on to Lab #18. <p><h4>American History</h4>Students were given a note-taking chart to help keep track of progressivism.They documented the problem, laws and actions, provisions and effects. <p><h4>Computer Science</h4>Students were exploring fractals for the first time. The teacher demonstrated andthen students experimented on their own computers. Those who were more adepthelped students who needed help. <p><h4>Pre-calculus</h4>The teacher demonstrated new properties of parabolas. Students derived equationsand charted their work. A resource room teacher worked with another math teacheras he gave kids a worksheet to help them practice for the state board exam. Shemoved around the room, helping students, while the regular teacher called outdirections. The worksheet allowed them to identify what they had done wrong sothat they could work on it.<p><h4>Math</h4>In another math class, students worked in groups to solve a list of problems inpreparation for a quiz. The teacher then offered them a mnemonic device; theysang the quadratic equation to "Pop Goes the Weasel." Without a moment'shesitation, half the class went to the front of the room and belted the equationout. They then solved for unknowns and graphed their work. <p><h4>Ninth-grade Social Studies</h4>Students worked in groups to define the word <cite>conflict. </cite>Each groupreported to the rest of the class on their definition, which was illustrated withthe pictures on the collage. As an introductory activity for a new unit, ituncovered an astonishing range of conflicts, from domestic violence to worldhunger. <p><h4>Music</h4>Students played through five tunes from different musical periods. They playedfour without stopping, and then reworked the fifth. <p><h4>Business Law</h4>Students watched a video on the death of Nancy Cruzon, a young woman who wascomatose for fifteen years after a tragic car accident. The next day, the teacherasked a range of questions requiring students to respond to the film and torelate this issue to others. A resource room teacher was in the class; theteacher drew her into the discussion and decision making about how they shouldproceed. <p><h4>Spanish </h4>Students recited conversations, made a statement from an overhead activity, andpracticed singing "El Rancho Grande," which they were to sing to the Frenchstudents who were about to arrive. <p><h4>Spanish</h4>In another Spanish class, students worked on conversations and then watchedslides of the previous year's trip to Spain. <p><h4>Technical Drawing </h4>Working in teams, the students drew tangent arcs. The students were very excitedabout the connection between what they were doing here and in their math class.<p><h4>Health</h4>Students were to have brought to class a list of the foods they had eaten so thatthey could code the foods for data entry on a computer. Those who did not bringtheir charts constructed them. The computer would then analyze their nutrition.<p><h4>Health</h4>In another health class, students gave oral reports on a topic of their choice,related to stress. <p><h4>Physics</h4>The teacher explained conduction and demonstrated, then got students wiringcircuits. <p><h4>Ninth-grade English</h4>The students conferred with the teacher if they needed to, obtained peer review,or worked on completing a piece for their portfolio. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cotic"><h3>Close-ups of Two Interdisciplinary Classrooms</h3>In order to get in-depth close-ups of classes, as well as to help the facultypursue their interest in innovation, we did multiple observations in twoclassrooms, the tenth-grade English and social studies classes. We focus on theseclassrooms in more depth, not as exemplars, but as examples of two teachers'relatively early attempts to change their practices by integrating instruction.These classrooms are particularly appropriate because they show two teachers whoare experimenting with new methods and new materials. Abby Steiner, who teachessocial studies, and Marge Michaels, who teaches English, are in their second yearof building interdisciplinary connections.<p>Abby and Marge read the segments which follow and made revisions for accuracy.They noted that it is difficult, given the brief number of observations, to get asense of the range of their work together, but they are willing to share whatthey describe as their own work in progress. <p>This year they have made several changes. In social studies, Abby is using newmaterials from the Facing Our History curriculum recommended by the principal.She and Marge have revised the final assignment from a written paper to a moreopen-ended choice. Students are able to produce drawings, speeches, and videotapes, as well as do research papers or creative pieces. While last year theEnglish students were required to read a book from the selected list on their owntime, this year, students could watch movies or read a book. <p>The four lessons describedtwo in each classshow the transition from one unit toanother. Both classes have recently finished a unit on the French Revolutionwhich they did together. They then worked on separate units: in social studiesthe students discussed World War I, and in English they worked on a unit onshort stories. This unit was created in response to students' request for morechoice in their assigned reading.<p><h4>Day 1</h4>On our first day of observing these two classes, we listen first in Marge'sEnglish class as they conclude the short story unit, and then in Abby's socialstudies class as they talk about the Treaty of Versailles, which provides atransition to the introduction to their new unit on the Holocaust. <p><p><b>In English.</b> When the period begins, students are working at their desks,either individually or in groups, reading or responding to short stories. Fifteenshort stories were selected by the teacher, and multiple copies were run off andplaced in folders in the back of the room. Stories include: "A Night in June,""The Eighty Yard Run," "Enero," "First Confession," and "Hills Like WhiteElephants." Students are to read six of the stories and write responses. Theresponses can be done in multiple forms, of which the following examplesrepresent just a few of the choices: <p> <ol> <li>	Mapping out events in thecharacter's life; <p><li>	Masksmake reflections of a character's concerns and questions: paperbag; oak tag; plaster of paris; papier-mche? Graded not just on the beauty of itbut its accuracy in looking at a person's character; <p><li>	Letter from character telling the story from a different perspective.<p></ol>Four of the reviews will be selected by students for revision and for inclusionin the portfolio for this unit. Marge circulates among the students and makesanecdotal notes about what she sees or discusses. She takes care to recordsomething about each student. <p>In class, half of the students are reading, another portion are writing, and twoget up to get dictionaries. There is quiet conversation in the room. Margeengages the students in questions and answers. At the end of the period, sheannounces: "I'll leave the door open if you want to stay and work." Two girlscontinue while two other students confer with the teacher. <p>An example of her anecdotal records for one student, taken over the duration ofthe unit, follows: <p><p><blockquote>Nancy: 3/6 Starts "Too Early Spring." 3/9 Health Assemblystartsgraph & turns in. 3/10 Starts "First Confession." 3/11 works on writing for"First Confession"a letter. "Pair of Silk Stockings." 3/12 Reading "A Pair ofSilk Stockings." 3/13 writing her response. Talks with the others a fair amount.3/17 worked on a mask with TJ last nightreads "My Sister's Marriage." 3/20Absent. 3/23 Fusses in hall with Tammy. Finishes ss, ["Silk Stockings"] willwrite. </blockquote><p>When Marge finishes with the students, she goes downstairs to catch Kara Capraro,who provides in-class support to some of her mainstreamed students. Kara sits ather desk. Behind her on the blackboard is a list of all the work students havedue in various classes. The short story assignment is at the top. The listreminds students of their deadlines and of the assignment requirements. <p>Marge brings down the assignment sheets for the upcoming Holocaust unit and goesover the requirements. Several books on the list are appropriate for kids whohave trouble reading. Kara reviews the information, asks good questions, and saysthat she is looking forward to doing some of the reading and watching some of themovies. The two of them work easily together and chat about students, untilseveral students remind Kara that she has to go to math class with them.<p><p><b>	In Social Studies. </b>Later that same day, nineteen students gather forsocial studies. Four kids sit on the floor in the hall taking a test. The otherstudents sit at their desks in groups. Today Abby Steiner is moving the topicfrom World War I to the Holocaust via the Treaty of Versailles, which is thesubject of today's discussion. <p>She begins by passing back students' papers on the previous unit on the FrenchRevolution. This has been a joint paper with Marge's students. Students did aself-assessment prior to the teachers' grading. As Abby hands back their papers,students can compare their self-assessment with the grade the two teachers havegiven. One student's paper is about a nobleman betrayed by a peasant who hasbecome a Jacobean.<p>Another student chose to write from a peasant's and a nobleman's perspective intheir two respective journals: <p><p><blockquote>1788Peasant: Dear Diary,... My name is Jean Luke and I am fifteenyears old. My family and I live in horrible poverty, we have no beds to sleep inand hardly have enough food to eat, my parents say that over 80 percent of their(already low) income from the farm goes to taxes and feudal fees which date backto God knows when. My granddad has told me that he grew up in the same povertyfifty years earlier and his grandfather also had to pay the same feudal feeswhich we do today....</blockquote><blockquote>1789: I recently overheard a few of the nobles who own the farmtalking about something of great interest. From what I heard, it appears thatKing Louis has called a meeting of the Estates General for the first time in 175years. </blockquote><blockquote>1788Noble: Dear Diary,... My name is Jean Paul and I live on amanor in France. I spend a lot of my time at the King's court and I attend manyparties. I own a farm and I get money from peasants who work the farm. I get mostof the farm's profit and they pay me taxes. </blockquote><blockquote>1789: I just heard that King Louis called a meeting of the EstatesGeneral for the first time in 175 years. The third estate wants a constitution.The three estates of the Estates General have come together to form the nationalassembly. The King opposed this, and to show they meant business, the responsewas the storming of the French prison, the Bastille. </blockquote><p><a name="chartplace">Both students and teachers used an analytical scoring guide to grade the papers.This paper had the analytical guide that appears in <a href="#chart1">Chart 1</a>.<p>After students check their papers and compare with their neighbors, and onestudent asks the teacher if he has handed in "Homework #2," Abby poses the firstquestion: "How would you define a treaty?" <p>"An agreement." <p>"An agreement between two or more parties over rules and regulations." <p>Abby looks to the rest of the class, "Does everyone agree with that? Are thereany additions?" <p>"Isn't it mostly a peace treaty, saying we will not fight?" <p>Abby points to one group of students. "Does this group agree?" They nod. "Doesthis group agree?" More nodding. "Good. What is the ultimate objective out of apeace treaty?" <p>A variety of students answer: <p>"Peace." <p>"Happiness among all." <p>"The Germans weren't too happy about Versailles," says a third student. <p>Abby interjects, "Let's not worry about the Versailles Treaty. What is theobjective of a perfect peace treaty?" <p>"Each side would get what it wanted?" <p>"Is the Triple Alliance like a treaty?" <p>Abby: "It's an alliance." <p>"A good treaty will be a compromise. Everyone would get what he wants." <p>Abby: "Should a treaty punish people?" <p>"You need punishment so a nation won't get out of line." <p>Abby: "Should a treaty be fair to all?" <p>"Forget the past, start with a clean slate." <p>"Punishment should be given!" <p>One student yells at another, "Don't write on my desk!" <p>Abby: "If a treaty is to prevent war and you're talking about punishment, can atreaty ever make all sides happy?" <p>"Everyone wants something different." <p>Abby: "We have some disagreement here as to whether it should be the victor, thevanquished, or a neutral observer who sets the terms of the treaty. Let's getsome consensus." <p>"The people who were fighting should put in what they want. Why should neutralsbe involved?" <p>Abby asks another question: "What were the difficulties involved in the Treatyof Versailles?" <p>"There were lots of nations involved." <p>"To punish the Germans." <p>"Austria, Hungary, France..."<p>"Italy." <p>Abby passes out a handout, "The Peace Settlements," and asks students to readthe bottom portion on the provisions of the treaty. The provisions includedterritorial losses, colonial losses, reduction of German army and navy, economicrestrictions, the condition that Germany must accept the guiltthe completeresponsibilityfor the war, and the establishment of the League of Nations. <p>She asks the kids: "Is this a good treaty or a bad treaty according to thecriteria you set?" The students shush each other. For ten minutes they talk ingroups. During this time, a student asks, "Why does Germany have to accept theguilt?" One of her group members says, "You're making no sense."<p>Abby asks the kids to focus on reparations and accepting guilt and to write downwhat they feel about that. Each group is called on to report, in turn, whetherthis is a good treaty or a bad treaty. One group responds that a good treaty isfair to most, that both sides compromise equally, and that it works to preventfuture wars. <p>Abby asks students for their attention. "Who started the war?" A student saysthat the treaty was not drawn up in a neutral place; Versailles is in France.(Meanwhile, the four students come in from taking the test in the hall. )<p>Group 1 gives their ideas first. The reporter says that Germany was notresponsible for beginning the war. <p>A second student remarks, "I did it differently from my group." <p>A third says, "It's your fault for going to war." <p>Another student responds, "That's because you are German." <p>Another student: "You can't be forced to accept guilt!" <p>Abby, intervening: "I want to get all groups in." <p>Group 3 reports: "Germany got too much guilt. They have to rebuild. The Germancolonies got taken away by the victors." <p>By the time group 5 makes its report, the reporter notes it has all been saidbefore. Each group indicated that the treaty was not a very good one. <p>Out of time, Abby calls out as the class departs, "So the general consensus ofthe class is that this is a bad treaty?"  <p><h4>Day 2</h4>While the first two classes we observed conclude these teachers' separate units,the next two classes begin their interdisciplinary unit on the Holocaust; it isthe unit they report they have worked the hardest on, and they feel that theHolocaust unit is their strongest collaborative one. In their classes they spendseven weeks on the Holocaust. <p><p><b>	In English.</b> First thing the next day, eleven students are in place forfirst period. Marge reads the daily announcements. One announcement is that thereis a list of students in the National Honor Society who have offered to helpothers with their schoolwork. Marge pauses to urge students to take advantageof the opportunity and contact the National Honor Society kids for help. Sheannounces that the portfolios of the short story reviews are due and thatstudents should select the top four out of six. She notes that they are nowbeginning the study of the Holocaust and refers the kids to the newspaperarticles on the bulletin board about the Holocaust and to photocopies of thecomics, <cite>Maus I </cite>and <cite>Maus II. </cite>Students glance at thebulletin board. <p>Before they begin to study the Holocaust, they have a spelling test. The test isbased on words from their own writing with which they frequently have difficulty.Kids are quiet and move their desks apart. Marge dictates each word and uses themin clever, funny sentences. The words are: <cite>beginning, debt, different,appetite, might, there, their, environment, separate, desperate, success,they're, appear, business, disappear, peasant, attitude, being, fulfill,probably. </cite>She collects the papers and glances at them. One student asks,"Did I get any wrong?" She looks at the relevant test paper. "No," she tells him.Another kid asks for his score. She says, "Environment: Remember it has an ironin the middle." <p>With the spelling test over, she returns to the Holocaust. "Let's talk about theHolocaust. We'll be doing it in lots of different ways. She mentions the movie,<cite>Night and Fog. </cite>A student asks, "Is that the gross movie the otherclasses watched?" Marge hands out the extensive book and movie lists and startsgoing over them. When she gets to <cite>The Diary of Anne Frank, </cite>onestudent says under his breath, "I swear to God if I have to read that book, I'llkill someone." Someone else says, "<cite>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</cite>is a game." Marge goes over the movie list, indicating that the choicesare based in part on kids' recommendations from last year. <p>She then takes the booklet of essays and poems from last year's class and startsto read aloud. The first excerpt is from a biography of Simon Wiesenthal. Thesecond, requested by a student, is a poem about a concentration camp. The third,which rivets the students' attention, is an interview between a student and hisgrandfather, who had been a soldier in World War II and had participated in theliberation of a concentration camp. The interview is both about the war and theHolocaust and about the student's growing respect for his grandfather, with therealization that he had participated in a significant moment of history. <p><p><b>	In Social Studies. </b>Later in the day, we observe Abby's class as theybegin the new Holocaust unit. Abby decided to introduce the study of theHolocaust with a movie, <cite>Night and Fog</cite>. She made a conscious decisionto do this because she wanted to engage the students emotionally with thesubject. Once she engages them, the idea is to step back and learn the historyand explore why people behaved the way they did. <p>The film, on videocassette, begins in color, as if the viewer were driving pastgreen fields and countryside in present-day Germany through the towns whereconcentration camps were once located. The film leaves the verdure of the presentand uses black and white Nazi footage to show the events of the thirties. Whenthe Jews are herded into boxcars, Abby describes how many of them suffocated andhow the boxcars for the horses of the German officers were more spaciousaccommodations. The most graphic parts of the film show the concentration camps,the bulldozers dumping bodies into mass graves, and the ovens.<p>The students are riveted. Most are silent, although some are talking softly,saying things like "Gross!" "Why would people do that?" The film takes almost thewhole period. Kids are attentive, despite the fact that light is streaming in thewindows and the screen is small. <p>At the end of the film, Abby asks the kids to write about their feelings. Somewrite a list; for example: "(1) Disgust (2) Nausea." Others write paragraphs fullof moral indignation. At least one writes that he wished he had more informationabout the topic. Abby collects the papers, answers a couple of questions, andgive the students a short break. <p>When they return, they grapple with Helga's Dilemma, a simulation where groups ofstudents must decide if they, as Helga, a young German, would house Rachel, alifelong, close friend who is Jewish. Rachel knocks late at night afterdiscovering that her whole family has been taken away by the Gestapo. <p>Placing oneself in the role of a student, one feels the brisk pace of these twoclasses as the teachers wrap up one segment of their curriculum and move on to anew section. While they have chosen to work together, their work is stilldiscipline-centered; each teacher takes responsibility for the learning in eachcontent area. The connections are based on mutual treatment of a historicalperiod intended to give students a richer perspective. The teaching techniquesused in the classroom range from one class to the next and include individualconferences; discussion; group work; a spelling test; lecture; video viewing;quick, reactive writing; and polished writing. <p>The observer is not sure whether the new curriculum is a shared curriculum orwhether the Holocaust is primarily considered to be a social studies unit withreinforcement and support from the English class. What we do not see is how theteachers work together, whether they blend their daily activities, or whetherthey agree on the overall theme and objectives and design lessons independently.Still, this glimpse enables us to envision what students experience as they movefrom English to social studies in a given day; what either course, English orsocial studies, is like two-days running; and what happens in class as studentsmove from one unit to another. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr><a name="rots"><center><h2>Reflections on the Snapshot</h2></center> <hr>Looking back across this snapshot, a number of issues spring to mind which poseinteresting questions for the staff at Oak Hill High School. The concern abouttransitions in leadership, the information from students and teachers, thenegotiation of new partnerships, and the need for time are all important if OakHill is to move forward along its path towards better schooling. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="til"><h3>Transitions in Leadership</h3>"The only certain thing we know about change is that nothing ever stays thesame," said a teacher recently in a Coalition seminar. At Oak Hill, four yearsinto its work as a member of the Coalition, the superintendent leaves, theprincipal leaves, the vice principal leaves, the elementary principal leaves, oneof the head secretaries who knows the district like the back of her handconsiders leaving. And the physical education teacher and coach, who taught manyof the parents in the community to play ball, retires. The middle schoolprincipal has only been in the district one year, and while the high schoolprincipal is moving to the superintendent's job, almost everyone in a leadershipposition will be new. That is a lot of change in one year, and it certainlychallenges the staff to be clear about what they want and where they are going.<p>Across the country, when leaders leavebe they teachers, principals orsuperintendentsthose remaining tend to wait until the new people come on boardto decide what the new direction will be. It is almost a kind of a freeze: peoplestop doing what they were doing and revert to older, more comfortable practiceswhile they wait for the new direction. This is not surprising, since schoolsystems are generally well-established, hierarchical places, and it has, in thepast, been the purview of the leaders to set the direction of their schools. <p>There is a sort of pattern which follows changes in leadership. At first there isa period of uncertaintysix months or sowhile the new leaders settle in and maketheir goals and objectives known. Schools that were working on outcome-basededucation turn to clinical supervision. Schools that were working on clinicalsupervision turn to peer coaching. We have thousands of examples, from ournational political leaders to local schools, of how changes in leadership meanchanges in direction. One wonders whether the Oak Hill staff's decision to holdoff on changing the schedule to gain extended instructional time was made inlight of the transitions in leadership. <p>Oak Hill is a place that has moved some distance from the old model of schooldecision making and direction setting to a more participative process, whichincludes staff, parents, and students. The school is a place where change hasprovoked healthy ferment. People are working on multiple levelsthe school, thedepartment, and their classroomsto reconsider their practices. The whole group,moreover, is working together to bring some coherence to the effort. <p>At a time of transition such as this one, the questions for the staff at Oak HillHigh School are critical ones: Can they maintain the momentum for change bycommunicating their commitment to the work they have begun? With new people, canthey forge participatory relationships which allow them to maintain the momentumfor change? Can they continue to reconsider what they have done and move forward?<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sat"><h3>Students and Teachers: Teaching and Learning </h3>Comparing and contrasting the voices of teachers and students as they talk aboutteaching and learning is illuminating. Teachers debate whether kids can orcannot do certain things. Some feel that kids are working to capacity when theydo mediocre work; others think kids can learn more thoroughly when they have thetime. Some teachers note that teachers learn more about the kids and theirabilities when teachers give them a task and then observe them work. A few saykids cannot follow rudimentary directions, and suggest that there is no way kidscould engage in more complex work. Some teachers say that it is exciting to watchwhat the kids come up with when they are engaged, and note the difference instudents' investment when they are doing less engaging work. Others say thatwhile kids are exploring, they take wrong turns, go down blind alleys, and take alot more time.<p>The math department suggests that their discipline does not lend itself tochange; others note that it only takes time and the brain trust of a couple ofteachers to generate new approaches and connections between one discipline andanother. Mary Shea raised an interesting point when she talked about kids in thedead zone"zombie kids." She notes that there are some kids in the school whodon't come to the table, who seem to be protesting schools by putting themselveson a deadly knowledge-fast. <p>Students also say that school is not always a place where they have to work hard;they suggest, too, that they turn into zombies in school. They do not like beingzombies, and clearly, teachers do not like teaching zombies. The students saythat they are willing to work when they are engaged in work which interests them.They are able to articulate what kinds of things they do at school which makethem feel that they are using their time and their minds well.<p>Students like connections between disciplines and between their school work andthe world at large. They like variety in assignments and in daily work. They liketo be asked what they think; they like teachers who value their ideas. They liketo work with their friends and are appreciative that they are being taught to getalong with one another.<p>These kids like to know that they can improve; they want to know that there ishope that they can move beyond their current capacity. They like to show whatthey can do even if it does take more time and effort. <p>One aside is worth making. Besides the zombie kids who are deeply troubling to usall, everyone realizes that kids are different today. Teachers all over thecountry talk about the fact that kids are less disciplined, that they tend toread less, work less, than kids used to. Their experiences are quite differentfrom the childhood experiences of kids who grew up in the first sixty years ofthis century. There is nothing anyone can do about that except to accept it. <p>Teachers' lives are different today, too. One teacher noted that for years,because she was a teacher, her husband knew what she was doing every minute ofthe day. Now she goes to conferences, visits other schools, goes to IBM officesfor meetings, teaches a computer course for college credit, and deals with herclasses in a rotating schedule. He thinks her life is more interesting thanhisand she does, too. <p>No one benefits by lamenting that kids are not what they used to be or byromanticizing the lost but more idyllic days of teaching. Everyone benefits bytrying to figure out what we can do with what we have. It is important that we donot attempt to solve contemporary problems with old solutions which worked foranother time but may have lost their potency. <p>The comments we have heard on teaching and learning during our visit raiseimportant questions for the school community at Oak Hill:<p>Can the staff and students at Oak Hill follow the collaborative precedent theyhave already set in the Student-Faculty Congress and figure out how to buildlearning experiences which engage both students and their teachers? Can teacherscombine their own experience in teaching and learning with students' suggestionsabout what is most helpful to them to create a better, more nourishing, moreenriching educational stew, a stew to coax kids off the fast? <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tcom"><h3>The Challenge of Mathematics </h3>Students and their parents suggested that they experience more difficulties withmathematics than with other subjects. However, we do not believe that thesedifficulties in mathematics are either new or unique to the people at Oak Hill,but rather that they mirror what is happening in schools across the country. Onemath teacher noted that throughout his twenty-five-year career, his students havehad more difficulty with math than with other subjects; it is not a new problem.All along, parents have lamented their inability to help their children and havejoined their kids in questioning the relevance of the discipline. <p>The math teachers at Oak Hill are meeting and considering solutions to theproblems of which they are well aware. Still, the solutions they seek, such asgrouping by ability or adding another class, are in keeping with traditionalpractices. New approaches in instructional delivery or curricular organization donot appear to be a focus of their discussions. This response to the problemmirrors the reaction of many math teachers in schools across the country. At thesame time, experts in the field, the National Math Standards Board, andresearchers and teachers like Maggie Lampert at Michigan State, suggest that mathcan and should be taught differently. <p>There are, then, several important questions for the math department at Oak HillHigh School: Is it possible for a math department to look for fresh solutions tothese very old problems? Can math teachers benefit from the current thinking ofoutside, objective experts? Can the teachers at Oak Hill experiment with thoseideas to better understand what is possible and what is not? <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="maq"><h3>Musings and Questions</h3>Since the early 1900s, with the institution of "one teacherone classroom,"teaching has been a private act. Teachers, working alone with their students,seldom see others teach, seldom have the opportunity to share instructionalstrategies or assessment measures, and seldom discuss what they do and why.Teachers infrequently grade papers together to better understand the expectationsheld for students across disciplines; they rarely build units together to ensurea variety of instructional methods or to benefit from a fresh eye.<p>A number of educational historians and researchers suggest that the isolation inwhich teachers teach is the single, most powerful reason that attempts to changeschools have been largely unsuccessful.5 Other researchers suggest that the normsof privacy which are common in schools cancel even the most elaborate and costlyprofessional development efforts.6 <p>The staff at Oak Hill have agreed to open their doors to allow others, throughthe snapshots, to look inside their rooms. Looking in Abby's and in Marge'srooms, we see teachers exploring how they work together, struggling to rethinkthe normal parameters of their responsibility, but doing it publicly so thatthey might benefit from the conversation the entire faculty has with them aboutwhat they are doing. Could the staff spend a faculty meeting asking questions ofthe two teachers about their efforts?<p>Our visit to their classrooms raises the following questions for them: What wasthe role of consensus in the discussion of the Treaty of Versailles? How did youlike the scoring guide you developed for the revolution paper after you used it?Why did the student, whose paper we saw, get a 66? What merited a 90? Theanecdotal records look like a management strategyare they? Are they helpful? Howdo you use them? Do the students see them? Who else on staff uses anecdotalrecords? In what ways? Why do you integrate sometimes and not others? What willyou do differently next time you teach the introduction to the Holocaust? <p>Such specific questions might lead to questions with which the whole faculty isgrappling. What criteria do we use for grading students? If we integrateinstruction, do we lose rigor or do we gain it? How do teachers from less obviousdisciplines participate in integration? How might we change the structure of theschool to allow for more possibilities in integration? <p>Oak Hill is a small district. With three schools, willing parents, an involvedboard, and a new superintendent, all of whom are supportive of change, thedistrict ought to be able to break down traditional norms of isolation to buildan educational program which is both coherent and expressive, rigorous andflexible. The question here is, how can the three schools, the central office,and others work together to begin to forge a K-12 program with common values andcommon goals?   <p>The final issue is time: the staff indicated that the greatest barrier to theirchange efforts is the lack of time. If Oak Hill is to continue its journey, if itis to further break down the norms of isolation and privacy which have crippledschools in their previous attempts to change, the staff must have regular andongoing time to work together. Currently, time is allocated on an as-neededbasistwo days during the year for a department, and one afternoon for a speech.While this time has been enormously helpful, it is not enough. The schools whichhave moved the farthest in the Coalition figured out how to get regular timescheduled each week or each day. <p>The Oak Hill staff need time for a minimum of three purposes: to think thingsover and to plan, to assess whether the new material went well, and to debate andto learn from one another. Collaborating teachers need time together to plan theconnections in their integrated work. Individuals need time to plan new teachingmethods. In addition, teachers need time to work as a group to rethink theschool's direction, to keep working on, refining, and revising their notions ofwhat kids should know and be able to do. Finally, teachers need time to watchothers teach, to build their critical eye, to build their repertoire oftechniques, to do research, to read, and to gather the latest information. <p>In a time of declining resources, can Oak Hill High School figure out a way toprovide people with regular time to hone their craft and to build theirprofessional capacity? <p>Summer comes. The trees are resplendent. Graduates toss caps in the air. Juniorsprepare to be seniors. Eighth-graders hear horror stories about Freshmen Fridaysand attempt to figure out how they can avoid getting hung in a locker or how theycan appear unafraid. Teachers go off to study in seminars, to spend familyvacations, and to teach in various institutes. New administrators attempt tofigure out how the place runs before the others return. Oak Hill's journey towardbetter schooling continues... and we look forward to our next visit in thefall. <p> <a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr><a name="notes"><center><h3>Notes</h3></center><p> <ol><li>For the first snapshot, please see Patricia Wasley, "Poised for Change,"Studies on School Change (Oak Hill No. 1), Coalition of Essential Schools, BrownUniversity, Providence, February 1992.<p><li>Wasley, "Interpreting the Nine Common Principles," Studies on School Change(Oak Hill No. 2a), Coalition of Essential Schools, Brown University, Providence,September 1992.<p><li>The research team from the School Change study, sponsored by the Coalition ofEssential Schools, returned to the school for the week of March 2327. Duringthat time, thirty-nine faculty and fifty students, including eight seniors, tenjuniors, twenty-three sophomores, and nine freshmen, were interviewed. Onenon-certified member of staff, one board member, six administrators and elevenparents were also interviewed. The team observed seventeen classes, one advisoryseminar, one emergency meeting, and one session of the Student-Faculty Congress.While on site, researchers collected samples of lesson plans and student work.In addition, three teachers and two students wrote weekly journals. <p>Two other researchers joined the team for this second site visit. Dick Clark, theteam leader from the New Mexico study site, and Judy Bray, a policy researcherfrom the Education Commission of the States, helped to gather information on thelarger context of schooling to see what happens in the surrounding system whenindividual schools begin to entertain serious change. Dick interviewed the boardmember and other district administrators, as well as people in the school. Judyvisited the state department of education, interviewed people involved with stateboard of education exams and those involved in the New Partners for BetterSchools, and observed a meeting between the state department and Oak Hillprincipal Nancy Brenner. <p>This snapshot, like the previous one, is set up to reveal a series of role groupconversations. This convention works well, as it allows us to return the parents'conversation to the parents, the students' conversation to the students, whileprotecting the larger staff discussion, in accordance with our originalagreement. In all cases pseudonyms have been used to ensure as muchconfidentiality of the participants as possible. Data was analyzed under rubricsdeveloped around the investigative themes mentioned above. While everyone'scomments are not represented in the interest of length, no comments are includedunless they have been corroborated by at least two other sources or unless theyare identified as individual impressions. When using quotations, we attempted toselect those which best represent the thoughts and concerns expressed by severalpeople.<p><li> Our sample is heavily weighted with underclassmen.

This discussion took place during the secondvisit by the School Change Study research team to "Oak Hill," a small, publichigh school in the Northeast. <p>By joining the Coalition in 1994 and working toward becoming an Essential school,Oak Hill had made the commitment to attempt to use the nine Common Principles asguidelines for whole-school change. The Oak Hill staff felt that if they areusing the Common Principles to guide them in developing a better school, then itis important to know what the staff understands them to mean. For that reason,they asked the researchers, after their first visit to the school in fall 1991,to facilitate a discussion about the Principles during their next visit, inspring 1992.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="atcp"><h3>About the Common Principles</h3><p>Theodore Sizer, the founder and chairman of the Coalition of Essential Schools,conceived the nine Common Principles in 1983 while working on A Study of HighSchools. The Principles are a set of common-sense criteria that Sizer believeswould significantly improve the quality of secondary education in this country ifput into place by local practitioners. Taken individually, the Principles are notunique among those proposed for improving education. Their uniqueness lies inbeing a set of ideas that, when taken together and put into practice, would havea profound effect on the nature of high school education in this country. <p>When Sizer founded the Coalition of Essential Schools in 1994, the nine CommonPrinciples became the touchstone for its work of reform. Just as good familiesshare powerful guiding ideas but cannot follow a single model because each familyis unique and has its own traditions, so good schools, each with its owncommunity, staff, and traditions, share powerful guiding ideas but cannot followone blueprint or model for success. For this reason, the Coalition advancesreform according to ideas rather than a model. The Principles driving Essentialschool reform are purposefully nonspecific so that they can apply to the widestvariety of schools and can lead people to develop the school that is best fortheir own community. <p>Because the nine Common Principles are the foundation of Essential school reform,it is crucial that people working toward reform according to the Principlesexplore the ideas within them in order to be clear about the direction of theirwork and to find a common ground with others with whom they are working. By doingso they will be able to work in concert toward common goals for students and tosupport rather than undermine one another's efforts in changing schoolpractice.<p>We will state each principle, present the staff's responses, and comment on theirreactions and interpretations.  <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr><a name="itncp"><center><h2>Investigating the Nine Common Principles</h2></center><hr><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="1:if"><h3>1:  Intellectual Focus</h3><p><cite>The school should focus on helping adolescents <b>learn to use their mindswell.</b> Schools should not attempt to be "comprehensive" if such a claim ismade at the expense of the school's central intellectual purpose. <p></cite><p>Most teachers in this Essential school feel that learning "to use their mindswell" means learning the skills of critical thinking and being able to solvecomplex problems.<p><blockquote>[It means] using knowledge, not just sorting it. <p></blockquote><blockquote>It's being able to think through the consequences and the outcomesthey want in longer work. <p></blockquote><blockquote>It's when the kids can formulate questions and develop responses andlisten very carefully. <p></blockquote><blockquote>It's asking questions, and not just, "I don't understand." It'sgrasping a concept and applying it in all different kinds of ways that arepertinent to their own lives and their own experiences. It's when a kid says,"Well, if that happens then shouldn't this happen?" That is so far beyond sittingthere and saying, "Tell me so I can give it back to you word forword."<p></blockquote><blockquote>When we were doing the weather-watch assignment in my science class,one of the kids used Harvard Graphics to chart his findings. I thought theylooked pretty impressive at first but discovered that the graphs did not conveysome of the essential ideas he was trying to show. I showed him and he got soexcited. He said he thought he could get it right, and he just kept working on ituntil he did. He really grew from that. The two of us learned alot.<p></blockquote>A second group interprets using one's mind well as succeeding in the kind of workstudents have traditionally been given in school. <p><blockquote>Kids should be able to learn the material we give them and retain it.<p></blockquote><blockquote>Kids should be able to read, do the work given to them, and solve theproblems we give them. <p></blockquote><blockquote>I wouldn't think that using your mind well precluded memorizingwhether it's appropriate to keep going back and back. There are some things youmemorize in history so you don't keep looking it up in the index.<p></blockquote>Not only does the staff have differing interpretations of this principle, theyalso have differing opinions as to whether it is achievable. The vice principalagrees that this principle refers to critical thinking and problem solving butpoints to the current difficulties in implementing it:<p><blockquote>A kid should be developing the skills, not just to pass a test, butto think out a problem he's facing here and to try to make the problems hereattached to what's out there. That's not so easily done with the curriculum theway it is now. People don't have as many resources as you might think to makeeverything so relevant; and the state board exam is the mountain blocking thevalley of critical thinking that everyone is trying to get the kids to.<p></blockquote>A small group believes that this principle refers to critical thinking andproblem solving but feels that given today's kids, this principle is notrealistic; kids do not seem to be able to use their minds well now. <p><blockquote>In math it would be problem solving: being faced with a problem,where do you start, how do you proceed, where do you get the answer? And to getsatisfaction when they get the answer. If that's possible, that would be usingyour mind well, but I don't want to guide them. I want them to do it. That's oneof the things that annoys me: that they do want to rely on the teacher sooften.<p></blockquote><blockquote>Students need to be responsible and be organized and learn basicmaterial in certain ways before they can start using their minds well. You can'tjust jump in there. A lot of kids aren't ready to use their minds well becausethere just isn't any information in there for them to use.<p></blockquote><blockquote>I know what it should mean. It would mean to make inferences andthings of that nature. But heck, if they just even asked any type of intelligentquestion I would be happy, but of course they don't. I have second semesterseniors. We sit around. The nine Common Principles are these great generalitiesbut then there's the real worldin my classroom.<p></blockquote><blockquote>I'd like kids to be able to read a problem and know how to attack it.The amazing thing is that you change a percent problem from a $7.95 CD or tape tothe next problem, which is the $125.00 suit, and it's as if you have a whole newmathematical problem.<p></blockquote><blockquote>Kids don't want to use their minds. They want us to tell them what todo. They need a clear sense of the expectations.<p></blockquote>The staff reach some common ground when they discuss critical thinkingproblemsolving, using knowledge, applying what was learned to a fresh situation, makinginferencesand they agree that when students do these things, they are usingtheir minds well. <p>The point of disagreement in the discussion of this principle lies in the staff'sattitudes about student capabilities. Some suggest that state exams and mandatesstand in the way, but imply that, given the opportunity, students are capable ofusing their minds well. Others suggest that students today have no will and nodiscipline, so that even if they were provided with the opportunity to use theirminds well, they would not choose to do so. The polarity of opinion about studentcapabilities suggests that given the opportunity, the staff would create twovery different kinds of schools. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="2:lim"><h3>2:  Less is More</h3><p><p><cite>The school's goals should be simple: that each student <b>master a limitednumber of essential skills and areas of knowledge.</b> While these skills andareas will, to varying degrees, reflect the traditional academic disciplines,the program's design should be shaped by the intellectual and imaginative powersand competencies that students need, rather than necessarily by "subjects" asconventionally defined. The aphorism "Less is more" should dominate: curriculardecisions should be guided by the aim of thorough student mastery andachievement rather than by an effort merely to cover content. <p></cite>Some staff feel that this is a good principle, but, due to a variety ofconstraints, they are not yet following it.<p><blockquote>It's doing one Shakespeare play instead of three. It's working onthree pieces of music instead of six. We'd be better off to do this but parentswant a traditional approach.<p></blockquote><blockquote>You can do it in two ways. You can limit the curricular offerings orlimit the number of topics within an offering. But the AP exams and the stateboard exam constrain us.<p></blockquote><blockquote>If you look at our course offerings, we are still functioning on thebasis of units of credit. If a kid passes a course with a 77 or a 66, we tell hershe has passed the course and is ready to move on. I don't think that impliesmastery of knowledge in any sense of the word. I don't think we know what thismeans as a staff. I don't think we've reached that decision.<p></blockquote><blockquote>The pace should be more thoughtful as we end the year. In fact, itgets much more frenetic. The AP exams are next week. I do not want to run alanguage course to take an exam. Our foreign exchange program would be out of thequestion for those students, and learning about other people and how they thinkis not included in the AP curriculum. Those elements of the course are far moreimportant to retain than all of the rules of the language wrapped up in onebundle.<p></blockquote><blockquote>The constraint is the state board exam. We can't figure out what tocut. The state board exam courses are the antithesis of this principle. We needhelp to understand how we reduce the curriculum to prepare kids to go out ontheir own.<p></blockquote>Some find the aphorism "Less is more" confusing or troublesome: <p><blockquote>I think that the kids should have a background and a generalknowledge to be an educated person. What bothers me is that the kids seem so"experience poor." It happens in class a lot. I give them an example: "You know,when you're walking along a stream and you're afraid to step on the bank becausethe stream has cut under it..." The kids look at me like I'm nuts. They'reexperience poor. It's hard to relate things to their everyday life because theyare experience poor. Sometimes I ask them to visualize things, like a mass ofair. They don't know what I mean. They don't form visual images. I don't know howto reduce what they need to know when they know so little.<p></blockquote><blockquote>We are already giving kids less in math. Their time has beeninundated by requirements. They have to have technology. They have to have alanguage. Then there's drug and health education. These things are important,but twenty years ago, kids spent their whole day at school doing reading,writing, and arithmetic. And the high school curriculum is driven by the mathand the verbal SATs. These kids have got to pass those tests. So I get a littlenervous about "less is more." <p></blockquote><blockquote>Sometimes, the kids don't want less. They want to know more aboutthis and more about that. You end up covering more than you ever thought youwould cover and there's no complaints.<p></blockquote><blockquote>We're sending these kids off to college and the student arrives witha transcript which says, "I've taken pre-calculus." I think we have an obligationto make sure certain topics are covered. For instance, I'm not particularlycrazy about logic proofs, so I might choose to leave those out and go into moredepth on geometric proofs. My students may not have the foundation they need togo on. I don't think that we have the right to go and change the curriculum justbecause wein our own particular school districtfeel it should be different.We have an obligation to our students to prepare them for the schools that theychoose to go to, for the SATs. <p></blockquote><blockquote>"Less is more" might be all right for some district in trouble, butours is a school with high academic standards.<p></blockquote><blockquote>We've spent our careers building a program that offers students agood deal of choice, richness. Less is not more; more is more. <p></blockquote>Universally, the staff considers this principle to be the most difficult and themost controversial. Almost everyone begins their comments by, "This one gives metrouble." <p>The staff have several reactions to the principle: some believe it is a goodprinciple but, due to a variety of internal and external constraints, agree thatthey are not yet implementing it; some find the aphorism "less is more" confusingand do not believe the faculty has the right to decide the curriculum; andfinally, others are trying to understand what <cite>mastery </cite>means, what<cite>knowledge </cite>is, and what <cite>essential skills </cite>might be.<p>As the faculty members respond to the pieces of the principle"Less is more,""mastery," and "knowledge"they reveal its complexity. All of the faculty'scomments suggest that this principle challenges the status quo, whether createdby the staff or by the state department of education. Their responses alsosuggest that while everyone seems to understand the notion of "less," no onegrapples with the meaning of "more." When and how "less" might be "more" is leftunexplored.  <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="3:ug"><h3>3:  Universal Goals</h3><p><p><cite>The school's <b>goals should apply to all students, </b>while the means tothese goals will vary as those students themselves vary. School practice shouldbe tailor-made to meet the needs of every group or class of adolescents.<p></cite><blockquote>It means that all students should be exposed to the same standards,the same teaching, and the same resources.<p></blockquote><blockquote>It means that we're trying to get away from tracking but you can't dothat in a high school. As soon as you start segregating the best math and foreignlanguage students, you can't have the same school for everybody and you can'tstart that at the ninth grade.<p></blockquote><blockquote>I think mainstreaming has jogged some people's thinking. It's raisedsome questions about standards. What standards do all kids meet? What standardsdo some kids meet? Every one of us can tell stories about how mainstreaming isworking in our classrooms, and where it is problematic. There's another part ofit that we haven't confronted and that's the AP dilemma. At the junior and seniorlevel, we are taking the top kids and segregating them. It leaves the rest of theclasses with the middle kids and below. And it reinforces the idea that knowledgeis an accumulation of stuff that kids then spit back faster. In the long run, Iam not sure that the AP classes stretch them other than just to give them a wholelot of stuff to accumulate, and to give them the chance to do what they alreadydo well a little better.<p></blockquote><blockquote>There is a wide range of teacher expectations in the school and awide range of marks. I'm not sure how we get to some kind of consistency for allkids.<p></blockquote><blockquote>My grading is very subjective. I have one kid who is getting a 90; tosomeone else it is not 90 workbut for him it is. I might expect much more fromanother kid, much more. If a kid can do more, then I demand more.<p></blockquote><blockquote>This is hard to do in math. I have some kids who are barelystruggling along with a 70 because the content, the conceptual level of thematerial, is hard for them. <p></blockquote>It seems that the math department finds tracking to be the way to meet thecriteria set by this principle. To "meet the needs of every group or class ofadolescents," the math department has just created a new math class for studentswho are not yet ready for the state board exam math sequence. Almost everyoneelse's immediate response suggests that this principle refers to mainstreaming,which is designed to equalize the opportunities of those students with specialneeds. However, tracking and mainstreaming, the two strategies that the staffsuggest for implementing this principle, are based on quite differentassumptions about how teaching and learning take place.<p>The staff's comments reveal that they have additional, unresolved questionsrelated to this principle. Several note that despite the hopes for equalopportunities for all students, individual faculty have very different standardsand expectations for students. The math department indicate that they findfollowing this principle to be an unrealistic goal, while another faculty membersuggests that the principle contains contradictions which they have not yetaddressed. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="4:personalization"><h3>4:  Personalization</h3><p><p><cite><b>Teaching and learning should be personalized </B>to the maximumfeasible extent. Efforts should be directed toward a goal that no teacher havedirect responsibility for more than eighty students. To capitalize on thispersonalization, decisions about the details of the course of study, the use ofstudents' and teachers' time, and the choice of teaching materials and specificpedagogies must be unreservedly placed in the hands of the principal and staff.<p></cite>In terms of class load, several staff, noting that they have few students andsmall classes, believe that this principle is in place. Others have high classloadsupwards of ninety-eight students a dayand find it difficult to attend tothe needs of all of them. <p>Beyond the course load issue, there are two distinct interpretations of thisprinciple. <p>One group suggests that it means that teachers should get to know their studentsvery well, both inside and outside of the classroom. Such intimate knowledge,they believe, is necessary for them to be able to help students make progress inclass. <p><blockquote>However, when you're talking personalization, you're not justtalking about a friendly relationship, you're also talking about students andteachers confronting together what learning is and what it means for theindividual. Are you going to make decisions as a learner that stretch you, andnot take the easy way out on every occasion? I think if you have a good personalrelationship with a kid, in some ways it makes it more difficult to confront thereally tough issues.... Are you pushing yourself as hard as you should be as alearner?<p></blockquote>This staff member suggests that personalization means that teachers need to bewilling to argue with kids about the quality of the students' workthat teachersmust push them to their true capacity. Teachers who define personalization inthis way note that the advisory seminars help them to get to know their studentsbetter than before. <p>The second group defines this principle in terms of the shopping mall: "I'm notsure that this means any more than that you have some optionschoicesin classes,choices in assignments, choices in stuff to do after school." They explain thatit means offering kids a variety of courses so that they can personalize thedirection of their own education. This group believes that the school alreadyoffers this kind of program to the students.  <p>These two interpretations are markedly different. One suggests thatpersonalization means a wide variety of course options for students. The othersuggests that teachers have a central responsibility to engage kids in a kind ofcritical friendshipnot the friendship of the treaties described in<cite>Shopping Mall High School </cite>(Powell et. al, 1985)but the tough kindthat will enable students to confront and move beyond difficult learningproblems.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="5:s"><h3>5:  Student-as-Worker</h3><p><p><cite><b>The governing practical metaphor of the school should bestudent-as-worker,</b> rather than the familiar metaphor ofteacher-as-deliverer-of-instructional services. Accordingly, a prominentpedagogy will be coaching, to provoke students to learn how to learn and thus toteach themselves. <p></cite>One teacher, a coach, suggests that this principle means that "you don't leavekids to rot behind a desk for twelve years": <p><blockquote>Kids are active, involved and challengeddoing things not to preparethem for the real world but to engage them in the real world. The unfortunatepart about the metaphor is that most coaches are not democratic. Joe Paternotitled his book <cite>My Way </cite>for a reason. There was a big controversy ayear ago between Elway and Dan Reeves. Elway, the quarterback, wanted moreauthority to call the plays and he almost left Denver over that issue. Winningcoaches do not let kids do very much of the thinking. And I don't mean justsports coaches. Drama coaches, music coaches, too. I've coached for years, andbelieve me, most coaches aren't very democratic teachers.<p></blockquote>Others concur with his perspective:<p><blockquote>I'm saying that a coach is probably the most dictatorial position ofall. As a coach I tell them, "You do this and this and this. You put your leftfoot right here when I tell you, and you don't do it any other way." And theydon't do anything I don't tell them to do. Now, the Coalition has turned thataround so that the coach stands there and lets the kids do it. But coaches don'tdo that because kids can't do it by themselves.<p></blockquote><blockquote>I had some teachers who were very brilliant, and I would sit thereand listen to them talk about something and they would explain things in suchbeautiful ways and make it interesting, and I question whether we should takethat out of the classroom. It sounds to me like kids should be sitting around ingroups and the teachers aren't supposed to be in charge really.<p></blockquote><blockquote>The other thing is that in between games, coaches and kids drill overand over and over again. It's just plain ordinary work. The kids hate it. Nobodycheers. It's boring. And that is what we do in class. We drill. Nobody mentionsrunning those 220s day after day after day, and nobody likes doing problems overand over and over, but that's what makes you good.<p></blockquote><blockquote>In my math class this morning I had them working in groups. They weregetting a lot, but some of the things they were screwing up because they justdidn't bother to follow the pattern or model I had on the sheet. They skipped awhole bunch of steps. The problem with this discovery thing is that it takes anawfully long time, and sometimes they discover something that will lead them inthe wrong direction.<p></blockquote>The second group believes that the metaphor is a good, but difficult, one. Oneteacher stated,<p><blockquote>I do think, as much as possible, we should help the kids get theinformation by doing it themselves, whether that means reading it and trying tofigure out what it says or teaching other kids. They should be setting upreceptions like the kids are doing for the visitors from France. They should bein the play. They should be doing all the things they can possibly do becausethey learn a tremendous amount from doing different types of things.<p></blockquote>When the principal says that the group has not yet reached any agreement on whatlegitimate work is, others add their views about work: <p><cite><blockquote>Vice principal: </cite>Student-as-worker is a good conceptagreat principle, but we're missing the boat on that one here. Kids are gettingthe message that they don't have to work very hard. Kids are living in a societythat says "Do as little as you can." Our kids do not work as hard as they couldand should, and our teachers get frustrated as hell over that.<p></blockquote><cite><blockquote>A teacher: </cite>I could easily give them a little lecture ona story which would help them understand it more easily, or I could give it tothem to figure out in groups, to be able to summarize it. It takes a lot moretime, but I think students learn a great deal more because then they can attackother tasks and they develop skills that transfer. <p></blockquote><cite><blockquote>Another teacher: </cite>I think we're at the stage where a lotof people have tried this and have said, "Ooooh, this is hard." We've run upagainst this in several of our interdisciplinary assignments. When you say tothe kids, "Here's what you're going to do, here's the performance you're going togive, here's who your audience is, here's what the benchmarks are along the way,here's what I can do to support you, here's what you have to do on your own" andyou set the kids free, one of a couple of things happens. You find kids who don'tknow how to do things like read an article. Then you find kids who learn morethoroughly. You get the opportunity to interact with kids in ways that weusually don't when we're dishing out the assignments and they are dishing themback in. I happened to be working regularly with one student who has learningdisabilities. I realized just by sitting and watching him work, while I promptedhim to think about things, how much difficulty he had trying to make sense ofthe written material he was using. <p></blockquote>Three understandings emerge from the consideration of this principle. One groupsuggests that the metaphor is inept: that coaches are dictatorial and that kidscannot do the work without a dictatorial coach. Others think the principle doesnot convey what they believe the author intended, and that as a result it iseither misinterpreted or rejected. Another group accepts that the metaphor meansthat students need to be actively engaged in their own learning. This group alsosuggests, however, that the actual doing is more difficult than one mightimagine.  <p>Again, the faculty's multiple interpretations of the principle reveal their ownbeliefs about the professional responsibilities of teachers and the capabilitiesof students. <p>The principal's observation that the staff does not share a common understandingabout what constitutes legitimate work is revealing. In classrooms wherestudents have to be told and shown what to do each step of the way, it would seemthat the work they are given would be simpler than work given in other classesand that the teacher's responsibility would be to remain at the center ofteaching and learning. In classrooms where teachers define the metaphordifferently, work, as well as the teacher's role, takes on a different meaning.These two interpretations suggest very different philosophies about how learningtakes place.   <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="6:gbe"><h3>6:  Graduation by Exhibition</h3><p><p><cite>Students entering secondary school studies are those who can showcompetence in language and elementary mathematics. Students of traditional highschool age but not yet at appropriate levels of competence to enter secondaryschool studies will be provided intensive remedial work to assist them quicklyto meet these standards. The <b>diploma should be awarded upon a successful finaldemonstration of mastery</b> for graduationan "Exhibition." This Exhibition bythe student of his or her grasp of the central skills and knowledge of theschool's program may be jointly administered by the faculty and higherauthorities. As the diploma is awarded when earned, the school's programproceeds with no strict age grading and with no system of "credits earned" by"time spent" in class. The emphasis is on the students' demonstration that theycan do important things. <p></cite>Many teachers in the school have been asking students to do Exhibitions in theirindividual classes. The term when used in this context generally means oralpresentations given at the end of a unit. Math students did Exhibitions in thepre-calculus class. Other math students developed video tapes to teach mathconcepts. Students in ninth-grade English and social studies do Exhibitions atthe end of the unit on China and South Africa. Some of these experiments havebeen positive experiences for staff and students, but they do take time. <p>However, when some of the faculty consider the term as it is couched in thisprinciplea demonstration on which the diploma should be awardedthey feel lesscertain about it. <p>Some staff believe that they have been doing Exhibitions right along in their ownclasses: in the technology class the kids are developing prototypes for cars, thelanguage students pre- sent a fashion show, in music the kids have performances,in art they have Exhibitions, and a math teacher notes that the state board examis their Exhibition.  <p>Another group is struggling with the idea. They point out that no one knows ifExhibitions work yetthat it's still just an idea with no verification. <p><blockquote>I don't know why graduation should be based on one Exhibition. Idon't know how great an Exhibition would have to be to convince me that somebodywas ready to graduate. I think an Exhibition is a good way to show what you'velearned in a somewhat limited area, such as playing an instrument in music ordoing a painting or designing an experiment in science.<p></blockquote>Varying uses of the term <cite>Exhibition </cite>make discussion difficult. Manyof the faculty are interested in Exhibitions as end-of-unit assessments butuncomfortable with them as a means by which to grant diplomas. Others think thetests, oral presentations, and essays which students have always been required todo are Exhibitions, so no further consideration is necessary; while still othersnote that they have not really talked about the issue. A more clearly drawndistinction between end-of-unit assessments and graduation requirements mightprove helpful. Using two terms, <cite>Exhibitions </cite>and<cite>performances</cite>, to clarify the distinction might be useful. <p>The central questions with which the staff must grapple are whether they believeperformance assessment tells them more than traditional assessment does aboutwhat students know and can do, and whether they want to revise their graduationrequirements and assessment method to enable students to learn the skillsnecessary for producing work that can be evaluated by performance assessment.  <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="7:tod"><h3>7: Tone of Decency</h3><p><p><cite><b>The tone of the school should </B>explicitly and self-consciously<b>stress </b>values of <b>unanxious expectation </b>("I won't threaten you butI expect much of you"), of trust (until abused), and of decency (the values offairness, generosity, and tolerance). Incentives appropriate to the school'sparticular students and teachers should be emphasized, and parents should betreated as essential collaborators. <p></cite>Many staff feel that the values described in this principle are already in placeand that they were described in the first snapshot. Teachers and students seem tocare about each other; everyone is on the same side. The principal and severalteachers push this idea a little further:<p><blockquote>I think we're moving into some new territory in terms of empowermentwith the Congress  [the student-faculty decision-making body] and the FairnessCommittee. The kids are asking questions, and while I think they areunbelievably respectful, some teachers are really nervous. There is a kind ofsmoldering lack of ease about these new relationships. We're trying to workthrough them in advisory seminars and in Congress. This has traditionally been avery polite place, so it's hard to confront issues like fairness.<p></blockquote><blockquote>I don't think the kids get a lot of feedback from test scores orhomework. I've been trying to set up the writing program so that kids get a lotof feedback. It's hard to look at someone with whom you're trying to build trustand say, "I just didn't get anything from this paper." The bottom line is thatrelationships just simply can't always be friendly. They have to be based on whatwill move us all forward as learners and as a community. <p></blockquote>Several teachers mention that they think that anxiety is a good thing:<p><blockquote>I think we have to fine-tune the anxiety because on the one hand,it's a negative word, and yet, there's got to be some way to get at the kids whoare laid back. They're kind of like Paul Simon's song, "Slip Slidin' Away." Therehas to be a certain element of anxiety.<p></blockquote><blockquote>These kids, I'm serious, have no anxiety about not doing their work.I think they get away with a lot. And I think expectations need to be clear forthem. We need more of the discipline of caring. They need to know what theconsequences are. <p></blockquote>Several other teachers mention that in order for this principle to work, theparents need to be involved. <p><blockquote>I've come 360 degrees around on this one. I think the parents areleft out too much now. I don't care who the parent isdrunken, educated, noteducated. They have to be part of the process because the kids can't leave hereand go home without doing some of their work at home. The really good studentsare kids who spend hours each night. That's part of their job. They wouldn'tthink about postponing it. Parents can help us there.<p></blockquote>Again, interpretations among the staff are varied and tend to address parts ofthe principle: fairness, trust, anxiety, or parental involvement. Addres-sing theparts, as opposed to the whole principle, underlines the complexity of theprinciple. The fact that no one mentions expectations would also suggest thatthere may not be common agreement about what expectations for students should be.Taken together, the two words, <cite>unanxious expectations</cite>, suggestsomething different from the staff's interpretation of making sure that the kidsexperience the consequences of not doing their work. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="8:t"><h3>8:  Teacher-as -Generalist</h3><p><p><cite><b>The principal and teachers should perceive themselves as generalistsfirst</b> (teachers and scholars in general education) and specialists second(experts in but one particular discipline). Staff should expect multipleobligations (teacher-counselor-manager) and a sense of commitment to the entireschool. <p></cite>The faculty have two general responses to this principle. <p>One group feels that the staff are really doing this now, but their examples varyquite dramatically. The special education staff no longer have their ownclassrooms. They go to classes with their students and help wherever help isneeded. They work much more closely than before with other teachers.<p>One of the math teachers indicates that he follows this principle by knowing whatother teachers are doing so he can adjust the work load in his discipline. Stillothers think that teachers are enacting this principle because they are nowconducting advisory seminars, working with Congress, helping with the juniorclass dinner dance, and the like. Another teacher thinks it means knowing thestudents outside the classroom; he appreciates what his coaching responsibilitieshave taught him about the kids.  <p>Another group feels uncomfortable for a variety of reasons. One notes that,outside of special education, the staff have not even begun to look at usingresources such as time, people, and money differently. Even in theinterdisciplinary team everyone is still discipline-centered. Others feelcompetent to teach some other subjects but wonder whether the students would becheated if a teacher, untrained in math, had to teach math, for instance. Anotherteacher says that she frankly likes her discipline better than she likes kids, atthis point in her career, but that she is willing to try working collaborativelywith other teachers. <p>Some of the teachers who suggest that they are already fulfilling thisprinciple's criteria are describing newly wrought changes. Others believe thatcommon practices, in place for many years, show that this principle is already inplace. Are these groups' interpretations of the principle similar? Do theseresponses reflect different beliefs and attitudes? <p>Other teachers feel that the principle suggests that they take onresponsibilities which would not support student learning. How might the staffinterpret this principle if it were to mean increased support for students'learning?<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="9:budget"><h3>9:  Budget</h3><p><p><cite>Ultimate administrative and budget targets should include, in addition to<b>total student loads per teacher of eighty or fewer pupils, substantial timefor collective planning by teachers, competitive salaries for staff, and anultimate per-pupil cost not to exceed that at traditional schools by more than10 percent. </b>To accomplish this, administrative plans may have to show thephased reduction or elimination of some services now provided students in manytraditional comprehensive secondary schools.<p></cite>The faculty responded quite generally to this principle. Most feel that they haveremarkably low class loads. Those who do not, feel the pressure. On the otherhand, everyone cried out for more time to work together, to plan, and to thinkthings through. <p><blockquote>What we need now is time to digest and talk among ourselves and tryto see where we are and where we think we're going. In addition, there arenitty-gritty things that we need to attend tosuch as getting kids to do the workthey need to do.<p></blockquote>Teachers acknowledge that the principal has been terrific at giving them time ifthey needed ita day here or there to establish a new thrust or to problem-solve.An educational consultant who worked with the staff fairly regularly was muchappreciated, also. But the teachers who are trying to develop new unitslike themoon-tracking unit (in which students kept daily measurements of the position ofthe moon), the weather unit, the Holocaust unit, the apartheid unitand teacherswho are trying new strategies, such as Socratic seminars, alternative assessment,advisory seminars, and cooperative learning on biomes, need regular time towork with colleagues and to think things through. There was general consensusthat they are limited in what they can do by the amount of time they have to workthings out. <p>One of the administrators noted that just as the teachers need more planningtime, the administrators need more time tooto think things through, to checkfor coherence, and to troubleshoot. The amount of time they spend in planningfor change helps to ensure that change moves smoothlythat it is less difficult,bumpy, and disconcerting for teachers.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr><a name="aooti"><center><h2>An Overview of the Interpretations</h2></center><p><hr><p>Overall, the discussion of the nine Common Principles reveals that despite thefact that the staff agreed to the principles when they joined the Coalition, theyhave, not surprisingly, very different interpretations of them. Many commentssuggest that the staff have not begun to look at a number of the ideas in theprinciples and that there is some confusion about what this or that principle means. <p>It is not so much an issue of whether the staff have common definitions, whichthey clearly do not, or whether they disagree over them, but that they havemultiple, private interpretations, many of which center on a part or a phrase ofa principle rather than on the whole. <p>It is also true that only a portion of the staff interpret the principles as ifthey were designed to provoke investigative discussion about betterpossibilities for student learning. Others interpret them as if they weredesigned to engage faculties in a debate about the defensibility of their commonpractices. <p>Furthermore, the principles are interrelated and synergistic. In our interviews,unfortunately, we did not ask people to consider them as a whole, and so whetherthe staff accept only a few of them or the principles as a whole remains to beseen.   <p>Now that the staff have the information concerning their interpretations andreactions to the nine Common Principles, the question is, what to do about it orwith it? The ideas were designed to provide members of the Coalition with a kindof scrim, to borrow a theater terma light, unobtrusive backdrop which addsdepth, clarity, and purpose to the stage. In schools, our stage is the classroom,where teachers refine their craft, look repeatedly and relentlessly for morepowerful ways to engage students in the gathering, the practicing, and finally,the performing of new knowledge, skills, and understanding.<p>The principles were designed to help people examine traditional practices witha fresh eye and to help them consider when these practices are best used, whendiscarded, and when refined. They do not provide much help when staff dismissthem as inappropriate. They do not help much either when people suggest thatthey have already been following them.<p>An industrial arts teacher from another school shared his insights with us inthis regard. For years, because he had a hands-on class, he thought he was "doingit," while the rest of his school considered change. After some considerabletime, he came to a kind of personal revelationthat he had not been doing anymore than giving the students skill-and-drill kinds of activities. For years, thekids had to do nothing more than follow his directions just like in any otherclass, even though that meant using a band saw or a lathe. He felt a littlesheepish but began looking for ways to allow the students to use what they werelearning with their own, fresh applications and to provide them with realproblems which needed solving.<p>Instead of demonstrating step-by-step how they might repair a small engine, hesolicited engines from around the community which were destined for the junkheap, unless the kids could fix them. Working in groups, they got engines andwere told to have a go at it.<p>The teacher was still called on to demonstrate. He still gave his favoritelecture on small machines, but it was in the context of a problem in which thekids were interestedand some of the machines were returned fixed! <p>This is not to say that some people in this Essential school are not "doing it"alreadybecause they are. It is just to suggest that the infamous phrase "wealready do that" often enables people to pass over a complex idea with a quickand shallow glance.  <p>A principal of another Essential school said recently, <p><blockquote>The deeper we get into our understanding of the nine CommonPrinciples, the more work we have to do. I just realized that we have not, as astaff, ever talked about what it means for kids to use their minds well. Andevery year, we think we're doing it already!<p></blockquote><p>Clearly, the trick for the staff is to figure out how to use these ideas in a waythat is helpful, in a way that does not conjure up images of a vehement, newreligious sect or of a traveling educational road show that passes through,leaving little evidence of substance. Change is very difficulteven exhausting.It would be great if the ideas provided some sustenance to those involved in thischallenging, exhausting endeavor.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr><p><a href="../../../projects/sc/chanlong.htm">Appendix A: About the School Change Study</a><br><a href="../../../principl/principl.htm">Appendix B: The Common Principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools</a><br><a href="../list.htm#2">Return to Index of School Change Publications</a><p></body></html>

When we arrived, JimGoodman, the principal, and Esther Young, the vice principal, had settled intotheir new roles. A new physical education teacher had replaced a retiree, butshe was already familiar with the school since she had attended Oak Hill as astudent.	<p>The purpose of our visit was to continue to document the continuous work ofchange the school undertook five years ago, when it joined the Coalition ofEssential Schools. When it joined the Coalition, Oak Hill agreed to rethink itscommon practices in terms of the nine Common Principles, a set of ideas whichundergird the Coalition's work. (See Appendix B for a list of these Principles.)Oak Hill was selected to participate in the study because it demonstrated aserious commitment to creating more powerful school experiences for students andbecause faculty agreed that participation in the study was likely to push forwardits own work. <p>The many changes the school has made thus far are difficult but important earlysteps towards its goal of becoming an Essential school. A rotating schedule wasimplemented and revised. Staff and students participate in a Student-FacultyCongress designed to deal with issues which affect the school. Staff volunteer towork with students in "Seminars." Seminars, which students attend once a week,are designed to provide each student with an adult advocate in the school, aswell as a place to work on class projects and to deal with issues related to theStudent-Faculty Congress.<p>English and social studies teachers are building integrated curriculum. Specialeducation teachers and faculty are mainstreaming all students. Science teachershave dropped tracking in ninth-grade science in favor of heterogeneous grouping.English teachers are working on the development of student portfolios.<p>In addition, staff have become more involved in school decision making thanbefore and are working to forge a common agenda. On top of it all, almost everymember of the staff is attempting some kind of instructional or curricularchange, in hopes of engaging students more vibrantly in their learning thanbefore.<p>Last year, Oak Hill was selected as an early partner in New Partners for BetterSchools (NPBS), the state's effort to restructure schools. The changes within theschool itself, as well as this new partnership with the state, are just a few ofthe changes under way at Oak Hill. <p>The State Board of Education's Examination (SBEE), a standardized test, stillremains as a constraint on instruction and curricular innovations, in the sameway the Stanford Achievement Test does. The SBEE is required for certain coursesand is used by college admissions within the state system and beyond. However,the NPBS has suggested that interested schools can apply for waivers for theseexams. At the same time, the NPBS is in the process of revising the exam so thatit represents more authentic assessment than do previous exams. While the statecontext is changing in ways compatible to the schools, constraints that remainstill make changes difficult for the schools.  <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fts"><h3>Focusing the Snapshot</h3><p>Several months after our second visit to Oak Hill in spring 1991, we returned thesnapshot we had produced from our visit to the school, not as an evaluation, butas a description of their work in progress. Changing schools is very complicatedwork and requires the reasoned perceptions of both insiders and outsiders.Because we are interested in the accuracy of our perceptions, we ask that theparticipants indicate whether or not the picture we present seems true to theirexperience. We believe that this process of negotiating accuracy between theparticipants and the research team helps to prevent oversimplified,overglorified, or unduly negative pictures of school change. <p>In response to the spring snapshot, the faculty at Oak Hill made suggestions tothe researchers for this third visit. They asked that we help them investigatetheir multiple perceptions of the nine Common Principles, in particular byhelping them to see how they interpret what it means for students to use theirminds well. They also asked us to include an analytical note in which wehighlighted what we believe to be the dominant issues and reoccurring themes oftheir interpretations of the Principles.<p>The snapshot is organized in the following way: First, we present "close-ups" ofseveral classrooms at Oak Hill. Then, we present conversations that we had withstudents, staff, administrators, and parents during our visit. Finally, weconclude with a brief section giving our outsiders' perspective of the visit.<p>During our week at Oak Hill, we interviewed forty-two students, thirteen parents,seven administrators, and thirty-five faculty members. Researchers alsocollected samples of assignments and student work and observed in classrooms andin the lunchroom before and after school.1<p>We hope that the picture we present will enable the staff to determine whetherstudents are using their minds well in their classes and that it will help thestaff to understand to what degree classrooms are actually changing. We hope eachsnapshot we produce from our observations and conversations during our visits toOak Hill will illuminate the educational life at the school for a variety ofpeople who have a stake in it: teachers, students, parents, administrators, andoccasionally, local journalists and policy makers; and that it will raise issuesand questions for the faculty's critical consideration. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="awisc"><hr><h2>A Week in Several Classes</h2></center> <hr>In order to better understand what Oak Hill is like for teachers and forstudents, we spent more time in a variety of classrooms than during our previousvisit. This time, we followed three students through eight classes all week long.With ninth-grader, Tina Rice, we went to English 9 and earth science. Withjunior, Terry Stahl, we went to English 11, social studies, chemistry, and Course3 Math. With junior, Karen McFarland, who shares English and social studies withTerry, we went to French 2 and business law. The classes we visited, whichrepresent both electives and required courses, were selected because theirteachers were willing to participate in the study, rather than because of anygrand research design. The students confirm that these classes portray typicalexperiences they share while attending Oak Hill. While close-ups of these coursesare just a small sample of each of these students' daily schedules and providejust a glimpse of what each of each teacher does in the course of a day, theyopen a valuable window to classroom life. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="mo19"><h3>Monday, October 19, 1992</h3><p>Students gather around outside to greet us and to brief us before we head off toclasses with them. While we worked with these students just months ago, we notedramatic changes. The juniors are seniors and somehow look the part. The newsophomores and juniors also look older than they did in the spring and in manycases tower over the new freshman class. Many have grown taller, thinner, wider,or more muscular.<p>After a summer of diverse activitiescamps, local jobs, worldwide travelstheyhave much to say about school. Some say it is harder this year; someone respondsthat they <i>think </i>it is harder because their teacher keeps telling them itis. Several others suggest that nothing much has changed: "For all the talk, thisschool is pretty much like every other school I've been to. Kids listen and takenotes while teachers talk, then we take tests and then we graduate."<p>Other kids are enthused by new approaches, by the Student-Faculty Congress, andby the fact that this year they were allowed to reinstitute the homecomingbonfire. The seniors are excited about a new requirement, the Senior OptionsProgram. As we move into the building and off to classes with three students,they promise to explain more later. All of them believe that we will see theschool the way they describe it.   <p>The new principal, Dr. Jim Goodman, greets students in the halls as they come in."Hi, Tony. How was your weekend?" <p>"Okay, Dr. Goodman. Too much homework."<p>"Hi, Mary. We have Seminar today."<p>"Yep, I know."<p>"Do you have the list of issues we were going to go over?"<p>"Somewhere. Don't worry."<p>"Let's see, it's Angel, isn't it?"<p>"Nope, I'm Tina."<p>"Sorry, Tina, I'll get it eventually. I was telling my daughter about the campyou went to last summer. She might be interested in it next year."<p><h4>Tina Rice, Ninth-grader</h4><p>Tina Rice is fifteen, confident; bubbly one moment, crushed, angry, and out ofwhack the next. She is, if nothing else, volatile. She is about five feet, fiveinches tall, has neat brown hair, and has in her pocket a pair of severe,multicolored glasses that she takes out when she has to read. She is glad to bein high school. She thinks it is much harder than middle school but that studentshave a lot more freedom here. She is also the third of three girls in her familyto come through the school system. She feels that her teachers stereotype herwith her sisters, but, Tina protests, "I'm, like, really different from them; itis so annoying!" Tina is taking French, English, social studies, Course 1 Math,health, and SBEE earth science. We follow her through English and earth scienceall week. "Monday isn't bad," she says, "because the periods are only thirtyminutes long to make room for Congress and for Seminar."<p><h4>Terry Stahl, Junior </h4><p>Terry Stahl's week includes Course 3 Math, SBEE chemistry, English 11, and socialstudies, among other classes. Terry is a good student; he likes school when itengages him and criticizes it when it leaves him bored. He does his schoolwork,is active in extracurriculars, and has a part-time job. He and his best friendspend their spare time dreaming up potential businesses that could make them afortune and trying to figure out a single mathematical formula in which all otherformulae are embedded. He shares English and social studies with Karen McFarland,but she has French 2 and business law instead of chemistry and math. <p><h4> Karen McFarland, Junior</h4><p>Karen has dropped the SBEE classes because, she says, she hates math very muchand just cannot seem to do it. Because she had a terrible time with math, shelost her confidence in learning it. She suggests that the counselors told herthat if she thought she wasn't going to do well, she should try another tack. Shehas ability in her other classes but little energy for school. Like Terry, shelikes courses which engage her but does not have the staying power Terry has whenit comes to working at things she does not like. She describes herself as stupidwhen talking about some subjects and competent when discussing others. She isworried about her future, occasionally feels alienated in the school, and iseasily intimidated when she does not understand something. She wants to go tocollege, but she cannot always follow the information counselors give her, so shedoesn't know where she could go. Karen's parents are divorced, and she has notspoken to her father for months. That's OK with her, she says, as long as shedoesn't think about it. <p><b>English 9.</b> Student desks, pushed together in pairs, form a circle aroundthe edge of the room, with a small group of desks in the center. Ms. Leonardsuggests that the kids sit with anyone who is part of their adopt-a-countryproject. The twenty students quickly find seats with partners. They are to adopta third-world country, research its culture, and write about it from afirst-person perspective. The assignment is a part of their interdisciplinarywork in English and social studies. The articles will be published in a magazinethe students will format and publish. Ms. Leonard suggests that in order to getstarted, they first list facts that they have uncovered in their research andthen begin writing the story. The room is marked by inertia.<p>"Can't get started?" asks Ms. Leonard. "What are the key things about yourcountry that you want me to understand? OK? Write down who you are...." Shegives suggestions of who they can be: a reporter who has just arrived by plane, aColombian addict looking for prospective drug trade, a Peace Corps worker, aforeign exchange student, and a doctor concerned about overpopulation inSomalia. Ms. Leonard circulates, helping individual students until the bellrings. Tina writes nearly a page; she likes to write. Her report is on Somalia,and she has been reading the news every day. At the end of the period, she packsup and scuttles up the stairs to her next class. <p><b>Earth Science.</b> Mary Shea, the teacher, is in the front of the room as Tinacomes in with her friend, Janis. Tina and Janis move to lab tables in the back.The class is beginning a unit on the atmosphere and weather. Ms. Shea hands out adata sheet, which helps the kids translate Fahrenheit into Celsius. She explainsthe directions as the students read along. <p>Ms. Shea tells the researchers that the students need to know the terminology,and they need to be able to read and analyze the data on the sheet for the SBEEexam. She notes that students come in with all kinds of incorrect assumptions,which she has to ferret out and correct.<p>"For instance, kids think that the air we breathe is made up of oxygen, and theythink I'm nuts when I tell them its real composition." Ms. Shea asks kidsquestions from the fact sheets and answers the questions when they hesitate."What is the temperature in Celsius when it is one hundred degrees Fahrenheit?" .. . "Thirty-eight? Do you see that? What temperature is it on the Kelvin scale?". . . "Three hundred ten; that's right." Students answer the questions out loud.Tina rolls her eyes; the questions are so easy. Her friend Janis doesn't looknearly as confident as Tina.<p>Sam Tenner, another science teacher, sits near Tina in the back of the room. Heis there as a helping teacher because this class is heterogeneously mixed,rather than tracked by ability. Seeing if all kids can learn the material andpass the SBEE exam is a major experiment in the science department. Last year,contrary to common practice in the state, Oak Hill had all but four ninth-gradestudents take the exam, and all but a few passed. Passing that exam is a majorobjective of this class.<p>Ms. Shea hands out a lab sheet which requires that students graph varioustemperatures and altitudes and that they label the different parts of theatmosphere (the troposphere, the lithosphere, and so on). She explains thedirections and shows them where they can look on the chart for assistance. Shegets a box of old color crayons and asks students to color the various levels indifferent colors. Tina and her friend move to the back of the room to the largetables. They immediately begin discussing the weekend while they take out theirpaper, get the crayons, and figure out the fact sheet. <p>Ms. Shea and Mr. Tenner wander from group to group, helping as needed.<p><b>	English 11.</b> As the bell rings, students file into desks, which areplaced in rows, and Terry and Karen take their seats. There are twenty-fivestudents: nineteen boys and six girls. Terry and Karen both like this class; theteacher is interesting, and he pushes them. They feel that they are doing harder,more sophisticated work than usual, that he expects a lot of them, but that heencourages them, too. Mr. Walters, in the front, says, "Congratulations on yourwin on Friday."<p>"We kicked their anal posteriors!" says Terry.<p>"We have several things on the agenda," Mr. Walters proceeds. "How was thePSAT?"<p>"Gruesome."<p>"The math was easy," says another student. <p>"The verbal was really hard," says another. "We were never taught thosewords."<p>"Word knowledge," says Mr. Walters. "As long as the PSATs demand word knowledge,they are not aptitude tests. What about the analogy section?"<p>"That was the hardest of all."<p>"The best thing you can do now is forget the test, but don't throw your testbooklet away. We can see where your weakness lies."<p>He then reviews assignments. They are to be reading to page 70 in <i>MyAntonia</i>, they are to prepare for a vocabulary test, and their fifth writingassignment is due by the end of the week. One students says, "<i>My Antonia</i>is boring."<p>Mr. Walters responds, "You need to eliminate the word <i>boring</i>. Too much TV.You need to use your imagination."<p>They begin on the vocabulary lesson, which takes place once every two weeks orso. The students call out words they know from the list he has given them,venture definitions, and ask questions about the distinctions between words. Astudent asks, "What's the difference between <i>haggard </i>and <i>decrepit?</i>"<p>"<i>Haggard </i>is used only to describe humans," says Mr. Walters. They go backand forth and around the room. Kids write things down, laugh, exchangeinformation, and listen to Mr. Walters. The bell rings.<p><b>Social Studies 11. </B>Terry and Karen move on to U.S. history, where they arefocusing on the Articles of Confederation and on a document-based question whichis part of the SBEE essay section. There are nine documents, which consist ofletters, tables, or maps. Karen and Terry take the handouts as they are passedaround. Terry loves this class. "Ms. Francis really knows her stuff. She makeshistory so interesting because she relates everything to things that are going onright now, like the elections." <p>Karen, on the other hand, finds the textbook hard to read. She says that it isboring and that there is a <i>lot </i>of reading. By the time she reaches the endof the chapter, she has forgotten what she has read. She likes the classroomdiscussions and is interested in the elections. The class does current eventsevery week, and she has been following the presidential debates. Karen's reactionto the debates has fueled the running debate she is having with her step-father.<p>For class today the question is, Should the Articles of Confederation have beenreplaced? Students are to use the documents to supply the answer. A spiriteddiscussion follows between Ms. Francis and five boys in the class. Occasionally,the teacher prods the nonparticipants: "Karen, what do you think?" "Jamie, canyou explain Shay's Rebellion?" "What's the connection here between what Bush andClinton believe about the states versus federal power?" <p>Back and forth they go until the bell rings. Ms. Francis reminds them that theyare to read chapter 1 and watch the next presidential debate. Terry leaves,grinning. Karen waits to ask Ms. Francis about an intentional choice of words onher paper, which Ms. Francis had corrected. Karen, who likes to write, isdisappointed that Ms. Francis did not get the pun she had intended. <p><b>Chemistry.</b> Terry playfully punches a few friends as he moves through thehalls to his next class, which he shares with twenty-three other students. Theyare learning about atomic theory. Mr. McDonough, in a white lab coat, passes outan activity sheet which asks students to consider the strengths and weaknesses ofseveral theories. Next, he returns a recent test. Terry and his lab partnercompare results of the test, then turn to the activity sheet. Terry explains tohis partner, "Turn to the text first, then use the other sources." They divide upthe task: one reads the question and the other tries to find the answer in thebook. They quickly discover that their knowledge of grammar is helpful. Bylooking at what kind of word is needed, they can easily find the correct answerwithout doing any research. Several other boys join Terry's group, and they workuntil the period is over.<p>Mr. McDonough tells the researchers that he is trying to "let go" of the classtolet students do more of the work. He finds it difficult and does not know if itis more effective than his previous approach. <p><b>Course 3 Math.</b> Terry goes next to Course 3 Math. Terry sits midway downhis row and joins a number of kids with baseball capssome with the bill forward,others with it facing back. <p>Mr. Nelson hands out a vocabulary sheet on the geometry of the circle: "Things toKnow or Be Square." On it are terms and definitions: all radii are congruent; aninscribed angle is an angle whose vertex is on the circle and whose measure ishalf its intercepted arc. He asks the kids when they want a test on this. Theyvote for Thursday because they have an exam in another class on Friday. <p>He then asks the students to review the homework. They do not have to hand intheir homework, but they must do it to know what they do not understand. Terrysays his homework becomes his notes for the course. It is what he uses to studyfor a test. The kids call out which problem they want reviewed, and Mr. Nelsondemonstrates it at the board. By the end of the period, they have not completedtheir review, so he assigns the same homework for the next day. <p>Mr. Nelson explains that this is the math course with the most packed curriculum.There is no time to dally, as most of the material is included in the SBEE test.All the kids in the class are college- bound, but they are not the strongest mathstudents. There are only three girls in the class.<p>Instead of going to chemistry and math, both SBEE courses which she is nottaking, Karen goes to French 2 and business law. Karen joined French later thanother kids because she was not sure she wanted to take a language, but afterhearing so much about the trip and the exchanges, she decided to take iteventhough she knows that there will not be a trip for her by the time she reachesFrench 3. Sometimes she gets it; sometimes she doesn't, because Ms. Lahton talksso fast, but she likes a number of the things the class did last yearlike makinga giant map of the Oak Hill area for the French students who visited them. <p><b>French 2.</b> In the small room there are twenty students: nine boys andeleven girls. Only Karen and another student are juniors; the rest aresophomores. Ms. Lahton starts with a verbal review in both French and English ofwhat they did the day before, then moves on to new vocabulary. She usescolor-coded cards to introduce the words, and the students use the words insentences. <i>Buzz</i>, an unobtrusive alarm sounds, signaling that they need tomove on to a new activityin this case, a quick quiz on a half sheet of paper.Students have three minutes to conjugate the verb <i>aller </i>and use it insentences. <i>Buzz</i>, and Karen hands in her paper. Most of her work is writtenin English. A neighbor has done hers entirely in French. When the dismissal bellrings, Ms. Lahton stands at the door extracting a French statement orcommentanything in Frenchfrom students as they leave. <p>Karen says she always feels a little exhausted after this class because thingsmove fast, and she has to concentrate hard to follow what is going on. <p><b>Business Law.</b> Karen races downstairs to get to business law. There shesits in a square group of desks with three other girls, her friends, all of whomhave taken this elective to fill a requirement. Karen thinks the counselor toldher that this class will fill a science requirement, but she isn't sure. MikeFrank, the teacher, changed this course recently from a SBEE course to a classdealing with issues of justice and morality. <p>On this Monday morning, he announces it will be a catch-up day, as he has beenaway at a conference. During class, students work alone or in groups on thefollowing: chapter outlines, vocabulary, case questions, current events, and/ortheir federal agency paper. As he moves from student to student, handing backpapers and checking off their work in his grade book, they fill him in on wherethey are with their federal agency papers. <p>Karen has chosen to write a brief of a current case described in the newspaper,but spends the majority of the time recapping the weekend with her friends. Sheand her boyfriend visited some of his friends at a local university. She says sheliked the place a lot and would love to go there. The four girls talk about theweekend, except when Mr. Frank is near their table; then, they check their ownwork, read the chapter, and review vocabulary words. The bell rings, and studentsmove off to their Seminars.<p><b>Seminar.</b> Jeremy, a senior, slouches towards Ms. Leonard's room. Seminarsmeet once a week for half an hour. Ms. Leonard has arranged the desks in a smallcircle for the twelve students who join her. Ms. Leonard attempts to set upindividual meetings with each of the students to talk to them about their SeniorOptions project, a new graduation requirement about which students are excited.Scheduling takes some doing.<p>Next, they need to find a time when their Seminar can meet, since most of theseniors are mentoring a freshman Seminar. The group is lethargic. Ms. Leonardsuggests that they eat lunch together and that they could bring special things.She still gets no response. By force of her personality, she gets them to agreeon meeting during lunch period once a week, but not to bringing lunch. TheirCongress representative makes a report, and the kids leave. <p>Ms. Leonard says that her group has not jelled since the beginning of schoolbecause Seminar has been rescheduled and because the seniors are mentoring thefreshman. She needs time with them, she says.<p><b>After School.</b> At the end of the school day, which has seven class periodsand a forty-minute lunch period, the students move off to various otheractivities. Tina tries out for volleyball. Terry goes to his job three days aweek, except when he plays basketball, which has not started yet. Right now hehas a small part in the play, which he can manage to squeeze around his job.Karen goes home to do her homework before her boyfriend gets off work.<p>The students have varying levels of homework; the consequences for doing or notdoing it are different in each class. Students know that if their teachers arenot coaching after school, they can find them for extra help, or they can gethelp from one of the resource room teachers, who, because of mainstreaming, arespending a lot of time in classes and really know what is going on. The schoolhums until after five o'clock. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="to20"><h3>Tuesday, October 20, 1992</h3><p>English 9.</b> Tina, feeling sluggish today because of an argument with hersisters this morning, slides into her English class. Today there are seventeenstudents. First, Ms. Leonard gives them a calendar, on which due dates are markedby arrows, and they go over the next month's activities with her. <p>Next, Ms. Leonard hands out a survey based on "The Scarlet Ibis," a short story.The students are working on pieces of writing in response to the story. She asksthe students to fill out the survey on their own. Once it is completed, she movesthem into groups to discuss their reactions to the survey. One group argues thepoint in question 12 on the survey, which says, "Outer appearance is asimportant as inner traits are." Eventually Ms. Leonard turns them back to theirwriting assignments. "Please examine the argument you made and the support. Seeif you can strengthen your piece by including more evidence to support yourposition." The classroom is quiet until the bell rings.	<p>Ms. Leonard learned yesterday that students need more information for theiradopt-a-country reportssomething she has discussed with Mr. Lacer. <p><b>Earth Science.</b> Ms. Shea is in the front of the room as students enter andsprawl on the desks and lab tables. She asks for their labs and then tells themthat she is going to give them a quick quiz. "Oh joy," sighs a student sittingnear Tina. Tina and her partner exchange doomed glances. There are fivequestions: <p><ol><li>List 4 variables that change with altitude. <p><li>	Graph themquicky graphswith altitude as the independent variable. <p><li>	How do you know where an interface occurs? <p><li>	What would your graph look like if the atmosphere was uniform,homogeneous throughout? <p><li>	Describe the atmosphere according to the information on your graph. <p></ol>Tina works very quickly: <p>1.	Temperature, pressure, water vapor. <p>3.	When the temperature stays the same. <p>5.	For the first 14 miles it goes down then from 1420 miles it goes up andfrom 5068 miles it goes down in temp. <p>The room is very quiet. She finishes long before the others and then fidgets. Ms.Shea comes by and tells Tina that she is a good thinker. <p>Once everyone is finished, she asks the kids to move into groups appropriate towhere they are with the work listed on the board. The kids get up and move. Ms.Shea looks through the quizzes and quickly gets a sense of the kids' generallevel of understanding. She reviews the quizzes while the kids work on theirhomework until the bell rings.<p><b>English 11.</b> Terry takes a seat in the back and lays his head down on hisdesk. He is exhausted. Karen sits with friends. "Two thoughts," Mr. Waltersbegins. "It is clear very few of you have the slightest idea how to write apoem." They discuss the difference between <i>prose </i>and <i>poetry</i>."Poetry speaks through comparisons. Ezra Pound's is an example: Faces on petalson a wet black bough.' He wants to create an image, a comparison." Terry's headcomes up. "Yellow flowers bursting open," Mr. Walters writes on the board. <p>"And everyone's really hopin'," volunteers a girl.<p>"Rhyme." says Walters. "The twentieth century doesn't like rhyme. If you rhymeeach line you end up with something that is a cross between Jack and Jill' and aHallmark card."<p>Someone asks, "So you're saying that this [meaning Pound's poem] is better?" <p>"It takes away the singsong stuff that sounds like elementary school." They moveto a discussion of <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>. "What is your impression of the kingand duke?"<p>"They are con men."<p>"What makes them so successful?"<p>One student says, "Because Huck's naive."<p>"Almost everyone was," says Karen.<p>A third student says, "They complemented each other."<p>"What other comedy pairs have followed these two?" asks Mr. Walters. The kidssuggest Abbott and Costello, Laurel and Hardy, and Lennie and George in <i>OfMice and Men</i>. Mr. Walters responds, continues to ask questions, tells thestudents he is pleased by the connections they are making, and concludes, "Thelesson for today is about immoral actions. This story is about two friendsexpelled. Huck's decision that the king and the duke are no longer people he canbefriend is like . . . "<p>"Huck's decision to leave his father?" asks a student.<p>"We'll discuss Boggs and Sherburne tomorrow. Are you beginning to see why thisbook is important? Family ... friendship ... slavery." Terry, whose head isback down on the desk, has not said a word and packs up as if in a fog.<p><b>Social Studies.</b> Terry is a little more alert. He and Karen discuss withMs. Francis the campaign and the voters' newspaper published by the League ofWomen Voters. Ms. Francis gives a brief historical description of the League,walks the students through all of the candidates listed in the paper, and answersquestions related to the national, state, and local candidates. She then relatesthe discussion to their reading: "Do you agree with the Founding Fathers' viewson human nature as explained by Hofstadter? Are there any candidates the FoundingFathers would approve of in this election?" <p>For homework, the kids are to read Article 1 of the Constitution and fill in aworksheet. <p><b>Course 3 Math.</b> Mr. Nelson asks students to draw circles. They are givencompasses, rulers, and blank paper. Working at the board, Mr. Nelson draws ahorizontal line through the middle of the circle and labels the line segments."Do you know any of the angles?"<p>"Ninety?" someone volunteers.<p>"Why ninety?" <p>"I don't know."<p>"<i>AB </i>is an intersected angle, so <i>C </i>is a right angle. The inscribedangle in a semicircle is a right angle." He draws while he talks. They move on totangents, which he describes as one of the most powerful concepts in mathematics.Drawing examples, he clarifies the difference between a line segment and a line.He draws tangent arcs, and students copy them on their own paper. He then remindsthem what a compass does: "It indicates equal distance from a given point. Itmakes a circle. If you want measurements, you have to get a scale." He asks thekids to draw tangents. A student asks, "What are we doing here?" Mr. Nelsonwanders around the room, checking students' work. Two kids start dueling withrulers. He asks them to locate points <i>B </i>and <i>C </i>and then says, <p><blockquote>You can memorize a pound of crap, or you can work to understand theshapes and the relationships. Where do tangents intersect circles? Where arethere right angles? Locate the inscribed angles. What is an acute angle? Where isone? </blockquote><p>While walking out, Terry says that math is going better for him this year. Heunderstands what they are doing, and he can get help when he needs it. <p><b>Chemistry.</b> Twenty-four students assemble for a chemistry lab. The shadesare drawn and an acid smell permeates the room. Terry and his lab partner putvarious elements into the Bunsen burner flame. The flame burns blue, red, orgreendifferent colors depending on the element burned. Standing in the front ofthe room, Mr. McDonough describes the color spectrum and explains the differencebetween <i>ground state</i>, which is stable, and <i>excited state</i>, which isunstable. Terry and his partner fill in the blanks on their lab sheet. Mr.McDonough relates this lab to neon lights. Terry says, "To get different colors,use different gases." Mr. McDonough explains that man-made logs are impregnatedwith similar chemicals. Someone mentions fireworks.<p>Terry and his partner work away, filling in the blanks indicating that when theyburned <i>x </i>element they got <i>y </i>color. At the end, Terry grins andsays, "I don't know the point of the lab, but it was fun."<p><b>French 2.</b> Class begins with a quiz. Following the quiz,  Ms. Lahton passesout pink, hole-punched notecards to present a lesson on the verb <i>dormir</i>.She begins by having students identify various related English words<i>dormant,dormitory. </i>She emphasizes the regularity of the verb. Students recite andanswer questions using the verb. <i>Buzz.</i> Orange cards are next, with theword savoir in its various forms. Ms. Lahton works on the board and the studentscomplete the notecards. <i>Buzz</i>, and they sing a round. Karen sings quietly.Next, students translate common French phrases listed on a sheet into English.Students are allowed to say, <i>"Je passe," </i>if they did not know the answer,so that they can maintain the brisk pace. Karen responds three times correctly,passes twice, and answers incorrectly twice. Ms. Lahton corrects any incorrectresponses. <p><b>Business Law.</b> When she enters the classroom, Karen joins two of her threefriends. Mr. Frank hands out the description of the final assignment for thefederal agency project. He also hands back the background checklist that the kidswere to have filled out. The final assignment sheet includes the following: <p><ol><li>Select a federal agency from the list provided.<p><li>	Write to this agency requesting information. Submit your letter ofrequest to me prior to sending it to the agency.<p><li>	Research supplemental material from other sources.<p><li>	Format: 35 typed pages. Sources include a bibliography.<p><li>	Content: agency background, purpose, how and why the agency came intobeing. Identify a current concern of this agency. Research this concern.<p></ol>The grading criteria are as follows:<p><blockquote>10 points: choice of topic and request for materials.</blockquote><p><blockquote>30 points: Introduction/background section. Should provideinformation as outlined on the research guide sheet.</blockquote><p><blockquote>50 points: current event section: This section should be the majorarea of research and should explore one current concern of your particularagency.</blockquote><p><blockquote>10 points: Bibliography</blockquote><p>Once the sheets are handed out, students are to work on any of their ongoingassignments: their chapter outlines, current events, or research projects. Karenand her friends open their books and then talk for the rest of the period.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wo21"><h3>Wednesday, October 21, 1992</h3><p>English 9.</b> Tina is more cheerful today than yesterday, as she moves into herEnglish class. Today the desks are in rows for a timed writing activity. Allstudents at the high school are doing the same assignment, which will be used bythe English department to discuss students' writing and to look for consistencywithin the department. The topic is: "You have been granted the power to changeone thing about yourself, your life, your world. Write about that change." Ms.Leonard explains the assignment for a few minutes, then the class quiets down asstudents set to work. Ms. Leonard sits in the front of the room. Two boys do notwrite. One has made arrangements to do the freewrite another time, because he gotlittle sleep the night before. A girl sucks her thumb unself-consciously whilewriting. The kids cross out, start over, and get going. Some do several pages;others do less. Tina writes two pages before the end of the period.<p><b>Earth Science.</b> Today there is a substitute because Ms. Shea has gone withthe superintendent to a meeting in Albany. The kids receive a worksheet onlongitude and latitude. Tina talks with her partner while they fill in theworksheet. They move back and forth between the lab worksheets and a sheet whichdefines the two terms. They also talk about the fact that there is <i>nothing</i>to do in Summerville. They talk and copy, talk and copy, until the bellrings.<p><b>English 11.</b> The discussion today examines Boggs and Sherburne, twocharacters in <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>, and moves back and forth between Mr.Walters' questions, students' questions, students' observations, and Mr.Walters' clarifications and observations.<p><b>Social Studies 11.</b> When Terry and Karen enter the U.S. history classroom,they join a group of students engaged in conversation with Ms. Francis. She istelling them of a recent discovery which indicates that Hamilton fired into theair, prior to his fatal duel with Burr, not because he wanted to avoid killingBurr, but because his pistol had a hair trigger. Students ask a number ofquestions, but move to their desks when the bell rings. <p>The lesson for the day focuses on the Constitution and on how elections areconducted. Ms. Francis asks a number of questions, to which students respond. Sheclarifies, pushes, prods, and encourages. The homework is reading Article 2 andcompleting a homework sheet.<p><b>Chemistry.</b>  Mr. McDonough explains what it was they saw in yesterday'slab. He reviews several questions they will need to know in order to write up thelab, and he discusses several equations. <p><b>Course 3 Math.</b> Today the class reviews tangent arcs. Mr. Nelson remindsthem that they have a quiz tomorrow and that arcs will be on it. The boys in theclass are unsettled and talkative, and it takes considerable force on Mr.Nelson's part to get them to sit down and concentrate. One student gets up andshuts the window. Another student tells him to leave it open, so he goes back andopens it. One of the boys needs a pencil; someone gives him one. Terry asks theboys around him to shut up. Mr. Nelson asks the kids to draw two circles. Terryuses his compass and draws one circle. Drawing the second circle, he asks hisneighbor, "Can they overlap?" Answering his own question, he erases. "It wouldn'tmake sense if it did. Can't make a tangent if it overlapped." Then he drawsanother set. Mr. Nelson walks around the class, helping kids. When Mr. Nelson isnear him, Terry says that he doesn't really understand what a tangent means. Mr.Nelson leans over and draws it as he explains. <p>The kids become clamorous when they think they finally have it. Mr. Nelson goesback to the board and demonstrates for them. Several students begin poking eachother with rulers. Finally pushed beyond his tolerance, Mr. Nelson turns on thekids, his voice changing. He tells them that "the school for clowns is inFlorida." It is a quiet, serious moment, and then they move on.<p>Students want to know what pages the quiz will cover. He says that the quiz willinclude the homework assignments on diameters and radii, central angles,inscribed angles, and tangent arcs. He says they will not be doing constructions.The kids moan and say that it is the only thing they are good at. <p><b>French 2.</b> Beginning with the Pledge of Allegiance, they rapidly move intoa review of the future <i>proche </i>and again work with <i>dormir </i>and<i>savoir</i>. They follow a pattern with each verb: name, translation,formation, applications, and examples. Karen answers correctly by reading fromher notes. <i>Buzz</i>. They review for another quiz. Ms. Lahton says that theirTuesday's quizzes were so bad that she threw them away. After the quiz, they do arecitation, using their notes as a drill sheet. Karen works with a partner andthey feed each other lines, but Karen is lethargic. <p>Business Law.</b> Today there is a substitute, who announces that there will be avocabulary test tomorrow on chapter 3. The kids groan. She suggests that theyshould work on the worksheets which she hands out. She says that Mr. Frank willcollect them later in the week. The substitute sits down behind the desk and doesnot speak again for the rest of the period. <p>Karen passes out candy to her friends. The group talks about what they did thenight before. Reluctantly, they look around for books in order to work on theworksheet. Only one of them has her book. Karen scans the worksheet and says thatthe second section provides clues to the answers in the first section. One girlscans the book. Whoever locates the answer first calls it out and the rest copyit onto their worksheet. Part of the worksheet is a story in which they have touse vocabulary:<p><blockquote>The Barbours bought custom-made draperies for their home fromDicksons Drapery for $3500 but they paid only $500 and refused to pay thebalance. Dickson, therefore, files a 1)______ against the Barbours for thebalance due. </blockquote><p>The girls fill in <i>civil action</i>. They concentrate and also talk. The nextsection requires yes or no answers and a brief explanation. Karen works on herown. She reaches the end, where there is an extra-credit question. "Do we getextra credit?" They tell her no, and she scratches her answer out. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="to22"><h3>Thursday, October 22, 1992</h3><p>English 9.</b> Tina and her classmates work on either their "Scarlet Ibis" shortstory paper or their adopt-a-country project. <p><b>Earth Science.</b> Ms. Shea leads the class in a question/answer session onlatitude and longitude. "The pole should cast a . . . ? Shadow. Can we figure thecircumference of the earth? . . . Your plane is crashing, and you have seconds tomark your position. What information do you need?" <p>Tina yells, "You need a depth finder and a latituderometer.'" The class respondsto her answer with laughter. <p>Ms. Shea: "You need to know your latitude and your longitude. Are degrees brokendown into something smaller? Minutes." The kids echo her: "Minutes." <p>"How many minutes are there in a degree? Sixty."<p>"Sixty."<p>"What else do you need to find me? Longitude."<p>"Longitude."<p>"How many dimensions do you need to find a location? Two."<p>"Two: longitude and latitude," the kids call out. Ms. Shea talks for the rest ofthe period, asking them short-answer questions, which she explains bydemonstrating the problems on the globe. They locate different points on theglobe, giving increasingly precise descriptions of their location.<p><b>English 11.</b> The juniors begin a discussion of <i>My Antonia</i>, a novelthey are reading for both English and history. They spend a good deal of timediscussing the land and the relationship of the individual to the land; theythink about Eden, about utopias, about whether a utopian place can becharacterized by monotony, and they consider the issue of isolation.<p>Michelle shares with the class that she can totally relate to Paul, one of thecharacters, who is moving West because his parents have died. She is goingthrough a similar situation herself. Mr. Walters suggests that Michelle deservestheir empathy.<p><b>Social Studies 11.</b> Terry and Nancy have just settled into their seats inhistory when an announcement calls all of the junior students to the auditoriumfor a class meeting. <p><b>Course 3 Math.</b> Because the junior class meeting lasts through the nextperiod, Terry misses his math test. <p><b>Chemistry.</b> Mr. McDonough conducts his famous liquid nitrogendemonstration, which he does once a year. He has a big vat of liquid nitrogen onthe demonstration table at the front of the room. He explains that it cost threedollars a liter and that it is useful because it is cheap and portable. Itsdensity is .81, and its boiling point is way below zero. He discusses the dangersof working with it and defines <i>cryogenics</i>the study of very coldtemperature. He throws in a piece of lettuce, takes it out, and throws it on thefloor, where it shatters into tiny shards. He talks about the use of liquidnitrogen as a gasket or seal on spacecraft. He tells how Clarence Birdseye usedliquid nitrogen in pioneering frozen foods.<p>The most dramatic moment comes when Mr. McDonough sticks his bare hand quicklyinto and out of the nitrogen. The students "ooh" and "aah"; Terry and hisclassmates are rapt.<p><b>French 2 and Business Law.</b> Karen misses French and does not show up forbusiness law, in which there is a multiple-choice vocabulary test. After thetest, Mr. Frank asks students to work in groups to think about what they want toknow about the first ten articles of the Constitution so that he can assign thempartners and a particular article to research. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fo23"><h3> Friday, October 23, 1992</h3><p>English 9.</b> Tina and her classmates engage in a Socratic seminar with Ms.Leonard and Mr. Lacer. Socratic seminars involve students in discussions whichemerge from close textual readings. Mr. Lacer, the facilitator, asks questionsand monitors the discussion. Ms. Leonard sits outside the circle to observe.<p>Students are given ground rules: read along as the story, "The Arrowsmith," isread aloud; when speaking, try to refer to the text; it's OK to pass; keep ontask; if you have a question or a comment, make a note to come back to it; you donot raise hands to speak; and speak up so that everyone can hear. <p>They read and discuss the text for some time and then stop to discuss the conductof the seminar. Ms. Leonard notes when they asked questions of each other, whichis normally considered the teacher's role. She suggests that she and Mr. Lacerwould like to cultivate that role in the kids. She points out how often they madetextual references, who dominated the discussion, and who was left out.<p>The students talk about how, as a result of hearing other kids' opinions, theyare learning more about the other kids in the room. They discuss how their ownopinions change as a result of points made by others, and they talk about whethereveryone should be involved, or whether it is OK for some to sit out thediscussion.<p>Tina enjoys the discussion and feels she has learned from it.<p><b>Earth Science.</b> Ms. Shea works with the kids in much the same way she didthe day before. Today they concentrate on time and direction as they relate tolongitude. She asks questions: "It is 3 p.m. at your location and twelve noon atGreenwich. What is your longitude?"<p>After a series of questions on longitude, they review latitude, and she handsout a lab sheet. She reads the directions on the handout to the students, peppersit with a few examples, and asks them to work with anyone they choose in order toget the answers absolutely correct. Mr. Tenner and Ms. Shea give help to groupsas they need it. Ms. Shea notes that this is a cut-and-dried section of the SBEE;they need to know this. <p><b>English 11.</b> Since Mr. Walters is attending a meeting, there is asubstitute. The substitute has asked the students to read silently and toindicate the pages on which they start and finish. Terry and Karen read <i>MyAntonia</i>. Terry opens the book at the beginning. He reads fourteen pagesduring the course of the class. Karen is nearly finished. The room remains quietthroughout the class period.<p><b>Social Studies.</b>  Ms. Francis reviews what should be included in their bookreports and when they are due. "I will be remarkably unsympathetic if you tell methe book was dull. You could have put it down and chosen another." Over theyears, she has compiled a list of books that she thinks make American history"sing." She expects each student to read at least one of these in hopes that whenthey forget the dates, they will remember the personalities. Then she reviewstheir next bit of work on the Constitution. Eventually, she begins a discussionwhich goes to the end of the period. She begins,<p><blockquote>Hofstadter said, and you also have indicated, that the authors wereremarkably down on people. Is that a fair statement? That they took a very dimview of human nature, don't find them very trustworthy? Is that a point of viewyou agree with, or do you think they are too hard on people?</blockquote><p>Terry:<blockquote> They already had one government that had kind of failed, andthey wanted to be sure that this one would work, and they had to be totallycautious.</blockquote><p>Another student:<blockquote> It seems to me that they felt that not everybody wasborn like some people were and you had to take into account thosepeople.</blockquote><p>Ms. Francis:<blockquote> Did they proceed on the assumption that everyone isdepraved? That everyone is going to abuse power if they have it? </blockquote><p>When students respond in the affirmative, she switches tack and asks, "But Ibelieve that mankind is good, and that he becomes abusive of power only whenprovoked. Isn't that a better stance from which to write a Constitution?"Although more boys than girls participate in the discussion, the students areattentive and many take notes. <p><b>Course 3 Math.</b> When Terry gets to math, he and the others settle in totake the test. Terry plugs away with a quiet, uncertain thoughtfulness. He bitesat hangnails, scrunches up his face, looks up, and then looks back down. Whenfinished, he reviews his work, crosses out work that he considers incorrect, andsays, "The fractions were easy. That was review. The circle stuff was veryconfusing; some were easy. The tangent stuff was easy. Questions 8 and 9 werevery hard. I had no clue."<p><b>Chemistry.</b> Mr. McDonough has taken another class on a field trip. Terryand his partner work on activities on a three-page handout with sections on themajor subatomic particles, their properties (like mass and charge), the discoveryof these particles, and several formulas. Terry finishes before the class isover, packs up, and talks about girls with his friends. <p><b>French 2.</b> Karen is called out of class by the vice principal, who ischecking on her absence the day before. Students roll through a variety ofactivities and add a spirited game of Viola, similar to Bingo. Winners arerewarded with a song. <p><b>Business Law.</b> Karen, absent yesterday, finds out that she has beenassigned a partner and has been given an article of the Constitution to research.She and her partner sit at a desk in the library for a few minutes. Without muchprior effort, she tells Mr. Frank that they cannot find anything. He gets a bookfor them and looks through the index to find other potential sources. He doesthis for several students and then directs them to investigate a few othersources. Karen gathers various bits of material, then sits and talks at the tablefor the remainder of the period. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr><a name="cws"><center><h2>Conversations with Students</h2></center><hr>During the week, when we talked with students, faculty members, parents, andadministrators, we discussed a range of issues with each group. One question weasked all the groups was whether students are using their minds well.<p>This year, because they knew us better, the students, without prompting, came totheir interviews with examples of their work, prepared to demonstrate the pointsthey wished to make. They were also more eager to talk than during our previousvisits.<p>They felt that the previous snapshots accurately reflected their conversationswith us and were appreciative that what they have to say is included in thesnapshots. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="gc"><h3>Grade-level Concerns</h3><p>Since the students primarily identify themselves by their grade level, they beganby discussing the specific concerns of their class. <p>The sophomores, no longer new to the school, see their own place in it moreclearly than last year. They said they are very excited about the homecomingbonfire, think that Student-Faculty Congress is moving along, and feel that theyhave grown up somewhat. They are frustrated at their inability to work togetheras a group. <p>For the second year in a row, the juniors noted that this year is harder than theone before. They said that several of their teachers, particularly in English andsocial studies, are pushing for deeper analysis and more work than before:<p><blockquote>In social studies, we are taking a much more realistic view,...looking at the way people thought and different ways you can view an issue. Ourteacher wants us to be better thinkers. She really knows the subject matter, andwhen you ask her a question, she answers it ... she tries not to skirt anyquestions.</blockquote><p><blockquote>Our whole class adopted the viewpoint that the Articles ofConfederation weren't working out and needed to be changed. So she adopted theviewpoint that was opposite. That forces us to understand our point of view.While we are going back and forth, we are learning about both sides, furtheringour understanding of one side, while completely learning about theother.</blockquote><p><blockquote>She wants us to get a deeper understanding beyond, "We dumped tea inthe water and then we fought the Revolution." She wants us to understand thesocial forces behind what happened. It was not just that everyone hated theBritish. Different social classes had their own reason for wanting to break awayfrom Britain. So the discussion is much more in-depth.</blockquote><p>The juniors appreciate when their teachers connect subject matter to currentevents. Given that this is an election year, Ms. Francis requires that they watchthe debates, and then in class, that they connect their reading about theConstitution with the positions of the candidates.<p>Their discussions are purposeful and require that students think hard, payattention, and come prepared. In this class, they are expected to read difficultmaterial, keep up on current events, examine historical documents, analyze them,and engage in thoughtful discussion. <p><blockquote>It is pretty challenging because she asks questions that she doesn'teven have answers to. She, like, puts them out on the floor and we discuss themand argue back and forth. And it is pretty hard, because the questions don't havea right or wrong answer and they are complicated.</blockquote><p><blockquote>It's good.</blockquote><p>Students said that Mr. Walters' English class is an equally stimulating class:"It is the kind of class I have looked forward to since I started high school.""It is different than asking us questions about exactly what happened, or whatthe book is saying. We don't have to think about those." A third studentexplained:<p><blockquote>What makes it different this year is that he asks these questionsabout our reading so that we have to think about the book a lot. Last night hegave us three questionsshort things like how the environment affected the peoplein <i>My Antonia</i>, and how the different cultures affected the people, and thepsychological effects of it all on them. You have to think more about it becauseit is not said in the book. </blockquote><p>They feel their reading skills are expanding because Mr. Walters asks them tolook for connections between what they are reading now and what they have readpreviously, and he asks them to be aware of literary allusions and classicalreferences. <p>Students remarked that although the feedback they get from Mr. Walters issometimes intimidating, it is also helpful. Their papers are covered with redwhen they get them back, but they can rewrite and rewrite them until they have afine piece of writing. The students said they are learning from Mr. Walters'class how to present an argument and how to support it.<p>In both of these classes, students find the level and quantity of the readingmuch more demanding than in previous years. While Mr. Walters openly states thathe could not change his teaching style to include group work or to match hisunderstanding of the Coalition Principles, the students believe that both his andMs. Francis's teaching exemplifies the Principles.<p>The students debated about whether these two classes follow the interdisciplinarytradition of earlier English-social studies partnerships. Some feel that now theconnections are better organized and clearer. Others think that, to their loss,the connections simply are not being made.<p>They feel more pressure this year as they prepare for the SATs. As one studentpoignantly expressed,<p><blockquote>I can't believe that I'm a junior already. Soon enough, I'm going tobe in college. It doesn't seem like that long ago I was in elementary schoolplaying tag, and now I'm a junior, looking at colleges.</blockquote><p><blockquote>Everything seems very different. This year, I'm thinking much morethan I was in my first two years.</blockquote><p><p>The seniors expressed enthusiasm about their final year; most are finding itchallenging and interesting. They are also in the midst of filling out collegeapplications and of retaking the SATs. Several mentioned that their parents arebothering them so much about which college to attend, and about getting goodgrades so that they can get into a good college, that they feel besieged. <p>The seniors described the Senior Options Program, the graduation requirementadded just this year. In this program, seniors will choose between doing anindividual project, conducting research on a particular topic, or maintainingtheir work in their regular classes. In any case, the seniors will make apresentation of their work to teachers, family, and friends at the end of theschool year. They will have release time from school during the second semesterand will work with one mentor teacher.<p>Only one of the seniors questioned the Senior Options Program; the rest arelooking forward to it: "It will be helpful because it will help us to learnsomething we're interested in. It will help us to explore a career." "It'sdifferent working for a grade and working on something for yourself. We get topick the topics ourselves. We'll work hard on things we pick." "It may bring outa whole new side of kids that nobody else here has ever seen, especially whenthey pick their own topics." <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="iaag"><h3>Issues Across Age Groups</h3><p>After listening to the students tell us of the issues that concern theirparticular grade level, we asked all of the students to tell us what they areworking on in their classes this year, when they feel that they are using theirminds well, and whether they see evidence of changes in the school. Out of theircollective responses, several issues emerge which cross age groups. <p>We have organized the students' responses to our questions according to theseissues: the fairness of tracking and the discrepancy between the kinds ofexpectations teachers have for students in different tracks, the ways mathematicsis taught, students' beliefs about their actual role in decision making, theirfeelings of being intimidated by teachers, the uneven quality of Seminars, theeffect of group work on their intellectual progress, the transitions in theschool's administration, and what it means to use one's mind well.<p><h4>Tracking and Teacher Expectations</h4><p>Whether the students are in SBEE and AP courses or not affects how they feelabout their capabilities as students. Since a number of AP courses have beenadded in recent years, students feel the competition keenly. <p>One student lamented,<p><blockquote>I dropped SBEE courses this year. I'm worried because I want to go tocollege, but I don't know if I can. But I couldn't get through it and I feel sostupid. </blockquote><p>(In a moment when her defenses are down, this student reveals how frightened sheis; at other times her attitude towards school is hostile, condescending, orbored.) <p><blockquote>"I feel bad this year because I am not an all-around good student,but my English teachers said I should be in AP English. Since I'm not in theother ones, I couldn't take this one." </blockquote><p><blockquote>"I don't know, but I think there are some kids that aren't inadvanced classes that can do the work, but they are not given the opportunity totry. So you never know if they can succeed in that."</blockquote><p>Another student who has always been in the advanced classes said, <p>"Advanced classes are biased in some way. I have really had no variety in thepeople in my class. Once you're an 85 student, you're always an 85student."</blockquote><p>Not fully understanding admissions requirements for AP classes, or why they arenot allowed into the advanced classes, is an issue for a number of students. <p>They turned to the differences in teachers' expectations in the various tracks.Because students compare notes, they are aware that a teacher can be interestingand stimulating when working with one track and less stimulating while workingwith another. One girl described a teacher in her class, which is consideredadvanced: "In our class, we get interesting reading assignments and discussionsevery day and field tripswe've gone to several events." A young man in a classfor general students said he has the same teacher: "We aren't doing any of that.We are reviewing for the SATs. Reading the book without any help from the teacheris not going to help me do better on that test." Two other students in his classacknowledged that the expectations in this class are much lower for them, too;they seldom actually have to do the work required because classroom discussionsare limited to factual recall of material read. When asked whether this makesthem resentful, they said that they have all known for a long time that whatclass you have makes the difference in what the teacher expects and that studentsdo not have the power to suggest to teachers that it should be different.<p><h4>Math Instruction: What Works, What Doesn't</h4><p>As it did during our previous visit to Oak Hill, mathematics surfaced as a topicfor discussion in itself. In particular, students remark on the differencesbetween teachers and teaching styles. <p>Several reported that they feel they are able to understand the work this yearbecause their teachers explain it well:<p><blockquote>This year, I pretty much understand math. I have the best teacherI've ever had in my life. He applies what you already know. He's around to helpafter school, and every example he brings back to what you know.</blockquote><p><blockquote>My math teacher goes over the homework. Then she goes over the newstuff and she does a "check" to see if we get it. Then we try out the newstuff.</blockquote><p><blockquote>If you did your homework wrong the night before, she gives you backan incomplete and you have to fix it and hand it in. If you get it back with asecond incomplete, you have to go to her after school. She really makes sure youknow everything.</blockquote><p>Other students said their teacher does not teach in a way to make mathsufficiently understandable for them: "WowI don't get math again this year. Theproblem is that my teacher just doesn't explain enough." <p>Students agreed that math instruction is most helpful when they receive immediatefeedback, as when a teacher explains a new concept or mathematical function,then asks them to practice the function, and then reviews their practice. "It'sbetter when we learn about something new first, then do it, and then go over it.It means that our math teachers have to be very organized." <p>At the same time, the students debated whether math can be taught differentlyfrom how it is taught now. <p><blockquote>The only way to learn math is to have the teacher stand up in frontof the room and lecture. Otherwise you're not going to learn anything. If shetold us to go off in a corner in groups, we could be there all day, and wewouldn't figure out a single thing. We have no choice but to have her stand upthere and lecture. </blockquote><p>Although several students agreed, one said, "I don't know. Math teachers havetaken so many math classes in college that they don't really see it the way wesee it. Maybe we could try some different ways to understanding [<i>sic</i>] it."<p>Another student said change is already evident in his class and is helping thestudents learn:<p><blockquote>Our teacher is kind of changing his ways. We are doing projects suchas building things, using compasses, estimating distances, using formulas, usingT measures. But we don't have an SBEE exam. We remember it better though.</blockquote><p>Another student worried about whether she really has to understand the conceptsor whether she just needs to be able to complete the assignment:<p><blockquote>We have been learning about some concepts that are pretty hard tograsp. We are talking a lot about infinity and how it relates to zero, and usinginfinity as a limit for series. Aaahhh!! It gets confusing; but even if you don'tcompletely understand it, I think it is still possible to do the problems. Iguess you need to decide how important it is to you to understand the idea, or ifyou simply want to be able to do the work.</blockquote><p>Because math requires abstract thinking, it is difficult for many kids. As theymove through the school, they experience several teachers' approaches to mathinstruction, some of which appear to be more helpful to them than others. When weasked them to explain further about whether math can be taught differently, thestudents responded uncertainly that their own ideas are only speculative and areperhaps based on teachers' opinions rather than on their own experience. <p><h4>Decision Making</h4><p>The debate we heard last time we visited about whether the Student-FacultyCongress is useful or not has disappeared. Students seemed to accept Congress asimportant and to recognize that the kids who complain about it are the kids whochoose not to participate. However, students debate about whether they are trulyinvolved in decision making in the school. <p>They cited two examples outside the school day that reflect the inconsistency intheir decision-making power: they feel that they were not involved in thedecisions about the homecoming pep rally, but that they <i>were </i>involved inthe decision to hold a homecoming bonfire. They felt extremely pleased about thereinstitution of the bonfire, and they felt to a large degree responsible for thedecision. The decision not to involve the students in the pep rally, on the otherhand, was unpopular among the students. <p>In classes, they generally do not feel themselves involved in decision makingother than in inconsequential decisions. "Sometimes we get to choose what we'llread." "We make decisions more about when we are going to do something than aboutwhether we're going to do it."<p>Several students suggested that they do not know enough to be involved indecisions about what they should cover in class: "I don't think that a lot ofpeople in our grade are able to make decisions. We don't know what is right forus."<p>They did not mention the idea that their interests could be a guiding force indecision making, although they suggested over and over again that when teacherspresent material or activities that are pertinent to their daily interests, itmakes a difference in their willingness to put forth effort.<p><h4>Feeling Intimidated</h4><p>Students talked seriously about feeling intimidated in their classes:<p>"My teacher called me a bimbo' and a space cadet.'"<p>"We don't want to participate in discussion because our teacher makes fun of usif we get the wrong answer."<p>"My teacher looked over my shoulder when I was trying to do a test problem and Icouldn't get it and said, We'll blow this up and label it "World's DumbestStudent".' I felt awful." <p>They acknowledged that it is at times hard to know when a teacher is kidding orwhen the kidding crosses the line, but they clearly appreciate humorespeciallywhen it is not at their expense. <p><blockquote>Our teacher said to us over and over again, "I can't believe youdon't know this." Everyone sat there stunned at how rude we felt she was being,and then she finally noticed it. It's really hard to answer a question in classif you know that if you get it wrong you're going to feel stupid.</blockquote><p>Several students suggested that they are unwilling to let teachers know when theyare lost because the teachers are not receptive "and take it as a personal insultto their teaching." Students said they feel powerless to intervene on behalf oftheir own learning when they believe that they will be ridiculed for theireffort. More of the examples of this nature come from female than from malestudents.<p><h4>Seminars </h4><p>During Seminars, which meet once a week for thirty minutes, students can work onclass projects and discuss issues which are pertinent to them. Seminars alsoprovide them with one teacher who knows them well outside a purely academiccontext. Their teachers change every year, so all of the kids have had at leasttwo Seminar teachers. This year, seniors are mentoring freshmen Seminars.<p>The students commented on what Seminars are like for them this year: "We talkabout what we want to do, which is helpful to our class." "In my Seminar, we talkabout issues that we really need to talk about." "In our Seminar, it is sodisorganized because everyone talks and argues, and our teacher is moreinterested in food than in helping us."<p><blockquote>I am really lucky because I am the Congress representative in myclass, and my teacher gets us all seated like we were doing a Socratic seminar,and I run the meeting. It works pretty good, but sometimes it is disappointingbecause other people don't listen. </blockquote><p>While in previous years students had told us either that Seminars were worthwhileor a waste, this time the kids suggested that the quality of their Seminarexperiences depends on the teacher. The kids noted that some of the teachers arepessimistic about what kids can do with their class projects. These teachers, thestudents said, indicate that they do not want students to undertake complicatedprojects because such projects would take more of the teachers' time than wouldsimpler projects. <p>Several students acknowledged that kids are frequently unwilling to cooperateduring Seminar. The students wondered when and how they will build their ownskills in collaborative decision making and in running meetings. Students in thetwo lower grades, especially, seemed to feel that they do not seem able toorganize themselves very well.	<p><h4>Group Work</h4><p>In recent years, there has been a growing belief that the skills of collaborationare very important for students to learn. As a result, a number of the teachersat Oak Hill encourage students to work in groups or teams. When the kids debatedthe value of group work, the majority of students suggested that it makes schoolmore interesting and that they learn from their friends. <p>They also mentioned the drawbacks of group work, one of which is the dilemmaabout equal workload: students do not like to carry the load of other students.Tina said that she wants to work with kids who were willing to hold up their endof the workload. Tim responded, "What you're saying is that everyone is just notup to your level." She answered, <p><blockquote>Last year I was grouped with someone who did not work. He told methat he was going to draw a picture of a mosque. He brought in a <i>scribble</i>the day before, and that night I had a lot to do. But I had to scurry aroundand get all this information, plus I had my other homework to do. We used hisartwork but added a film strip.</blockquote><p>The kids noted that teachers often pair stronger students with weaker students.Sam said, "You might not like how someone else is doing his part, but you have tolet them do it." Another student added, "I did a group project with someone whodidn't do his work, but I didn't do it for him, and he got it done."<p>Another drawback about group work is that, like any technique that is overused,it can create an unbalanced educational experience. <p><blockquote>Our teacher felt that if teachers in the school were made to breakstudents into groups of four to work, and then just walk around the room smiling,that the quality of education would go down. He felt that if it was your naturalstyle of teaching and you feel comfortable teaching in that way, then that'sgreat. But if you are forced to teach that way, you will lose your individualityas a teacher and become burnt out as a teacher.</blockquote><p><blockquote>This made me really think about the changes here. It really does getboring to hear for the millionth time, "OK, break up into groups and we're goingto work in teams." I realize that I've become so dependent on thinking thingsthrough with other people that it is sometimes hard to workalone.</blockquote><p>The debate continued about when it is useful to do group work. Students talkedabout wanting to do their math homework in groups, even though it is not part oftheir class routine. They also talked about how easy it is to fill in worksheetsin a group, because they can get them done faster and with less individualeffort. Also, when they have to make a presentation or organize something reallybig, it helps to have others' aid.<p><h4> The Administrative Transitions</h4><p>The final issue the students discussed is the administrative transitions at theschool. They feel very comfortable with the new principal and appreciate theeffort he has made to learn their names.<p>Several commented that the principal's and the vice principal's roles areswitched from last year. Mr. Goodman, the principal, is more like Mr. Oberman,the former vice principal, and Ms. Young, the new vice principal, is more likeDr. Brenner, the former principal. Few of the kids know Ms. Young well. Severalsaid they are irritated by her heightened vigilance concerning attendance.Students suggested that both of the administrators should make themselvesavailable to the students and should find ways to listen to their suggestions.<p><h4>What It Means to Use One's Mind Well </h4><p>When we asked students what it means to use one's mind well, they gave examplesfrom specific classes and attempt to define what it means. In French, they saidit is concentration. "In French, you really use your mind well. You have to eventhink in French to be able to get by, because she doesn't like talking English inclass."<p>In English, one student said, it is having the freedom to interpret an assignmentin her own way, while knowing that she will get feedback from an adult sherespects:<p><blockquote>I recently had a creative writing assignment to write about a weakcharacteristic. I wrote something about eating disorders, figuring that waspretty weak. I am very nervous about getting it back because my writing <i>really</i>matters to me because it is what I'm interested in, possibly even as acareer. Maybe. (Aaahhh, what stress deciding what to do with your life!) Anyway,I'm also nervous because at this point I really respect Mr. Walters' opinion onwriting, and writing matters to me! I work hard in there. </blockquote><p>It is the intersection of her interestwritingand of having a respected, helpfulaudience that motivates her.<p>Over and over again, the kids mentioned utilizing information in some meaningfulway as an example of using their mind well. They also said that reading is anintegral, but not sufficient, means of using their mind well. <p><blockquote>I think using your mind well is getting involved and learning foryourself. You should be able to analyze stuff and draw conclusions based on whatyou read and what you see, and be able to go somewhere with itnot just spit itback as what they wrote. You want to be able to say why they wrote itwhat kindof style they are using and characterization. To think deeper. When you have aconversation, to be able to sound somewhat intelligent, as opposed to justspitting stuff back.</blockquote><p><blockquote>I like it when you have to think for yourself. If the teacher said,"This is it," and you memorize it, you don't really think for yourself; theteacher thinks for you. When you're reading and the reading is complex, and youhave to put it together by yourself, that's better.</blockquote><p>Senior students suggested that using their mind well means reading toward a goalor relating something they are reading to someone or something else. They agreedthat they do not think they are using their minds well by studying for the SATs.<p><blockquote>A lot of us feel that we are little mice on a treadmill. We have torun through all these hoops and, like, it's just the thing we have to do. But itdoesn't really measure what we know. I know a lot of words, but most of themaren't on that test! </blockquote><p>Another student explained that she thinks she is using her mind well when she canuse what she has learned from her daily experience outside of school:<p><blockquote>My father and I, we totally do not see eye-to-eye in politics, and Iam debating with him and my uncle. I've watched both conventions, and I've readthe newspaper, and we're reading in school about how elections take place. I'mbetter informed than they are on most of the issues. I can really debate withhim, and I'll sit there until I'm able to prove my point! I also wrote a piecefor our school newspaper.</blockquote><p><p>One student gave another example of the power of utility: "In English we havevocabulary work. To learn the words, I write them on index cards. It's funnybecause when we walk through the halls, we try to use the words in a sentence.It's fun." A less enthusiastic student says, "I guess it's if I understand whatwe are talking about, but I don't always do that because I don't pay attention."Other less confident students believe that they are using their minds well whenthey know exactly what it is that they should be doing, or when there is slimchance that they will fail if they follow directions. <p>Each time we talk with students, we learn something more about what drives themto put forth conscientious and exceptional effort, as well as what discouragesand frustrates them. This fall, students suggested that what motivates them isgrappling with information gained in some meaningful wayfor example, throughthoughtful discussions in which application is expected and necessary. It is alsowriting for a respected audience, and it is using information gained in school intheir lives outside of school.<p>While these interpretations of what it means to use one's mind well are not newor surprising, they do provide an easy, clear measure of meaningful activity forstaff and students at Oak Hill. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr><a name="cwtf"> <center><h2>Conversations with the Faculty</h2></center> <hr>Our conversations with thirty-five teachers and seven administrators touched onmany issues, including the question of whether students at Oak Hill are usingtheir minds well.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="twtt"><h3>Talking with the Teachers</h3><p>At the beginning of our second year of working togetherthe sixth week of theschool yearthe Oak Hill teachers radiated that fresh hope that infuses schoolsacross the country in the fall. For the teachers, the new year holds promise andnew resolve. One teacher's hopes for the new school year are reminiscent of thebest January intentions: <p><blockquote>This year I am going to try to bring joy and hospitality to thosewithin my reach. I am going to provide as many opportunities for students toperform, to do, to learn all sorts of things. I am going to try to chitchat witha staff member I don't usually do that with. I am going to go to one game foreach sport. I am going to concentrate on a few strategies to improve theclassroom work of my students. I am interested in little groups, bigger groups,and whole class, and back and forth until we are all hooked into it as a worktool.</blockquote><p>During the week of our visit, the faculty gathered in groups or met with usindividually to discuss the school's ongoing effort to become a place wherestudents are increasingly enabled to use their minds well. Topics this timeranged over a number of issues: the staff's inattention to the two previoussnapshots, the staff's feelings about the nine Common Principles, their feelingsabout change in general, what teaming is like at Oak Hill, the staff'sperceptions of the administrative transition, and their feelings about Seminar.However, the major themes revolved around how teachers interpret what it meansfor students to use their minds well and what teachers hope for theirstudents.<p><h4>Using the Snapshots </h4><p>Teachers agreed that the staff have not yet used the snapshots which were writtenabout their school last year. While many people read them, they were never thetopic of collaborative inquiry or the focus of a faculty discussion. <p>There are several possible reasons why they have not used the second snapshot.First of all, the snapshot did not reach the staff until the very end ofschoolnot a fortuitous time. In addition, no provisions had been made for usingthe snapshots; people are still unsure of how, why, and when they might use them.Some people thought that the snapshots are really written for the researchers,not the faculty, to use. Other faculty suggested that people continue to say thatthey are willing to use the snapshots, but that when it comes to discussing them,they manage to hold the conversation at a superficial level. In this way, theyavoid discussions about what kids are really saying, what is going on inclassrooms, or what parents are saying, because it would necessitate morechange.<p>One teacher was unsure, as he was last year, about the benefit of interactiveresearch. He feels that since the first snapshot, when the research team changedsome of what they had written to accommodate the concerns expressed by staff,they are watered-down, less valuable pieces, that reflect back to the staff onlywhat they want to see about themselves. <p>Having information like the snapshots, which portray daily life in the schoolfrom multiple perspectives, is not common to any of the teachers' experience.While several people expressed interest in the possibilities that conversationsstemming from the snapshots might provoke, no concrete suggestions areforthcoming about how the snapshots might better be used by staff to fostergrowth and to provide support for the staff's efforts. <p><h4>The Nine Common Principles</h4><p>Similar to last year, there was almost universal agreement that the nine CommonPrinciples have not been discussed in any depth, but that the faculty has made acommitment to do that during the course of this academic year. (The faculty'sdiscussion of "using one's mind well," which it chose as the focus for a facultymeeting, appears below.) Two faculty members we talked to continued to believethat the vote to join the Coalition was falsified, that staff are notresoundingly in favor of implementing the ideas, and that they have not everlooked at them carefully. <p>The majority, however, suggested that an enormous leap in the staff's commitmentto the Principles occurred when Nancy Brenner left the building. Serving onhiring committees, the staff purposely hired administrators who would supporttheir work with the nine Common Principles, rather than try to redirect thefaculty. This hiring decision indicates that work with these Principles is now afaculty project instead of an administrative one.<p>More staff are coming to believe that they can no longer agree to disagree aboutthe nine Common Principles, because disagreement dissolves the potential for theschool's work. The staff hope that a thorough exploration of the ideas might helpthem to map a clear, coherent path to a better school. <p>Two teachers continued to mull over the possible application of "less is more."One suggested that she knows what it meansreducing the number of topics coveredso that students can develop a depth of understandingbut she cannot see thathappening in a "coverage world." Alta O'Malley said she still struggles with"less is more." Does it mean that they currently give students a smorgasbordlessabout more topicsso that students can choose what they want? Should teachersinstead serve pasta for everybody and hope the kids love it?<p>While the general conversation about the nine Common Principles is just emerging,people are grappling in their own classrooms with individual ideas embedded inthe Principles.<p><h4>To Change or Not...</h4><p>Mr. Walters was provocative in his skepticism about change:<p><blockquote>People will not observe a class's intellectual tone or its success inconveying ideas so much as they will judge the class by whether you're doingsomething that is in vogue. My concern about educational reform is that in someways it is having the wasteful effect of changing naturally talented left-handedwriters into right-handed writers. Does everyone have to be the same? It isimportant that you don't force people into things they can't do. It's absolutelyabsurd to teach from a weakness. Some people flourish in other modes. I haven'tbeen able to swim all my life for a very simple reason: I don't feel comfortablein the water. My goals have been the same in classes for a very long time. Ibelieve teaching is an occasionwhether it's communicating spirit, communicatingwork ethic, communicating mutual respect for people in class.</blockquote><p>At the same time, almost all the faculty members with whom we talked mentionedhow they are changing some aspect of their work with students. While individualsare trying various approaches, they seem to select only those techniques whichappear to have some promise and to be workable for them. <p>It is also apparent that some techniques appear to be migrating from classroom toclassroom. The science teachers are applying to have a lab component in theSBEEs. Mr. McDonough continues to have an oral exam in chemistry. Several otherteachers apply for waivers or changes in the SBEE requirements. A number ofteachers are taking a course on Socratic seminars and, as part of the course,trying them in class.<p>We noticed more classes than last year where students are responsible forteaching course material in presentations to their classmates. We saw that moreteachers are using writing as a learning technique. We read more student paperswhere kids are writing first-person narratives and/or adopting variousviewpoints. We note changing policies to increase student participation inphysical education. A number of teachers are expanding previous efforts toinclude more substantial Exhibitions, or final demonstrations, of what studentsknow and can do, as described in the nine Common Principles.<p><h4>Teaming</h4><p>While stimulating a smaller discussion than the other topics did, ourconversations with the faculty about teaming raised a couple of very importantissues. By working across disciplines, the staff hope to make connections forkids, but they also hope to provide students with a more coherent experience thanthey would have otherwise. Their comments indicate that they believe they areable to provide the kids with more powerful learning experiences because havingtwo teachers provides heightened expertise of the subject matter and a deeperunderstanding of the students than having one teacher does. <p>But working on interdisciplinary teams requires more time than the staff havenow. For instance, Jane Leonard and Tom Lacer found a quick forty-five minutesafter school so that they could debrief one another on the Socratic seminar theydid together. Ms. Leonard did for Mr. Lacer's facilitation just what she didwith the kids when we visited, pointing out where he allowed the discussion toswitch directions and where and how he intervened. She knew all the while thathe would be doing the same for her the following week when she facilitated theirother class. However, out of time, but not finished with his planning with Ms.Leonard, Mr. Lacer had to race off to coach the football game, while Ms. Leonardfinished the preparation for the next Seminar. Mr. Walters and Ms. Francis haveto schedule evening meetings to find adequate time. Ms. Michaels and Ms. Steinerpass drafts of potential units back and forth because their schedules seldomallow them common time. Each of the members of the teams suggested that theirability to strengthen this approach rests in the amount of time they find tobuild it. <p>Another central point is that staff defined <i>teaming </i>in terms of theirindividual experience. Not surprisingly, it appears that several differentdefinitions of teaming exist for staff. For some it means the time they spendwith others in their departments.<p>The math department said they are teaming when they work together to try tofigure out how to reduce the race to cover material, so that kids have moreadequate time to understand concepts. This is not an easy task for them, sinceexternal tests still set the curriculum.<p>The science department said they are teaming because they are working together onthe ninth-grade project and are also looking at the SBEE exams together.Administrators and counselors seem to be working more closely together than theydid previously. Teaming between resource room teachers and regular classroomteachers has also been powerful. Individual teachers often invite other teachersinto their rooms as specialists to provide particular expertise, but thisprovides less satisfaction to the invited quests than does ongoing teaming, as itis additional work with limited results or sustained effort. <p>For some, <i>teaming </i>means the kinds of collegial conversations they havealways had, which have little effect on individual teaching, curriculum, orassessment practices. For others, teaming means attempting to forge newrelationships in all of the areas mentioned above, and it requires a good deal ofchanged behavior. <p><h4>Administrative Transitions</h4><p>Teachers noted that the transition in leadership was generally off to a goodstart. There has been almost unanimous support for Esther Young's efforts to workon student attendance and tardiness. Some teachers feel that while the staff arein the midst of change, the administration's newcomers are working hard to catchup. "It's almost like we're a wave and they have to figure out how to ride alongwith us.<p>Several teachers noted that Jim Goodman seems to lack confidence in the faculty'sability to follow through on projects; he calls many meetings and wants toparticipate in the planning. Someone reminds the teachers that principals, liketeachers, have difficulty giving up control. While participatory decision makingis very important to them, staff hope that they and the principal will developskills to call lengthy discussion to a halt when further conversation no longerseems productive.<p>Faculty said they are pleased by the student response to the new administrators.They also feel a newfound sense of power in that faculty are running staffmeetings and taking a more active part in setting the agenda within the schoolthan before. Staff advise the administrators in the school to listen and to askquestions before setting a course of action.<p>There was nearly unanimous agreement that the advice from the staff that holdsthe biggest challenge is for the superintendent, Nancy Brenner. Several staffand administrators charge her with a much-needed proposal for a schedule whichwill allow them the kind of planning time they need. While staff are anxious tokeep going, they feel that they cannot strengthen their work without more time towork collaboratively. They also hope that she will visit the schools and holdopen-forum meetings for teachers in the district so that teachers and centraloffice administrators will work more closely than they do now, and so that therift which they feel has existed for years will not get rebuilt.<p><h4>The Need for Seminars</h4><p>For some teachers, Seminars seem to be an appropriate use of their time, becausethey can help teachers get to know kids better and provide kids with support. Thetopic of Seminars raises the question of whether kids today have lives thatrequire the extra support. Teachers at Oak Hill have varied opinions. Severalsaid they feel that kids are the same as they used to be but that the socialcontext has changed: today there is diminished family stability, TV, moreinformation, and more opportunities than in the past. Some believe that kids arebetter prepared for school than kids used to be: they are better writers and moreknowledgeable about the world. Several staff talked about the fact that some kidsdo seem to be differentdisengaged, disinterested, alienated, and unreachable.All, however, agreed that because of the diminishing family structures, kidsneed more support. <p>For others, Seminars are of more questionable value. Two teachers suggested thatSeminars need to be reviewed, clarified, and better understood by all of thestaff. Others said that their purpose is not clear.<p>Still others feel that teachers should not have additional responsibility forchildren beyond their disciplinary training. This view was countered by thebelief that if teachers rely on their disciplines alone, they will not be able topull the kids in, keep them there, or keep them going.<p>Senior Seminar teachers appear to be real advocates of the kids. They preparekids for their senior projects and have increased responsibility for helping thekids to select a topic and a mentor teacher. The seniors are enthusiastic, theteachers said, and are looking forward to a year-end evaluation.<p>Seminars continue to be a source of discussion and some controversy. At the heartof the controversy is the question of teachers' primary responsibilities inschools. Is it to teach subject matter or is it to teach kids? <p><h4>Teachers' Goals for their Students </h4><p>When we asked teachers what they wanted their students to gain as a result of thework they were doing in class, we heard the following: <p>Mr. Lacer:<blockquote> I'd like them to understand cultural diversity... tounderstand that current third world countries have rich histories. I'd like thekids to make connections between the problems of those countries and othersthey've studied and ours.</blockquote><p>Ms. Shea:<blockquote> I'd like to help kids break down their erroneouspreconceptions about science. </blockquote><p>Mr. Nelson:<blockquote> Understand the concepts. It isn't enough for them to justmemorize formulas. They have to know what they mean, what they cando.</blockquote><p>Mr. McDonough:<blockquote> I want my kids to be competent in chemistry when theyget to college. </blockquote><p>He explained that while they do not need to be chemistry majorsthere are few ofthosethey need to be able to get through their basic requirement courses.<p>Ms. Leonard:<blockquote> I want to teach kids the value of reflective processes.I want them to learn about the reader/writer relationship.</blockquote><p>Ms. Steiner:<blockquote> I want kids to understand universal models, likerevolution. I want them to gain a voice. I want them to move away from lookingfor right/wrong answers to the consideration of bigger questions, moralissues.</blockquote><p>"We want kids to feel competent in another language!" say the language teachersin unison, and then one explains, "I want the kids to understand their place inthe world, and to be able to communicate with others."<p>Ms. Thompson:<blockquote> I'd like them to feel confident to see themselves inbroader possibilities in a global economy.</blockquote><p>Mr. Walters:<blockquote> Obviously, since we're doing this interdisciplinaryconnection, we'd like the students to make the natural associations between theliterature and the history of the country, and I want these kids to be moremature, to know that how they present their work matters. I have a commitment tomake them more verbally literate in speech and in writing. I want them to read asmuch as possible. Kids don't read sufficiently. </blockquote><p>A number of teachers seconded this assertion.<p>Ms. Francis:<blockquote> I'd like the kids to read and use that as a basis fordiscussion, to undergird their thinking. I'd like them to be able to analyzedocuments for meaning. I want them to be able to connect history withcontemporary events. When they go away, I want them to be more analytical so thatthey are better able to cope with the next set of social scienceproblems.</blockquote><p>Ms. O'Malley:<blockquote> In AP biology, I want them to have a comprehensiveunderstanding of a college biology program as described by the textbook we areusing. I hope they'll work well together and find the material exciting. Inmarine biology, I'd like to have them get pleasure out of the course so that theydon't think that science is impossible to do, and in the SBEE courses, I'd likethe kids to pass with confidence.</blockquote><p>Consideration of what staff want for their students suggests the very old dilemmaabout what is central to teaching and learning: for some teachers, the curriculumas it currently exists is at the center of the discussion; for others, the focusis on what students can do. <p><h4>Focusing on Using One's Mind Well</h4><p>The staff at Oak Hill established earlier that a focus of their collaborativework for the year would be an in-depth exploration of the nine CommonPrinciples. To that end, a faculty meeting took place to determine how theywould begin to explore the Principles. We present a description of that meetingas well as a discussion among a few of the faculty that continued theconversation later in the week .<p>At the Faculty Meeting. Caroline Theil and Ken Field ran the meeting, which washeld in the music room after school. Jim Goodman took a seat among the crowd. Acouple of teachers and the vice principal were not at the meeting. <p>Caroline called the meeting to order and made several suggestions: They coulddiscuss them as a whole group, they could divide up into groups and takeresponsibility for individual Principles and report back, or they could divide upinto small groups to discuss each principle. Everyone in turn said what they wantto do. Several other suggestions surfaced: use index cards, work in smallgroups, work as a whole group. <p>Questions emerged for the staff: What is the purpose of the activity? Do we wantto know what they mean for us? For students? What are we going to do with thisinformation? The comparative advantages of small-group and whole-groupdiscussions surfaced. Mr. Walters wondered about how the Principles apply indifferent disciplines and also wondered whether faculty could, anymore, agree todisagree about the Principles.<p>They talked about how long to focus on each Principle. Jane suggested that eachmight take two hours; Caroline thought that two hours was too long. Jane saidthey are treating the Principles like an overfull curriculumtrying to coverthem. Eventually, they took a vote: seventeen wanted whole-group discussionsessions, and eleven wanted small-group discussions. Those in favor ofwhole-group discussions won, and they began on the first Principle. Again therewas discussion about how they intended to do this. The conversation wasinterspersed with laughter; the tone was friendly but earnest. What about aretreat? What about using the two hours available on Superintendent's ConferenceDay? <p>Finally they decided to go around the room so that everyone could define what itmeans to them for students to use their minds well. The following are definitionsthat the faculty gave:<p> <ul> <li>	Thinking and feeling deeply aboutworthwhile ideas. <p><li>	Judgments, analyze, think. <p><li>	Demonstrate critical thinking, read something controversial and defendone's position.<p><li>	Stimulate questions in a direction moving ahead. <p><li>	Using mind well enough to adapt to our system. <p><li>	Do something creative; it may not come out with something should come outwith. <p><li>	Mistakes, learn why you made an error and what you can do to improve. <p><li>	Express themselves more than memory and recall. <p><li>	Questions reflecting insight and broadness, putting things in their ownwords and actions.<p><li>	Finding answers for oneself. <p><li>	Plan time use. <p><li>	Really delving for the right answer. <p><li>	Using other sources. <p><li>	Divergent thinking, making connections, establishing relationships. <p><li>	Persistence, not getting good grades on tests. Not an end in itself. <p><li>	Moral valuestolerance. <p></ul>After the go-around, a brief exchange ensued:<p>Mary:<blockquote> Are we using the right measurement? Tests should reflect thatkids use their minds well.</blockquote><p>John:<blockquote> Tests, any types of tests, give you some kind of information.</blockquote><p>Mary:<blockquote> In French, if the kids conjugate a verb, is that using theirmind well?</blockquote><p>The exchange moved to asking what constitutes using one's mind well in a foreignlanguage course: knowing grammar or being able to speak well?<p>With the time nearly over, Caroline suggested, "I'd like to suggest that we thinkabout it between now and Superintendent's Conference Day. We jot down when we arepreventing kids from using their minds well."<p>Jim Goodman said, "How about the positive? What are we doing that helps kids?"<p>"We could collect information from the kids." <p>They then moved on to the next itemwhat they might do to improve behavior duringassemblies. <p>In the morning, teachers found a one-page, provocative memo from Emily Francisabout using one's mind well. She made the point that people can use their mindwell for nefarious ends. She said she hopes that at Oak Hill they will helpstudents develop the ability to use their minds well to positive ends.<p>In the faculty room, teachers discussed both the meeting and her memo beforegoing to class. The general feeling was that the staff meeting went very well;staff ran it, and they had begun something they all wanted to do.<p>A Follow-up Discussion.</b> Later in the week, a small group of teachers extendedthe discussion. <p>Caroline:<blockquote> John and I had a student who did very well on tests becausehe knew how to study for those. But he didn't have any mastery. His score on theAP [test] was low. He's taking pre-calc in college because he couldn't pass theplacement exam. He scored 100 on every SBEE exam he took. He's at a top IvyLeague school, and he got in because of those scores. I never did feel that heused his mind well. Grades should never be an example of using one's mindwell.</blockquote><p>John:<blockquote> I went in and saw the exhibition in Caroline's class. Hisperformance was almost non-existent when there was a question. I said to her thenthat there wasn't a chance for this kid in calculus. I told him, "Jim, you can'tmemorize this test. This is not like the SBEE." Using your mind well really comesdown to the questioning aspect of it: What do you know? What comes next? Whatthings do you visualize, see, hear?</blockquote><p>Warren:<blockquote> He was unable to apply anything in a real life situation. Wehad another student that year who was number three in his class, and he couldalways apply it.</blockquote><p>John:<blockquote> The accepted standards, those tests, are out there. The kidsknow they count. I don't blame the kids for studying like hell to do well onthem. </blockquote><p>The teachers proceeded to give evidence from their classes of kids using theirminds well. <p><blockquote>"It's persistencea kid who comes back again and again to get aconcept down."</blockquote><p><blockquote>In my class, when kids are working in groups, and one kid is tryingto change the minds of the othersthe whole group is involved then and they arethinking. I can be standing there and they don't know I'm there.</blockquote><p>Several examples surfaced of kids' inability to use their minds well. <p>John:<blockquote> Some kids are willing to try things. It's a most interestingdifference between kids. Others say, "Just show me. Just tell me what todo."</blockquote><p>Bill:<blockquote> Is it because they are lazy or because the system has trainedthem up that way? </blockquote><p>Warren:<blockquote> Take oligopoly. I asked them how it would apply in sports asopposed to a monopoly. And they couldn't answer it.Now, was the question too tough? Didn't they do their reading? I had to gothrough a whole explanation.</blockquote><p>Bill, ribbing him half seriously:<blockquote> Maybe you should have just shut upand said, "OK, talk to one another until you figure this out."</blockquote><p>Caroline stated that she does not think that it is possible that all kids will beable to use their minds well. "It's not a question of ability, but a question ofwill. If I could reach 65 percent of the kids in my class, I would bethrilled."<p>Warren:<blockquote> Are schools as they are organized set up to help all kids tolearn to use their minds well? Or have we set up an institution which reallyallows them and encourages them to sit and say to us, "Tell me." What are weinstitutionalizing here?</blockquote><p>Caroline:<blockquote> Obviously, standardized testing does not help them, wouldyou agree?</blockquote><p>Nodding their agreement with these comments, the group then acknowledged thatthere has been movement from their discussions last year, when they indicatedthat the SBEE was a fair measure of kids' achievement. <p>While this was clearly an unfinished conversation, the contrast between the largegroup and the small group suggests that how teachers define what it means forstudents to "use their minds well" reveals itself slowly through examples ofstudents' experiences and disappointments and through personal reflections,more than it does from a go-around. While the faculty suggested that this is theeasiest and the least controversial Principle, it provokes interestingcomparisons between current practices and desired outcomes. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="twa"><h3>Talking with Administrators</h3><p>The district experienced substantial administrative turnover during the year. Inaddition to the change in the superintendency and the high school principalship,the elementary principal's contract was not renewed, so Howard Jones, director ofstudent services, moved into that position until a principal was hired inNovember.<p>We know from experience that such turnover can wreak havoc on changes under way.2Visits with the administrators in the high school and at the central officeindicated that the district is busy establishing that change is afoot throughoutthe district.<p><h4>At the High School</h4><p>Both Jim Goodman, the principal, and Esther Young, the vice principal, claimedto be thrilled to be at Oak Hill. Both come with lengthy teaching andadministrative experience in a variety of settings. Both feel that theycomplement each other, as their styles and strengths are quite different.Delighted with the small size of Oak Hill, both like the students and staff verymuch. Both expressed appreciation of the work which is under way at the school.<p>Esther projects a friendly, efficient, and able demeanor. She laughs easily,takes a moment to reflect before she responds, and values her colleagues. Sincearriving at Oak Hill, Esther has been trying to respond to faculty concerns aboutattendance and tardiness, while at the same time working towards clarifyingwhat the nine Common Principles mean when translated into action by visiting withteachers and working in their classrooms. She expressed her view of thePrinciples:<p><blockquote>The Principles are what any good teacher would come to naturally.There is nothing profound or earthshaking in them. The strength in them comesfrom the framework which they provide. Usually we just see the pieces, but thePrinciples take the pieces and give a whole picture. </blockquote><p>That overall framework which guides Oak Hill's work is what makes it differentfrom the last school in which she worked, where individual departments forgedtheir own goals. <p>Esther finds watching teachers work with the Principles fascinating because itreveals a good deal about students. In Alta O'Malley's biology class, she watchedstudents struggle to find answers which Alta wanted them to pursue on their own.<p><blockquote>One student had a different answer than three or four others, but shewas convinced she was right. Watching her, you could see that she had a long wayto go before she developed into a scientist, because of her need to hang on toher original ideas and her inability to question her findings. The importantthing was that Alta didn't impose an answer on them. Nor did she make them cometo any conclusion. She could have told them all of those things, but she didn't;she allowed their minds to work.</blockquote><p><p>Esther expressed enthusiasm about the shared decision making at the school andsees Congress as one of "the glories of the school." She learned the hard waybya miscommunication about the homecoming pep rallythat no issue isinsignificant to the students at Oak Hill and that they value theirdecision-making capacity.<p>The new principal is a tall, lanky man in his fifties. He grins easily, stoopingjust a bit as he walks the halls, visits with teachers, and works with parents.He is a man who communicates a deep love for young people and believes ferventlyin their capacities. He said, in fact, that the students in the school are hisgreatest support.<p>After working in a very large, bureaucratic high school, where his majorresponsibilities were policing students and getting various factions to stopcomplaining, working at Oak Hill is a special delight. He did not have to beginby selling any new ideas or approaches to the faculty. He did not have to workhard to get them to work together. He found that his predesigned system forworking with teachers on their goals was a little mechanistic, since most ofthem knew what they were working on already. His role, he finds, is not one ofpushing change, but of flowing with it and "nudging" it along. <p><blockquote>What I find very nice about my role here is that, unlike theprofessional literature of the eighties, which placed an overemphasis on theinstructional leadership of the principal, there is a stronger sense of acommunity of learners here, and the principal becomes a part of that. I find thatmy job is less to cheerlead than it is to help people think about their personalhistories, to understand how their experiences are related to what people aretrying to do here.</blockquote><p>Jim suggested that there is plenty to do in the school; he certainly does notfeel that his responsibility is to sit back and watch. <p><blockquote>I'm not sure that kids' experiences in this school are very differentyet. I don't think we've even come close to understanding where kids are andtaking hold of that, and shaping learning and instruction so that students grabahold of it. I think the Senior Options Program is going to be where we're goingto see what all that means, because we'll see students going out in directionswhich we have never seen before. It will force us to look back and ask whether wehave been doing the kinds of things we should be doing.</blockquote><p>Jim reveled for a moment in the fact that the faculty were so supportive of thenew Senior Options Program. <p><blockquote>I had moments of real anxiety: Would the faculty go along with it?Would they support it? Would they be mentors? Unfounded worry! Practically everyfaculty member signed up to be a mentor. That's another thing I've learned aboutbeing in a changing school. Teachers do not work simply to the contract. Theyextend themselves. They want to see results for the kids. Our job, Esther's andmine, is to make sure that the basics are taken care ofthat the school is clean,in good working order, that kids are here so that theyteachers and kidscan geton with their work. It is also our job to act on their decisions quickly,expeditiously, so that they continue to be willing to extendthemselves.</blockquote><p><p>As well as focusing on the students, Jim and Esther have been conscientiouslyworking with parents. Besides working with senior parents on the Senior OptionsProgram and Back to School Night, they organized a meeting for ninth-gradeparents on the issue of grouping, and were reminded that every year they musteducate new parents who come into the school. The counselors hosted an eveningfor parents on college admissions procedures and financial aid. Over half theparents in the class attended. <p>Jim also reveled in the fact that he is in the midst of a set of complementaryrelationships. He and Esther, he and Nancy, and he and the faculty bring togetherdifferent strengths. Still, he has one overriding concern: <i>time</i>. He'shopeful that all together, they will be able to "tackle the issue of time so thatteachers have time to work together and so that kids leave their classes saying,I really like working with that person.'" He continues,<p><blockquote>We need to find ways of creating interactions among adults and youngpeople which can really, truly be humane, while fostering learning. Then, we needto foster student-to-student relationships where we turn their affiliation intosomething that gets them involved in serious intellectualendeavor.</blockquote><p><h4>At the Central Office</h4><p>Nancy Brenner is settled into the central office, located in the district'selementary school. She said that she misses both staff and students at the highschool, but that she is making new friends with the students at the elementaryschool. She has taught in several elementary classrooms while the students doSocratic seminars, and claims it is a treat. For the beginning of the schoolyear, she chose to stay clear of the high school so that the new administrationhad a chance to coalesce. <p>There have been no dull moments in the central office. She has been workingclosely with Howard Jones, who is back in the central office as director ofstudent services, after several months as the interim elementary principal.Howard, she said, "did a glorious job of bringing peace to a pained school."	She has been thinking through how the district builds a coherent K12experience. This is a challenge most districts across the country have nottackled. Nancy thinks that it is essential. She has been working with both theelementary school and the middle school to help them think through their programsand future directions. She organized a course on Socratic seminars for teachersin the district and is working with the district curriculum committee while theyfinish mapping curriculum in the various disciplines, which she feels will be avaluable tool for all three buildings.<p>She has been working with the school board to set a districtwide direction, andrecently hosted an evening for community members to learn more about theCoalition and the New Partners for Better Schools (NPBS), the two partnershipswhich she feels will provide support for their work. She invited all present andpast board members, business leaders, and parents and ran the program on cabletelevision. At the same time, she is maintaining close contact with thoseworking on the NPBS, in hopes that they will find ways to support the district'swork.<p>Howard suggested that the district's mainstreaming plan is working very well andis perhaps a good indicator of the kind of coherent plan that is possible forK12. He observed that the high school took an enormous jump in acceptingleadership for the change work at the school. He also nudges Nancy by remindingher that activities like districtwide curriculum mapping will result in fluff,unless something is done with the information. Another fortuitous partnership...<p>After the initial settling-in, Nancy hopes to spend Wednesdays in the schools. Inher speech on Superintendent's Conference Day, she clarified her hopes fordistrict faculty and staff: <p><blockquote>The Coalition asks of us simply that we become a reflective learningcommunity that doesn't tinker around the edges, but looks at the very essence ofour practice and student results and asks, "How can it be better?" This questionis fundamentally different from those which ask whether or not we are adequatelypreparing kids to take surprise tests handed down by external agencies, whetherthey be the SATs or the SBEEs. We have to hold students to a higher standard, butwe must also take more responsibility for creating those standards.</blockquote><p>She knows very well that asking questions like these means thateveryoneadministrators, teachers, students, and parentsmust examine currentinteractions and common practices. She emphasized that in order to build alearning community, the members of the community must break down the barriers ofisolation, so that there is no longer a superintendent alone in her office and ateacher alone in his or her classroom. Relationships among the staff need to betransformed into a more public and collaborative, critical friendship. <p>As she reflected on the high school, she noted that faculty still see Seminar asa vehicle for taking care of business rather than as an essential part of thedevelopmental care for students. <p><blockquote>I see it as a place where kids should feel free to talk aboutimportant issues, beyond a gripe session. They have to develop the skills andtrust to do that. And, they need an adult who knows them well to helpthem.</blockquote><p><blockquote>I hoped that the adults would know the kids well enough so that theywould know the little hooks that bring each of the kids in. It is soimportanteven in a small school. So far, we are not there yet. </blockquote><p>She suggested that after the faculty have reviewed the nine Common Principles,there are three other essential questions faculty and staff might tackle thisyear: "(1) What is it we value for students? (2) What kind of schedule will servefaculty needs? (3) What will make Seminars worthwhile?" Answers to thosequestions will certainly have ramifications for her role and for districtresources which she is committed to providing.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr> <a name="twtp"><center><h2>Talking with the Parents</h2></center> <hr>On Monday evening, a group of parents came together to discuss the changes theschool is attempting to make and the effects of these changes on their children.Everyone began by noting that it is a new year and that, for the most part, thekids have new teachers.<p>Parents then described how they and their children feel about school this year:"The school must be doing something right. My son is happy, feels enthusiasticabout school."<p><blockquote>My son is a junior and is taking French again. He was talking to hisgirlfriend who goes to a private school. My son said that he knew French so wellthat he could speak it for an entire class period without speaking English. Shewasn't even close to that caliber of mastery.</blockquote><p><blockquote>My daughter is a senior and doing well this year. She is not as naiveas she was a year ago; she's beginning to see the whole picture. She's takinghumanities, and they are going to plays; they do a lot of visual arts and theyare reading. She's putting a lot of the human pieces together, connecting classesshe's taken before.</blockquote><p><blockquote>My son is taking an AP class for the first time, and he is devotingreal time to his work. He says he feels his writing is better than anything he'swritten or thought before.</blockquote><p><blockquote>My daughter is a senior. I remember when she came here, and teacherswere shifting gears a bit and teaching a bit differently. They wanted the kids toanswer their own questions, and Nancy did not like that a bit.</blockquote><p><blockquote>She's a kid who can listen to a song and sing it a week later. And itburns me up when she sings fifties songs that I can't remember the words to, andshe can even though she's only heard it once! She is blessed with that kind ofmemory. She was accustomed to being able to regurgitateinformation.</blockquote><p><blockquote>All of a sudden she was being asked to think a little bit and seekout different answers. I said, "Well, that's the way it goes because that's reallife. No one, when you get out of school and into a career, is going to give youinformation that they then want you to repeat back to them. They don't need youfor that." She has adapted and has done very well.</blockquote><p><blockquote>My daughter failed mathematics last year. This year she is taking itagain from the same teacher. Shouldn't kids be allowed to take it from adifferent teacher? Part of the reason she failed was that she couldn't learn fromthat teacher.</blockquote><p><blockquote>My son is a dependent learner. He is somewhere between collaborativelearning and copying his friends' work. I wonder how much of the collaborativelearning helps him to learn.</blockquote><p>Four major issues emerged during the course of a lengthy and varied conversation.Parents discussed what it means for their kids to use their minds well, whetherparents feel involved in decision making in the school, how the transition inleadership is going, and whether AP courses are helping or hindering kids in theschool.<p><h4>Are the Kids Using Their Minds Well?</h4><p>When discussing what it means for their kids to use their minds well, parentsreminded one another that last spring they cited a number of examples from theirchildren's classes. This year there are new examples. A parent of a specialeducation student who is now mainstreamed shared her delight that her son ishappier than he's ever been. "He loves applied physics and history. He is readingwith greater understanding than he has before." <p><p>Other mothers gave positive examples or expressed their concerns:<p><blockquote>My son's social studies class is trying to deal with the aftermath ofthe Civil War and Reconstruction. I recall him speaking with someone else tryingto look at what happened in this era from the point of view of a black person,someone from the North and someone from the South. At the same time he is reading<i>Huck Finn </i>in English.... One of the things he said that was a teacher'sdream, a mother's dream, was, "I'm starting to be able to see why goodwriterswhat they do that makes them good writers. What makes a classic aclassic."</blockquote><p><blockquote>I'd like to see the kids read critically. They are certainly readingin English, but I don't think they're really delving into it in the depth thatI'd like to see. As adults, when we read books and talk to our friends about thebooks we're reading in passing, we evaluate and we give information about it.They don't do that yet. They are still focused on what the teacherwants.</blockquote><p><blockquote>My daughter is graphing certain mathematical functions on thecomputer. I think this is good because it is relating something that she thoughthas no use with something that is very contemporary.</blockquote><p>The conversation turned to a discussion of the research paper as an indicator ofusing one's mind well. A father said, <p><blockquote>I am distressed that Nancy has not yet had to do a major researchpaper, and she's a senior in high school. I know a kid who's now a freshman atOberlin who spent much of his senior year working on a research paper. He endedup using libraries in the city. I'm really concerned here that teachers aretrying to fit the Coalition Principles into their actions and have forgottenabout this very critical area. I don't think that she's learning how to uselibraries, how to find information, how to find answers. I think she had moreresearch paper experience at the middle school. </blockquote><p>The parents thought back over a range of assignments, but none matches what thisfather was talking about: an interdisciplinary investigation that requiresmultiple sources, maybe interviews, and that forces the kids to move beyond theschool's library, their textbooks, and the novels they are reading.<p>Parents of seniors suggested that the new senior project might fill the bill, andthey explained it to the rest of the parents:<p><blockquote>They will have a choice of an internship, a project, a team project.They will have release time from school where they will be on their own to do thework. They'll be keeping a log and working with a mentor teacher who will guidethem and make sure that they are doing what they are supposed to be doing. Then,they will make a presentation and present a paper. I just wish it wasn't left tothe end.</blockquote><p>Another parent added, "It's to get rid of senior-itis.' It's to give them ameaningful transition between high school and whatever they are going to donext."<p>There was general enthusiasm for this new development. Feeling that they havebeen involved in shaping the project, the parents of seniors explained theorganization in great detail. <p>A debate ensued about the meaningfulness of the "old" research paper as they knewit:<p><blockquote>I'm not sure what the goal of a research paper is. Is it thegathering of information to be connected to some practical use on the part of theperson gathering the knowledge, or is the outcome the paper? If a kid is buildinga boat, he has to gather a lot of information and connect it all up as he goesabout his project. </blockquote><p>The father was not convinced that his daughter will have acquired the skill ofgathering information from multiple sources and synthesizing it by the time shegraduates high school. The parents did agree that the research skills should notbe overlooked in the high school. <p><h4>Parental Involvement in Decision Making</h4><p>As the focus turned to their involvement at the school, one mother said, <p><blockquote>I guess I don't feel that from year to year, that I've been involvedin whatever process is going on here. I think it's been a process that theteachers and administrators have been involved in, but we're observers of ourchildren in that process.</blockquote><p>"I feel the same way," said another. "Maybe if we went to board meetings?"<p>A parent who is on the board responded, <p><blockquote>No, I don't think the board is the medium that you're looking for. Iknow because I feel, in many ways, the same way. The most remarkable example ofa decision-making meeting was when we all came together to answer the questionabout what we wanted our kids to know and be able to do when they leave Oak HillHigh School. Remember?</blockquote><p>"Yes, we made lists of the characteristics we wanted them to have and thentrimmed them."<p>"And our list matched the teachers' list, which was so interesting." (NancyBrenner conducted an evening seminar for parents to do this activity, one thatteachers had already completed. It enabled both parents and teachers to come tosome agreement about where they were headed.) <p>"Once you've experienced something like that, which is true involvement,everything else pales in comparison." <p>Another parent said that it would be nice to have time to work with and talk tothe teachers: "Do they discuss all of this change? Do they agree that these arethings that they're going to work towards?"<p>The parents listed the meetings that have been held for parents this year: Backto School Night, which they described as the best ever because the teachersseemed so energized, a get-acquainted evening for the ninth-grade parents, theSenior Options Program meeting, and an upcoming meeting on grouping.<p>While appreciative, another suggested, "I'd like to see some kind of retreatwhere teachers and parents could discuss these issues together." The othersagreed. They said they want a session where they talk together about what theschool is doingnot a session where teachers tell parents what they think orwhere parents tell teachers what they think, but a collaborative workingsession.<p><h4>Administrative Transitions</h4><p>The conversation moved to the various changes in the administration's leadership.There was general agreement that the transition is off to a good startthat thenew administrators have been carrying the changes forward, that the new principalis developing positive relationships with the kids, and that the new viceprincipal has a tough row to hoe, since the retiring vice principal was so wellloved.<p>One parent said, "The kids feel that there is more of a chance to be heard thisyear, that their opinions count for more." The reinstitution of the homecomingbonfire, which the students had wanted, went a long way in making kids feel moreempowered than they were. Another reflected, <p><blockquote>I'm a little worried. It seems odd to me that in terms of ourpartnership with the Coalition, we've got the teachers who are now the veteransand the administration are the rookies. It used to be the other way around. So, Ifeel a little uncomfortable; I don't have any reason to, but I do. Does that makesense?</blockquote><p>When asked what kind of advice they might give to the new administrators, theparents had a couple of suggestions. <p><blockquote>I would like to see the rest of the gradesnot just the seniorsgo inthe direction of more hands-on, problem-solving, long-term, interdisciplinarywork rather than work focused on covering the curriculum to take the SBEE, andregurgitating answers and reading textbooks. I'd like to see more collaborationbetween the teachers and across the subjects.</blockquote><p><blockquote>I'd like to encourage the teachers and the administration to give thekids more respect and responsibility that goes along with that kind of long-termproject. While it is true that they are the kids and we are the grownups, I thinkthat those lines have been drawn in the school to the disadvantage oflearning.</blockquote><p>Another parent added, "Yes, if we're going to ask them to do the senior project,I think that we have to give them the chance to make decisions for themselvesearlier."<p><h4>AP Courses and Tracking</h4><p>The conversation took another turn as the group agreed that they are in favor ofdoing away with SBEE exams. They believe that those tests force coverage ratherthan substantial learning and skill development. One of the parents raised thequestion of whether AP courses are problematic in the same way that SBEE coursesare: "Do you all remember Sam Keyes? He was exceptionally bright. He took APphysics here, went off to college and enrolled in the next level of physics. Hewas way over his head and had to drop it."<p>"But doesn't AP provide kids with better classes? Enriched?" asked another. Oneof the parents answered:<p><blockquote>Look at the history of AP courses. We started them to make up fordeficiency in regular classes. If regular courses are taught properly, we may notneed to cram these down kids' throats. My son is in two AP courses right now. Ican see what's going on. He's covering material as fast as he can. It'sfrustrating in light of the kinds of experiences he's had in otherclasses.</blockquote><p>"But aren't AP courses designed to provide students with the extra challenge?"<p>"That's what it <i>was </i>intended for. But the exams in many cases force justmore of the coverage stuff. That takes the teachers' opportunity to experimentwith projects away."<p>Another mother said, <p><blockquote>Sometimes I think that the expectations for kids are just set, and ifthey are not met, teachers don't go after the kids. They set the expectations andleave the kids to sink or swim. That doesn't really push the kids. Pushing ispart of motivation. I think good teachers have to be willing to go out and trynew things, reflect on them carefullywhether they will make things better forkidsthen they should go for it. </blockquote><p>There is agreement in the group that they want high expectations for all, notjust some, of the kids, and that they want meaningful measures of whether thekids are using their minds well. A mother concludes, <p><blockquote>You really have to be able to see the work that a child can do. Achild should be able to design something that they can show me, and within thedesign, they can show the organization and the ability to draw from a variety ofsources. A child should be able to defend positions that might be taken. Bywatching, I should be able to tell that organization and resource allocation areimportant. Kids should have clear ideas about the objective of their work. Theyshould know how to self-evaluate their work, should know the questions to askthemselves about the work. They should be able to answer my questions about thework.</blockquote><p>Another mother said she was appreciative of the discussion. She feels that herson is finally validated because he got into AP courses. She had not thoughtabout the fact that most AP courses, too, conclude with an exam.<p>Since the hour was late, we agreed to stop, despite the fact that there is alwaysmore to think about and discuss. As usual, the parents' discussion wasinstructive. In general, they feel positive about the school and the direction itis taking. Not all of their kids are having great experiences, but the parentsseem to recognize the exceptional effort and energy staff are expending on behalfof their kids.<p>Like most of us, they vacillate between wondering whether their kids are gettingthe same quality of education they did and between envying themwishing they hadhad such engaging activities in high school. They are aware, however, that theworld has changed and that kids may not need the same kinds of tasks they had. Inaddition, they continue to ask the same kinds of questions the staff are askingabout the benefit of external measures which force curriculum coverage, and theyare interested in staff opinions and thoughts on this topic.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr> <a name="partiii"><center><h2>PART III<p>Outsiders Looking In</h2></center> <hr>By this, our third visit, there are some who would say that our ability toobserve objectively is diminished because we know the people and the place verywell now. It is true that our observations, once cool from distance, have becomewarmer with familiarity. However, in some cases the familiarity allows us to seethings that we could not see before, for all the newness. In any case, as theycontinue to invite us to share our observations, our colleagues at Oak Hill havetaught us a good deal about their genuine commitment to continually gainunderstanding of their own progress. <p>Four issues emerge from this visit which we would like to raise forconsideration: the administrative transitions, the absence of discussions aboutinstruction, a shift in beliefs about testing, and the discussion of "using one'smind well." We hope that our views on these issues, which surfaced as compellingand instructive for us, will prove provocative for others.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="at"><h3>Administrative Transitions </h3><p>This  fall, the transition occurring in a number of the top administrativepositions in the district, as  well as the addition of a new teacher to thestaff, occurred with remarkable ease. In general, all were treated with optimism;the new people promised new strengths and fresh perspectives, but they alsopromised a continuation of work in progress.<p>Nationwide, transitions in leadership are telling pointspoints when thoseresistant to changes under way join forces to redirect the schools' efforts, orwhen staff revert to more familiar hierarchical behaviors, waiting until thoseat the top call the shots. While in the spring the staff was quite anxious thatthis would occur at Oak Hill, it did not. Staff took quick action to assert theirown growing leadership and shared decision making by taking charge of facultymeetings; they also began organizing important events and projects like theSenior Options Program. The newcomers read and listened in order to familiarizethemselves with the place, rather than taking charge with new directions. <p>Several important factors account for this. Staff were involved in the hiring andselected people who supported their goals. When Nancy moved to thesuperintendency, she accepted that position only with the board's support thatthe whole district would undertake what the high school had begun. Moreover, thesize and stability of the staff ensured that they would continue to worktogether. <p>The direct consequence of this smooth transition is that there is a sense thatCoalition and NPBS work belongs to the faculty. The faculty's new role hasincreased the possibilities for serious and significant changechange that willresult in the students' increased ability to use their minds well.<p>From an outsider's point of view, this is very important for two reasons. Fewexisting high schools have been able to transform themselves intostudent-centered places because few are able to continue through the inevitabletransitions that occur over an extended period of time. Fewer still are thesuburban high schools that have pushed to serve students better. If the Oak Hillcommunity is able to go the distance, their contribution will be significant.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="i:tmd"><h3>Instruction: The Missing Discussion</h3><p>It is important to acknowledge that we did hear faculty talking more aboutinstructional practices than we have in the past. Several people are taking theSocratic seminar course and are watching each other teach. Ken Field, the physicsteacher, has been working with Donna Martin, the health teacher. He observed aremarkable discussion between students in Donna Martin's health class after theyread an AIDS article. Donna, watching Ken's first Socratic seminar attempt, wasable to point out how he tried repeatedly to redirect students to physicsconsiderations during a seminar using a Dali painting.<p>Jane Leonard and Tom Lacer had a lengthy discussion about Ken's facilitation ofanother seminar, and he reciprocated by giving them feedback on theirfacilitation of a seminar. Alta O'Malley watched Emily Francis lead a Seminar. Inaddition, English teachers collected writing samples from all students, so thatthey could discuss students' writing. Such a discussion is hard to have withoutcomparing teaching techniques. These exchanges show great promise and representthe kinds of exchanges that we think will broaden the staff's capacity to betterserve students.<p>However, when at Oak Hill, we noticed that the kids talked more aboutinstructionwhat constitutes good teaching technique, what teaching techniqueshelp them to use their minds wellthan did the other groups in the schoolcommunity. <p>Faculty talked more about new assessment practices: exhibitions in economics andin math as a conclusion to the sophomore year; senior projects; and waivers for,or new additions to, standardized tests. Many teachers are planning authenticassessments. The English department is developing portfolios for K12. The SeniorOptions Program is under way. There is thoughtful discussion and productivechange taking place at Oak Hill regarding assessment. Faculty also talked aboutcurriculum: new assignments, reductions in workload, rearrangements inschedules, and connections between disciplines. In addition, curriculum revisionis in progress within the integrating classrooms and within departments. <p>We have discovered that each of the math teachers in the school uses differentteaching techniques: One lectures and demonstrates first. Another gives a dailyproblem, then a problem set, and reviews the problem-solving process later.Another uses peer tutoring for students who need a boost. We heard little shareddiscussion, however, about individuals' various techniques. <p>We did hear teachers talk about wanting to lecture less, and we have seen severalexamples of uncomfortable exchanges between teachers and students as teachersexperiment. While discomfort is the twin of change, we heard little opendiscussion about what teaching techniques work to replace a lecture withoutsacrificing rigor. Such discussions might do a great deal to reduce the feelingsof discomfort that accompany the attempts at new techniques. Frequently, we heardteachers complain that students' abilities to present information are limitedand oftentimes boringthat they are like "talking heads"but we heard littlediscussion of the techniques students have been taught or demonstrated whichwould enrich kids' performances.  <p>This is not to suggest that instruction should become the sole focus of theschool. Curriculum, instruction, and assessment are all interwoven threads in thefabric of students' learning. They are so interrelated that to change one is tohave the same effect that pulling a thread on my husband's favorite jacket wouldhaveirreparable damage to the whole. The trick is to work on all three atonceinstruction, assessment, and curriculumand to develop the habit of workingback and forth between them all. <p>There are reasons why instruction is so seldom the focus of facultyconversations. Most teachers were trained to use only a few instructionaltechniques. Besides, working alone, as teachers usually do, hardly ensures arapidly expanding repertoire or critical consideration of commonly usedtechniques. <p>In one teacher's class, discussion, one of the most commonly reportedinstructional techniques,  compels students to do their reading, to come toclass prepared, and to participate in thoughtful ways; while in another teacher'sroom, it drives students to boredom and apathy. The difference between the two isnot simply a matter of curriculum, nor is it simply a matter of the teacher'spersonality. A good discussion is a powerful tool and a learnable technique. Butwhen teachers work in isolation and never see the difference between the twokinds of discussions, it's darned hard to grow. <p>There is another reason why opening the discussion about instruction isimportant: it can help teachers to guard against an overreliance on one or twocurrently popular techniques. We notice the spread of such techniques: in thescience classes where students are teaching sections of the curriculum, in manyclasses where teachers are assigning group work, and in classes where teachersare attempting Socratic seminars. Any technique used over and over again losesits currency and its effectiveness.<p>Teachers need and must find the opportunity to watch each other teach and todiscuss the benefits and the difficulties of various strategies and to generatenew techniques. To open the discussion about instruction is not to suggest thatall teachers should use the same techniques; it is to say that teaching is a richand sustaining profession because teachers can continue to build an expandingrepertoire of effective techniques throughout their careers.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="stac"><h3>Standardized Tests and Coverage</h3><p>A year ago, a number of teachers indicated that the SBEE tests were decentmeasures of student achievement and that the coverage they required wasimportant. This year, many of those same teachers have changed their minds.Examining students' abilities to apply what they learn, teachers discovereddiscrepancies between test-taking abilities and real understanding required forfurther application. Staff investigation of the match between the test resultsand student capabilities prompted the insight. The granting of waivers andadjustments by the NPBS, as well as parental support for changingassessmentsupport evidenced in previous snapshotsare important factors in thestaff's own change of attitude toward the SBEE tests.<p>The staff's change in attitude coincides with burgeoning research which findsthat neither standardized tests nor commonly used textbooks encourages criticalthinking or deep understanding of critical concepts. Other new research suggeststhat standardized test scores do not correspond with student performance inhigher-level math and science courses in colleges across the country. These newfindings add to the growing evidence that tests are gender- and culture-biased.The staff's shift in attitude is part of what we think will be a rapidly growingnational disenchantment with such tests. As we write, a colleague is assistingthe NPBS in the redesign of the SBEEs. <p>Given that staff seem less enamored of the tests than before, the issue ofcurriculum coverage shifts to the forefront. It seems to us that a correspondingshift in the belief that "less is more" is not in place, as staff attest earlierin this snapshot. There is still a sense of an either/or belief in either a full,rich curriculum or a limited, "dumbed-down" one. We get the sense that the fearis that too much will be cut, that students must be grilled for weeks on onetopic ad nauseam, and that they will appear narrow, uncompetitive, and limited totheir college professors. We also sense teachers' skepticism about being the oneswho should be making those decisions. <p>There is also a sense, however, that tracking is the solution Oak Hill chooses asa means to solve curricular pacing issues, despite growing research which atteststo its detrimental effects. A new, basic course was offered in math this year,and AP courses have been added in other disciplines. <p>The shift in attitudes towards standardized testing is importanta milestoneandit opens the gates for new work in both rethinking the substance of thecurriculum and in presenting it to students. Teachers must determine what it isthat they want students to know and be able to do at the end of a course or aftergraduating high school. Then, they must tackle the issue of coverage so that theydevelop a curriculum which is both bountiful and broadening and which allowsstudents the time to experience personally meaningful application of what theyhave learned. It means shaping instructional strategies that provoke inquiryrather than recall.<p>We feel that the staff has reached new heights, such that they stand with a newview, as we do in the springtime in our gardens: Fresh, new promises everywhere!But unavoidable hard work immediately at hand...<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="uomw"><h3>Using One's Mind Well</h3><p>The staff's careful consideration of the nine Common Principles seems to promisedeepening understandings and increasing coherence in their work together. It alsodemonstrates their commitment to keep going by thoughtfully reexamining theguideposts they might be using. (We also cheered while Caroline and Ken ran themeeting. It was an indication that shared leadership is flourishing.)	Fromthis positive base, three observations emerge from the staff's discussion of"using one's mind well." The first deals with the process of the discussion. Thesecond deals with people's varied understandings about the nature of work. Thethird suggests a circular problem which confounds movement towards developingmore engaging schools. <p>The fact that staff chose a go-around made it likely that deep, sharedunderstandings would not be possible. It did allow people to hear from eachmember of the staff and to feel that there was general agreement about thedefinition, since each person's contribution seemed to build on the next. Ago-around is a good catalyst to small group conversations, and it is a goodconcluding activity, but as a sole strategy to foster shared understandings, itis too limited. There simply isn't enough time for everyone to participate, thenclarify, ask questions, and prod for clear understandings. The discussion whichthe small group had, on the other hand, provides an example of the kind of richinsight which can emerge from discussion in which all are expected toparticipate.<p>The second observation deals with people's discrepant interpretations oflegitimate work. After examining the various comments, we feel that the staffhave various definitions of legitimate work.  We agree with staff who suggestthat if they continue to move along with discrepant understandings, it isunlikely that students will really benefit or that anything will change at all.<p>Some suggest that using one's mind well means reading and understanding the textand doing the assigned work. Most students we watch at Oak Hill are quite good atskimming a text and locating answers for worksheets or labs. This requires verydifferent intellectual activity from one which requires students to relateacquired information to a current circumstance, whether it be an internationalenvironmental conference on clean air or a presidential election. Recallingspecific, detailed information from a textwhether it be a newspaper article, anovel, or a math testis a different intellectual function from formulating anexample or critiquing someone else's example. This is not to suggest that carefulreading is not important; it is to suggest that we want students to be able toput what they read to good use.<p>A good deal of students' time at Oak Hill is spent in recall activities, whileless time is spent in activities which ask kids to synthesize information, applya concept, or relate a new understanding to a familiar circumstance. To informthemselves, staff might analyze and discuss the classroom sections of thesnapshots, or they might visit one another's classrooms in search ofclarifications. The staff need to determine which kinds of activities are mostlegitimate and then work towards creating them. <p>The last observation deals with the sometimes frustrated, sometimes cynicalresponse we get from teachers when we talk about legitimate work, by which wemean powerful demonstrations of "using one's mind well." Many teachers arediscouraged because students do not do the basic work they are asked to dolikereading the text and answering the questions at the end. Teachers occasionallysuggest that it is ridiculous to expect more; kids won't do even the simplestwork. Students, on the other hand, complain that much of what they are asked todo is meaningless busywork, neither requiring nor worthy of great effort. Theabsence of stimulating work makes students unwilling to engage themselves; theabsence of engagement makes teachers, in turn, unwilling to invest the effortnecessary to change instruction. It is a circular, self-defeating conundrum.<p>Still, each year when work is required in the service of some activity whichstudents consider useful or meaningful, teachers find kids surprisingly willingand able to do it. The science teacher, Mary Shea, admitted her own surprise atthe depth of the students' involvement in a moon-tracking activity, in which theyrecorded the position of the moon and measured the tides over a few weeks.Similarly, the language teachers find that interest increases as trips or foreignvisitors draw closer. So, there is confirming evidence that students can and willdo work when it is important to them. <p>To escape the conundrum, teachers will need to think again about how learning isacquired. They need to watch students closely in a variety of settings, and tothink about their own learning. Understanding that the will to learn emerges fromthe intersection of students' interests and those of teachers is an old notionbut a hard lesson. Mr. Nelson grappled with this in light of his own discipline,"You know how Clinton's slogan was It's the economy, stupid'? For me it is nowIt's the kids, stupid.'"<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><hr><center><h3>Notes</h3></center> <ol><li> Our sample of junior students, selected a year ago to represent aheterogeneous mix, appears to be skewed towards the top track.

Despite the illusion of quiet, suggested by the snow, the school whirled forward on its journey toward developing more productive practices for student learning. When our research team arrived in the spring for a three-day site visit, we found more than the local flora emerging from the winter grays; the school, appearing ever more serious about its commitment to examine its collective work, seemed stronger, fresher, more collaboratively engaged than before. <p>	This visit, our fourth to Oak Hill High School,  occurred near the end of the second year of the three-year School Change Study. As we do each time we visit a school as part of the study, we produced a "snapshot" based on our observations and conversations at Oak Hill. By presenting this snapshot, we hope to provide an accurate picture of the issues and the activities that are ongoing and imminent in the second half of Oak Hill's fifth year of striving to become an Essential school.<p>	Oak Hill, like the four other schools participating in this study, elected to pursue school change by joining the Coalition of Essential Schools, a partnership between a central staff at Brown University, under the direction of Theodore Sizer, and some six hundred schools across the country. In joining the Coalition, these schools agreed to rethink common secondary school practices through the guidance of a set of ideasthe nine Common Principleswith the aim of becoming an Essential school. (See Appendix B for a list of the Principles.)<p>	This snapshot is divided into four sections. In the first section, "New Issues, New Progress," we attempt to summarize a number of issues which surfaced in our discussions with faculty, students, parents, and administrators. The next section, "Conversations with Students, Faculty, and Parents," includes the gist of our conversations with the students, teachers, administrators, and parents and the major issues those conversations raised. In "Innovation in the Classroom," we share two teachers' reflections on their attempt to try a new approach with students. Their perceptions are accompanied by the perspectives of a student, a parent, and an administrator. The final section, "From the State Department," is our yearly update of the state's attempts to rethink its own practices to find ways of supporting changing schools. <p>	In order to make what follows more provocative for readers both inside and outside of the school, this snapshot takes on a more interactive format than the previous ones did. At the end of each section, we ask readers to engage in reflections concerning the preceding section by jotting down notes and observations. Originally we intended these reflections for the Oak Hill faculty, to help facilitate their whole-group discussion. We encourage any reader of this snapshot to attempt to answer the questions as well. The snapshot ends rather abruptly, so that readers have time to talk with colleagues about what they have read, to share their individual reflections, and to analyze the voices and issues to determine what important information the snapshot really conveys, as well as what actions it might suggest. <p>	Following the snapshot, in the section "Reflections from Critical Friends," the research team discusses what issues the snapshot revealed for them and what questions it raised. This section is meant  both to complement and contrast with the staff's own analysis of the snapshot to help the staff determine their future direction. We hope that by engaging in the reading, the reflection, the discussion, and the comparison suggested in this text, readers will be more practiced in the collective analytical skills so necessary for enabling whole schools to put into place more powerful learning experiences for the students.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ninp"><hr><center><h2>New Issues, New Progress</center></h2><hr>In our conversations with all the members of the school community, evidence emerged of new challenges and new progress at Oak Hill.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rt"><h3>Racial Tension: A New Issue Facing Oak Hill</h3><P>When something of importance occurs at the school, everyoneparents, students, teachers, and administratorsmentions it. Just such an issue surfaced immediately upon our return to Oak Hill in March of l993. <p>	While Oak Hill is a small school, the number of minority students enrolling in this historically all-white community is steadily growing. Soon after our last visit, a couple of black students raised the issue with staff that the school's curriculum and cultural traditions slight multiculturalism. In response, the administration and staff set out to organize a Martin Luther King Day assembly. In the meantime, during the early winter months, a number of students were involved in two fights off campus, which started as alcohol-induced skirmishes with racial overtones.<p>	Meetings among school district personnel, community forums, a parent meeting, and discussions among students were organized. While nearly everyone we talked to prefaced their comments with a denial that racism exists in the community, nearly everyone was startled by its emergence and worried about its potential reappearance. Everyone asked: Were the fights handled adequately? Was the school safe? Had the school dealt with the problem appropriately? Students believed that it was a bigger deal to the adults than to the kids. These events suggest that this historically homogeneous community is dealing with a very complicated contemporary issue. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="pi"><h3>Progress-Related Issues</h3><P>The staff were working as a whole, as departments, and as individuals, on a number of issues concerning change.<p><H4>The Senior Options Program</h4><P>Some teachers were struggling to figure out whether the new Senior Options Program would equal or surpass the carefully crafted curriculum which it was replacing. This program was designed to curb the senior slump by propelling graduates into self-directed learning right up until their final Exhibitions, which would take place shortly before graduation. The Exhibitions, which are to be public demonstrations of the students' cumulative capabilities, constitute a new requirement for graduation. 	The fact that school was closed for so much inclement weather wreaked havoc on teachers' plans. Especially affected were those teachers who had already rearranged their plans for the second semester in order to accommodate the new Senior Options Program.<p>	The seniors with whom we talked had begun their internships or their research projects and were unanimously in favor of the program; they were interested in self-directed work and perceived that it would help them in preparation for college and for jobs. Many of them were pursuing activities which allowed them to experiment with potential careers. Others selected internships outside of their intended field of study in order to broaden their life experiences. <p>	In addition, the seniors were waiting to hear from, or were in the throes of making final decisions about, the colleges they would attend in the fall. Among them there was a sense of accomplishment. Anticipating that the school might soon be submitting applications from students without the State Board of Education Exam (SBEE) scores, the head of the counseling department reported that college admissions officers seemed undaunted that some kids would be graduating without these traditional scores.<p>	The juniors, on the other hand, felt overloaded, stressed out over the up-and-coming SATs and the recognition that their time in public school was drawing to an end. All of a sudden, very important decisions loomed with real immediacy.<p><H4>Faculty Decision-making Power</h4><P>Several faculty mentioned a debate about the legitimacy of their vote to work on outcomes. When one of the teachers, John Nelson, saw that two faculty were abstaining from the second vote, he asked that they vote so that there could be no question about the decision. It was unanimous. (Students, however, continue to hear from some staff that the decision was not legitimate.) <p><H4>Proposals for a New Schedule</h4><P>The scheduling committee proposed a new schedule, which included two days of extended periods: two days of forty-minute periods and one day of shortened classes to accommodate Seminars and the Faculty-Student Congress. Seminars, which students attend once a week, are designed to provide each student with an adult advocate in the school as well as a place to work on class projects and to deal with issues related to the Student-Faculty Congress, in which students and faculty participate in shared decision making regarding issues that affect the school.<p><H4>The Search for More Time</h4><P>There was much speculation among the faculty about whether the committee would be able to respond to the faculty's plea for more time to work with one another and to work with students. Several suggested that the issue of their own planning time was not addressed by this committee, because many of the faculty on the committee believed that the issue of planning time was a contractual, not a scheduling, issue. Others believed that the scheduling committee would only be able to make modest changes this year, because the math and science departments needed more time to think through how they intend to redesign their curriculum. In either case, staff planning time did not appear to be the focus of the committee's proposals. <p>	The amount of time spent at the school was an issue of considerable discussion by faculty at their monthly union meetings, by team members, and by faculty in department meetings. At their union meetings, teachers complained, "We have a l950s contract for what may be a l990s school." Many described these discussions as very difficult. Traditionally, this is a community of committed professionals who do what they can to help kids move forward. On the other hand, the staff believed that they were investing ever-increasing time in the school with no additional compensation. Because they could not come to consensus about how they should deal with non-contractual issues, they agreed that individuals should establish their own parameters.<p>	In teams and in department meetings, the teachers expressed their need for more time to plan. They believe that there especially is not adequate time to plan new things. They feel concerned that they leap into programs like the Senior Options Program, rather than carefully considering all the issues connected with it, because they do not have adequate time to plan in advance. <p><H4>Discussing the Nine Common Principles</h4><P>Faculty continued their discussion of the nine Common Principles, but with mixed reactions. Jane Leonard and Tom Lacer conducted a meeting to discuss two of the Principles, at which time the faculty agreed to give the necessary time to focus on student outcomes.<p>	When we interviewed faculty about the seventh principle, which concerns the tone of the school, most people focused their responses on what they perceived to be an oxymoron"unanxious expectations." Considering only that phrase, the majority maintained that anxiety was an important part of student motivation.<p>	Some people felt that they would rather implement the Principles than talk about them. Others believed that the teachers needed even deeper discussions to move closer toward collective goals. One teacher commented, "I think that whether or not we make a difference for kids will depend upon whether or not we can get close enough on shared values so that there are certain things in the school that all teachers are teaching for." <p><H4>Students' Roles in Decision Making</h4><P>Three teachers talked again about the differences they recently have been seeing in studentsthey say that kids are less motivated, less responsible, less capable of powerful work than they used to be. The faculty that feel this way seemed uncomfortable with the increased voice in decision making that students have been given in Congress. <p>	The discussion of eligibility reached a new intensity, as well. Faculty finally came to consensus about what the policy should be, only to find students disgruntled again because the kids had not been included in the decision-making process. "The teachers accused us of acting selfishly, when all we were trying to do was save the Congress. If we just let them do whatever they want with the eligibility policy, there is no point in having a Congress."<p>	Another student pointed out that the time spent on eligibility was important, but that the whole problem needed reshaping since it did not address the issue of improved academic performance for the majority of students because they are not involved in sports or extracurricular programs at all. Still, we did hear examples from students about how the eligibility policy pushed them to maintain their work, and we did gain a sense that while shared decision making is difficult, faculty and students have moved to a deeper understanding of collaborative work.<p><H4>Changes in Curriculum</h4><P>The science department and the math departments were in the midst of a series of meetings to rethink the K-12 curriculum. Alta O'Malley summarized their work:<p><blockquote>We are right at the brink now of really looking at school change rather than individual techniques in our individual classrooms, which is what a lot of us have been doing for the last year or so. We've been focusing on trying to encourage kids to do group activities, work with each other, do more writing in the curriculum, do different types of testing, not just multiple-choice testing. Now we're looking ahead to bigger changes.</blockquote>	The number of teachers attempting to work together continued to expand. The technical drawing teacher worked with the physics teacher. Business education staff helped to support new science projects. The science teachers were involved in a series of meetings with the middle school science teachers to rearrange the scope and sequence of their work. One of the math teachers suggested that as they were investigating how much their students were actually getting in class, he had become convinced that they did not understand basic applications. Ninth- and tenth-grade English and social studies teachers were designing culminating Exhibitions and redesigning their individual interdisciplinary courses.<p>	Mainstreaming of students, which also involved teachers working together, was moving along better than people had originally hoped. Parents and teachers alike believed that the mainstreamed students gained important competencies and confidence as a result of negotiating the general curriculum. The college acceptance rate for those students was exciting. <p>	The sophomores and freshmen were engaged in more Exhibitions in their interdisciplinary English and social studies classes than before, since they would not be taking the SBEE exam. Pleased about not having to take the test, they were still a little apprehensive about what their teachers would devise to replace it.<p>	Meanwhile, faculty and students were preparing for an ambitious double-cast production of <CITE>Bye, Bye Birdie</CITE>. Students were thoroughly enjoying their participation, even though it meant late-night rehearsals. Twenty-four students and two teachers were packing for their two-week trip to France, after they sold soup, assisted the parents in an auction, and performed a French play (in French), among other things, to get ready to go. They were furiously drilling in conversational French so that the travelers might be conversant with the families with whom they would be staying.<p><H4>Coping with Administrative Transitions</h4><P>Everyone was still in the throes of the administrative transitionsa new superintendent, a new high school principal, a new vice principal, and a new elementary school principal. At the high school, many people again mentioned missing Nancy Brenner's energy and vision. The Superintendent's Conference Day which she planned was well received. At the same time, central office, middle school, and elementary administrators were all adjusting to Nancy's energy.<p>	Dr. Brenner was working with the other administrators to create a coherent K12 experience for studentsan ambitious undertaking badly needed around the country. The elementary staff was building developmentally appropriate instruction, the middle school was focused on integrated instruction and assessment, while the high school proceeded to better integrate instruction, curriculum, and assessment.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="r:ninp"><table border><tr><td><h3>Reflections for the Reader: New Issues, New Progress</h3>After reading this account, describe this school's progress in a few sentences. Where do you sense difficulties? What are the gains?</td></table><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cwsfap"><hr><center><h2>Conversations with Students, Faculty, and Parents</center></h2><hr>During our week at Oak Hill we met with many students, faculty, administrators, and parents to discuss a wide range of ongoing and new issues at  the high school.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tws"><h3>Talking with Students</h3><P>Each time we visit, we work with a group of forty-five sophomores, juniors, and seniors. We interview this group, both individually and in groups, and we shadow some in their classes. Two others write to us in a weekly journal. This spring, students were most interested in two questions we asked them which derived from issues they themselves had raised in previous visits. We asked them to define challenges in school and to give current examples. We also asked that they define fairness in school practices. Without any prompting, they raised a third issue about the changes taking place in their school. What follows is a summary of their discussion, sprinkled with quotations from the students.<p><H4>How Students Define Challenges</h4><P>Students define challenges as new efforts, attempts to do things they've never done before, something difficult and not easily accomplished, something that "pushes you beyond yourself, beyond what you did last time." A real challenge "forces you to reach; it's something that doesn't come to you easily, like reading somebody like Faulkner who has stylistic complexities that you have to reach for. It forces you to think, to draw on what you know, but also on your own creativity."<p>	Challenging work involves project work, critical thinking, or thoughtful discussion, rather than passive listening. Examples of challenges from recent classes reflect students' wide interests: debating in history, comparing <CITE>The Invisible Man</CITE> with "The Man with a Hoe," analyzing five poems of one poet, learning new aspects of chemistry, having discussions in humanities, reading Faulkner, working on their Senior Options project, and dealing with the issue of eligibility for the Congress. Intellectual engagement is one of the important criteria for determining what constitutes challenges in school.  <p><blockquote>If a teacher came up to you and said, "Tell me everything that happened," that would be easy. If they said, "Tell me everything that happened and why it happened," then you have a challenge. You have to look at it differently, you have to go into more depth. You have to think on it more.</blockquote>	They debated whether it has to be something that they are interested in. Some said that personal interest supplies motivation. Others suggested that personal interest is not always available, but that perseverance is important for gaining a sense of accomplishment. Feeling that one has achieved something of significance is important. <p>	Despite being able to provide fine examples of meaningful challenges, students said that challenges at school are the exception rather than the rule. <p><blockquote>I am challenged by workload rather than by the actual ideas. Most of my classes would be challenging if they weren't so task-oriented and mundane. I get home late and spend more time thinking about prioritizing the load than thinking or doing things that require creativity. </blockquote>They suggested that they spend a good deal of their time engaged in work that requires no real thought on their part.<p><H4>How Students View Fairness</h4><P>Students shared with us what is fair and unfair in school.<p><blockquote>Fairness means that you get an equal chance to succeed. If you do good work, you should be rewarded for it and if you don't, you get punished. Here, people, after a while, get graded on their reputations more than on what they hand in. I see it in kids' papers sometimes. I read their work, think it is good, maybe even better than mine, but they didn't get a good grade because they had their reputation as not being as smart or as talented. They are pigeonholed as average students. That happens to some extent in all classes. People get placed. Once they're there, it's very hard to get out. </blockquote>	A number of students said they feel that the fact that they are labeled early on is unfair. They also suggested that it is difficult to advance; others noted that it is equally as difficult to fall from favor. Kids would like to feel that they have greater mobility within the system and that as their performance increases, so do their grades and their opportunities to take more challenging classes. <p><blockquote>Fairness is grading you on your performance, something that can changesomething that is not indelible. Fairness is being able to talk and explaining to a teacher and not having it pre-decided. Fairness would make changing possible if your performance changed.</blockquote>	Regarding fairness, placement in advanced courses was one of their concerns. <p><blockquote>I think fairness is that everybody gets the opportunity to do what they want. Because you weren't in an advanced subject before doesn't mean you couldn't get into it the next time. I think that this is one thing that is unfair in our school.</blockquote><blockquote>I think that our AP classes are kind of elitist. Kids in other classes get teachers who use more movies and read newspapers in class. That doesn't challenge those kids. In AP, we get difficult books while other classes don't. I almost think that AP courses should be open to whoever wants to come do it. Because a lot of it is just your motivation to do it.</blockquote>	Students debated whether jokes at the expense of others are fair. Generally, they liked the injection of humor into teaching, but feel that it is inappropriate if the recipients are bothered by it. <p>	Several students told us they feel quite angry in some classes at being asked to do work which is below their capability and being treated like elementary school children. <p><blockquote>The thing that makes me feel the most cheated and unfair is not being treated like an adult: being given work that is a joke; teachers who stick to textbook answers. Give <CITE>Brady Bunch </CITE>answers from the text and you'll do fine. Give an opinion and you are in trouble. That is not learning and that is not challenge. </blockquote>	While several of the boys suggested that girls are more coddled than they are and get better grades consistently in some classes, several girls thought that they are discriminated against in a variety of areas, from athletics to academics. One girl said that girls should be given extracurricular credit for cheerleading and that they haven't been taken seriously. Another noted, <p><blockquote>I think in math, guys are totally being pushed more. You can tell just from the numbers in my class. There are hardly any girls. The teachers, too, make jokes: "Oh well, girls aren't supposed to be good in math." It just gets really discouraging. You have to laugh at it, but you're really kind of mad because it's discouraging to hear somebody say something like that, whether they're joking or not. Our school's pretty fair. But there are some things like that.</blockquote>	Another student noted that in one class, her teacher works with the kids who really do well, but ignores the kids who don't do very well. Another student mentioned that some kids are allowed easier work and that teachers do not interact with them as much as they do in the more advanced classes. Students feel that encouragement to do one's best is part of fairness. Students want to feel that the staff has high expectations for all of them and that they are encouraging them to do the best that they can. <p>	For seniors, the way counselors approach their college applications is a keen example of how they are treated unfairly in this respect:<p><blockquote>It's like applying for college admissions. Shouldn't our counselors try to encourage us to try our very best? That's what Mr. Field does. He tells us to reach, because if we don't we'll never get anywhere. I felt put down because my counselor discouraged me from applying to the places I wanted to apply to. I applied anyway and I didn't get in, but I'd rather have them tell me it's a stretch than have them tell me it's beyond me.</blockquote><H4>How Students Feel about Change</h4><P>The students are well aware that their school has joined the Coalition of Essential Schools and that the adults in their school are in the midst of a self-directed project to create better schooling for them. Depending on their grade level and their teachers, students are exposed to varying degrees of change and innovation. Almost all students are affected by the interdisciplinary coordination of English and social studies in ninth and tenth grade. Nearly every student has had to teach a chapter in a science class. Whether in economics, calculus, physics, or technical drawing, many have had to do Exhibitions. A number have participated in Socratic seminars.<p>	All the eight seniors we spoke with, the first group to do final Exhibitions as part of their Senior Options requirement, were in favor of the changes they have seen in the school, even though it has meant more work for them. <p><blockquote>I am working as a teacher's aide because I'm thinking that I want to teach. It's interesting. I'd never realized how difficult it is to be a teacher. It's a lot of work. Especially [with] eighth-graders. They don't seem to pay attention to whatever you say. </blockquote>	All of these eight seniors are pleased about pursuing work connected with their own intereststhough not all of them found the actual work as interesting as they had hoped. <p>	While it seems to us that support for change grows as students get older, the younger students expressed three distinct perspectives toward change.<p>	The largest group contained students who said they want school to be more meaningful, who like the things teachers are trying and want more changes sooner: "I like doing Exhibitions because it is different from a normal essay. You have to get up in front of a bunch of people and keep their interest, and not put them to sleep." "I like the fact that we get to do an independent exploration. It's what we've been preparing for, and it will help us get ready for college." They feel a sense of pride that outsiders frequently visit their school; they also feel that their teachers and administrators really work for them. Another student described a meaningful experience she had in school: a poetry assignment she liked in which they had to analyze several poems by one author. <p><blockquote>I think the point was that for writers there is some sort of imagination. Maybe it's not always so straightforward, but to some extent imagination goes back to inspiration and to the little things that set them off. It's interesting to see what kind of stuff makes writers want to write.</blockquote> <p>	A second voice came from a number of students who do not see much change at the schoolonly pockets of changeand frequently see only cosmetic changes in the works: "Changing the names of essays to think pieces' or Exhibitions' is not what I call the cutting edge of educational reform." <p><blockquote>We put on an Exhibition in English and did thesis papers. [In] all the other classes we keep coming to school and doing the same stuff. Teachers talk to us, we do the assignment, go to school the next day.</blockquote>	They feel unsure about whether they'd like the school better if the nine Common Principles were fully implemented, but doubt that they'll be around to see it. <p><blockquote>I don't even know if the Coalition is the better way because I haven't been taught that way. In the eleventh and twelfth grade there is not a lot of Coalition; most of that stuff goes on in the ninth and tenth grade. Who knows what the better way is?</blockquote>	They suggested that there are inconsistencies between what the school says it is trying to do and what it actually does. They said they are troubled about some of the strategies teachers are using, and wonder whether they are more beneficial or less.<p><blockquote>In Exhibitions you really learn so much about your own topic, but not about anyone else's. I listened to three Exhibitions on the Black Death and I learned something, but I couldn't go home and write an essay about it.</blockquote><blockquote>I have to work hard to understand the stuff in my chapter to teach it, but I don't learn so much from the presentations.</blockquote><blockquote>One of my science teachers has just given up helping us; he just leaves us to flail through the rest of it. </blockquote>	Some kids also noted that some teachers try new things only when we come. <p>	A third, minority voice came from students who don't want change. They are worried that they won't be able to get into college, or that they won't be able to compete when they get there. They don't like group grading, nor do they prefer essays over short answers, and they wonder if their individual capabilities are suffering as a result of new techniques. <p><blockquote>I know of none of my teachers who are working for my benefit. Some of the things they are trying are so unorganized. Maybe the teachers are having a hard time adjusting to it because they are used to teaching traditionally. I see no benefit to me.</blockquote>	Another student said, "We've spent all these years adjusting to the traditional way of educationyou can't just take it now and switch it." These students believe there are inconsistencies between the rhetoric in the school and the reality in the outside world.<p>	Some students from each of these vantage points at Oak Hill are engaged in a lively, ongoing debate about what an Essential teacher is. A couple, analyzing what their teachers actually do in class, are unconvinced by individual teachers' claims to be a Coalition or a non-Coalition teacher. <p>	Some teachers who are trying to do "Coalition stuff" sometimes use techniques that students do not believe help them learn to use their minds well. Several students are adamant that some teachers use the Principles to abdicate their responsibility to studentsturning it all over to the kidswhen the students feel quite unprepared to undertake complex work without some guidance.<p>	Students cited a couple of teachers who, although claiming not to be interested in the Coalition, use techniques that students believe embody the nine Common Principles.<p>	Students also debated whether the activities given are really Coalition ones or whether a teacher's responses to students' work are in keeping with the nine Common Principles.<p>	They noted that good discussion techniques are part of the Coalition philosophy, even though the technique of discussion has been around for a long time.<p>	They debated whether new techniques which teachers are usinglike Socratic seminars, project work, students-teaching-students, or Exhibitionsforce them to use their minds better than they would if they were listening to the teacher and taking notes.<p>	From these conversations, we learned that students are interested in dialogue about their school, their learning, and their education. <p><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="r:cws"><table border><tr><td><h3>Reflections for the Reader: Conversations With Students</h3><ol><li> What are the three most important things kids are saying about their learning? <p><li> Do you think their concerns are valid?

Additional conversations in the faculty room before and after school with other faculty also added to our understanding of the major issues for faculty. <p><H4>The Role of the Principal</h4><P>Not surprisingly, a major issue for the faculty this time was whether the new principal could support change in this school. In the midst of a year when there was progress on a variety of projects and when a number of individuals and teams were working on new strategies, administrative support seemed even more important.<p>	Since the fall, faculty have had experience working with the new principal. Naturally, the contrast between his style and Nancy Brenner's was the topic of much discussion. There was a sense of relief among faculty as they acknowledged that they were able to proceed with plans for change. Many noted that the new principal was hired to maintain their efforts rather than to take them in new directions.<p>	However, most of the people with whom we talked were now eager for the principal to exert some leadership of his own, to clarify his own vision for change. One teacher noted that administrators are always in a no-win situationthat Jim Goodman is criticized for <CITE>not </CITE>doing precisely what Nancy Brenner was criticized for doing. <p><blockquote>It is ironic to me that Nancy was criticized for being manipulative, and he is criticized for not being able to make a decision, or by having to get input on every decision he makes. Part of me says, you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. </blockquote>	While staff appreciated his positive energy, they also hoped for a stronger, more thorough "critical friend."<p><H4>Feelings about Seminar</h4><P>For the last four years, staff have been volunteering to work with a small number of students once a week in order to greater personalize the school for students. Staff talked a good deal about whether the Seminar program was working, whether they understood its purposes, whether it simply added to their workload, and whether it provided much for kids. To date, during Seminars, students discuss whatever their Congress representatives need to discuss, they share snacks, and they discuss individual class activities. <p>	Our observations suggest wide variation among Seminars. In some Seminars, students talk to each other and ignore any organized agenda. In some, students rotate leadership responsibility and follow an agenda. In some, teachers work with kids; in others, staff remain aloof. And in still others, staff conduct Seminars as an extension of regular courses. With the advent of the Senior Options Program, which the senior class Seminar teachers had an integral role in planning, teachers could see the full range of Seminar responsibilities over students' four years in the school. 	<p>	The staff noted that students claim to have very different experiences in Seminar. With some teachers, students discussed their school work, progress toward graduation, topical issues, and debated their classes' activities. In others, teachers lectured, treated Seminars as free time, or expected students to run them with little support from the staff member. <p>	Staff seem to divide into two camps on Seminars. While some believed that Seminars were designed to strengthen the support for students in the school, others believed that teachers are responsible for kids' academic development and are ill-equipped to do more. Other staff felt that Seminar teachers should broaden the base of class advisors by helping students to organize the junior prom or the sophomore fund raiser. Faculty agreed that a thoughtful review of Seminar, with careful attention to how it might proceed, is in order.<p><H4>Changing Instruction </h4><P>The majority of faculty indicated that, with a few exceptions, instruction has not been a topic of regular discussion among faculty. People who are teaming or engaged in some kind of collaborative work do discuss various teaching techniques. Some in the science department suggested that they are swapping more techniques than previously. Other faculty said they believe that each teacher develops his or her own style and that the discussion of <CITE>what </CITE>they teach is far more important than <CITE>how </CITE>they teach. Many noted that the lack of discussion about instruction is more a result of limited time than of interest. Time for teachers to work together, to plan, to compare instructional methods, and to watch each other teach is still limited. <p>	Still others noted that changing instructional practices and curriculum is perhaps more difficult for them and certainly more difficult for students than they had anticipated. New lessons and fresh approaches are not always positive experiences. Ken Field tried a physics project which he felt bombed (see "Innovations in the Classroom"). Emily Francis tried replacing exams with essays, but wondered in the long run whether her students retained the information they got by writing essays any longer than they did by listening to teachers or by preparing for an exam. She expressed her concern that while the old way didn't work particularly well and needed changing, the new way may not be making any significant gains. <p>	Mary Shea tried giving the kids a chapter to teach in earth science. She had them work in teams. Some of the kids did great work; others, however, did not. Two boys dealt with the question about how unequal heating creates convection currents and winds. They decided they could show this through water. They needed a heat source, and after trial and error, they ended up with a three-candle heat source. Then they had to figure out how they could show currents. They tried food coloring, but that didn't work. They decided the containers were wrong, so they changed containers. Then they tried dried watercolor paint. That worked. Their demonstration was the bestnearly all of the kids mentioned itbut the two students-as-teachers didn't cover everything they were assigned, which left Mary feeling that the project had been less than successful. <p>	Abby Steiner explained that while she and Marge Michaels are working to narrow their curriculum so that kids can do deeper work, she finds herself reverting to coverage behaviors: "I find I tell them about something, knowing that they're not going to remember it, but I still feel better. I say, I'm going to tell you about this' and I see them glaze over, but I still go right ahead." She feels that it is hard for her since she was raised with the SBEE and has always taught the SBEE curriculum. She also notes that she has had several students apply to take the SBEE because, she says,  <p><blockquote>They are sure that the SBEE will be much easier than any test we devise. What we are coming up with will require sustained effort over three weeks rather than a one shot deal. Some don't like the sustained effort, and they'd just as soon have one test that takes care of all of that.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="twta"><h3>Talking with the Administrators</h3><P>Jim Goodman, the principal, and Esther Young, the vice principal, are in their seventh month at Oak Hill. Both felt that they had learned a good deal and that they had something to contribute.<p>	Jim, an administrator with experience in several other schools, suggested that the role of a principal in a changing school is new to him and takes some adjusting. He said he feels the advantage of being selected by the staff, and believes that the whole school has managed to move forward in important ways during the year. His own observations have led him to believe that the faculty is working exceptionally hard and that they are in the midst of vibrant and serious debate about the school's goals, best practices, curriculum, and assessment. He thinks that they are certainly using their minds better than many of the faculty with whom he has worked.<p>	He also believes that kids' experiences do not yet match the vibrancy of the faculty's. He is anxious to review the whole Seminar program and the Senior Options Program for next year, and to engage the faculty in an all-out effort to ensure that students are using their minds well, too. <p>	Jim suggested that much of the difficulty or dissatisfaction teachers encounter when trying new practices is to be expected. The scaffolding, the carefully sequenced directions and supports, are not yet in place for students, so kids spend more time floundering and generate less-than-polished work. Jim suggested that teachers need to reflect on what worked and what didn't, and then build a more carefully articulated structure in which kids can work more successfully, rather than concluding that the technique is flawed. He said he feels encouraged by the new things teachers are trying and hopes that many of the rough spots will smooth out as teachers become more practiced.<p>	Esther agreed that her responsibilities in a changing school are quite different from those in her last school. She has worked hard to respond to faculty concerns about attendance issues, and spends the first part of each day talking with students who were reported absent the day before. In addition, she has been helping teachers consider instructional techniques.<p>	She took a major role in getting the Senior Options Program under way, too. To get that program up and running, she worked with Mark Thomas and helped to organize the community advisory board, set up the mentor training, establish placements for students, and figure out assessment techniques. She already has a list of things that she thinks they should do differently.<p>	When she first arrived, she was so concerned about getting her work done that she ate at her desk, until she realized that the work would not be successful if she never established any relationships. Now she has lunch with the faculty. She feels very much a part of the staff and greatly appreciates the opportunity to work with Nancy Brenner, whom she admires. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="r:cwa"><table border><tr><td><h3>Reflections for the Reader: Conversations with Administrators</h3><ol><li> Does an administrator's role differ in a changing school?

Most were satisfied with their children's progress during the year. One registered a complaint that she didn't believe that children were always treated with as much respect as the nine Common Principles might suggest. They expressed their interest in their kids' gaining more access to AP courses. <p>	Ever supportive of more active engagement for their kids, they debated again whether change was moving as fast as they'd like for their children. Two heard more about change than they actually saw in their students' experiences. One parent who has both a senior and a freshman said that progress was evident in the more finely tuned nature of the activities her younger son was getting. She reminded the group that change was not like buying a new car: "You don't learn the traditional way one day, and then switch the next. It just isn't going to be like that." Another parent worried again that changing assessment practices will lead to more subjective grading.Two parents of seniors were enthusiastic about their kids' projectsand a bit nostalgic, watching their youngsters go off to do independent work. They were quite satisfied with the new high school administrators, believing that Dr. Goodman and Ms. Young were managing to protect the gains made at the high school, and, as evidenced by the Senior Options Program, were in fact taking the school forward. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="r:cwp"><table border><tr><td><h3>Reflections for the Reader: Conversations with Parents</h3>What themes do parents echo from previous voices?</td></table><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="iitc"><hr><center><h2>Innovation in the Classroom</center></h2><hr>Many of the teachers at Oak Hill are trying new techniques to see if they can engage students more thoroughly than before and to see if they can help kids to understand applications for the concepts they are learning about. As Mary Shea suggested earlier in this snapshot, trying something new is often disconcerting because it involves uncertainty. <p>	The following is a description of a fresh approach to learning planned and implemented by the applied physics teacher and the technology teacher. Their hope was that the kids engaged in this project would understand the laws of momentum and kinetic energy better than they would through traditional learning activities.<p>	We heard about the project from multiple perspectives. The first description comes from Ken Field's journal; the rest are from interviews conducted while we were at the school.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="faptj"><h3>From a Physics Teacher's Journal</h3><P><blockquote>Two weeks ago, Mike Torno and I decided to try having my applied physics class and one of his technology classes do a project that I encountered from the Star Schools project. The goal was to design any apparatus out of paper, white glue, and masking tape, which would allow a marble to roll down it. The marble could not get stuck and stop before reaching the table level. The object was to design the apparatus which would take the longest time to reach the end. I introduced the project. I created random groups of four students each. I gave them the bulk of the first day to plan and brainstorm. We used class time for eight days to construct the things. I intended to use only four days, but they were nowhere near done. The deadline was today. We were going to have the great roll-off. </blockquote><blockquote>I have to comment here. It is obvious that our present educational program is not preparing students to tackle a problem like this. I was inspired to try this as an ill-defined problem like we heard about in another school. Well, my class just floundered. I was trying real hard not to make suggestions on how to do the project. After two days it was obvious that they had no idea what they were doing. Nobody assumed leadership. Some worked hard at rolling paper (for supports, they told me). Others watched their teammates roll paper. I tried to get them to draw me a picture of what they were going to construct. No idea. But, they kept rolling paper. </blockquote><blockquote>In the middle of this Jim G. was doing his obligatory observations. Well, in my enthusiasm, I told him about the project and suggested that he might want to see it. He did. He came in and saw students rolling paper. Then, today, he came in for the Exhibition. What a disaster.</blockquote><blockquote>One group from my class and two from Mike's even met the requirement of keeping the marble rolling. So I tried to salvage the catastrophe by saying that anyone whose project failed had to do a project over the vacation which could beat the longest time of the day. Twenty-two seconds. It sounded reasonable to me. Then, one of the students blew up. Said he was <CITE>not </CITE>going to do it. It was unfair. He was going to cut class and did. I don't know how Jim took it but it was the worst class that I have ever had. Boy, if I was not convinced that we need to do something different in science than we have been doing, I would retreat to the security of what I know that I do well, whether it was working for students or not.</blockquote><blockquote>So, what have I learned? The students used up four years of masking tape in two weeks. Next time, limit the materials. With unlimited materials, they could waste as much as they wanted. Next time they will have to be forced to plan. I would require that they submit an acceptable plandrawing before starting to build. I would make them assign roles and responsibilities to all members of the group. I would also make the actual building of the apparatus an all-day, in-house field trip. Trying to do it in forty-minute blocks of time is wasteful. You lose momentum and have to reignite the initial excitement over the project every day."</blockquote>[Eight days later . . . ]<p><blockquote>I set the date for the project roll-off for two weeks from today. I spent today processing what I saw happening with the project. One student was a big help. He had the only project that worked before the vacation. Over the vacation he built a bigger and better project for extra credit. He volunteered that in class. It makes the project seem workable to those who still have to do it. The kid who walked out earlier even showed up for class today, so maybe he'll do the project. Meanwhile we return to the study of heat. There are a lot of relatively straightforward experiments in this topic. The applied physics class usually enjoys this section.</blockquote>[Two weeks later . . . ]<p><blockquote>We had the roll-off today. Projects came in. All but three students have now successfully completed the project. What a difference in attitude. They felt good about the whole thing. I videotaped it. Some of the projects showed good work. I am glad I was hard-nosed about making them persevere.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tttp"><h3>The Technology Teacher's Perspective</h3><P><blockquote>In order to work with Mr. Field on an applied physics class, I volunteered for an extra period of duty. I did it just to see how the project works out. The new schedule should help us to do more of this in a more fruitful way. The parameters of the experiment were that they had to build something only using paper, tape, and glue. They had to make a steel ball go from some height to the bottom. The group wins that takes the longest time to do it. So you had to think of ways to make the ball slow down. In tech class, the kids came up with these funnels that would spiral and drop into another spiral funnel so that the ball would take a long time. Others created a maze on an angle that would take a long time. The important thing was that they are seeing that the momentum of the ball almost knocks down what's in its way, so they had to develop these flap doors to absorb the kinetic energy as it was rolling. There were some bugs to hammer out, but the project worked pretty well. </blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="app"><h3>A Parent's Perspective</h3><P><blockquote>Our son just had to do this thing for Mr. Field. He spent so much time on it. He had to create a maze only using paper and tape and a marble. It was supposed to run for twenty-two seconds. He tried and tried. It was supposed to be with a group, but he felt that his group wasn't doing anything so he decided to do it himself. It was interesting to see him approach it. He was doing it on a table in the basement. He was determined to get it, but the most he could get up to was thirteen seconds.</blockquote><blockquote>Then his father got into it, and I went by and gave advice, and then his brother came home and had a few recommendations. "Cutting the paper, your angles are too sharp. Put more in." "Add another piece here." "Reduce the slant." We thought, if it runs thirteen seconds this way, well, what if you turn it around and let it roll back up. He said he couldn't do that. Really it was all of us brainstorming and all of us using our minds well. Finally, he said it would just have to do. Twenty-two seconds is a long time when you're using paper and masking tape and a marble. We found that out.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="asp"><h3>A Student's Perspective</h3><P><blockquote>We made this weird contraption, kind of like a giant curve that went all around. It was an applied physics problem to learn about kinetic motion and momentum. It didn't work the first time we made it because it would only go to a certain point and then stop. So we redesigned it to zigzag toward the bottom. We made pillars to support the run by rolling big tubes of paper and wrapping them in tape to make them more sturdy. We taped these pillars to a piece of board. It was about a foot-and-a-half tall. We rolled paper tubes and attached them together for the ball to roll through. At first, I didn't like physics because it wasn't about mechanics and motors, but now it is more interesting.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tpp"><h3>The Principal's Perspective</h3><P><blockquote>A lot of the teachers are experiencing some discomfort when they try new things that offer kids the opportunities to be constructivistsyou know, construct their own knowledge. They are working on giving them more real problems to solve, like Ken Field and Mike Torno did in their physics experiment. Ken was upset on the day the kids were to present their projects because the projects didn't work as well as he would have liked. From my perspective, it was just a matter of building stronger structures, prompts, and benchmarks that will enable the kids to improve their performance. I was glad he kept at it. Some teachers just stop there and blame the kids. The next time he does it, he'll have more of these kinds of guides for students from teachers that lead to higher performance.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="r:iitc"><table border><tr><td><h3>Reflections for the Reader: Innovation in the Classroom</h3><ol><li> When you consider all perspectives, what happened with this lesson?

Previously quite prescriptive in terms of curriculum and assessment, the State Department of Education (SDE) is in the process of redesigning its own practices. Two years ago, the SDE undertook the implementation of new legislation which calls for the reformation of the state department and the redesign of the state's regulatory system. Entitled the New Partners for Better Schools (NPBS), the new policy implies that the state department must change itself in order to better support schools that are trying to better their students' education. In order to facilitate these changes, the SDE staff entered into a partnership with eleven exemplary schools currently engaged in change, one of which is Oak Hill. <p>	In the last year, the state department itself has been in the throes of interpreting and adjusting to NPBS. Some eighteen staff were let go in an attempt to reduce budget deficits. The rest of the department of education staff has been reorganized into a small central staff and a series of regional field teams. The regional teams consist of an interdisciplinary groupsomeone from special education, someone from mathematics, and someone from budgeting, for instance. Each team will spend the majority of its time in schools helping local practitioners to build site-based decision-making structures and develop better practices. <p>	Since last spring, the SDE has established three thrusts of activity as a means by which to translate the NPBS into action and support change in schools. The Curriculum and Assessment Council sponsored a report written by a prominent educational policy designer entitled "Building a Learner-Centered Curriculum for Learner-Centered Schools," which recommends the radical redesign of both the structure of curriculum and of the SBEE. The second thrust is to establish a new kind of accountability system. To do that, staff at the SDE are working with experts from England and from the partnership schools to establish a review process involving peer visitation and feedback. Those working on this activity hope to make it more powerful than current accreditation reviews. The third thrust is designed to deal with issues of equity, and a study group has been formed to that end. <p>	Various staff at the SDE described a number of barriers they are encountering as they attempt to change: (1) resistance to change, (2) ambiguity, (3) lack of trust between the schools and the SDE, (4) lack of expertise among SDE staff in redesigning their roles, and (5) no staff development to help SDE staff better understand their new roles. These barriers are not unlike those the staff at Oak Hill mention in their own efforts to change their school.<p>	The key issues the state department is dealing with at the moment include defining the desired outcomes, moving from a focus on input to a focus on outcomes, establishing the quality review, establishing alternative assessments which match the desired outcomes, and getting the SDE people focused on learning rather than on goals and procedures. Another major challenge is to ensure that the field teams move from a regulatory stance to a helping role. <p>	These changes, which constitute major shifts for the SDE, make them more likelyand better ableto support the changes staff at Oak Hill are pursuing. Much of the language of the Coalition of Essential Schools infuses the policies and reports emerging from the SDEwhich is promising for Oak Hill. At the same time, staff in the eleven partnership schools appear to have more expertise in managing change than do those in the SDE and are perhaps better equipped to support SDE staff for the next few years, than vice versa.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="r:catsd"><table border><tr><td><h3>Reflections for the Reader: Changes at the State Department</h3><OL><LI> What parallels did you see between the state department's work and the school's change effort?<p><LI> In what ways is the state department of education supporting you?</OL></td></table><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rfcf"><hr><center><h2>Reflections from Critical Friends</center></h2><hr>Oak Hill seems a stronger place to us at the end of our second year, more committed to analyzing current practices and to investigating fresh possibilities to improve student learning. Collectively, the faculty made major strides forward. They tackled tough issues like the schedule and organized and carried out the first Senior Options Program. Oak Hill is one of the handful of schools with a long history of bureaucratic decision making that is progressing as a result of staff discussion and staff decision making. The faculty seemed better able to make and follow through on collective decisions; they came to agreement on the eligibility policy, and they called for a second vote to confirm their interest in pursuing their work with the Coalition. The transitions in leadership, which have enormous potential to stall or derail a faculty's efforts, occurred with expected difficulties; yet these transitions did not stalemate, and in some cases, actually supported, the faculty's ability to tackle new challenges. Individual teachers made a number of curricular sacrifices in order to accommodate the whole faculty's agreement to try the Senior Options Program. Oak Hill is a school which continues to demonstrate that it is very serious about its efforts to change. <p>	 It is remarkable, too, that Oak Hill is a place that acknowledges that there is much left to be done. Staff are looking forward to next year: a new schedule, continued work in math and science, a revised Seminar and Senior Options Program, a more ccordinated, coherent English and social studies curriculum. Oak Hill is also one of the few places where staff seem to value feedback and critical friendship. At the end of this visit, staff again asked us to share our reflections on their progress with no holds barred. "Give it to us the way you see it," they said again. "We'll agree or disagree, but in any case, we want to know what you think!"  In no way does our feedback mean to suggest that we think we have uncovered "right answers"; it is merely our observations after stepping back ourselves, far away from daily life in the school. We hope it will contribute to the reader's own observations.  <p>	At the end of each of the previous snapshots, we raised a series of issues which we believed were important for faculty consideration as they moved forward in their work to strengthen their school. We have asked questions about the faculty's understandings of the nine Common Principles, about how kids' voices are included in discussions about change, about transitions in leadership, and about the role of classroom observation in changing schools. We have asked questions about why math instruction is so problematic, about how teachers' basic beliefs and assumptions about student capabilities and the nature of learning undergird the staff's ability to engage in real change. We have raised issues dealing with the interrelationship of instruction, curriculum, and assessment. We have asked whether being a teacher requires continuous professional growth and an ever-expanding repertoire of teaching techniques. Here again, we offer our reflections as provocations, while acknowledging that building better, stronger schools is tough, takes time, involves conflict, and requires energythen, more energy. We think we've asked some tough questions. We hope that staff will turn these over, compare them with their own reflective analysis, and use the combination to strengthen their efforts and ours.<p>	This time we revisit three issues and ask about two more. Obviously, the discussion about the nine Common Principles is of interest to us (though we suspect we hear faint groaning from our colleagues at Oak Hill). We wonder, too, about the interrelationship between curriculum, instruction, and assessment and about the nature of innovation. We ask how change might more rapidly wend its way into students' experience, and how teachers might gain more time to work together. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tpa:wdnsf"><h3>The Principles Again: Where Does Number Seven Fit?</h3><P>The nine Common Principles are a set of ideas designed to provoke consideration of very different kinds of schoolsschools which serve kids better. They provide the common blueprint all Essential schools use for change. In the first year of this study, we determined that staff had varying interpretations of the Principles. The staff, in turn, elected to consider them more carefully in a series of staff meetings. <p>	When we analyzed the responses faculty gave us to the first Common Principle, concerning what, in respect to the students, it meant to use one's mind well, we found that teachers' responses fell into two basic categories: engaging in work which required recall of information or engaging in higher-level thinking. When we asked staff again which they thought more appropriate, the majority of faculty suggested that they were more interested in having kids engage in critical thinking. One teacher reminded us that to prefer one over the other is to oversimplify what good learning really isthat both are necessary. We agree; we also believe that reaching closer agreement about what these Principles mean for the staff at Oak Hill suggests that the Principles will be more useful to the school. <p>	 Throughout the school we see growing evidence that many teachers are working to interpret the Principles in their own classrooms and departments; they are finding out what "teacher-as-coach, student-as-worker" means, and what it means to generalize, by assuming a variety of rolesmentors, seminar leaders, staff meeting coordinators, interdisciplinary team members, special ed/regular ed team members. A growing number of teachers are experimenting with more authentic forms of assessment in their classes, and the senior class is about to deliver their culminating Exhibitions for the first time. Teachers are beginning to struggle to better understand what "less is more" means for their curriculum.  <p>	We'd like this time to consider the seventh Common Principle:<p><blockquote><B>The tone of the school should </B>explicitly and self-consciously stress values of unanxious expectation ("I won't threaten you but I expect much of you"), of <B>trust</B> (until abused), and of <B>decency</B> (the values of fairness, generosity, and tolerance). Incentives appropriate to the school's particular students and teachers should be emphasized, and parents should be treated as essential collaborators. </blockquote>	During our fall visit, we asked staff how they interpreted this Principle. Most staff commented only on the phrase "unanxious expectations," and suggested that they found the phrase untenable, because they felt anxiety helps to motivate kids. Several teachers mentioned that the school had already dealt with this principle in mainstreaming its students. A couple of staff suggested that they had not begun to deal with this Principlethat they had not yet had conversations about what makes a school decent or about how they might have higher expectations for all kids without causing some students to feel defeated.<p><blockquote>I think we often misread the friendliness, the congeniality, and the affability around here as some signal that we really are connecting with kids. I think some people assume that this is a school where we are friendly and that means we have that Principle under control from day one. I would argue that we don't. The kids have told us that they are put down by some teachers. Then, I think we disagree as a staff about how much responsibility adolescents can really handle. I am not saying that children should have the ability to decide everything. But, we are going to have trouble creating an authentic Congress if we don't agree that we should say to the kids that we do believe that they can learn and that we are going to hold them responsible for it. </blockquote>	No one mentioned the aspect of the Principle which defines parents' roles as "essential collaborators."<p>	It seems to us that there is evidence that the tone of the school is sometimes harsh rather than decent, that high expectations do not apply to all students, and that parents are thought of with the friendly distrust so common across the country. While students talk regularly about issues related to the positive tone and qualities of decency in the school, while they tell us that their school is a good place and that their teachers care about them, that they benefit from the small size, that the administration seems to hear them and to respond to their concerns, they also tell us fairly often that many students feel unfairly treated.<p>	During each visit, students have talked about feeling labeled or pigeonholed. They believe that they are stereotyped by gender, by family affiliation, or by previous performance. They provided examples which illustrate that they feel intimidated by adult jokes or comments. While we are aware that students seem to have a highly developed sense of fairness and that they are often unable to consider complex issues from teachers' perspectives, we also believe that issues raised again and again from a range of students warrant some careful consideration on the part of staff regarding the tone of the school. <p>	Parents and students both talked about honors courses as another indicator that the school holds different expectations for some students. They are aware that some teachers do not have high expectations for all students, that some teachers believe that faculty should use academic performance as the basis for selecting students for honors courses. Students and parents both want more access for students to honors courses; they believe that if kids are motivated to try, that faculty should be willing to work with them.  Parents also suggested that they are very interested to find ways to better support the school and to get information from teachers about what they are doing. They loved being involved in the Senior Options Program and would like more opportunity to interact with the students and staff.<p>	We think the staff would benefit from a more thorough discussion of this Principle. The following questions might prove provocative: What does it mean to this staff to create a culture of unanxious expectations for all students? How might teachers create a stronger tone of decency in the school? What are the characteristics of decency? What policies and/or practices might teachers develop to communicate that they have high expectations for all students? How might parents be involved as essential collaborators in a way that is productive for staff? <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wdif"><h3>Where Does  Instruction Fit?</h3><P>During our previous visit to Oak Hill, we asked the faculty whether discussing instruction has a central role in their efforts to change. Most said no. The exceptions were when people work on interdisciplinary teams, or when faculty work with the special education staff. One person noted that people within their department were swapping more instructional techniques than they had before. We asked the question because we have made two observations: (1) staff seem far more concerned with curriculum and assessment than with teaching strategies; and (2) in classrooms where teachers consider all threecurriculum, instruction, and assessmentas an interconnected whole, the changes the teachers are making seem much more powerful to both parents and students than when teachers consider only one or two components.<p>	When teachers change the instructional strategy but do not think about the complementary nature of the other two components, the effects are less powerful for kids. When teachers change the curriculum, but proceed with standard teaching practices and assessment measures, kids are less powerfully engaged. <p>	Consider Mary Shea's moon-tracking activity. In the past, she had kids read the chapter on the moon, do the vocabulary exercises and the lab activities as suggested in the book, and then she gave them a test, reminding them that all of this would be on the SBEE. When she decided to try a different approach, she developed sheets for tracking progress, she explained the assignment, got the kids collecting data, and then began during class to help them learn terms they needed and helped them to adjust and make sense of their data. When they finished the unit, they handed in a database as well as a report which analyzed the data and showed their conclusions. This particular assignment seemed more worthwhile to both kids and parentsmore authentic, more engagingthan the usual assignments. This is<CITE> not </CITE>to suggest, by any means, that new strategies in any one of these three essential components alone are ineffectual, but it is to say that the power of the experience seems to us to increase in direct relationship to complementary shifts in all three dimensions. <p>	We have learned from previous work with teachers in Essential schools that considering all three aspects of the learning experience simultaneously becomes necessary when they get involved in serious change. Teachers tell us that deciding to change the curriculum goals from coverage to depth eventually forces them to shift teaching strategies, and that shift causes them to reexamine their usual assessments. We have also learned from these teachers that considering all three at once runs counter to their previous experience.<p>	For many years, they used quite linear processes. First, they considered the curriculumwhat to teach. Once that was decided, they considered instructionhow they would teach the curriculum. Finally, teachers thought about how to assess student learning. Teachers also indicate that most of them drew from a terribly limited bag of strategies for both instructional and assessment techniques. When analyzing current practices for heightened student engagement and for evidence that students are using their minds well, teachers tell us that they begin to recognize that in order to achieve these ends, all threecurriculum, instruction, and assessmentmust change. <p>	The following questions are suggested to help staff think about the interrelation of these three dimensions of teaching: What kinds of changes are you making? Which dimensionscurriculum, pedagogy, and assessmentdo you usually think about changing? What happens to the other two? How often do you consider all three? <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wru"><h3>What Role, Uncertainty?</h3><P>This leads us to consider the relationship of uncertainty to the redesign of schools. In his book, <CITE>Teaching: Making Sense of an Uncertain Craft </CITE>(Teachers College Press, 1992), Joe McDonald makes the point that, for years, researchers and teachers alike have been trying to make teaching a <CITE>certain </CITE>craft when it is, in fact, fraught with uncertainty. Joe suggests that embracing the inherent uncertainty in teaching is as necessary as understanding that uncertainty is an integral part of any learning experience. <p>	At Oak Hill, we see that teachers are disconcerted by uncertainty, and we see that uncertainty is part of learning new techniques. Whenever any of us tries something new, the inevitable uncertainty produces discomfort. In fact, to learn to do something in a new way, everyone must pass through some measure of uncertainty in order to gain new understandings. Teachers at Oak Hill who are attempting change suggest to us that when experimenting with new techniques, they frequently feel disappointed with students whose work did not appear as promising as teachers had hoped. Teachers also express a kind of skepticism toward suggestions that enduring the agony of changing practices will pay off in improved student performance. <p>	We agree, however, with Dr. Goodman that the discomfort teachers feel often results from their own uncertainty about how actually to do something new. We agree with him, too, when he suggested that new practices often seem unproductive because teachers have not yet built the kinds of support structures which kids need in order to complete new activities well.<p>	Dr. Goodman acknowledged that those strategies are built over time, as teachers analyze the relationship between kids' performance, the daily activities taking place in classrooms, and the hoped-for outcome, and then refine the information and the support they give to kids to help them accomplish the task. We are reminded of early teaching experiences, and heartened by our observation that most teachers do accomplish more each time they refine a new unit or an instructional strategy. <p>	The majority of kids at Oak Hill talked most about those lessons which involve them in fresh approaches and which are challenging to themdebates in history, reading and analyzing rather than recalling in English, Exhibitions in economics, Mr. Walters' end-of-the-year grading conference, and the marble-rolling activity in the physics and technology classes. We would ask staff to consider the following questions: When trying something new, what kind of support were students given in order to help them understand how to do the task? How might stronger supports be built so that students are able to do what teachers hope for? <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="hdcwiwisl"><h3>How does Change Wend its Way into Students' Lives?</h3><P>Again, we acknowledge with pleasure how much is going on in the school, what a vibrant place it is. More faculty are thinking, talking, experimenting, refining their common practices, working to better support students. Every time we come, we see progress. Still, despite a good deal of innovation by a number of faculty, students' experiences at Oak Hill High School are more often than not very much like those of kids in high schools everywhere. "School stays pretty much the same," they tell us. "Our job here is to listen, to sit and listen, sometimes to fill in the blanks." Another student expresses a cynical, resigned attitude toward the school's change efforts:<p><blockquote>I'm really beginning to think that the administration is trying to take the Coalition and twist it to their own game, and not make the school better. I think they are just making a few cosmetic changes and that the nine Common Principles are not being fully implemented. Unfortunately, we're never going to know if they would be good or not because we'll never see them fully implemented.</blockquote> <p>	Parents debated whether they see evidence in their children's experiences of the kinds of things the school says it is doing. They wondered how long it will take before their kids are more than sporadically involved in engaging work; they wondered whether engaging learning will spread beyond the classrooms of a few dynamic teachers. The parents with whom we talked acknowledged that it takes time, but they wonder whether their kids will miss out. <p>	We agree with Dr. Goodman, who observed in the spring that change was more evident for the adults than for the students. Many of the changes under way affect teachers' lives, but do not yet touch students' experiences. Teachers go to visit other schools, or talk with visitors who come to Oak Hill, or make presentations for the SDE. They spend release days with department colleagues talking about what might be possible, and time in faculty meetings deciding what the faculty's goals will be for the next year. Most of the faculty talked with enthusiasm about having a more vigorous work life than they had before, about feelings of renewed energy. In contrast, many students continued to indicate that they spend much of their time engaged in very familiar, routinized activities. <p>	We sense that the faculty is growing ever stronger in their agreement to rethink their practices in order to benefit kids. We also believe that both students and parents are enthusiastic about the fresh and challenging approaches which do reach students. Kids would like more of these, and so would their parents. The questions are: How long does it take for better practices to reach the students' experience? How might the faculty ensure that the changes they are making have more direct effects for students?<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tam:hmohft"><h3>Time and Money: How Might Oak Hill Find That?</h3><P>Of course, related to the staff's ability to push ever harder and deeper for change is the issue of time. Staff continue to say that they need more time to work collaboratively, to be thoughtful, to plan together, to watch each other, to reflect, to rethink, to explore. As evidence of their sincere hope for more time, they have continued over the last five years to revise their schedule. Our sense, however, is, that the issue of staff planning time is not actually under consideration when the schedule is revised. Our guess is that faculty look at planning time as a management/labor issue, as it was in the early seventies. Our hunch is that staff are suggesting that the issue of planning time is a responsibility of the administration, and that they are hoping that the administration will provide them with more planning time. We do not know if the administration has the capacity to do this, nor do we know, really, whether we are reading this accurately. The questions that come to mind here are about the faculty's capacity: What prevents staff from organizing more regular planning time for their work? What difficult decisions might staff have to tackle in order to deal with the issue of planning time for themselves?<p><hr><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr><p><a href="../../../projects/sc/chanlong.htm">Appendix A: About the School Change Study</a><br><a href="../../../principl/principl.htm">Appendix B: The Common Principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools</a><br><a href="../list.htm#2">Return to Index of School Change Publications</a><p></body></html>

Returning in the fall of 1993 for our fifth visit to Oak Hill high School, we enjoyed seeing everyone, now a familiar group of friends. We were beginning our third and final year of watching and learning from the parents, students, teachers, and administrators in the school. Our intention was to create a "snapshot," based on our observations and conversations during this visit, that would capture recent progress and current problems at the school. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rp"><h3>Recent Progress</h3><p>When we came for this fifth visit, we noted steady progress in a variety of areas.<p>	Almost everyone among the faculty and students said they like the new schedule. This schedule, the second we have seen in three years, rotates to provide two days of double-blocked periods; a third day which provides for the Student-Faculty Congress (in which students and faculty participate in shared decision making), special activities, and Seminars (weekly student advisory periods); and two other days of regular forty-minute periods. <p>	The Congress continued to grapple with policy to support students' academic priorities and to provide a respectful environment in which they can work. After several years of debate about the eligibility process, students pointed out that it provides incentives to a limited clienteleathletesand does not support students who may be equally in need of motivation. Because of an incident of artwork vandalism, a new committee on student respect was formed. In addition, staff continued to help state department people define the New Partnership for Better Schools, the state's effort to restructure schools.<p>	As always, a number of teachers told us that they are refining or expanding their own instructional repertoires. A number are using portfolios. Parents, teachers, and students suggested that they do not yet see the benefit of the portfolios. Several teachers noted that they are now ready to move to the next stage: examining their applications. Two new teachers joined the staff and by all reports were settling in well. Emily Francis, now retired, is teaching history to the teachers through a community education program. The two French teachers decided to team teach French 5. While Joan Tinot  said she wants to read fewer stories in French 5, Mary Lahton wants to read as many as possible. Their differences embody the dilemma: depth or coverage?<p>	The ninth- and tenth-grade English/social studies teams began working on building an integrated curriculum for the first time. Kara Capraro, Marge Michaels, and Abby Steiner recognized that some of their students were ready to move on in <cite>Julius Caesar</cite>, while others needed more work understanding Shakespeare's language. These teachers found that by dividing the class, they had more flexibility to respond to students' varying needs. Katie Moore, the new ninth-grade teacher, told us she wants to use Rushdie's <cite>Haroun and the Sea of Stories </cite>to teach students about plot. Tom Lacer, striving for balance between the disciplines, wants to use the book to build students' understanding of the historical context in India. Other adjustments and changes, too many to mention here, were in the works.<p>	Course 1 in mathematics joined others this year in replacing the state board of education exams (SBEE) with a teacher-generated assessment. Similarly, other teachers have been redesigning portions of the SBEE for greater student application in earth science, French, and biology, much as the chemistry teachers did previously. <p>	The school seemed to have a regular hum of activity, a greater sense of confidence about work under way. But, as with any gathering of people and ideas, there were problems too. Well along on their journey toward having a better school, some of the students and staff feel things have been going well, that the gains made are beneficial to students; others do not agree. As the staff have begun to assess their progress, differing views have become more apparent, and for some, more troublesome. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fts"><h3>Focusing the Snapshot</h3><p>This snapshot focuses on answering two interrelated, essential questions that the staff at Oak Hill have begun asking: Are we really helping the students to use their minds better? How do we know that what we are doing is improving the quality of student experience? We would like to approach these questions by first reviewing what the staff told us they were shooting for: the ideal Oak Hill graduate. We would then like to put these indicators of ideal graduates to work by using them as guides when we look into two classrooms and hear students' descriptions of unchallenging work. Using these indicators in this way, we suggest a process in which we can begin to answer the questions the staff have been asking. We would then like to describe the review processes already under way at the school as well as the increasingly troublesome divisiveness among staff. We conclude the snapshot with our own reflections about what we saw, heard, and learned during our visit.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="anata"><h3>A Note about the Activities</h3><p>We have designed this snapshot, like the previous ones, to be interactive, by asking that the Oak Hill staff take time to gather their individual responses while reading. At the end of every section, we include a suggested activity for the staff. We hope the staff will come together after making their individual responses to arrive at some collective conclusions. <p>	One of the frequent comments made by the faculty during this visit was that whole-group faculty meetings are not particularly productive for meaningful discussion. We were told that some individuals sometimes dominate, that others choose not to talk in front of large groups, and that frequently any issue can turn into a complaint session. While the staff has been reticent to break up into smaller groups in the past, perhaps such groups are needed to ensure that everyone participates, and to provide all with the opportunity to engage in meaningful dialogue. Reporting processes can be used so that each group benefits from the work of others; at the same time, small-group processes can be used to ensure that individual groups are not dominated by a particular point of view and that they do not deteriorate into frustrating complaining sessions.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="i:aig"><hr><center><h2>I: An Ideal Graduate</h2></center><hr>In recent years, the Oak Hill staff has been engaged in a process which Coalition senior researcher Joe McDonald calls "planning backwards." This process involves envisioning what a high school graduate should know and be able to do, and then planning the school program with the aim of attaining that goal. In the midst of their commitment to implement the nine Common Principles, the staff at Oak Hill have had several discussions about what an ideal graduate would know and be able to do. In the fall, we asked people to describe these to us again.<p>	Once a simple set of indicators is agreed upon by staff, these indicators can be used to plan and assess the quality of existing programs and daily activities. A critical component of any good evaluative process is clarity about the goals to be achieved. <p>	<b>Teachers suggested that an ideal Oak Hill graduate should be:</b><p><ul>	<li>	a lifelong learner<p>	<li>	a good communicator, verbally, aurally, and in writing<p>	<li>	a critical thinker<p>	<li>	a risk taker<p>	<li>	creative<p>	<li>	a good calculator, able to check his or her work<p>	<li>	able to present a thoughtful and convincing point of view<p>	<li>	able to assess pros and cons<p>	<li>	able to reason, question, conclude<p>	<li>	able to defend his or her work <p>	<li>	able to learn independently<p>	<li>	possessed of ethics, respect for others, and an awareness of the surrounding community<p>	<li>	able to make connections to the world around him or her<p>	<li>	able to take and hold an unconventional stand<p>	<li>	able to read and understand the <cite>New York Times </cite><p>	<li>	able to work productively in a group<p>	<li>	persistent<p></ul><p><b>	Students said that an ideal graduate should:</b><p><ul>	<li>	be prepared for college<p>	<li>	have good basic skills<p>	<li>	know what he wants, how to get it, and how to take care of himself<p>	<li>	long for learning and continue to learn, whether going to college or to a job<p>	<li>	be able to convince others of a point of view<p>	<li>	understand the way the world works.

We observed in an English class and a humanities class to look for evidence that these goals are being fostered.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="aec"><h3>An English Class</h3><p>The following excerpt from Mr. Walters' junior English class provides us with a glimpse into the development of analytical reading.<p>	At the beginning of the class, Mr. Walters reads the bulletin and then casts <cite>The Crucible</cite>. There are fifteen students in the class, twelve girls and three boys. He assigns to students various parts, such as Reverend Hale, Tituba, John Proctor, Mary Warren, describing in brief each character and asking for volunteers. Then, Mr. Walters moves on to a discussion of the book <cite>Ethan Frome</cite>. The plan is to discuss two passages of <cite>Ethan Frome </cite>which he assigned as paper topics. The papers, he said, were full of strong opinions which were not backed up by close textual analysis. He begins, "Ground rules for the day: What elevates authors from the mundane is the level of diction. Wharton has her own clear, in some ways like Hemingway, sparse writing style." <p>	Sitting in the front of the class, as the students sit in desks before him, he reads aloud the part when Ethan and Mattie return home to find the key out of its usual place. Mr. Walters asks, "What do you notice about the construction of the scene, the language?" Students make references to images of death, such as the crepe streamers.<p>Tom:<blockquote> He followed in his wife's wake?</blockquote>Mr. Walters:<blockquote> When I tell you we explore words connotatively, never be satisfied, because you never know what you're going to discover.</blockquote>Tom:<blockquote> There are two meanings to <cite>wake</cite>, one refers to the event associated with a funeral.</blockquote>Mr. Walters:<blockquote> What does the image connote to you besides death?</blockquote>Tom:<blockquote> That he follows her shadow?</blockquote>Mr. Walters:<blockquote> Can we tighten that up?</blockquote>	Students throw out words like <cite>concession, obedience</cite>, and <cite>submission </cite>that depict Ethan's relationship to his wife. Mr. Walters responds, "To some degree, when she goes, he automatically follows. She talks about the image of a ship's wake."<p>	He then refers to the previous day's discussion on determinism and to their papers. <p><blockquote>Some of you have to be more decisive. If you are going to say that he is weak-willed, then what you are talking about is a character flaw and not determinism.</blockquote><blockquote>I want to digress for a moment. Greek tragedy is totally fatalistic. We all know death is coming. You've all read a Shakespeare play. In Shakespearean tragedy, Shakespeare is already injecting the idea of free willthere may be certain fatalistic things, but there may also be certain choices. So we have a conflict about how much man controls. In <cite>Ethan Frome </cite>you have a similar tone. Is his life pre-planned, so that he can't make a choice, or is it something in him that prevents him from doing so?</blockquote>	They go back to the meaning of the phrase "heavy with dreams." Mr. Walters says, "The dream is to run away with Mattie. What's the heaviness of it? What's the reality?" Students say that the reality is his wife Zena.<p>Mr. Walters:<blockquote> There is a very curious word at the very end. Zena says something to him which symbolically comments on the state of their marriage.</blockquote>Janet:<blockquote> The fire is out long ago.</blockquote>Mr. Walters:<blockquote> The house is cold, all of this adds up to a portrait, where, if you were writing about it, Ethan comes home with this fantasy of this night with Mattie to the reality of a house which is dead, cold, passionless.</blockquote>	He switches to the last scene, in which the sled crashes into the tree. Students are yelling out about Mattie, her character and motivation. <p>Mr. Walters:<blockquote> One of our goals over time is to be able to refer back between books so you see the heritage that is owed. If you were going to connect this to a Shakespearean play, who could Mattie be?</blockquote>A student:<blockquote> Juliet with the death pact.</blockquote>Mr. Walters:<blockquote> The suicide scene, where they coast down the hill and eventually hit the tree and then they are sprawled in the snow after the collision, was also loaded with all sorts of things. What did you find?</blockquote>	When Nancy mentions several fatalistic words in the passage, he agrees. Then he asks, "What is the elm tree doing?"<p>	"Looming!"<p>	"Look at the word <cite>loom</cite>. Do you know where the word <cite>loom </cite>comes from? From the Three Fates who on the loom of life weave your pattern of existence. So a word like <cite>looming </cite>immediately alludes to fatalism. Remember what he hears, both before and after the collision?"<p>	A student suggests, "The horse is hungry."<p>	Mr. Walters adds, "If the horse is hungry and Ethan should feed him, what is the horse a symbol of?"<p>	"Responsibility," answers a student.<p>	"We'll finish this up tomorrow."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="saii"><table border><tr><td><h3>Suggested Activity II: An English Class</h3>After reading this brief excerpt and keeping in mind that analyzing an individual class has definite limitations, answer the following questions:<p>A. What are the students being asked to do? What skills and thinking processes does this class require? What role did the teacher play?<p>B. Given that this is a single lesson within a particular unit of study, what evidence can you see that students will gain the kinds of experiences they need to become ideal graduates?<p>C. What kinds of experiences do students need in school to engage in deep textual reading?<p></td></table><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ahc"><h3>A Humanities Class </h3><p>Let's take a look at another discussion conducted in a single classroom, this time in the senior humanities course.<p>	It is the day after a field trip into the city. Students have read Ayn Rand's book, <cite>The Fountainhead</cite>. On the field trip, they went to look at the Chrysler Building, the Stock Exchange, and a new luxury development called Battery Park City. The class is team-taught by Rick Jones, the English teacher, and Warren Sagor, the social studies teacher. They have been teaming for eleven years. Students and parents reported that the class is extremely popular because of the integrated approach. One student told us, <p><blockquote>For me, I like humanities because you talk about art, architecture, and literature. And you talk about a whole lot of things, and it is an exposure to something that you don't get exposed to unless your parents are writers, or humanitarians. That is really the important part of learning to me, to get as much exposure as possible. I am an analytical person. I like to draw my own conclusions. </blockquote>	As the students come in, Mr. Jones hands out a copy of an article that suggests that Alan Greenspan, director of the Federal Reserve, was significantly influenced by Ayn Rand's economic theories. Showing pictures of the buildings they saw, he suggests that he was pleased with the field trip. Justin, a student, refers to the new complex: "The buildings seemed to be kind of traditional but modern at the same time."<p>Warren:<blockquote> Did they blend?</blockquote>Tony:<blockquote> They designed it to blend into the city.</blockquote>Alexis:<blockquote> They seemed isolated from the city. They didn't blend. </blockquote>	A girl arrives latelateness is not appreciated. Mr. Sagor asks Mr. Jones to carry the conversation while he talks to the girl in the hall. The students continue without Mr. Jones having to say a word. <p>Tony:<blockquote> The architect was a separatist, an elitist. It used to be low-income housing, but they moved all the poor people out. It was an ostentatious show of wealth. </blockquote>Tina:<blockquote> It shows the diversity in the city where the wealthy are. They have security guards and stuff.</blockquote>Another girl:<blockquote> The wealthy are trying to isolate themselves from others. I did not see a lot of people there.</blockquote>Mr. Sagor: <blockquote> You mean minorities?</blockquote>Charles:<blockquote> I did not see that the apartment prices were out of line. They were $1200 per month. Initially apartments are much higher when they are new because the builders are paying the buildings off. </blockquote>	The kids debate whether $1200 is reasonable. Mr. Sagor and Mr. Jones offer comparisons to help the kids get a more realistic sense of the price. <p>Jerry:<blockquote> Battery Park City has its own security force, its own streets, its own shops. It isn't designed to blend with the rest of the city. They created their own! </blockquote>Justin:<blockquote> Everybody should have the ability to live there; the city is built on blood money.</blockquote>Mr. Sagor:<blockquote> What reward is there for hard work?</blockquote>Mr. Jones:<blockquote> Twelve hundred dollars a month in the city is reasonable.</blockquote>Mr. Sagor:<blockquote> People from Harlem cannot generally afford such a reasonable rate. </blockquote>	The discussion, heated, moves fast, erupts into multiple voices, returns to a general discussion. <p>	"Who does rent control serve, anyway?<p>	"Things have to be available to everybody."<p>	"I can't build a building unless I can pay for it!"<p>	"It's open to the public."<p>	"Just because it's open to the public doesn't mean that everybody has access to it. Not everybody can afford those kinds of stores." <p>	Mr. Jones comments occasionally. Mr. Sagor prevents one student from dominating. They move to a discussion of a gifted public high school in the city.<p>	"A school for a privileged few in the city."<p>	"The already privileged!"<p>	"A school for kids who are interested in working hard!"<p>	"Kids come from all over the city." <p>	Back and forth, they debate the legitimacy of public space for those who can afford it or for the elite. During a split second lull, Mr. Sagor waves the article. "Take a minute to read this, folks. The problems that Ayn Rand articulated in the forties still exist today. Read this quickly." <p>	The students, however, are not done discussing one of their favorite topics, the notion of first- and second-handers. Ayn Rand suggests that there are two types of people in the world, those who create their own reality and those who plug into the reality around them. <p>	Tim says, "I don't think we need a world of first-handers. We need second-handers. I don't want the main character bagging his own food. I want to save him for architecture."<p>	"We can't have a world full of second-handers either."<p>	"I don't think there are second-handers."<p>	"I don't see what being a grocery bagger has to do with being a first-hander. It's a stereotype."<p>	"You don't have to think to be a grocery bagger."<p>	"You can't really say that small jobs are second-handers. Effort constitutes a first-hand job."<p>	"How do we know that people working in quarries aren't first-handers?"<p>	"According to Ayn's philosophy you have to be one or the other."<p>	"She never says that first-handers had to solve the problems."<p>	"The world leaders are all first-handers!"<p>	Mr. Jones jumps in. "You are struggling with issues of talent and social mobility."<p>Mr. Sagor:<blockquote> The article in the paper says that 60 percent of kids copy others' work in school. Second-handers.</blockquote>Charles:<blockquote> I want to argue whether a first-hander even exists.</blockquote>Mr. Jones:<blockquote> Are you suggesting that we have no free will? Ayn Rand says that we do. Thoreau was an individualist. He lived a separate life. If you want to be free you may have to give up some comforts.</blockquote>Tanya:<blockquote> I don't think that you have to live in the woods. People can have their own ideas. Roark's history is avoided. She is saying that once you become an adult, you have the right to become an individualist, to exercise free will.</blockquote>Mr. Sagor:<blockquote> This article is about Rand's philosophy and the debates she had with Alan Greenspan about the detriments of inflation. </blockquote>	There is a pause while everyone reads the article. Mr. Jones offers some predictions about the growth of poverty in this country. Students ask how those predictions are made. Mr. Sagor switches to his economics hat and asks the kids what inflation is. Mr. Jones asks why inflation is detrimental. In between the students' responses, the teachers offer interesting information and ask more questions, such as, "What does supply and demand have to do with inflation?"<p>	"A nearby town has the fourth largest supply of unused office space in the country."<p>	Tony laments, "It makes me wonder even more why they want to fill the river in."<p>	"What land is most valuable?"<p>	"Waterfront!"<p>	"Right now we are at a record low on inflation. We are at 2.2 percent. The social security recipients will get the lowest increase since 198687."<p>	A student asks, "How does Greenspan control inflation?"<p>	"Prime rate!" someone yells.<p>	"That's right. He controls it through the Federal Reserve interest rates. The prime rate is what the Federal Reserve sets to control the cost of borrowing money. By raising the prime rate, he keeps inflation down." <p>	More examples, questions: they move on to discuss the cost of colleges, what tuition really pays for, and why the costs are increasing so muchuntil the bell rings.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="saiii"><table border><tr><td><h3>Suggested Activity III: A Humanities Class</h3><p>A.

As a follow-up to comments made by students in previous snapshots, the staff asked us to find out from students what they mean when they say that much of the work they do at school is often not challenging. <p>	Students suggest that the following kinds of activities do not develop their skills:<p><blockquote>When you do a certain amount of reading and then there is a summary of the reading at the endfour or five main points. Then there are a whole bunch of questions, and you don't even have to do the reading to answer the question. All you have to do is look at the summary. Sometimes, the answers are often stated word for word. This kind of work is really "go find the right answer," rather than think about it or defend it or come up with something that shows it.</blockquote><blockquote>Doing dittos is ridiculous. A teacher telling me to find fluff for a paper if I couldn't put enough substance in it. Doing science and math problems. Once I know how to do them, they aren't challenging. Some teachers make you do all the problems. I like it better when Mr. Nelson tells us to do as many as we need to understand. I think that formulas are the death of active minds. I would prefer to know where each individual part came from and understand how they relate, but some teachers say that you just have to assign values and plug in formulas. We call ourselves the "numbers pluggers," because we don't understand the equations, but we just plug them in and get the right answer. So in some ways, teachers have to teach kids where the formulas come from so that whenever the kid uses a formula, he understands why it works.</blockquote><blockquote>In some of my classes, we've covered whole topics and I understand none of it, not really. We just go over things, do the labs, take the tests, and move on. I can get the answers on the test, but I don't really know how the things work.</blockquote><blockquote>I think the work we do here in the first two years is less challenging than in later classes. When you are asked to answer five questions and the answers are right there in the book, that doesn't take any skill. You don't even have to read the chapter. You read the question and look in the chapter where it talks about that and write the answer down.</blockquote><blockquote>Kids are challenged here to get good grades. Well, Ive never had a strong desire for high grades. I like to <cite>do </cite>things that mean something. I never did see the point to a lot of the things I did in high school, like I never saw any connection in math like proofs. They took so long to do, and we would get down to the end and I would look at it, and there wasn't any satisfaction at all getting two things to equal each other. I could never see how I was going to go out in the work force and use that. </blockquote><blockquote>Repetitiveness, doing the same thing over and over and over, gets really boring, whether it's writing or reading book after book. Once you know what the teacher wants and can do that, you don't have to think. Reading and writing need to be combined to be challengingotherwise it is just spitting things out. And sometimes all we have to do is memorize vocabularyto do well on a test. We can get good grades without knowing anything about it.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="saiv"><table border><tr><td><h3>Suggested Activity IV: Unchallenging Work</h3>A.

In several staff meetings, the faculty confirmed that review is an important focus for their current work. During our visit, we learned that several review processes were in progress. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rtsp"><h3>Reviewing the Seminar Program</h3><p>A number of faculty participated in a two-day summer workshop to review the Seminar program, a specific period held once a week to enable students to deal with student government. In addition, it is hoped that the small group of age-alike students and their Seminar teacher, who stays with them until they graduate, would form a closer support group for each student in the school. The review was attended by six staff and two administrators. The central issue under consideration was whether typical Seminar activitiesreports on Congresswere compelling enough, and whether these accomplished the intention of Seminar. The group debated the placement of the Community Service program since it was replaced last year by the Investigate program, the senior Exhibition project.1 The committee determined that rather than adding community service to the Seminar program at the junior level, which would involve additional planning for Seminar teachers, they would add a component of moral development. Elsa Wasserman, from the ATLAS project, and Tom Lacona, author of a book on moral development, are due to provide some training for staff in the coming winter. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rtip"><h3>Reviewing the Investigate Program</h3><p>A second review of the Investigate program took place over the summer. Seniors were expected last year, for the first time, to graduate by an Exhibition of their skills and abilities. Students selected an internship or a research topic, kept a journal, wrote a research report, prepared and delivered a public presentation, and defended their work when asked questions by the review panel. They were given Wednesdays during the winter term and a month at the end of the year to work full time on this project. Each was supported by a mentor teacher and evaluated by a team of reviewers, including other students, teachers, and community members. At the end of the first year's work, Mark Thomas and Esther Young, the coordinators of the program, met with the students, the mentor teachers, a parent group, and the community evaluators to review the project. <p>	Collectively, they named the program and determined that it was an excellent cure for "senioritis." Still, while everyone was pleased with the first attempt, they agreed that a number of aspects of the program needed strengthening. The research component was not strong enough, and the expectations for the research need to be more carefully outlined for students. The Wednesday release time didn't work for either the students of the sponsoring individuals or organizations. A number of adjustments were made for this current year. <p>	Students clarified that they did not like being "guinea pigs" but were glad they were able to do what they did. They agreed it was a nicer ending to their senior year. They did not "slither out of the school," but rather were able to show their stuff. They would have liked to attend more presentations of other students. Most suggested that they benefited from the experience: for some it confirmed their direction, for others it confirmed that they would choose another path after high school. All felt that pursuing topics of their own choosing was very compelling and fitting. When we interviewed four of the graduates recently during their winter break, they described the Investigate program, like their extracurricular programs, as enormously productive for them. Students from this class will sit on the review teams of the presentations in June, thereby fulfilling a new requirement added this year. <p>	Parents we interviewed were extremely positive about the Investigate program. Those whose children had participated were very pleased with the amount of work their kids did. One parent described her daughter's experience: <p><blockquote>She did a lot of research for her project. She enjoyed working at the Center, tutoring male adults. It gave her an opportunity to refresh her own memory about math, and it helped her to put her own weakness in math in perspective. She learned about the federal budget and about adult literacy. It was a good focus for her because she was kind of tired of school; it helped to get her through. </blockquote>	This parent thought that her daughter is better prepared for college than her older sister, who graduated several years earlier. One father agreed that the standards in the school have risen. Those who had students facing the Investigate program were already discussing possible topics with their children. All of the parents wished that such independent study had occurred more regularly in the kids' four years of high school. Based on the various levels of review and the adjustments made to the Investigate program, the coordinators felt that it will be stronger this year than last. <p>	The tenth-grade English and social studies team (Kara Capraro, Marge Michaels, Abby Steiner, Jim Goodman, and Emily Francis) also engaged in a review of the Exhibitions conducted at the end of the sophomore year. For their Exhibitions, students were asked to select three great figures from history and to compare their various philosophies and their contributions to contemporary times by researching, writing a script, delivering their presentation, and defending their interpretations when asked questions by the audience.<p>	When all of the Exhibitions were completed, the teachers asked each student to write a reflective review, which we read. Some students found doing their Exhibition very meaningful; others wondered about the value of depth versus breadth: would they be handicapped because they learned everything about one figure and hardly anything about others? A number indicated that it was more difficult than the SBEE test; several suggested that they would rather take the test. Some wondered whether working in groups was productive. One student noted that he spent more time on costumes and prompts than he did learning about his character. The teachers read these, watched all of the tapes of the presentations, and then set about determining the weaknesses and strengths of the project. <p>	Staff agreed that while the presentations varied in quality, the proof of how much kids knew was revealed in their ability to answer questions from the audience. They ascertained that kids are not used to either presenting or defending their work. As a result, there will be a greater focus on building the skills in oral presentation and defense. One parent, a professional in presentation, agreed to provide significant support. The assignment description and the scoring guides were revised to give students clearer understandings of the expectations. In addition, the staff decided that the students will watch and discuss videotapes from last year's presentations to build their own understandings about quality. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="oor"><h3>Other Ongoing Reviews</h3><p>Prompted by a week-long work session with the state board of education staff, Mary Shea spent much of her summer reviewing the test scores from the earth science course and revising a component of the SBEE exam for students. The new component asks students at the end of each term to apply skills recently developed, while engaged in a year-long discussion about planets which might prove reasonable substitutes to the earth. In order to do that, she read and worked to develop a coherent philosophy of science education from all of the reports which are emerging about the need for different instructional and curricular approaches. <p>	Certainly, there are other ongoing reviews about which we know less. The French exchange program undergoes a yearly review by students, parents, and staff. In addition, the staff has reviewed and revised the new schedule since we visited. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="frttr"><h3>Faculty Reactions to the Reviews</h3><p>With all of these reviews in progress, a few members of the staff have been dissatisfied. <p><blockquote>My essential question is, "Where is the proof?" When the proof is there, I'll be on the bandwagon. So far, the only proof is subjective: "I think the kids are learning better." The core of my discomfort is that the focus of this school, which should be success, is, instead, change. Change is not an end, it is a means. In this school we have books on counters with "Look how much we're changing!" Who cares if the school is getting worse? You hear all of the things about "using your minds well." I'm not sure people here know what intellectual demand is. We should be able to talk about this, but we can't because people get very, very defensive. When the focus of the school is change, what it comes down to is, the more change we have, the conclusion is, the better the school is.</blockquote>	Another claimed that staff coherence depends on agreement about the effectiveness of their work: <p><blockquote>Until we really look at what's going on, we won't pull together. Last year some of us watched Exhibitions but weren't asked to critique. Some of what I saw was drivel. Since people don't have time to discuss quality, they begin to see everything as awful. </blockquote>	Some, implying that there has been an unwillingness to discuss the SAT scores, claimed that the scores are dropping and should be discussed. Others suggested there should be whole-faculty discussions about the quality of the work being done. It has been staff, perhaps, that have been the most affected by the divisiveness. <p>	Another teacher offered another perspective: <p><blockquote>People who don't like the changes are defining the Coalition in terms of changes that actually leave you with less rigor, more touchy-feely, "if-it-feels-okay-you-pass," no standards, lack of responsibility. Everything that could possibly be seen as negative is seen as a Coalition change, and somehow, because there isn't a way to look at whether things are better, whether children are learning more, whether they really have more information, there's no way to counter that publicly. I want to be able to talk about this. If there is truth to the critique, then I want to hear it. If there isn't, then I don't want to hear about it anymore. I don't want it nagging away at what's going on. Somehow, people have got to be willing to stand up and say, "This is what I'm doing now that I didn't do before and here is the difference I see in the kids."</blockquote>	We heard these complaints from a relatively small group. As a result, it is difficult for us to tell whether the reviews under way are unsatisfactory to them, or whether they simply have not been informed about them. It is also appears that people were asking to review only new programs, projects, and classroom techniques, rather than all aspects of the school's practices. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sav"><table border><tr><td><h3>Suggested Activity V: Reviews in Progress</h3>A.

It also suggests that there is disagreement about what is being done. It seems that as more is undertaken, as the direction of the school becomes clearer, those who disagree become more vocal; so that the friendliness, the politeness which characterized Oak Hill when we arrived is less evident. While the debate has fostered more productive work than before, it has often been difficult for those involved. <p>	Several aspects of divisiveness surfaced, which have affected the momentum of change at the school. These need more attention. We would like to try to isolate the issues and then pose some questions for faculty consideration.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tiodm"><h3>The Issue of Decision Making</h3><p>Decision making surfaced as a sore spot for teachers and students alike. A number of the students commented on the fact that they were being told that they would have greater participation in the decisions which affect their time at school. When they returned this year, the campus was closedstudents could no longer leave during free periodsand new policies of lateness were being enforced. It seemed to them that teachers and administrators were acting hypocritically, and that this was evidence that the adults only intend to allow students to engage in decisions that require minimal responsibility from them. <p>	In a similar vein, teachers agreed at the end of the year that they would like to operate a detention center. The administration rejected the idea. The teachers were, by all accounts, furious. So the administrators reversed their rejection and offered to institute a detention center if staffed by teachers. Faculty ultimately counter-rejected this proposal on the grounds that it was out of contract time, but the issue of who decides and how decisions are made continued to rankle.<p>	In another example, teachers suggested that there is resentment over the decision making about participation in Coalition-related functions. A teacher told about a group in the faculty room:<p><blockquote>... making a list of the people who are getting more perksmore time, more attention, more PR, more time offmore anything. The ones who are counting suggest that they are the plain old people staying home doing all the work. And it's true. Some people feel rejected by it all.</blockquote>	Some of the math and science teachers were not informed about the study of change in math and science classrooms. Others wondered who is chosen for the national Fall Forum of the Coalition of Essential Schools and how. Still others wondered about the summer activities. Another teacher suggested that there is a group keeping track of who is benefiting from participation in many of the activities, both monetarily and in terms of travel. Some of this group felt like they are not invited to participate. Others felt that while they don't want to participate, the opportunity was not offered, thus contradicting the public claim of participatory decision making. Some also wondered whether it is appropriate for teachers to be gone so much of the time.<p>	A contrasting view is that opportunities are made available and that those interested pursue them, and those that don't, complain, even though they chose not to participate. In still other cases, teachers indicated that they pursue interests on their own, thereby creating opportunities to visit other schools or to investigate new programs. These teachers suggested that all anybody needs is a little initiative. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="savi"><table border><tr><td><h3>Suggested Activity VI: Decision Making</h3>A.

What decisions should include students? staff? administration? <p></td></table><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tdac"><h3>The Debate about Change</h3><p>In each of our site visits, students have shared their beliefs about the effort the staff is making to examine and refresh their educational approaches. This time, however, both students and their parents noted that there seems to be more debate going on among teachers and students about the general focus of the school. Students' comments often reflected their teachers' opinions; when probed for deeper understanding, they could not go beyond what they have heard. At times, they offered contrasting evidence: "I don't like less is more,' but I do like integrated instruction where we cover fewer topics. I love the fact that we are reading fewer books this year but going into greater depth." <p>	A number of students offered their thoughts about the Coalition when asked what was new. <p><blockquote>The sweeping school change is, as usual, really very little. I think that more and more people are coming to question the Coalition, because a lot of people just jumped on the bandwagon: "Coalition is bad; Coalition is wrong." But a lot of people didn't really know what they were talking about. They couldn't elucidate on ideas about what was wrong or what needed work. I see now that a lot of people have looked at things and said, "Well, in this class we are doing this and it doesn't really work." People question the "less is more" theory, and I don't really feel that we should be narrowing our focus of what we look at now. In high school you should be exposed to as much as is physically possible for you to be exposed to. That will make it that much easier when you go to college to pick a major in something you are going to enjoy.</blockquote><blockquote>Right now we're stuck in between implementing the Coalition and rejecting it. Until that time when there is a decision made on what we do, this place will always feel in a little bit of a flux, a little bit of chaos. In a couple of years, a bunch of the teachers are getting closer to thinking about retirement. The choices they make in replacing those people will go a long way in determining where the school is headed. It is hard to tell what kids understand about the Coalitionother than some buzzwords such as "student-as-worker," "teacher-as-coach," "less is more." Some of the younger kids don't like to learn that way, so they're opposed to it. There is no consensus. Some people don't care; some people don't know. Other people think it's good; other people think it's bad. </blockquote>	He suggested that the most important thing is to support teachers who could interest students in learning.<p>	A young man described his teachers' comments to the class:<p><blockquote>[One of my teachers] says he hasn't changed a thing. Another teacher told us, "I'm only putting you in groups because the Coalition says I should." I guess sophomore year was the biggest part where the Coalition had an influence, but then I guess in all the advanced courses, the teachers aren't comfortable with changing so they teach what they know works. Junior and senior year I really didn't have much exposure.</blockquote>	"One of my teachers told me he won't even consider portfolios," said another.<p>	Focus groups debating the value of the Coalition and of Exhibitions revealed their fears and revealed what they have come to understand the school's effort  to mean: <p><blockquote>My biggest fear is that we're going to come out of here and they're going to figure out that the Coalition didn't work. If they discard it, that's our education they're discarding.</blockquote><blockquote>I'm worried about the SATs. They're not going to change the SAT for someone who is learning more centralized rather than broader knowledge. I'm at a loss compared to someone who is not doing this.</blockquote><blockquote>It's not just what you're learningthe factsbut the ability to grasp new concepts, to experiment.</blockquote><blockquote>I think I learn better from Exhibitions. I can't cram things into my head and then remember. Exhibitions demand more creativity than the conventional test because they have to weave facts into a story.</blockquote><blockquote>I'd rather take a test and learn a little about a lot of things and get in there and have a broader spectrum of what I know.</blockquote>	The parents' debate over the controversy about the direction of the school is based on their children's experiences and reports home. The small group of parents we talked to seemed generally in favor of the changesthe Investigate program, the integration of classes, the expectation that the kids will take more responsibility for decision making in the schooland they seemed supportive of those teachers they believe are asking a good deal of their children, whether they are involved in reform or not. Yet they also noted that their kids are influenced by their teachers' comments. <p>	"Missy doesn't think much of the Coalition because her teacher bad-mouths it, while practicing much of it."<p>	"What the kids really criticize is the buzzwords of the Coalition."<p>	"One of the teachers told us at Back to School Night that the Coalition required a lot more work of the teachers." <p><blockquote>My daughter learned a lot from an Exhibition she did at the end of one year. Recently, though, she was in a little discussion group with one of her teachers and apparently the end result was, "Yeah, we all decided we don't like the Coalition." I thought her Exhibition was great and I was impressed by all the work she put into that piece. So I asked her more and she said that she felt more comfortable learning the broad facts, as opposed to the broad philosophy.</blockquote><blockquote>I've heard a lot of negative things since last year. The kids just thought it was a lot of nonsense. But I think this is complicated. I'm not sure that the kids can see how it applies to their lives and at the same time, I'm sure some nonsense goes on. </blockquote><blockquote>The kids don't like it when it gets too gimmicky. They don't want fourth-grade work!</blockquote><blockquote>What I'm interested in is whether the kids are learning. I don't care whether they like or don't like it. Part of it is that it's hip to criticize what people are working so hard to do. But the kids see through the teachers' opinions. They know who's working them hard and who's not. They see through this stuff.</blockquote><blockquote>Well, whether you're buying it or not, I think that the important thing about the whole exercise is that it's created a debate and an impetus on the part of teachers and students toward independent thought, as opposed to old-fashioned rote learning. At Back to School Night, one of the teachers said that it required a lot more work for her and that she's teaching a class today in a way which is quite a bit different from what she would have done in the past, so I think the whole exercise is having quite a lot of influence.</blockquote><blockquote>If it has made many teachers sort of rethink their style of teaching and what's in the content of their teaching, I think that's great. It's true that some of the teachers seem to have been doing it all alongchallenging and pushing the kids to think. But I think that teachers need to be refreshed by some process that gets them thinking about how they teach and what they are teaching. </blockquote><blockquote>I think it is good for the kids to see the teachers disagreeing, that the administration allows that, because when the kids leave Oak Hill, they are going to see a lot more diversity of opinions. </blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="savii"><table border><tr><td><h3>Suggested Activity VII: The Debate About Change</h3>A.

What processes can you imagine which might allow the staff to clear the air and to establish some ground rules for addressing their concerns, and establishing a professionally supportive work environment for all?<p>D. Some students' complaints about the changes being made in the name of the Coalition are legitimate. How might students and parents be included in the review process to benefit all?</td></table><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="v:r"><hr><center><h2>V: Reflections </h2></center><hr>Our visit this time revealed a school that seemed a little schizophrenic: we felt as if we saw two distinct personalities. One side appeared to be a school which was calmer, making steady progress, enthusiastic. Another side revealed a school in the midst of whispered disagreements. We were delighted by the first, not surprised by the second, but hopeful that the two sides might be integrated in a productive way. Our observations will be brief, but directed to several important issues. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tnfoe"><h3>The Need for Ongoing Evaluation</h3><p>The issue of evaluation is a central one. One of the beliefs we think is implicit in the nine Common Principles is that staff will continue to work together to determine whether, in fact, there is any proof that students are using their minds well. In what John Goodlad calls the "ecology of a renewing school," everyone is involved in asking whether what they are doing is working to build student skill, confidence, and competence. Those who call for conscientious review are important to the real development of the school, and their questions, often perceived with irritation by others, should not be disregarded. They will help to ensure that rigorous work and quality instruction enable students' intellectual development. <p>	However, we are not always sure that all of the staff are requesting schoolwide renewal. It is hard to tell whether those who disagree with the school's direction are asking that only the new projects and programs be reviewed or whether they, too, are interested in an open review of their own work in addition to everyone else's. We wonder if some of the teachers who are calling for review are really asking for the right to reject school renewal writ large, as if it were a pilot program to be tested by a few, assessed by the whole. Our understanding is that this school is not involved in a pilot program. The staff agreed on several occasions that their intentions are to continue to work on what goes on in Oak Hill so that every student learns to use his or her mind well. We understand that there is agreement that this is a whole-school endeavor. <p>	Given that agreement, then all aspects of the school should be involved in ongoing, formative evaluation. (The difference between formative and summative evaluation is important here. Summative evaluation occurs only at the completion of a project or task, and is not appropriate here, where the whole staff is committed to ongoing renewal.) Formative evaluation suggests that teachers collect information and make decisions based on that data, revising subsequent approaches. Every class, program, project, course, trip, innovation, and settled practice should be scrutinized on some ongoing basis to ensure that the professionals involved get the kind of feedback they need to better serve kids.<p>	Again, teachers need feedback about their techniques and strategies every bit as much as students need feedback on their writing or their calculating in order to improve. Students have told us repeatedly that they benefit from very direct formative feedback on their writing, that they learn better when math teachers move beyond summative checking for correct answers, to see how they think and calculate. Nationwide, teachers continue to suggest that what prevents them from growing is the lack of regular, formative feedback which allows them to engage with others about their own work. This is the objective of ongoing, formative evaluation. <p>	We agree with some who claim that they are not always sure that they see evidence of intellectual rigor in many classes. And we do see classes that demand more of students than others. But we also believe that every teacher, from the very finest to the least skilled, benefits from examination of and discussion about his or her work. This is not to suggest an orthodoxya one-right-way of doing things. The nine Common Principles suggest nothing of the kind, but they do suggest that teachers must have a wide repertoire of instruction and assessment techniques if kids are to flourish.<p>	It is unnerving to us to hear that teachers tell students that they haven't changed a thing. Students interpret this as a boast. They understand from teachers that this is a kind of rebellion against current authority or against poor policy. All of us can imagine rejecting change for its own sake, but none of us can imagine the value in rejecting possible professional growth. It is equally as unsavory to hear that teachers tell kids that they are "only being put in groups because the Coalition says it's important." The implication is that teachers follow suggestions against their own better judgment, and that somewhere outside of teachers' experience, there is one, sanctioned, acceptable method of engaging students. Neither of these things suggests very positive messages to students, nor very powerful roles for teachers. We think teachers need to review their practices and those of others so that everyone can grow in their understanding of the richness, the diversity of approaches that are possible. <p>	We also believe that it is just as possible to use techniques badly as it is to use them well. It is constant evaluation, feedback, and discussion that will help everyone to build a repertoire which serves students better than in a school where teachers work in perpetual isolation with limited feedback, and a small repertoire of curricular, pedagogical, and assessment techniques.<p>	Finally, we think that such review needs to be ongoing and regular, and that there needs to be some general agreement about what the school is shooting for, so that it can measure its progress against its goals. It is encouraging to see the reviews of programs which are in place. If there is a weakness in them, it is that it was difficult for us to tell whether there were any skeptics present. If formative evaluation is conducted only by those closest to the program or the project, they are naturally less likely to ask the most difficult questions. Good critical review requires both insiders and outsiders to ensure maximum growth. We also note that reviews are taking place for major activities. We look forward to a time in the school when such review spreads to individual lessons, to all disciplines, to a variety of courses, and to specific teaching techniques. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="latss"><h3>Looking at the SAT Scores</h3><p>We also heard from students and teachers that SAT scores are falling and that no one is talking about it. The inference is that the SATs are directly reflective of the poor quality of the work that has been going on as a result of the changes in the school. The school needs to ascertain whether SATs do reflect their beliefs about good education, and then, as a first order of business in this discussion, check to see whether the SATs are able to measure those.<p>	In order to investigate, we obtained the scores for the last seventeen years and ran five or six analyses on them to see what we could see. After that, we visited with one of the vice presidents in the SAT division at the Educational Testing Service to see if our analysis was correct. To date, they have assured us that it is safe to say the following: <p><ol>	<li>	It is dangerous to interpret variation in Oak Hill's scores too literally because the number of kids taking the test is not large enough to give statistically significant data. <p>	<li>	We do know that the verbal scores have always been above the national average. <p>	<li>	Math scores have fallen below the national average three times in seventeen years. <p>	<li>	There has been regular fluctuation over that time period. Fluctuations of 20 points have been common. The Educational Testing Service suggests that these fluctuations may be accounted for by mere differences in student cohorts. It is also possible that the socioeconomic status of the community has changed, that students are watching more television, that course offerings are changing, or any number of possible variations in context that would affect who's taking the test and how they do. <p>	<li>	The number of students taking the test has grown from 66 percent of the total number of juniors to over 80 percent since 198<li> <p>	<li>	The most significant drop in scores occurred in 1990, in both math and verbal scores. <p>	<li>	The most significant gain ever occurred in 1992, in both math and verbal scores. After several conversations, the figures were shipped to them for their further psychometric analysis. We will send any anything more conclusive to the people at Oak Hill. <p></ol><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cwd"><h3>Coping with Divisiveness</h3><p>Several years ago, while doing the research reported in <cite>Teachers Who Lead</cite>,2 I discovered what a covert operation teaching can be. (Oliver North's trial was big at the time.) Teachers frequently are not overt about those issues, practices, or proposals which trouble them. They more often complain to those they know well and who share common views, but leave those in favor largely unaware of their concerns. There are two direct consequences: (1) their feeling of negativity and isolation continues to grow, while the troublesome circumstance remains; and (2) those in favor savor a false sense of group interest or support. <p>	It is also true that those forging new plans or projects frequently forget to ask whether others see the value of their mutual direction. Sometimes, they don't ask out of arrogance, convinced that their way is right. At other times, they don't ask because they are afraid that resistance would derail their efforts. In either case, their new efforts frequently are built on a fragile house of cards. <p>	Both of these behaviors, not telling and not asking, are a direct result of old, ingrained, hierarchical structures and practices. Given the self-defeating nature of both, it is hard to imagine why anyone would want to persist in either of these behaviors. The objective is to learn to engage in an open forum, to be direct about plans, projects, activities, questions, concerns, and disagreements. People can have different opinions about how things might best be done without attacking each other on a personal basis.<p>	It is the open debate that fosters carefully constructed and hard-won progress in our schools. Over time, adults come to see this as the equivalent of the intellectual ferment they want their students to be able to experience and to be prepared to participate in. To engage in this, a faculty needs constructive problem-solving processes, something that Bena Callick, an outside consultant, pointed out earlier in the year. To engage in serious, open, collaborative debate which mirrors mutual respect requires a repertoire of problem-solving skills. The faculty has demonstrated their willingness to use these several times during the course of this study, and so, we have every reason to believe that they will continue to tackle very tough issues in an open, professional manner. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="aslr"><h3>Are Students Less Respectful?</h3><p>Across the country, teachers are suggesting that students are less respectful, more difficult, less attentive to authority. On the one hand, this is the constant description of the older generation of the younger. Teachers reported this in 1936 in Willard Waller's book on teaching. They reported it again in 1970, and again now. On the other hand, teachers in each of these generations have been accurate: the world and the kids who live in it are constantly crafting a different code of respect, one that seems harsher to those who were raised to say "please," "thank you," to take hats off in the classroom, and to speak only when spoken to. Nowadays, much of the code of respect is being forged not in families, not in schools, but in the media, and, frankly, everyone is struggling to understand the consequences. Across the country, traditional measures like suspensions and detention rooms are having less and less of an effect.3 <p>	There are generally two responses to increased disrespect: heightened punishment or heightened responsibility for students. Many schools, like Oak Hill, are choosing policies and approaches which require that students take more responsibility. The belief is that, given the demise of common social standards, kids need practice in decision making and in the creation of a mutually acceptable community. In this case, what happens is classic: just at the point when adults have provided students with more responsibility and are expecting more of students, students, as yet unpracticed and often graceless in their newfound responsibility, act up. Convinced that students are incapable of accepting more responsibility, adults retreat to more familiar behaviors. Retreat at that moment convinces students of the natural tyranny of adults, of their inability to actually do what they say they are going to do. On the other hand, if the adults stick it out, pointing out to the students what is untenable about their suggestions or behaviors, then at least students will be given a real chance to grow.<p>	It seems to us that Oak Hill is just at this juncture with students, with their work in Congress and Seminars. It seems to us that many students in this school are responding well from the opportunities to engage with the faculty in policy setting, review, and enforcement. It also seems unlikely to us that old methods of punishment are likely to result in the kind of increased respectfulness for which staff hope. It is more likely that students will gain respect for staff from the opportunities and challenges they are provided, which in the long run, convey the message that the adults in the community respect students. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ct"><h3>Concluding Thoughts</h3><p>We are learning a great deal from the Oak Hill staff about just how difficult it is to create or recreate a school where faculty and students work together to build more powerful daily experiences for all. The schizophrenic feel to the school just now is not unexpected; as the school relinquishes some of the individual teacher autonomy which restricts professional growth for closer collaborative effort, and as the faculty begins to work together to establish mutual goals and objectives, disagreements about what works and what doesn't are bound to become more explicit. Our classroom visits, our interviews and observations, again lead us to believe that until parents, teachers, kids, and administrators agree on the focus of the school, until they all build a mutual understanding of what it is they are shooting for and then openly discuss the means by which each of them chooses to get there, all best efforts degenerate to who's in, who's out, who's winning, and who's losing. We, like the staff, hope for more.<p>	We believe that the staff, again, face a brave moment. If they have the courage to persevere through difficult issues and times, they will be much closer to the kind of culture where everyone grows.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><hr><h3>Notes</h3><p><ol><li> In earlier snapshots this program was called the Senior Options Program.<p><li> Patricia Wasley, <cite>Teachers Who Lead: The Rhetoricof Reform and the Realities of Practice</cite>  (New York: Teachers College Press, 1991).<p><li> See Linda McNeils <cite>Contradictions of Control </cite>(Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1986) or any of William Glassers recent books on control. <p></oL><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr><p><a href="../../../projects/sc/chanlong.htm">Appendix A: About the School Change Study</a><br><a href="../../../principl/principl.htm">Appendix B: The Common Principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools</a><br><a href="cross6ac.htm">Appendix C: Suggestions for Improving Planning of Meetings</a><br><a href="../list.htm#2">Return to Index of School Change Publications</a><p></body></html>

Each time we visited, we produced a "snapshot" capturing what we observed in classrooms and what we heard in conversations with people in the school. While three years was long enough to capture a great deal, it was not long enough to leave with a finished portrait, showing the analysis done, the changes made, the students more skillful and more competent. That portrait, we learned, will never be truly complete; developing a better school is, after all, an ongoing, creative endeavor. <p>	Now, in the spring of 1994, we look back. Three years was long enough to follow one cohort of students, who started with us as juniors, into their freshman year in college. Long enough for sophomores to become seniors, busily preparing their final Exhibitions,1 checking the mail for college acceptances, making plans for after graduation. Long enough for our freshman group to become juniors who acknowledge that their writing has improved, that they are more confident speaking in front of others than they were before. Long enough for a teacher to reconsider what she said on our first visit: <p><blockquote>I think the work the Coalition suggests is all interesting and fine for people in the humanities, but it doesn't have much to do with me in math. I have too much to cover. Math is restricted by tests and requires steady, daily attention, and a set sequence! </blockquote>	Now this teacher is working with colleagues to redesign the math curriculum and to rethink her own examinations in calculus.<p>	These three years were long enough for principals to come and go, for two teachers and two administrators to retire, and for newcomers to replace them. Long enough for this year's sophomores to consider their concluding humanities Exhibition a tradition instead of an experiment in which they are the "guinea pigs." Long enough for us to grow fond of parents, kids, and staff, and to wish we could stay much longer. <p>	For our final snapshot, we would like to look back across the previous snapshots to measure the distance come and then to describe where the school is now. We would like to summarize what we think we have learned about the three themes that guided the study: the translation of the nine Common Principles into practice, the factors sustaining the momentum of change, and the factors that bring about whole-school change. Finally, we have been requested by the faculty to outline the near horizon as it appears to us. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="part1"><hr><center><h2>Part 1<br>Looking Back Across the Snapshots</h2></center><hr>Oak Hill High School joined the Coalition of Essential Schools during the 1989-90 school year. It joined because a new principal arrived with a vision of Oak Hill's becoming an Essential school. The faculty expressed a collective willingness to explore the nine Common Principles, the ideas which undergird Coalition reform, and to determine what changes the ideas might foster if taken seriously in their school. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="in1991"><h3>In 1991</h3><p>By the fall of 1991, a writing-across-the-curriculum project was firmly in place. The faculty had changed its schedule for greater flexibility and had instituted a Student-Faculty Congress to deal with issues of mutual concern to faculty and students. They had begun to have Seminar once a week, in which small groups of students met with a teacher to discuss issues related to the Student-Faculty Congress. Special-needs students had been mainstreamed into regular classrooms, with support from resource rooms. Special education staff attended classes with their students whenever possible and consulted with the regular classroom teacher. A new, combination student center and technology center was being completed-albeit without computers. The earth science course that prepared for a State Board of Education Exam (SBEE) was heterogeneously grouped for the first time, and all freshmen students were required to take the course. Interdisciplinary work was under way in ninth- and tenth-grade social studies and English. <p><h4>When We Talked with Faculty</h4><p>Many of the faculty were engaged in the discussion about <cite>whether </cite>o change, as opposed to <cite>how </cite>they might change. Outside of freshman and sophomore English and social studies, staff members were unsure that their involvement in the redesign of the school was important or wise. Many believed that they were constrained by college admissions, by advanced placement requirements, and by the SBEE. Others determined that changing would undermine the very good program they had developed over time. While nearly everyone complained that the SBEE demanded that they cover too much curriculum too quickly, many still felt that the exam itself was a good measure of student performance, and that their community relied on it as a measure of their success. Accustomed to external, norm-referenced measures, they questioned their authority to determine what kids should know and how students should demonstrate that knowledge. While faculty liked the nine Common Principles, they admitted that they had not really discussed the ideas or considered what the Principles might mean.<p>	Faculty, students, and parents characterized the school as a caring place, a place staff would like to stay until retirement, a comfortable, small, safe place. There was some debate among faculty about the legitimacy of the vote to join the Coalition, and some debate over whether the principal, Dr. Brenner, was a true leader, enabling them to transform the school or, rather, very skillful at manipulating staff to her own ends. For the most part, though, the staff suggested that she breathed new life into the school. Several of the staff complained about lowered standards and rowdier, less respectful kids, and pushed for policies which would return them to the kind of respectful, civil culture they remembered from earlier years.<p>	While staff acknowledged that Dr. Brenner provided them with more time to go to conferences and to visit other schools, as well as release time to work with colleagues, it was somehow never frequent or regular enough. Time to work together either as a whole staff or in smaller groups, to think through their direction and their strategies, always seemed in short supply, and teachers believed this shortage confounded their ability to accomplish as much as they would have liked. <p><h4>When We Talked with Students</h4><p>Students felt well cared for in the school, but said that they were not often asked to do work which taxed or pushed them. A majority felt pigeonholed by ability early on, and once labeled, felt stuck in their grade category: "Once a 70 percent always a 70." Several were worried that the changes the staff were undertaking would leave them ill-prepared for college. While ninth-graders suggested that they were doing more than they had previously, a number of older students claimed that not much had changed-they were doing the same assignments that older siblings had done. Teachers were using similar textbooks, teaching in familiar ways: lectures, note-taking, dittos. Few students found Seminar to be time wisely spent. Those involved in Congress found it meaningful, while those not involved speculated that students' abilities to tackle real issues were restricted. Their most consistent request was that teachers help them understand the contemporary utility of what they were studying, and that teachers work to make the subject matter more interesting. <p><h4>When We Talked with Parents</h4><p>Through their discussions with Dr. Brenner, parents were familiar with the direction in which the school was going. They knew about the Coalition and seemed comfortable with the idea. They also seemed eager for the school to change in some ways. It made good sense to them that the methods that worked when they were in school should be called into question. Frequently, one or more of them would try to remember something-anything-they had learned in high school. What they could remember were the events where they had been involved in some public demonstration of their competence-games, plays, publications. They also remembered how quickly they forgot the facts, the dates, the names they had been encouraged to memorize.<p>	They cited a number of examples of changed instruction, where their kids came home from school talking about what they had to do: the moon and the tides measurement activity, the adopt-a-country project, the Holocaust unit.2 Several did note that they were very excited by the adult discussion of change, but slow to see examples in their kids' daily experience. Parents suggested that they were interested in knowing more about what the staff and students were doing so that they might be supportive and well informed.<p><h4>When We Looked in Classrooms</h4><p>For the most part, the classrooms we visited could have been classrooms from our own high school experience. This reinforced the consistent finding that high schools have endured relatively untouched in the midst of enormous social and technological upheaval in the last thirty years. The content in many classes was familiar: work on thesis statements, math problems done by teachers at the board, cake baking, French or Spanish oral recitations, papers, teacher-led discussions of economics, a student report on paleobiology, and a chemistry lab in which the teacher demonstrated and kids filled in the blanks. There were signs that some were changing their teaching methodology by adopting process writing, small-group work, student-generated projects, rapid-fire oral activities that required that everyone participate and keep up.<p>	And there were new forms of assessment, or in some cases, new names for old forms: <cite>Exhibitions, scoring rubrics</cite>. And there were occasional signs that teachers were modernizing their curriculum by adding minority authors or relating what students were learning to contemporary issues, as in economics, when the teacher asked students to consider the fate of socialist theory in light of the impending collapse of the Soviet Union. While faculty were enthusiastic about the changes they were making, those who were attempting fresh strategies were new to innovation-enthusiastic, but anxious for feedback. In addition, while the staff was interested in talking about the Principles, few were attempting to translate the ideas into daily practice. From their perspective, and ours, it was sometimes difficult to determine that kids were using their minds well or at least better than they had previously. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="in1992"><h3>In 1992 and 1993</h3><p>In the intervening years of the study, several major changes took place at the school. <p><h4>Changes in the Educational Context</h4><p>The state department of education drafted new educational policy to support reform and Oak Hill became one of the first partnership schools. As a partnership school, Oak Hill would provide a model for the staff at the state department of education and would be one of the first schools to translate new policy into action. Staff and administrators were invited to help the state department of education think through their changing roles and to suggest appropriate redesigns of the SBEE. <p>	A new principal and vice principal came aboard, and, in a decisive break from tradition, the faculty began facilitating their own staff meetings. Dr. Brenner moved into the superintendency and expanded her efforts toward achieving district-wide coherence. <p>	The Investigate program, which takes place in the last term of the senior year, was established. It requires that students engage in an independent study, an internship, or a research project and then make some formal presentation at the end of the year, in front of a panel of external judges, about what they have learned. <p>	As we looked in from the outside, our role changed. Faculty asked us to go beyond mere description to give them some sense of our impressions. Accordingly, we raised a number of issues with the staff in the intervening snapshots. The most constant issue we raised was the lack of planning time, consistently noted by the staff, that constrained their efforts to reassess and strengthen their practices. We suggested, too, that while staff have constantly revised their work schedule, they have never tackled the issue of planning time, beyond providing mutual planning periods to team members in some cases. <p><h4>Instruction-related Issues</h4><p>We saw that many teachers were in a proverbial Catch-22 with kids. Many kids, disengaged in the work teachers offered them, suggested that it was hard to do boring, repetitive work. Teachers, however, found it difficult to imagine that kids could or would do more, or that teachers should invest the time and energy required to develop more rigorous, challenging work than before. Thus, a kind of mutually defeating set of circumstances continued. <p>	We were told that mathematics was the most problematic discipline in the school by all reports from students, teachers, and parents. Students found math confusing, and frequently needed tutors. Parents struggled to understand individual teacher's systems and to find adequate tutors. Teachers found too many students ill-equipped and reticent. We learned that the problems were confounded by math teachers' perceptions that math is completely linear, that the curriculum is rigid, and that demonstration and drill are the only methods for teaching it. After we raised these issues, members of the math department worked together to determine how to move ahead.<p>	We discussed with the faculty several issues related to instruction in general. Teachers generally get very little feedback about their teaching and work alone for the most part. Part of what the nine Common Principles seemed to suggest to us was that teachers should cultivate a broad repertoire of pedagogical techniques. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to build this repertoire when people work in such isolation. We also observed that teachers did not talk about their own instructional practices as much as they did about curriculum or assessment. There are real implications of this particular cultural norm. Teachers develop an individual style, or set of techniques, with little feedback about the range, the effectiveness, or alternative possibilities. Consequently, there is little support for teachers who are trying new techniques, which makes it less likely that they will persist when something new does not work out as planned. We hoped that the development of a protocol, a set of ground rules, for the discussion of instruction might open this end of the teaching triangle of curriculum, instruction, and assessment.<p><h4>The Nine Common Principles</h4><p>Several things became clear about how the school used the nine Common Principles, a focus of our study. The first was that the faculty seemed not to have probed beyond surface understandings of the ideas. When we reported our observation to the faculty, they asked us to interview them about the nine Common Principles. We found, not surprisingly, that people tended to define the Principles in terms of their current practices. Since many of the staff had very different notions about quality, rigor, and what constitutes good thinking, we suggested that deeper discussion of those ideas might provide the kind of mutual understanding they needed to give them clearer, more coherent direction than they had previously. We noted that some faculty perceived the nine Common Principles as an orthodoxy, "the right way" to do things; consequently we suggested that deeper dialogue about the Principles might help people to build broader interpretations than they previously had of them. <p><h4>Divisiveness Among the Faculty</h4><p>We also observed that as more staff became involved in assessing their work and redesigning new structures, the whole faculty appeared more divisive. Teachers, parents, and students all commented on this phenomenon. Divisiveness manifested itself in several ways-private sniping, public disagreement, or interdepartmental arguments. There was a greater impatience on the part of those who believed change to be beneficial, and a greater skepticism on the part of those who were unsure about change.<p>	As each group became more certain of its advantage, so did its counterpart. Both groups engaged in the kind of covert action which is so irritating to others. Supporters were said to have made decisions without consulting others; those uncertain about the value of the changes under way allegedly made lists of those benefiting unduly from the changes. Rather than having frank, whole-group discussions or direct confrontation, both groups became involved in the rumor mill, which worked ceaselessly, to the irritation of both groups. As the irritation reached new heights, those less interested in change became more insistent that an evaluation of gains be made. Those involved began in small groups to review the quality of their work, but generally these groups did not include their critics. We observed that it might be healthier for everyone if the school as a whole became committed to schoolwide renewal and held all programs and practices up to the light over time. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="part2"><hr><center><h2>Part 2<br>Oak Hill Now</h2></center><hr>By the spring of 1994, the school, Oak Hill's faculty, and the students were at a different place-more change-wise; more battle weary. Still, they were struggling with some of the same issues. English teachers collected portfolio materials for a couple of years. When they discovered that they had no mutual understanding about how the materials might be used, they gathered to come to some consensus. Faculty and students involved in Congress believed that their work had moved to a deeper level, but they were still debating issues of eligibility, fairness, and the ticker (a programmable sign in the lunchroom). Seminar was still problematic and under review. Congress was proposing that each Seminar include students from all grades, instead of only one grade, as a strengthening measure. The staff was again interviewing candidates for a new principal. Nearly everyone perceived that the school was contributing more to the state's reorganization than the school was getting back.<p>	The Investigate program (in its second year), in which seniors selected an internship or a research topic for an end-of-year Exhibition, went through a review involving parents, students, mentors, and Seminar teachers to determine how to strengthen it. Faculty voted to retain the schedule they had last year that provided rotating, double-blocked periods. Some hope that during the 1994-95 school year they might build a simpler schedule to provide planning time and greater teaming opportunities. A retreat that was designed for faculty to share their work together, snowed out in the winter, was rescheduled for June.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wwtwt"><h3>When We Talked with Teachers </h3><p>The ninth- and tenth-grade English and social studies teachers moved from interdisciplinary work, in which they studied feudal life in social studies and King Arthur in literature, to integrated work, in which students researched the nature of feudal society through literature, history, and film. The teachers changed the name of the course to <cite>humanities</cite>. All four teachers from these two levels worked to redesign the Exhibitions at the end of the tenth-grade year. The eleventh-grade English and social studies teacher instituted a research paper and several exams that asked students to use information gained in both classes. <p>	All of these teachers worked together to develop assessments that substituted for the SBEE. Other teachers in chemistry, French, Spanish, earth science, math, and biology developed some performance assessment components for the SBEE and had them approved by the state department of education. Teachers were gaining confidence in their ability to judge and to rethink this assessment tool. <p>	The resource staff at each grade level functioned as members of teams. Recognizing that students needed more organizational skills, they turned their attention to those needs. <p><h4>The Same Goals for All? </h4><p>About half the staff suggested that the faculty held the same goals for all kids, while the other half suggested that they did not. In any case, their reasoning was the same: that all kids were expected to work to their ability level. More is expected of those students perceived to be brighter than others. This tendency, which has been the conventional wisdom in schools for years, is supported by tracking and by the bell-curve system of grading. One teacher suggested that faculty had not discussed how the Principle that suggests that schools should hold the same goals for all kids might indicate a different set of solutions.<p>	Most staff agreed that the nine Common Principles are interrelated, but suggested in their examples the interconnection between only two or three. Some could see the relationship between personalization and "less is more," while others could see the connection between "student-as- worker" and "personalization." Two teachers did not think they were related, one because the ninth Principle, about the cost of reform, was so different from the others, another because, he said, "Less is never more." Many said that the Principles are interrelated but very difficult to translate into daily practices. <p>	We asked people to think about the benchmarks that they might consider as indicators of the successfulness of the changes they have made. Two people said that they were not sure that there were any benchmarks yet. One teacher said, "We're asking less and getting less. I don't like the reader response theory [in which readers keep a running journal or log as a way of reacting to the text to increase comprehension], and I think that it is possible that teaming locks teachers into an ever more rigid system." A number of teachers suggested that the Investigate program was a tremendous benchmark. Other comments about improvements made were that kids can write better, can solve problems better, and that special education kids are less isolated than they were before. <p><h4>Leadership </h4><p>In distinction from their view of leadership at the school when we arrived, the faculty saw a number of teachers as leaders in the school. At that earlier time, most discussed leadership in terms of traditional roles, such as the principal's. This time, they did not suggest formal leadership roles, like that of the curriculum coordinator or the union, so much as they gave examples of how individuals moved some aspect of the work in the school forward. Eight teachers were named for their contributions. This suggested to us that the staff was interested in "leadership density," a notion developed by Scott Meyer in his early book entitled <cite>Every Employee a Manager</cite>,3 in which he suggests that large organizations are too complex to be governed by hierarchical structures and that individuals need to be able to contribute in areas of particular interest to them. <p>	It was also true that many of the staff wanted a stronger, more active principal than they have. While they were grateful for the opportunity to expand their own leadership skills, they wanted more vision, more decisiveness, and a sense that someone was ensuring the coherence of their efforts. Finding the appropriate balance between shared leadership and the formal exercise of leadership was a challenge.<p><h4>Collaboration</h4><p>We talked with all of the teachers who had been working collaboratively. The most experienced humanities team had been working together for nine years. They gave hope to the rest by affirming that the need for time to plan decreased with experience. Everyone else was still desperate for the time to work together. The greatest challenges in teaming were balancing the two disciplines, supporting special-needs students, meshing tempos, enculturating newcomers, and struggling to find other approaches besides ways to blend their work. One newcomer said that she felt like a substitute teacher coming into a pre-established curriculum. The majority of teams noted that they were more reflective about their work as a result of their interaction with a colleague, and that they shared "more laughter, more ideas" as a result of their work together. <p><h4>Changes in Instruction</h4><p>All teachers suggested that they were working on some aspect of their pedagogy or assessment. Changes in curriculum were most frequently mentioned-new texts, new projects, new authors, new technology. The addition of CD-ROM in the library has provided an amazing resource. In terms of instruction, teachers mentioned working on Socratic seminars, working in small groups, trying to lecture less, and engaging kids in more metacognitive reflection. In terms of assessment, besides the alternatives to the SBEE, teachers mentioned Exhibitions in math and humanities, and they noted the development of new scoring rubrics to help kids better understand the grading criteria. Most teachers mentioned work in only one area-like the incorporation of new curriculum or a new assessment technique. A number mentioned that they were tentatively considering changes in one area. The art teacher and the business education teachers, the major freelance collaborators in the school, have been busy working with teachers in a variety of disciplines.<p>	Staff tackled some difficult issues related to the divisiveness they were experiencing. They established a set of ground rules for talking about change with students and among themselves, directly addressing issues that most schools simply avoid. They also talked about the need for tighter, more purposeful staff meetings, and about the need for a more coherent focus for their work. <p>	The general tone of the faculty was much different from when we first arrived. People were better versed in discussion, and seemed more interested in real exchange than in politeness. There was little discussion among fewer people questioning the need for change. Several people felt isolated in this regard, as if they were not valued despite their very real contributions. The faculty still seemed to struggle to accept varying points of view and had not satisfactorily answered the questions raised by those who would have liked more faculty-wide evaluation of the changes made. <p><h4>Changes Being Developed</h4><p>However, the majority were engaged, and they described to us what they were interested in pursuing next. The science department suggested again this spring that they might be ready to make a major change in their courses by the fall of 1995. The humanities teachers suggested that they now needed to share student work to double-check quality. The Investigate program facilitators hoped to find a broader range of mentors earlier, so that students would be able to make their arrangements earlier on. The technology program was experimenting with providing real products for the cost of materials. The math department planned to revamp Course 2 next year by reducing the curriculum to slow the pace.<p>	It did not seem as if the faculty was slowing down, waiting for the opportunity to lapse back into business as usual. On the contrary, they seemed better prepared, more interested, more intent upon next steps than they did in previous years. While they were a little stunned by the range of emotions that change elicited among staff-fear, frustration, anger, exhilaration, closer friendships-only two people (the principal and a teacher) opted to leave in this, their sixth year of change. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wwtws"><h3>When We Talked with Students</h3><p>This year, we interviewed only seniors and juniors. Out of our original cohort, one student transferred to an alternative program, one dropped out of school, and two moved away. The seniors were solidifying their plans for the next year. Many of the students expressed a kind of mingled glee and nostalgia as they anticipated graduation: "It's really hard to believe that thirteen years have gone by and I am on the threshold of graduating from high school. It almost has taken me by surprise!" Another student expressed her remorse: <p><blockquote>I totally wish I was like a nerd and a bookworm. I really, really wish I was. I am so mad at myself. Because I always thought average is okay because my mom was always telling me, "There's 500 million other average people." You know what I mean? You have to be above average. </blockquote>	Her plan now was to bring up her grades at a local community college so that she could transfer to the college she wanted to attend. <p>	We asked students to talk to us about several issues: to think about whether the school had the same goals for all students, to indicate which changes they considered worthwhile and which they found lacking, and to share how and what they knew about the Coalition. We asked them to indicate what they found problematic about the school, and to tell us what they would do to improve the school. <p><h4>Different Goals for Different Kids</h4><p>Students, like faculty, gave two answers, but arrived at the same conclusion. Either the school had the same goal for all students-that all kids should graduate-but didn't meet it, or the goals were different for students of differing abilities. Students suggested unanimously that more is expected of and provided for the more talented students in the school. One student asserted, "Honestly, I think they only care about the top 20 percent and then the rest they want to push off into life with some preparation-but keep them from bothering the top 20 percent. Then the top 20 percent is played off against each other." He and his teammates compare what they are expected to do for homework. The regular classes have far less homework; "They have the same goals, but subtly communicate that kids aren't equal."<p>	A student gave another example: <p><blockquote>Teachers expect some students to go further than others. There is a kid in my class who comes in late every day. The teacher doesn't care anymore and says, 'Well, you're going to fail.' I think the student can do the work; he just needs someone to get on his case a lot.</blockquote>	One girl who works hard in school remembered how she was given the message that she wasn't as good as others. <p><blockquote>I took the test to get into advanced English, my best subject, and I think like the whole year I kept like a 93 average, and when I asked why I didn't get in, a teacher told me that there were other students that had the same grade as me, but they didn't have to work as hard to get it. I was like, "Wait a minute. You're telling me that because I worked harder, I can't get the class I wanted?" Who cares how hard I had to work for it? I did it. And I was willing to do that. I think the whole reasoning was wrong.</blockquote><h4>Worthwhile Changes.</h4><p>The two changes mentioned by students were the Investigate program and Exhibitions. <p>	Many students said they are looking forward to the Investigate program. <p><blockquote>I am really glad that our school is part of the senior investigation program. This last quarter of school would be unbearable for me if we had to go through with it in school as usual. Even the teachers seem to think and act as if school doesn't mean as much at the end of the senior year. The project that I am undertaking is (in my opinion) much more enlightening than six more weeks of school. Since I will be working on my own mostly, I will have to sharpen my motivational skills and learn to actually complete a project on time as my own boss. These are important qualities to focus on, seeing as I would like to go into business for myself.</blockquote>	In addition, kids mentioned the Exhibitions in math. <p><blockquote>In math we had to present an Exhibition to the class. This Exhibition consisted of working in groups and being given a certain math problem to solve. Besides solving the problem, we were asked to write out our steps and draw a graph of the solution, both on transparencies so that the whole class could see how we did it.</blockquote>	Another student added, "It really helps to make us understand more in the English sense how to get the problems, rather than learning the rules that you then don't know how to use." Several students suggested that Exhibitions were promising. "After it was over last year, I felt proud of myself because I had done a good job presenting stuff and I knew my character and the others well." <p>	Others noted that community service was worthwhile, or that they believed that they had learned to write better and express themselves more confidently than before.<p><h4>Unproductive Changes</h4><p>When we asked students which changes were least worthwhile, they suggested that the arguing among faculty was disconcerting, and that the lack of information they got about what teachers were attempting and why was problematic. Some considered mandatory community service to be contradictory. One student did not like the Investigate program because he said that it would be too easy for some students to slack off. Many students suggested that the changes were occurring too slowly. "I think the school's changed less than I've changed. I look at things differently, but I don't see much difference in it."<p>	A group mentioned that they would like to go beyond oral presentations and that they need more variety. Students said that double-blocked periods were killers, if no instructional adjustments were made. One student noted, <p><blockquote>It is interesting. We have been watching a lot of TV in school lately. At one time, we were watching three separate movies in two classes. This is much more than I watch at home. It is interesting how teaching methods are moving away from a teacher lecturing. Watching a lot of TV also raises questions itself.</blockquote><h4>Students' Thoughts about the Coalition</h4><p>We asked how students got information about the Coalition, an issue the faculty had asked us to check out. <cite>Tiger Pause</cite>, the student newspaper, conversations with faculty, and a student session conducted several years ago were their main sources of information. One student described that he felt that almost everything in the school was blamed on the Coalition. <p><blockquote>The things I remember are "less is more," "student-as-worker," "teacher-as-coach," which in one teacher's class is bad because it's taken to the extreme. I think the Principles are pretty vague, so teachers interpret it the way they want. In one class, the teacher doesn't teach; he expects us to learn from the textbook. Well, the text is an aid, but it's not the only way you should get your information. The Coalition is something that teachers and students should be able to talk with each other and have a mutual understanding about. That's something that's not really happening in the school. And because students automatically assume that the Coalition is bad, anything that the teacher describes as Coalition has got to be bad. It's part of "School is bad, school is boring; Coalition is school, so Coalition must be bad and boring." Or I take a different kind of test and I get a bad grade on the test, so "These tests are ridiculous, the test is new; therefore, the test must be Coalition and bad." A lot of little things work on association like that.</blockquote>	A number of students suggested a new view of the Coalition after a brief conversation with Theodore Sizer, founder and chairman of the Coalition of Essential Schools. Unfortunately, very few students shared that opportunity. <p><blockquote>I think most students who got to speak to him had a much different view, and all of them thought a lot higher of the Coalition and the things that are going on after speaking with him. Even though he left us with a lot more questions than answers, which is typical of every Coalition meeting I've ever attended, we really talked a lot. We asked him a lot of questions about the nine Principles and applications, and in a lot of cases, he didn't have the answers. At the same time, you see where he is trying to go with it, and I agree that the American education system right now is really poor. . . . I am still as critical and analytical, but I'm less likely to just dismiss the nine Common Principles offhand.</blockquote><blockquote>"Less is more" means that you cover less material, but you go more into depth on what you teach. With Oak Hill teachers, it's a common joke. To them it means you do less work and you get more out of it. After meeting with Sizer and hearing about what the Coalition stands for, it is not the problem. It is how it is implemented in this school.</blockquote>	Another student was more concise: "The main Coalition idea is to make students more active in the learning process; less 'sit back and take it' and more 'go out and find it.'"<p>	Students seemed to come down squarely in favor of learning something more thoroughly, rather than racing through it. "I don't like not remembering what I learned!" The students were in agreement that they would like both more information and more dialogue with faculty about the changes the school is trying to make. <p><h4>Critical Observations</h4><p>Students raised a number of issues which seemed problematic to them. Many of the seniors noted that their senior year is much easier than their junior year-that not as much is asked of them. This was a consistent comment throughout both visits this year and was reinforced by last year's seniors and their parents. The year did not challenge or push students as much as they expected or would have liked, despite the fact that they found some classes very interesting. Gaining an understanding of the utility of what they learn continued to confound them. A number of students said, "Kids don't know how to use what they've learned," or "I know how to plug in the numbers to get the right answer, but don't know when or how I would use it on my own." <p>	Congress still felt contrived for some, and they were distressed by the fact that they were dealing with the same three issues they were confronting when they started. Seminar still felt superficial and the purpose was not always clear to them. <p><h4>Suggested Improvements </h4><p>We asked students to give advice about what they thought might be done to improve the school. They were earnest and thoughtful in their suggestions. The most important recommendation was that student interest be central to teachers' planning and to classroom work. <p><blockquote>I need to be more stimulated by classes. That is the key for someone to be a learner. Kids have to be interested, stimulated, and motivated. The force to learn comes from them. Teachers can't make someone learn.</blockquote>	Another said, "We need more latitude in finding an angle on an assignment." <p>	Along with the latitude to locate personal interest in a topic, students commented on their need to understand the utility of what they learned:<p><blockquote>In many classes you can easily not pay attention for a long period of time, preview the book at the end of the year and pass the SBEE and come out knowing absolutely nothing.</blockquote><blockquote>One teacher just reads the reports that students wrote: the digestive tract of an earthworm versus grasshoppers. This is stuff that you memorize for a little while but forget because it has no meaning in your life. Maybe if it were focused on enzymes and how enzymes work, because we have enzymes, too, that affect our digestion. . . .</blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Sagor's Great Issues class is the most important class I have. I can use what I learn there. It's important right now.</blockquote>	There were two requests to teachers embedded in these suggestions by the students. Students wanted to be engaged in activities that require them to place the content of their study into the context of their lives, and they wanted assignments that allowed them to identify the intersection of the content and their own interests. The first student also indicated a need for specific content to relate to larger concepts, both within and beyond the discipline.<p>	Rushing through things was difficult for kids, as was predictability or repetitiveness. <p><blockquote>In her class, I have the kind of tests she gives down pat. I can take the test without reading the instructions and get a 90 something. It's the same things over and over. Not really challenging at all. </blockquote>	Another student commented, "Throwing dittos at us that we have to do gets boring."<p>	Teacher enthusiasm played into their enthusiasm for school as well. Mr. Nelson was an example of "raw energy" that forced the kids to become more interested. They resented teachers who were negative towards them and blamed students for not learning, when from their perspective, it was also the teacher's responsibility to engage with students. <p>	Several students offered recommendations regarding the changes that teachers were making. They said it was hard to learn from the oral reports of others: "It's hard enough to learn from listening to a teacher, but with students it's impossible!" <p>	Students suggested that it was necessary that teachers go beyond putting kids in little groups. They did not feel that group work by itself elicited more from them or provided more for them, in and of itself. Group work embedded in a larger task was a different story.<p>	They hoped that teachers would use double-blocked periods more creatively, use a variety of teaching techniques, or allow students more latitude in their selection of topics to pursue. They did not feel that they were better off if double blocks were used as study halls, or if they found themselves doing repetitive activities for the full two periods. When doing that, their attention and interest flagged. <p>	Students wanted teachers who would support them. Many students had suspicions that several teachers translate the nine Common Principles too literally, that "student-as-worker" means that teachers retreat to allow kids to figure it out alone. <p><blockquote>One of my teachers is heavy into the Coalition. He's interpreting "student-as-worker" as "I don't feel like teaching you. Learn it on your own." He's taking the framework and mangling it. He's taking a welding torch to it and changing it to new shapes to suit him. He says we're the worst class he's had in ten years and we say it's because he won't teach us. </blockquote>	Another student asked that the sexism in classes be reduced, that math teachers refrain from suggesting gender as an explanation for poor math performance. <p>	Finally, a student summarized for the rest that teachers are key to their education: "A teacher can open doors for you, or guide you to it."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wwtwp"><h3>When We Talked with Parents</h3><p>During our final visit to the school, we were joined by a group of six parents, down from our normal group of ten to fifteen. The group reinforced one continuous theme: they would like more information about reform and about the changes the school was making, and they would be interested in helping in more interesting and compelling ways at the high school level. Again, they reinforced that they loved the initial sessions Dr. Brenner conducted with them; they longed for more activities of that nature. <p>	Two of the parents expressed their belief that the school had the same goals for all students. One, a parent of a resource student, believed that her son had been challenged and not exempted from anything other kids were expected to do. She was most appreciative, and she believed that her son had flourished in a way he would not have if he had been left to a resource room. The other parent in this group had a son who was not strong academically. She cited example after example of how the school managed to find her son's gifts and to push him in that direction. The other parents believed that the school favored the more talented students, that tracking limited the opportunities students have, that in order for students to jump tracks, parents had to be very vigilant and outspoken. <p>	By and large, these parents continued to be enormously supportive of the changes the school was making. They mentioned the Investigate program, the community service program, and the focus on writing and on Exhibitions as benchmarks of change and as worthwhile indicators of better preparation for their kids. One mother, who was an evaluator last year during the Investigate program, shared a story: "One student built a guitar. He glowed, and the instrument glowed, and it was an incredible experience. You realize that it is within your power to create those kinds of experiences for kids." Another noted that her current college freshman had gone to college better equipped than her equally bright older sister who graduated from Oak Hill earlier. Her younger daughter was more adept at problem solving, at writing, at speaking in front of others. <p>	On the other hand, two of the mothers of less academically capable students stated quite clearly that none of the changes which the school said it was making affected the daily lives of either of their children. From their perspective, there was more rhetoric than action; this was disappointing, as they believed that their children would benefit the most from new designs and activities. At the same time, they were supportive of what the school was attempting and seemed to believe that action would eventually follow the rhetoric.<p>	Another father noted that he was troubled because he perceived that the changes under way were preceding the faculty's understanding of the nine Common Principles-that action was preceding ideas. He would have preferred the reverse to be true on occasion, as he believed that the stability of the changes made would be more secure if teachers had a strong philosophical undergirding.<p>	The group credited a number of teachers for both leading and having the courage to examine their own work. They agreed that Dr. Brenner is a remarkable leader, but debated whether she elicited real participation or was actually managing a personal agenda. One parent served on a committee whose recommendations were ignored. Others believed that parents had been legitimately involved. <p>	Consistent with our earlier conversations, parents suggested that "schools undergoing change are more flexible, more open to new ideas and to children in wonderful ways." Their emotional reaction to change was to say "Phew!" and "Oh, good!" Clearly, these parents were willing to support the faculty's in-depth redesign of school practices. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wwlic"><h3>When We Looked in Classrooms</h3><p>After this visit, we might characterize classrooms in several ways. Some exemplified traditional practices which asked little of kids-teacher talk predominating at the front of the room, reviewing textual material, or teachers working problems at the board. Two more traditional classrooms demonstrated approaches that engaged students in serious ways-through guided analytical discussion which center on the teacher's knowledge. Other classes exemplified teachers' experimenting with new techniques which they believed moved them and their students closer to more active participation. In some cases, these classrooms seemed successful-more thoughtful, more demanding of students. In others, the tasks students were undertaking were not very compelling or demanding, or students simply were not given enough guidance from their teachers to provide them with the wherewithal to do the work. <p>	The science department was most often identified as either misinterpreting the Principle of "student-as-worker" or as abdicating responsibility for providing support. At the same time, some of the activities the science department had undertaken prompted more intellectual engagement on the part of students. Similarly, while the math department eliminated some curriculum and moved towards a redesign of the SBEE, we still saw only an occasional example of more varied instructional approaches. In a discipline which consistently confounds so many students in the school, we can't help but persevere in suggesting that a greater variety of instructional approaches would be helpful to students. <p>	It may be important to clarify here that the majority of teachers were involved in making the structural changes in which the school is involved-changing schedules, establishing Congress, serving as a Seminar teacher. Still others were involved in reassessing the curriculum to reshape it around essential topics, as opposed to coverage. Many were redesigning assessments-changing part or all of the SBEE, experimenting with Exhibitions, using scoring rubrics, studying uses for portfolios. However, fewer teachers were involved in rethinking instructional techniques than were working on assessments. <p>	When we looked back over the last three years, we had visited some classrooms up to fifteen times. We have had students who wrote weekly journals recounting exactly what they were doing in class. What we noticed most clearly was that the majority of teachers at Oak Hill used one technique predominantly, and then had a limited complementary repertoire of options for moving through material. Students, therefore, accepted routinization as a regular, daily part of their school experience, but complained vehemently and consistently about boredom, predictability, a lack of freshness, and the lack of connection between what they were learning and the larger world in which they lived. We think that there is a significant connection between the variability of teachers' instructional approaches and students' engagement. We also have evidence that changing assessment or curriculum does not necessarily drive the kind of changes in instruction needed for the consistent intellectual practice kids require to learn to use their minds well.<p>	A second related issue was that even those who were changing tended to overuse or quickly routinize new approaches, so that they, too, lost their freshness. Writing first-person narratives (an assessment technique) and reporting on a chapter in science were examples often cited. The old saw about too much of a good thing may pertain.<p>	A third issue was that many teachers had adopted one fresh project or approach over the last three years and stopped there. While it is understandable to us that the addition of a major project or a technique like Socratic seminars may take a number of years to refine and evaluate, we are left wondering whether teachers believed that the addition of a project or two was sufficient to the school's commitment to foster student competence. That, in turn, leads us to wonder why it was so. Was it that the faculty believed that this was another temporary phase in the school's long history? Was it that it was too hard for individual teachers to engage consistently in learning new approaches? <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="part3"><hr><center><h2>Part 3<br>The Study Themes</h2></center><hr>We started this study to investigate three themes which we believed were largely absent from the reform literature. We asked how schools were using the nine Common Principles, how they maintained the momentum of change over time, and whether they were involved in whole-school change. While we plan to spend the next year analyzing all of the data from the original three sites and from the two sites added last year, we thought some brief preliminary thoughts might be in order. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tncp"><h3>The Nine Common Principles</h3><p>Professor Sizer generated the nine Common Principles as a fresh approach to school redesign. Historically, change has been mandated for those who work in schools by those who don't.4  Clearly, many of the mandated requirements for change were shortsighted and thus fell short of providing better student learning. The Principles are designed to be respectful of the intellectual capacity of those who work in schools, to suggest that they themselves are best suited to diagnosing and redesigning their practices. The Principles are offered as a kind of architectural support, like a blueprint, that has to be translated on sight to account for local differences and values. They are prompts for the construction of new meanings, practices, beliefs, and structures.<p>	We know from a number of studies of schools in their first three to five years of reform that they do not use the Principles in very rigorous ways.5 It appears that schools further down the road do not feel the need to use the nine Common Principles vigorously either. At Oak Hill, we believe that only a few of the ideas are really under consideration. Most faculty suggest that they are working on "personalization" or "student-as-worker." Fewer still are working on "less is more." Despite the conversations we've had about the ideas in our interview sessions, faculty do not hold shared understandings of what they mean. While many people feel that the ideas are interconnected, we see only limited evidence that teachers wish to move towards a holistic interpretation. <p>	We can speculate as to why the Principles play such a limited role in the school. Staff have limited time to work together. High schools have never been accustomed to fostering shared understandings, but rather have been collections of individuals or departments. It is also possible that staff have participated in vision-building sessions that take only a few hours or a day, and so, do not see that there is a need for deeper conversation or sustained effort. In addition, schools in general are more action oriented-their approach is to build a new program, add some new curriculum-they are less oriented to establishing the philosophical base for action first. Furthermore, as we've mentioned previously, we are a society of slogans, such as, "Just do it," "It's the economy, Stupid!" "Every child can learn." Evidence abounds that there are little or no consequences for adopting new rhetoric to old practices. In fact, our political life suggests that adapting new slogans without changing much is what we expect and is the status quo.<p>	Whatever the reasons, the nine Common Principles do not appear to undergird the work of the majority of the faculty. More frequently, they are used to help to clarify divisiveness among staff. As we noted in our first snapshot, they are frequently the source of humorous exchanges. We agree with Mr. Walters that the Principles can and should withstand significant, heated debate. We also believe that the Principles are only useful to local communities when they are actively used.<p>	 The question we will grapple with over the next few years is whether the strategy-local interpretation of a common set of ideas-has real potential to support better schooling, or whether it does, as its skeptics claim, ask more of school folk than they are willing or able to give.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="stmoc"><h3>Sustaining the Momentum of Change</h3><p>If schools are to engage in schoolwide renewal over time, the momentum for change has to be sustained by the faculty and the community over time, also. Historically, efforts to change have been stalemated by the transition of one principal or superintendent to the next, or by the departure of important faculty. Interestingly, at Oak Hill, despite the departure of two principals and the retirement of three faculty, support for change appears to have grown steadily. A major factor is the superintendent, who was the high school principal previously. She created a resource-rich environment for the faculty when she was at the high school, and now is providing the same for the entire district. Dr. Brenner is heavily involved in the state's restructuring effort and has ensured the compatibility between what the district and the state are doing. Seen as manipulative by some, touted as the champion of the district by more, she has been the single, most important force for change.<p>	We are not unaware that the presence of the study has had some effect on change efforts. In addition to the visits, the study sponsored faculty participation in summer seminars on the development of student-centered curriculum (a study of math and science teachers' roles in Coalition schools) and provided the opportunity for the staff to visit with eminent educational leaders such as Ann Lieberman, Art Powell, and Seymour Sarason. <p>	On the other hand, some staff have gained interest purely as a result of their own investigations. One staff member took an evening course on alternative assessment with her daughter. Another did independent reading that led her to conclude that the school's direction might just be on target.<p>	At the same time, the faculty worked hard to develop the interpersonal skills to deal with conflicting views. With those skills, the capacity to discuss, to argue, to confront, and to clarify has been extended. As the debate among faculty moved from the typical "polite-but-separate," it seems to have become intrinsically more interesting-and frightening-for the participants. <p>	The principal who replaced Dr. Brenner was hired by her and was carefully screened in terms of his ability and willingness to foster and support the school's effort. He, in turn, approved of shared leadership, so faculty took an increasingly lively interest in organizing and conducting staff meetings. In the last year, virtually all of these meetings have been run by staff. This suggests a new kind of opportunity for professional growth for teachers. Places where the staff is challenged and growing are far more likely to persevere than places where the staff is stifled and opportunities are scarce.<p>	The community has been uncommonly supportive. While communities around the country are succumbing to the second back-to-basics movement of the far right, or the restrictive satisfaction with their own schools but discontent with others that the <cite>Phi Delta Kappan </cite>reports each year, parents and business people alike in Oak Hill seem to recognize the need for change and appreciate what the staff is doing. Their enthusiasm may extend from a combination of the following factors: the fairly well-educated, liberal backgrounds many come from; the work Dr. Brenner has done-seminars and community town meetings; and the fact that the local newspapers cover education better than most. Whatever the reasons, parents in this community continue to encourage teachers to tackle major obstacles like state tests and to create meaningful and engaging work for their children.<p>	Students also contribute to the momentum at Oak Hill. While they complained and worried about being "guinea pigs" during the first year of reform, they generally accepted and were cheerful about changes in ensuing years. Students here, for the last two years, have consistently seen the Investigate program as beneficial to them. They debate the advantage of the exams teachers are creating to substitute for the SBEE. While we heard much more fretting about the changes in examinations two years ago, we heard relatively little this year. While students expressed a fear that they wouldn't get into colleges two years ago, given the track record of elder schoolmates, those fears have subsided. Continuing to indicate that they would rather be challenged and work hard than slide through school, the students provide a steady impetus for teachers to understand what that might mean.<p>	Staff turnover has worked to the advantage of those interested in change. Two teachers suggested that they retired because they felt themselves unable to muster the energy to shift beliefs and attitudes. They were replaced by teachers who at the very least suggested their willingness to participate. It is also true that those staff who were not supportive of change contributed to the momentum for change. They raised good questions, which helped faculty to clarify their positions. They stimulated the discourse and, in many cases, refocused the staff on important issues. In a couple of instances, they strengthened the effort by solidifying the larger faculty around issues like teachers' rights to professional development and travel. Without these people, the effort would have less depth and less clarity.<p>	Currently the faculty faces another new principal. There is not the trepidation this time that there was last time. Many staff and most parents hope for a leader who can promote and support change so that they can continue on their journey. The greatest challenge may lie ahead if and when key teachers leave, although leadership for change is spread widely throughout the faculty, or when the superintendent leaves. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wc"><h3>Whole-School Change</h3><p>Research on schools in their first three or four years of work in the Coalition suggests that individuals are able to effect differences for kids in classrooms, but that, with the exception of schools that are able to start from scratch, whole faculty have yet to be engaged.6<p>	We set out to determine what <cite>whole-school change </cite>might be, how many faculty that might require, and whether whole faculty might be able to build sustained effort. In traditional comprehensive high schools, everyone doesn't agree, but everyone does participate in a single organizational design. We have to determine the role of dissenters, and determine what constitutes a "whole." On cursory glance, if we examine decision-making processes, the whole faculty is involved. If we look at the number of people who are affected by change, the whole school is involved. If we look to see how many students' experiences are affected by change, again, most are. With the exception of only a few teachers, everyone is involved in some way.<p>	What accounts for this expanded participation? The size of the faculty significantly affects its ability to engage in whole-school change. The fact that the faculty can sit comfortably in the music room contributes to its ability to make decisions as a group and makes the task of joining together much easier than it would be for a larger faculty. The recent transition from Dr. Brenner to Dr. Goodman might have facilitated greater involvement in two ways. Dr. Goodman provided less clear direction. As a result, more faculty got involved. At the same time, he defused some of the tension that existed for those who did not support Dr. Brenner's direction. The fact that the staff is largely a homogeneous group cannot be ignored either. These, too, are factors in whole-school change.<p>	Eventually, this current reform movement will depend on the ever-increasing numbers of whole schools who can provide stronger images of schooling for neighboring schools and for policy makers alike. Oak Hill's movement from a vanguard to larger faculty involvement seems promising in this regard.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="part4"><hr><center><h2>Part 4<br>Where to Now?</h2></center><hr>When we started this study three years ago, we stated in our first snapshot that the staff was at a crossroads. A number of changes had been made, but few affected the daily lives of students. We suggested that their challenge was to move deeper into further analysis of their own regular practices. If they chose to stop where they were, they would join the ranks of hundreds of reforming schools in this country who struggled, but in the end, made changes that improved the lives of adults, yet seldom changed the intellectual life of young people. <p>	As the three of us finished our last site visit, we agreed that the staff had taken the less traveled road. Almost everyone on staff is involved in some aspect of redesigning the school to serve youngsters better. What used to be perceived as major obstacles-the schedule and the SBEE exams-are now redesigned each year by many faculty. The faculty's understanding of and experience with norm-referenced, criterion-referenced, and performance-based assessments grows each time we meet. What used to be a place that valued politeness over conflict is now a place that believes that its members can negotiate procedures for important disagreements and can weather the more productive and honest debate that ensues. And almost all students who go through this school will be asked to demonstrate what they know, so that their parents and local community members can assess their competence and their skill. It is a very exciting place, a place that has grown and pushed itself, a place that inspires hope in those who visit. It provides new images of how our high schools might work and get more from their students.<p>	Still, there is always the question, Where to now? We would suggest again the harder trail, the less familiar route, a path that leads to new ground in several directions. We would suggest much deeper discussions about instruction, a much greater focus on experimentation, feedback, and tough-minded, collaborative exchange on actual teaching techniques. Despite the fact that the faculty has been at this for a number of years, too many youngsters spend their time in Oak Hill classrooms in passive roles, required to do little meaningful work. While we know that many have challenged instruction directly, we would hope that the entire faculty might ask the question: What instruction consistently and over time helps our students learn to use their minds well? How many techniques are there that a teacher might use through the course of a year to build student capacity? What is it that teachers need to do every day in their classrooms to enable students to become active, confident learners? <p>	We hope the staff will work harder themselves and in collaboration with the superintendent to deal with the issue of time. Planning time needs to be included in the next iteration of the schedule. As part of the effort to use time more effectively, faculty meetings, early-release days, and teacher work days need to be planned for coherent and focused professional development for all. Staff need to set priorities and then work on a limited number of issues over time. If double-block periods require more various teaching methods, the staff could spend a year and more exploring possibilities together. <p>	In addition, we hope that the staff will pursue its interest in examining student work as a means by which to assess the quality of their efforts. A mutually sustained and balanced focus on curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment seems critical to the school's ability to better serve its students.<p>	Given past history, we believe that such a path itself would not be altogether unfamiliar; there will be controversy, exhilaration, confusion, and illuminating experiences along the way. Given the staff's heightened ability to negotiate the unknown, it might help to develop the kind of learning community in which everyone-students, staff, and parents-flourishes. We have seen powerful changes in the last three years; we hope to see more as the school community perseveres.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><h3>Notes</h3><p><ol><p><li> The term <cite>Exhibition</cite>, described in the sixth Common Principle, refers to a kind of assessment used for high school graduation.

Constructed in 1927, with entrances framed by imposing turrets, the school gives a first impression of being a cross between a factory and a castle. Yew trees, twisted and gnarled but still growing, cling to life along the thin strips of remaining earth surrounding the school. Approaching the school, we are greeted by steel bars and wire mesh on the windows. Massive, steel-reinforced doors are scraped and battered.<p>	As we pass the security guard and climb one of the two grand staircases leading from the entry to the main floor, we are struck by the dark beauty of the massive woodwork, plaster walls, worn wooden floors, and a mural depicting black leaders. <p>	This paper is not about the building, however, but about life within this imposing structure. In November 1992 we came to Marshall for our first visit, as part of the School Change Study. Our purpose was to chronicle life in the school, in order to gain understanding of whole-school change and, simultaneously, in order to provide a mirror to the people of the Marshall community that would help them in their efforts to better serve the young men and women who attend their school. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="abdo"><h3>A Brief Description of Marshall</h3>Marshall is a large, urban high school with a faculty of 150 people. Since the district has hired few new high school teachers in the past decade, the faculty consists of very senior people. About 45 percent of the staff are African-American, a statistic that becomes more significant as one looks at the student body, which is roughly 99 percent black. In November 1992, there were 2,057 students on the rolls. With an average attendance rate of slightly more than 60 percent, there are between one thousand and fifteen hundred students present on any given day.<p>	Located in a dominantly African-American neighborhood in the large, eastern city of Jefferson, Marshall is considered to be a comprehensive, neighborhood high school, even though it serves students from other geographical areas in the city. Marshall serves the students who remain after others have chosen to enroll in magnet programs created by the district as a means of integrating schools. As one student described it,<p><blockquote>This [school] is for the neighborhood kids....You know, Marshall is, like, if you get thrown out of one school, you're going to come to Marshall. If you get thrown out of jail, you come to Marshall! <cite>[at which point the group of students around him agreed and laughed] </cite>...because this is for, you know, people that are not doing well.</blockquote><p>	But not everyone sees the school the same way. For instance, one student observed, "When I first came here, I thought, 'I'm not going to like this school.' But this school has a lot of opportunities, and it's going to take a lot for me to leave this school!" One of the parents we interviewed told us, <p><p><blockquote>Out in the community there is a bad reputation for this school. Lots of people don't realize what's going on here that's good, but the kids have to learn to use the skills that they are teaching them here to spread the word.</blockquote><blockquote>Since back in the late '60s, this school has had a bad reputation; but when you can see your own kids doing better, you know something good is happening. A lot of the bad reputation comes from kids who hang out here but who don't even go here. A lot of the kids have the desire to achieve, but there are a lot who don't want to do anything.</blockquote><p>	Along with the usual features of a comprehensive high school, Marshall has some that are less common. The principal, who was on leave during our fall 1992 visit, successfully lobbied to create a nursery for infants and toddlers--one of the most promising efforts by Marshall to serve its students. Young mothers, who otherwise would be at home caring for their babies, can bring them to school, where two large rooms, formerly laboratories, have been converted into childcare facilities.<p>	Another success story at Marshall High School is its basketball team. For several years it has been among the high school teams in the country given high rankings by <cite>USA Today</cite>. It is easy to spot the members of this squad moving among--but above--the students flowing through the busy hallways. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fts"><h3>Focusing the Snapshot</h3>As we do each time we visit a school as part of the School Change Study, we produced a "snapshot" based on the two intensive days of observing classrooms and interviewing teachers, students, administrators, and parents by the two researchers.<p>	The snapshot also draws on observations and interviews by the author during four visits, beginning in the 1988-89 through the 1992-93 school years.<p>	We decided to focus this first snapshot of Marshall on the evidence of change in the high school. The first part examines the changes that Marshall has experienced as a result of district-wide restructuring efforts in recent years. The second part describes positive examples of instruction as well as changes--and accompanying challenges--in other aspects of life at the high school. The snapshot concludes with questions that this first visit raises regarding the future of Marshall High School.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tcom"><hr><center><h2>The Context of Marshall High School</h2></center><hr>Understanding the context in which Marshall operates, particularly the recent history of restructuring, as well as the ongoing issue of violence affecting the school, is central for understanding what it is like to learn and to teach at the high school.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="esor"><h3>Early Stages of Restructuring</h3>Marshall was identified four years ago as one of the schools to receive intensive attention by the foundation-funded Metropolitan School Restructuring Collaborative (MSRC). In examining the school's evolution during the course of this initiative, one first needs to recognize that the school has a life which precedes this time. Marshall alumni include well-known political leaders, educators, athletes, and entertainers. Teachers have toiled mightily for more than sixty-five years to educate a continually changing clientele.<p>	The fact that we pick up the story with the present efforts should not be taken to suggest a lack of effort and success by earlier educators. Nevertheless, by the time Marshall joined with the MSRC, attendance and graduation rates were at an all-time low, morale was bad, course completions were low, and the school's reputation in the community was much closer to the first student's description, quoted above (a place "for people who are not doing well"), than the second ("This school has a lot of opportunities and it's going to take a lot for me to leave .  .  .").<p>	The main thrust of the MSRC has been to break down Marshall and the other schools like it in the city into smaller units called "charters," which enable the teachers to know students better than before. The MSRC has also focused on improving instructional practices in schools by offering numerous seminars, frequently in connection with the district and local universities. The MSRC has also made efforts to enhance the role of teachers and to promote site-based management with the district and the local American Federation of Teachers (AFT) unit in order to improve the quality of the schools. In addition, the MSRC has given attention to student transitions from the eighth grade into Marshall and from Marshall into the worlds of work and higher education. <p>	One teacher-leader described the start of this restructuring effort at Marshall as follows:<p><p><blockquote>Four years ago, when they started this idea of restructuring comprehensive high schools, when they got the [foundation] grant, the impetus was put out so they could get some teacher-driven charters. The whole idea was to come in and break these huge high schools down, so that you could get a better relationship with the students and with the teachers and get some of the isolation removed. </blockquote><p>	At Marshall, the first venture in personalizing education through restructuring was the creation of the ninth-grade Institute. Marshall shared this approach with a number of other schools who were faced for the first time with a large ninth-grade class, when the district eliminated the ninth grade from middle and junior high schools. In the Institute, teams of teachers concentrated on developing personal relationships with the ninth-graders as a means of easing the transition. <p>	The following year, the renewal team began charter development. Three teachers, who had all worked in earlier reform projects in the school and district, responded to the offer by the MSRC to "get ideas and share what you think you would like to do to form these new units." The teachers who were involved told us that as they brainstormed their ideas during the Thanksgiving vacation of that year, they realized that much of what they were considering was closely patterned after Coalition of Essential Schools philosophy.<p><p><blockquote>We didn't start out saying we wanted Coalition philosophy; it was kind of the other way around. We did that and we looked and we saw it matched very closely. [Three of us had] read <cite>Horace's Compromise </cite>...and more by Ted Sizer....</blockquote><blockquote>When the three of us sat down and actually started talking about the different types of things we were trying to do in our classrooms, the <cite>patterns </cite>really became much clearer. We started to see the recurring things, and that's when it sort of became clear it was a match to the Coalition.</blockquote>	As a result of these conversations, the school's renewal team recommended, in addition to the ninth-grade Institute, the formation of two charters that became known as the Overland Charter and the Business Institute, modeled after the school district's highly successful academies. (These academies are school-based, externally funded, career-oriented programs that draw students from various parts of the city.) The Overland Charter was designed to provide the entire educational program for a heterogeneous group of tenth- through twelfth-graders who would participate in classes organized around integrated, thematic units. Similarly, the Business Institute would provide the entire educational program for students interested in business careers. The Business Institute, however, lacked the external support and resources of the business-supported academies. The renewal team's recommendation was affirmed by a faculty vote to make Marshall eventually into a fully charterized school.<p>	In subsequent years prior to 1992-93, an externally created charter, the Auto Academy, was added, in addition to the locally developed Overland and Business charters. Also, a third comprehensive charter focusing on communications was created. During our visit, conversations were under way regarding the creation of additional charters. <p>	One of the problems the school has faced is what to do with special education students. The MSRC specifications call for charters to be inclusive entities, yet the traditional pattern of dealing with special education students at Marshall and elsewhere separates these students.<p>	During the third year of the MSRC initiative, Marshall's faculty voted to become a letter-of-intent school.1 As such, the faculty would follow a planning process designed to culminate in a faculty vote authorizing the establishment of the council and site-based management as an official, district- and union-approved leadership structure for the school. At this point, the renewal team evolved into a school-based management council. During our fall 1992 visit, the acting principal told us the faculty had rejected its council's site-based management plan, since only 73 percent, rather than the requisite 75 percent, had voted for it. A second vote was pending. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="v:acf"><h3>Violence: A Challenge for Revitalization</h3>An episode a few months before our visit symbolizes the status of the revitalization effort. On a warm spring day in 1992, television crews from NBC were at Marshall filming activities in the Overland Charter for a broadcast that was to be presented at the start of the 1992-93 school year. The crew was highly impressed with what it saw, and eventually offered their footage as evidence that successful education could take place in one of the nation's urban high schools. <p>	While they were gathering their film footage in one section of the building, the principal was dealing with a different kind of a scene. Following an assembly, fourteen girls had engaged in a rumble. The assistant principal for discipline, the school security office, and a local police officer joined the parade of students entering and leaving the principal's office as she dealt with this latest crisis. As calm finally seemed restored, she turned to us and said, "I should have known better than to schedule an assembly on a beautiful spring day like today." She then went on to explain that the girl who appeared to have started the fracas by attacking another girl with a knife was the only one still at school; the others had all been suspended. She had to keep the instigator in school until this young woman's child returned with the other toddlers in the nursery from a field trip.<p>	This spring scene is not offered to suggest that the Overland Charter is faultless and the rest of the school is a sea of violence. As our visit revealed, the crew could have found outstanding instruction in classrooms in several of the charters. The scene is presented to show the simultaneous presence of exemplary and problematic conditions that characterize the school. It is this set of contrasting conditions which must be kept in mind by the people of the Marshall community as they continue their struggle for revitalization. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="eoca"><hr><center><h2>Evidence of Change at Marshall</h2></center><hr>In November 1992, it was clear that Marshall was undergoing change in several respects. Observations in classrooms revealed examples of innovative instruction in the charters, and our interviews brought to light the changes that the school is undergoing and the challenges it is facing in terms of its leadership and structure. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="iitc"><h3>Instruction in the Charters</h3>The following "close-ups," which are based on the researchers' observations in classrooms, portray classes in the Overland Charter as well as in other charters.<p><h4>English </h4>The nineteen students, who have read <cite>Antigone</cite>, are about to present modern versions of it. The teacher tells them to get in their groups (boys and girls have formed separate groups) and practice their presentations. These presentations culminate four weeks of reading, discussing, and writing about the play. <p>	The students range from ninth-graders, repeating their first year of high school, to seniors. Some of the kids are on the school's honor role. The arrival of one boy is a surprise to the teacher, who says she hasn't seen him in three weeks. Two boys are mixing their music, which is very loud, and the teacher asks them to turn it down. As the preparation continues, some typical student silliness breaks out: a girl, stuffing a beach ball into her T-shirt, acts as if she is pregnant, to the amusement of others in her group. A couple of boys stop by the classroom and indicate they want to join the fun, but the teacher shoos them on their way.<p>	Having given a five-minute warning, the teacher starts to arrange the room for the performances. She creates a stage area in the front of the room, then calls the first group, all boys, to begin performing.<p>	As the boys move to the front, the teacher tells the class to keep in mind how well the performance follows the themes of power in <cite>Antigone</cite>. The issue of power is tied to the essential question being pursued this year by the Overland Charter: "What is the relationship between power and inquiry?" <p>	A boy begins by setting the scene in Jefferson, in gang terms (with overtones of <cite>West Side Story</cite>). The explanation is clear, but the audience is distracted by some of the members of the group who are muttering to each other while the narrator speaks. Finally he tells them to "shut up," and the performance begins. They begin the first scene by attempting to show how revenge will be enacted. They move slowly, ponderously, through their scene, controlled by the narrator, who cues the others through their lines. Following the performance, the teacher questions the group about the changing of the play's ending that their script entails. <p>	This discussion is followed by a four-minute performance by one of the students in this group. He performs a popular rap about a high school boy who becomes a drug runner and gets his whole family involved, just so he can get money for his mother, brother, and sister. It is a remarkable, nearly professional act.<p>	After the teacher reminds the students that she is listening to their scripts for parallels to power themes in <cite>Antigone </cite>and for cooperation in the performances, the second group performs. There are moments of wonderful humor in their story--mostly having to do with language and culture, and these students end with a rap also--their equivalent of a Greek chorus. <p>	The final group appears the most organized. They have a number of props, including plastic guns. Their performance brings loud clapping from the other kids, who seem to appreciate the extra work the group did in preparing the script.<p>	Quickly, the teacher yells at them to put the room back in order and take out a pencil or pen. She passes out a paper on which they write their names and then respond to three questions: "What role did you play in today's performance? What stood out today for you? Which group was best and why?" She makes it clear that she wants them to work individually and that she is looking for detail and thoughtful reflection. All the students begin to write. <p>	When they finish their work, the teacher asks them to share from their writing. As they read, the teacher responds, probes, and asks for clarification. Students listen quietly to one another, and then, when the bell rings, discuss one another's performances as they exit the room. Everyone has participated. They seem to understand the issues of power contained in the play they were adapting. <p>	Is this a typical class for the school? Maybe not. But it represents a level of intense involvement of students in active learning about difficult materials--the kind of involvement which this author has seen in the same teacher's room on two other occasions.<p><h4>Biology</h4>In a different charter's classroom, we find eighteen students sitting quietly at their desks as they prepare to take a test. The class starts, soon after the period begins, with a student passing out the tests and the teacher talking the class through the various segments of the test and answering scattered questions about it. <p>	For this biology test the students are allowed to use one set of notes. Most work intently, although one boy in the back of the room is still reading his textbook. As the students work on their test, the teacher writes assignments on the chalkboard for upcoming science and technology classes. They will be investigating endangered species and animals. For pre-class work they will be expected to apply the terms <cite>threatened, extinct</cite>, and <cite>endangered </cite>to a list of animals that includes the white rhinoceros, black rhinoceros, African elephant, American bald eagle, dinosaur, vulture, alligator, baboon, and California condor. This class will also be writing a research paper using three different sources from their bibliography. They are to select one animal from the pre-class work list and explain its status as either threatened, extinct, or endangered.<p>	As the biology students complete and turn in their tests, the teacher tells them that they are going to finish dissecting their worms, then learn about hookworms, and end with earthworms. After having a brief conversation with them about legal cases that limit the extent to which they can do live dissections, she talks about an upcoming assignment. For that assignment, they will spend two periods in the library, where she will help them use the new computer setup to get books from any library in the city. <p><h4>Other Classes</h4>In one class we saw, a teacher developed an elaborate and sophisticated system of individual folders to help students work on individual projects. A social studies teacher described in detail how she used the concept of "less is more" by focusing on the Constitution to help students learn about government. Reading from the textbook about the court system, the teacher in another social studies class drilled the students on vocabulary and paused to help students understand the terms and write them in their notebooks. <p>	A parent, who talked with pleasure about the thematic focus of the Overland Charter, commented on her daughter's interest in the previous year's theme of <cite>change </cite>and the of the interviews the daughter had conducted to learn more about this year's theme of <cite>power</cite>. In a junior ROTC class, we watched students learn about the chain of command, consider management theories, and discuss current events. Students alternated between acting like young air force cadets and acting like typical teenagers. One member of our study team summarized her overall conclusions about instruction at Marshall by saying, <p><p><blockquote>I saw evidence of sustained, collaborative student work, with students serving as peer teachers as well as enacting the Principle, "student-as-worker." As I sat through a non-Overland, two-hour class, I saw evidence of students working, of students engaged with their teachers and the learning process.</blockquote> <p>	Students shared numerous examples of their projects with us and talked about essential questions guiding their study. Students also spoke positively about the value of group learning and suggested it is unusually well integrated into the routine of their daily academic lives. In Overland Charter and other charter classes, we saw students working actively and engaging with their teachers in creative learning processes.<p>	Data compiled by independent evaluators examining MSRC grants have revealed improvement in attendance, course completion, and grades for students, particularly for those involved in Overland. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cil"><h3>Changes in Leadership</h3>When we visited, Martha Brown, who had been chosen with support from the faculty, was serving as an acting principal at Marshall. Martha explained to us that the change process had been initiated by Andrew Lincoln, the principal who was on leave. Speaking about Lincoln, she said, "Lincoln had come to the school with a reputation for creating and building new structures. He had come from a middle school background, and he opened up the first middle school, I guess, in Jefferson back in the 70s." Brown said she thought the principal "was possibly placed here to begin this effort of change--because of his background as a mover and a shaker, a man of action, a man of movement."<p>	Opinions vary, however, as to what the early sources of leadership were at the school. One person told us that it was a vice principal, who has since left, who "really spearheaded, in terms of the administration, the renewal process. She knew a lot about the Coalition." After going to Brown University for a summer workshop, "she came back here and really carved a lot of places to help .  .  . Overland starting <cite>[sic] </cite>up." This administrator is credited with having had a "strong affinity" to moving towards engaging the whole school in the Coalition. But, as one person put it, "The first few years the person we had as our restructuring assistant principal was gung-ho, but now she is gone."<p>	Whether early leadership came from the woman serving as assistant principal or from the male principal makes little difference; both have left Marshall.<p>	As noted earlier, teacher leadership emerged early in the restructuring process. Department heads, union leaders, and other teachers were cultivated by the MSRC; yet, according to several of the teachers, the MSRC erred in not engaging the full administrative team in their work.<p>	Organizational consultants were brought in to work with leaders and to help with group process, but there still have been clashes between people in old and new roles. The most evident form of such clashes is between department heads and charter coordinators. One teacher in the school described the situation as follows:<p><p><blockquote>Department heads in the city system teach only one class.2 Therefore, you have a lot of older people who are just entrenched. They work very hard to get away from kids. They are protected by union contract--they have a nice setup.</blockquote><blockquote>So Overland comes in, and they start looking to spread the wealth. Those are real battle lines, and they haven't been handled well here or in the MSRC.  ...Another problem is that the administration hasn't handled it very well. You don't want to wipe out your heads if you don't know what will be in place.  ...So we have chaos. </blockquote><p>	Specifically, as leadership roles evolve, the battle lines appear to be between the coordinators of the new charters and the heads of the established departments. Who has authority? Who will assign people to courses? Who will determine curriculum? Who will receive extra compensation?<p>	Charters received extra financial support while they were being developed and coordinator roles were being created. As the soft foundation money began to disappear and union concerns accelerated, the conflict between the new coordinator roles and those of longtime department heads seemed to expand.<p>	The evolution of site-based management councils presents additional conflicts. At Marshall, the council chairs believe they are trying to engage all people in the school in decisions. Other people see the chairs and some council members as favoring selected programs.<p>	Still others are not sure what the role of the council should be, and point to confusion between the roles of the principal, the union's building committee, department heads, and the new Governing Council. Some at the school suggest that the Governing Council simply discusses matters, but that real decisions are made by a vote of the entire faculty; others suggest that decisions are made less democratically.<p>	The role of parents in the new Governing Council continues to introduce its own ambiguity into the scene. Some parents speak positively about the opportunities the Council presents them, and others indicate, by their lack of participation, that they doubt its efficacy.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="catc"><h3>Conflict Among the Charters</h3>During our visit, we saw progress in several of the charters deliberately created to personalize education for students and to be an environment in which instructional programs could be invigorated. At the same time, we saw indicators of conflict and jealousy among the new sub-units--indicators that suggested the progress was in danger of being overwhelmed by differences among the adults in the school community. <p>	A teacher-leader viewed this conflict in terms of interactions between Overland faculty and others concerning involvement in Coalition of Essential Schools activities:<p><p><blockquote>It was almost to the point where I wouldn't talk about it. If something had to be presented, somebody else had to do it, so it didn't look like it was coming from Overland. I mean we had to really maneuver so that even if there was a good message to be passed, the right person had to stand up or it was just wrapped up in all this other baggage....</blockquote><blockquote>They think Overland took the best teachers. They think that Overland takes the best students.3 They think that we are elitist. They think we have all the favors done to us. They think we get all the attention. They think we have favors done for us that nobody else gets. </blockquote>	Our interviews suggested that this Overland teacher had an accurate understanding of his peers' views. We witnessed a discussion among representatives from various elements of the faculty and administration at Marshall which also revealed these feelings. In the discussion, teachers traded charges and countercharges about which charter received the most favors, the most outside money, the most attention, and the best students. <p>	By the time of our visit, this conflict seemed to be accelerating. Some Overland teachers were seeking (or at least advocating) autonomy as a school separate from Marshall, even if it meant that they would become part of a middle school campus. Unless this conflict is managed better than it appears to be, it will be difficult for the entire student body of Marshall to receive the enhanced education some of Marshall's teachers and the MSRC are seeking.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rotf"><hr><center><h2>Reflections on the Future of Marshall</h2></center><hr>As intensive as our examination was, two days and a few other short sessions provided much too brief an examination of the school to predict what will happen at Marshall. Rather than predict the future, we close this first snapshot by raising some questions which we hope the Marshall school community will address as they consider their future.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="qftf"><h3>Questions for the Future</h3><h4>1. Coalition of Essential Schools and the Nine Common Principles </h4>Recognizing that the Overland Charter is the only portion of the school which has officially embraced the nine Common Principles, we still believe the school can benefit from considering questions such as the following: In what ways do faculty members use the nine Common Principles? To what extent do the Principles define what the teachers of all the charters, and all the students at Marshall, are trying to achieve? <p><h4>2. Instruction</h4>Whether or not teachers pursue the Coalition's Principles, our visit leaves us with some questions concerning instruction, which we believe the people at Marshall should consider. In what ways must pedagogy change for there to be real reform in the school? How can all charters address the needs of the full range of students?<p><h4>3. Support and Leadership</h4>In light of the seemingly intractable problems facing Marshall's students, how do the central administration, union, department chairs, principal, charter coordinators, teachers, and parents negotiate supportive processes and roles on behalf of these students? How can leadership roles best be clarified--whether those roles are individual, as with department heads, charter coordinators, or school administrators, or whether they are related to efforts to develop group decisions through involvement of teachers, parents, and administrators? How can conflicts between old and new structures be resolved?<p><h4>4. Management of Competition Among Charters</h4>Given existing circumstances in the school, it seems quite possible that competition among the charters will destroy them. The hoped-for gains of personalization and better instruction may be lost in the fighting over personal power and scarce resources. How can such competition among charters and among individuals within the school be managed so that the energy involved is used as a constructive force toward the betterment of education for all students? Finally, this competition raises the issue of how differing visions of educating young people can exist constructively in the same school.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ct"><h3>Concluding Thoughts</h3>Marshall is a school with tremendously difficult challenges. There are many people doing heroic jobs. Our visit revealed glimpses of instruction that were inspiring and individual visions of exciting futures. We hope that during our return visits we will see progress in the difficult issues that are holding up the achievement of these visions.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><hr><center><h3>Notes</h3></center><ol><li> "Letter-of-intent" schools are those schools that  responded to invitations from the joint committee of district and union officials responsible for developing site-based management in the district. If the plans they develop are approved by a 75 percent vote of the faculty, they can ask the joint council for waivers of policies and contract provisions which give them greater independence in their day-to-day operations.<p><li> Another teacher-leader told us that department heads are now supposed to teach two classes, but that so far most of them in the district seem to have found ways to avoid this mandate.<p><li> This charge is the most common leveled against Overland and other sub-schools implementing Coalition Principles. In this case the data suggest that Overland students represent a cross-section of the school, but the effects of a group of students who choose to be together in what is perceived as an academic program as a variable is probably greater than sheer demographic data can indicate.<p></ol><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr><p><a href="../../../projects/sc/chanlong.htm">Appendix A: About the School Change Study</a><br><a href="../../../principl/principl.htm">Appendix B: The Common Principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools</a><br><a href="../list.htm#2">Return to Index of School Change Publications</a><p></body></html>

Located in a dominantly African-American neighborhood in the large, eastern city of Jefferson, Marshall is considered to be a comprehensive, neighborhood high school, even though students from other geographical areas in the city attend the school. Marshall serves the students who remain after others have chosen to enroll in magnet programs created by the district as a means of integrating schools. <p>	Marshall is a large high school with a faculty of 150 people and a student body of about two thousand. Close to 45 percent of the staff are African-American, a statistic that becomes more significant as one looks at the student body, which is roughly 99 percent black. <p>	Along with the usual features of a comprehensive high school, Marshall has some that are less common. One of these is a nursery for infants and toddlers. Young mothers, who otherwise would be at home caring for their babies, can bring them to school where two large spaces, formerly laboratories, have been converted into childcare facilities. Another special feature at Marshall is its basketball team, which, for several years, has been among the high school teams in the country given high rankings by <cite>USA Today</cite>. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tcot"><h3>The Context of the School</h3>The work at Marshall takes place in a complex environment, consisting in part of a large city school system which, while committed to decentralization and strengthening of instruction, is a victim of the bureaucratic problems facing all large organizations. The work also takes place in the context of a community where poverty, violence, racism, and other social ills conspire to make the task of educating children monumentally difficult. <p>	Marshall is an urban high school that is part of a district-wide school revitalization effort initiated by a foundation-funded collaborative. We call the collaborative the Metropolitan School Restructuring Collaborative (MSRC). The main thrust of the MSRC has been to break down Marshall and the other schools like it in the city into smaller units, called charters, which enable the teachers to know students better than they could before. <p>	Two charters, the Overland Charter and the Business Institute, were modeled after the school district's highly successful academies. These academies are externally funded, career-oriented programs within schools that draw students from various parts of the city. The Overland Charter was designed to provide the entire educational program for a heterogeneous group of tenth- through twelfth-graders who participate in classes organized around integrated, thematic units. Similarly, the Business Institute provides the entire educational program for students interested in business careers. <p>	In subsequent years prior to 1992-93, the Auto Academy, a charter created by the district's academy office in conjunction with the auto industry, was added, in addition to the locally developed Overland and Business charters. Also, a third comprehensive charter focusing on communications was created. During our visit, conversations were under way regarding the creation of additional charters. <p>	During the third year of the MSRC initiative, Marshall's faculty voted to become a letter-of-intent school.1  As such, the faculty has followed a planning process designed to culminate in a faculty vote authorizing the establishment of a Governing Council, with site-based management as an official, district- and union-approved leadership structure for the school.<p>	Marshall is also affiliated with the Coalition of Essential Schools through the state's Re:Learning initiative, and through a direct linkage established between the Coalition and its district in 1992.2  Marshall's primary linkage with the Coalition, however, has been through the Overland Charter.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fts"><h3>Focusing the Snapshot</h3>As we do each time we visit a school as part of this study, we produced a snapshot of the researchers' observations and interviews during our visit to the school. Each snapshot depicts a school at a particular point in time, along with pertinent information about the environment in which the school operates. The snapshot is to be used by the teachers and administrators at the school as a mirror to assist them in charting their own course. As researchers, we will also use the snapshots to seek greater understanding of the challenges faced by schools that are committed to change.<p>	The following snapshot is based on two intensive days of observations and interviews by two researchers in May 1993. The researchers also examined and collected some documents regarding current happenings at the school. Information gained by the author during other discussions with people in the school district, union, and MSRC also supplements the field notes. <p>	The first part of the snapshot briefly examines the problems in the district that have an impact on Marshall's reform efforts. The second part presents perspectives on Marshall from the points of view of the teachers, administrators, and students. In this part, progress is also examined in terms of the nine Common Principles, ideas that the Coalition of Essential Schools uses as guideposts to drive school reform. (See Appendix B for a list of the Principles.)<p>	The snapshot concludes with some reflections on what the future might hold for Marshall High School.<p>	Our focus in the snapshot is on the school and the people who inhabit it. However, the success of the school in elevating student performance will ultimately be determined by the extent to which progress is made in curing the ills of the broader setting, as well as by what happens in the school. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="pitd"><hr><center><h2>Problems in the District in 1992-93</h2></center><hr>During the 1992-93 school, year several circumstances significantly influenced the pace of restructuring within the district. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="vafp"><h3>Violence and Financial Problems </h3>From the beginning of the school year, outbreaks of violence in the district's high schools absorbed considerable amounts of the top leaders' energy. Even when there were not violent acts at a particular school, the time devoted to establishing procedures for inspecting children to make sure they were not bringing weapons onto campus, and the general need for increased supervision of students, competed with attention paid to improving instructional programs for students. <p>	The district was also faced with a series of financial problems which directly affected high school reform efforts. These financial problems caused the school district to give each sub-school unit engaged in reform considerably less money at the beginning of the year than promised. These same financial difficulties also affected bargaining in the fall, and continued to influence relationships between the school district and the teachers' union. Cutbacks in the availability of federal Chapter I funds caused added financial woes.<p>	The final blow came in the spring, at the time of our visit to the school. Faced with reductions in state funding and slower-than-predicted local tax collections, the district decided to make overall cuts of approximately $60 million, with about $18 million of the cuts scheduled to come from the high schools. The teachers at Marshall reacted with the same general lack of enthusiasm exhibited by teachers, administrators, and parents throughout the district, as they faced the task of making budget cuts. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tioe"><h3>The Impact of Early Retirement</h3>In spring 1993, the state legislature offered bonuses to employees who retired early. Because of some rather unique components of union agreements and past practices within the district, central office leaders, principals, and teacher-leaders not only left in large numbers, they began leaving prior to the completion of the school year. District-wide, nearly eighty principals needed to be replaced. <p>	By the summer of 1993, the superintendent and her most senior immediate assistants had added their names to the list of retirees. As planning was under way for 1993-94, the deputy superintendent had retired, and the associate superintendent for operations, whose duties included all personnel and labor relations functions, as well as one of the two assistant superintendents for high schools, also had retired. The interim superintendent, who had been appointed to fill the position until a national search was completed, had no direct replacements for any of these departed leaders--although their responsibilities had all been reassigned to continuing administrators. <p>	The effects of early retirement were felt at the school as well. During 1992-93, Marshall's principal was on sabbatical and was replaced by an interim principal. For 1993-94, another person was appointed as an acting principal. The school also faced the loss of an assistant principal and several longtime teacher-leaders. Our visit took place at the height of rumors regarding the superintendent's plans, and at a time of uncertainty concerning the assigning of new principals and vice principals at Marshall and other high schools in the district.<p>	Other issues, such as a court review of district desegregation and new state mandates for curriculum, had less immediate impact on Marshall but were part of the environment within which the people at Marshall worked. <p>	When we asked one Marshall teacher what was new in the spring since our visit the previous fall, she responded, "Not much. I think it's just gotten frantically chaotic." Thinking of her remarks and the context in which Marshall operated in the spring of 1993, we are reminded of the following comments from the preface to Tom Peters' <cite>Thriving on Chaos</cite>:3<p><blockquote>To thrive "midst" chaos means to cope or come to grips with it, to succeed in spite of it. But that is too reactive an approach, and misses the point. The true objective is to take chaos as given and learn to thrive <cite>on </cite>it.</blockquote>	Most of the people at Marshall, and, for that matter, throughout the district, would have been happy to be perceived as thriving in the midst of chaos.  <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fvom"><hr><center><h2>Four Views of Marshall in the Spring of 1993</h2></center><hr>Taken together, the perspectives of the teachers, administrators, and students, as well as the perspective of the nine Common Principles, suggest how Marshall was faring in spring 1993, in the midst of the particular set of chaotic conditions in its environment. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ftpot"><h3>From the Perspective of Teachers </h3>As we talked with the teachers, impending changes were on everyone's mind. <p>	Rosemary, a teacher-leader, told us:<p><blockquote>It's unprecedented having so many people retire and so many people moving around like this. We should know the major decisions in a few weeks, but right now it's really tense. And I have to wonder how all of this will affect our change efforts....</blockquote><blockquote>Is <cite>anyone </cite>capable of handling all the problems these kids bring in?</blockquote>	Two other teacher-leaders, Bruce and Earl, talked with us about the changing leadership in the school. Bruce told us, <p><blockquote>There could be no one back next year. I mean, Harold [the assistant principal] is already officially retired. Friday was his last day. Max and Martha [the assistant principal and principal] are both on principal lists and they're out interviewing right now. So we can have one scenario where we have no administrators returning.</blockquote>	When we asked what the consequences of such scenarios might be, Bruce responded,<p><blockquote>I don't know. I hear names in the pool--nobody gets excited about any of these names on the principal's list or anything else.  ...I don't know how many principals are left out there that support school-based management, or think about charters, or are progressive enough that really want to talk about what this restructuring means.  ...When you look over the names, they are not exactly the movers or the shakers who have bought into this movement. </blockquote>	Earl was a little more optimistic when he said, "There are some principals I wouldn't mind seeing here." However, he went on to say that the ones he could think of already had high school positions and were unlikely to want to give them up. <p>	Bruce and Earl then had the following exchange, which reveals the mixed feelings of others with whom we talked about what was needed in the way of administrative leadership:<p>Earl: There's some people who would come in and maybe "ride herd" on a place, but when I try to think in terms of people coming in with outreach and forethought and some vision, I don't think they're out there.<p>Bruce: I'll take someone who rides herd. I'll take someone who rides herd but is smart enough to get out of those people's way who want to do things. I don't know if that combination is there.<p>	A part of the reason for the interest in "riding herd" undoubtedly comes from the perceptions of many teachers that students are out of control in the school. For instance, when Rosemary described the impact of certain conditions on Marshall's reform efforts, she told us, "This year has been most difficult. Our behavior problems have sapped our energies, so I think that we have paid less attention to instruction." <p>	What this teacher referred to as "behavior problems," other teachers addressed more vehemently. Bruce told us:<p><blockquote>It's just been a very tumultuous year..., like when you were here in November with the fires and stuff like that. And it never really got better. I mean, one of the results was that Earl's hand got smashed in the door. He's been out since March. He was in his room and he answered the door because there was a knock, and as he opened the door, the kid--who knows how?--kicked, shoved, and smashed his hand.</blockquote><blockquote>To me, the students are out of control. The building's out of control. I call for NTAs [non-teaching assistants]. They're breaking up a fight somewhere else. I can't open the door and go out. When I've opened the door, kids have rushed into my room. I can't get them out. You know what I mean. So, like, you sort of lock yourself in your room and don't try to go out there.</blockquote>	As we continued to talk with Bruce, Earl joined us and acknowledged that he was "living proof of the chaos going on here."<p>	Given the nature of the problems, it was not surprising that most of the classrooms we visited were locked by teachers so that students passing in the halls could not enter and disrupt proceedings.<p>	While we visited in the spring, Harry's car was stolen from the school lot. The magnitude of troubles staff were facing and their ability to maintain a sense of humor in the face of these troubles were evident even in this incident. When asked if he was upset about the theft, Harry responded, "At least I didn't get hit by lightning when I went out in the parking lot." <p>	Teachers had their own views regarding progress being made in restructuring the school. They told us about new charters planned for the coming school year. Some expressed concern that development of charters was causing the school to lose its focus, and others expressed hope that they would be able to pursue the idea of charters having an ultimate level of autonomy, in which the restrictions of the school structure could be overcome.<p>	They also told us about having narrowly voted down school-based management,4 but expressed the belief that eventually this approach would win approval. They also spoke in various ways about what was happening at Marshall concerning Coalition of Essential Schools ideas--a subject we will take up in the closing section of this snapshot.<p>	Perhaps one teacher summed up the general mood and views of the faculty when she told us, "Right now, I'm apprehensive. I don't want to hear any more bad news. Faculty morale is very low--the budget cuts--but I do think that we can get back on track."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ftpotsa"><h3>From the Perspective of the School's Administration</h3>As mentioned above, one principal was on a career-ending sabbatical and an assistant was acting as an interim principal. When we began talking with the administration, we were told that, in addition to the retirement of the second assistant principal during the first week in May, one of the department heads had left as of the end of April. In all, it was expected that the toll from the early retirement legislation would be twenty-one staff, administrators, and teachers. <p>	While we visited, the administration was preoccupied with budget reductions. They showed us charts indicating that the school needed to reduce its budget by $341,700. They planned to achieve this reduction by making such cuts as eliminating athletics (a proposed savings of $121,000)5 and eliminating two department heads--a possibility because of retirements anticipated by three of the current department heads. <p><h4>Violence and Safety</h4>One administrator told us,<p><blockquote>Our student behavior is finally settling down. We employed metal detectors in April--it was a sobering experience for all of us. Every child was searched. Fifteen were arrested--ten girls and five boys for carrying knives, mace--but no guns. These weren't the notorious ones--they were the "good" kids who said they needed this stuff for protection.</blockquote>	Administrators did say that "student incidents took attention away from academics and change movements this year." They also told us about SAVE (Students Against Violence Everywhere), which had been initiated by students and received support from many politicians and community members.<p>	While she objected to the depiction by our first snapshot6 of Marshall as a school in the midst poverty, the acting principal made the following observation about Marshall,<p><blockquote>Our restructuring may have to take many forms to account for the violence, the teen pregnancies, drugs, AIDS, homelessness. School is not just about scheduling and curriculum. We are dealing with the social pieces of these kids' lives all the time.</blockquote><blockquote>We see "new poverty"--once-working people are not now. And we see dysfunctional families for all kinds of reasons, including the new poverty.</blockquote><blockquote>This is what impacts Marshall every day. Unless we take care of these things for our kids, nothing else will happen. Kids are involved in street crime so much earlier now. </blockquote>	From these comments, she went on to narrate her involvement with probation officers, homeless families, and with other significant problems facing her students. <p>	As we talked with the principal about these matters, we were struck by the way in which chaos seeps into the daily routine at Marshall. A teacher interrupted us to talk about prom tickets, the woman in charge of the daycare program came in to talk about funding for next year, the phone rang, and the principal engaged in a conversation about a special-needs student who had been placed in a residential facility. While we talked, a student from a nearby university hovered outside the door, waiting for an interview that had been omitted from the principal's calendar. As the principal attempted to juggle all these things, she mused to no one in particular, "The whole city doesn't know what is going on." She also explained to us, "[All these activities] are not really interruptions; it's just that I am constantly facilitating."<p><h4>Looking Toward the Future</h4>In spite of all her concerns, the acting principal spoke with optimism about the future. When she shared the 1993-94 educational plan for Marshall with us, she took pride in pointing out that three-fourths of the students (all except a group left over and referred to as "comprehensive students") would be part of a smaller unit or program. These units included the Auto Academy and Business Institute, which focused on careers. These units also included academic charters, each with a particular emphasis.<p>	Special opportunities were provided for children of the young mothers who were enrolled as high school students, and special education programs and Chapter I services completed the plan's components. <p>	The Chapter I program was no longer a scheduled group of remedial math and reading classes, but had become a "charter-driven entity." That is, each charter would determine its own content, and Chapter I math and reading teachers would adapt their lessons to suit the charter curriculum. This plan, part of what was defeated when the faculty rejected participation in school-based management, envisioned a leadership group for 1993-94 of a fifteen-member governance council made up of teachers, parents, administrators, and paraprofessionals chosen by the union's building committee and the administration. <p>	Martha also showed us the airline tickets for students from Marshall and Forest Park,7 another high school in Jefferson, who would be traveling to Libreville, West Africa, for an African summit. As she commented on the funding of this experience by Pepsi, she also mentioned the $5.2 million grant on student retention which Marshall shares with three middle-school feeders and ten to twelve elementary schools, and other grants obtained from a nonprofit organization within the city. Commenting on this funding, she observed that in many ways her role is that of a broker.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ftpos"><h3>From the Perspective of Students</h3>Student voices gave us another view of Marshall. One student, Ron, told us, "This school is a very good school, despite all the negativity that goes on." In particular, they shared with us their feelings about safety and violence, and they expressed their own opinions about their teachers.<p><h4>Students Speak About Violence</h4>When we shared the stories we had heard about violence at the school, Amanda responded,<p><blockquote>Yea, I have heard them talking about a lot of fighting going on. Or, kids saying, "I'm not going to Marshall! Uhh uhh, that's a bad school." I ask them, "What's bad about it? Tell me what's bad." They'll answer, "I hear somebody got shot and there was somebody got stabbed," or "you all get beat up," but it's not like that at all.</blockquote>	Ron told us, <p><blockquote>When they had searches one time, they took beepers. They did find a couple of weapons, like knives or mace. And it was from, like, kids you would never think. Like the quiet, quiet kind. To one boy I said, <cite>"You </cite>carry the knife? I mean, <cite>you</cite>?" He said, "I work at night, after school." So he carries it to protect himself when he walks back from work. And most of them, it's just like, it's for protection. I mean the streets aren't safe these days.</blockquote>	The defense of the school by these students does not mean that students generally disabused us of the notion of chaotic behavior suggested by the teachers. These students were talking about the part of the building where they spent their time. These students and others shared with us stories of the creation of SAVE, a group formed by students to counter the spreading violence. One of the students explained this organization:<p><blockquote>It's a collaborative group of students who oppose violence, not only in the school, but outside the school too. We meet frequently ...and we talk about things that we can try and do to stop it, and different activities that go on around the school. We make pledges and read them.  ...We had a panel discussion with a lot of important people here.</blockquote>	To help us understand the nature of the conversation among the students about non-violence, Ron asked us to think about how it was to be a kid in a group that was trying to avoid violence, but was being harassed by other students:<p><blockquote>The kids that ain't never been in trouble or whatever, what are they supposed to do? Stand there and just let them push them around, or just defend back? People were in disagreement on that one. One said, "Well, it was self-defense." Another person said, "But you should have run and got help." And another asked, "But how can you get help when they're hitting you?" And like that.</blockquote>	Turning from the theoretical to specific, Ron then described a situation in which a group had been harassing him and his friends. Eventually one of the group ran up to his friend and hit him. This led to a fight, which caused a number of students to be prohibited from attending the prom and which threatened them with non-participation in graduation.  Ron told us that these consequences led to the active engagement of parents: <p><blockquote>But our parents came in and they talked and then we had a conference with all the parents--their parents and our parents. And their parents, everybody, was just crying and stuff. And their parents were like, "You shouldn't do this," to the principal. "You shouldn't do this--take this away from them and everything." And she gave it back to us.</blockquote>	The right to participate in graduation was restored, but only one of the students was permitted to attend the prom--a student whose mother was at the school the next day. For that student, it was a bittersweet reprieve, since he found himself the only one of his friends permitted to attend the party.<p>	As teachers and administrators have told us, students confirmed the violent nature of the environment outside the school. Once, as we were asking a student to tell us about something he had learned, he responded by explaining that he had learned to call home regularly. Since we had anticipated information about learning in the classroom, we asked him to elaborate. He told a complex story, the gist of which was that his mother had always required him to call home, but he hadn't, until something happened to his brother. This is how he described the incident:<p><blockquote>He was nineteen. He always told [our mother] where he was going. And then he stayed out. He stayed out; he didn't come back the next day. And Mom said, "Where is he? He usually calls, he usually calls. He never called. He ain't calling us." And he never called us. And then she called the police and reported him missing. But they said he was nineteen years old and maybe he wanted to get out for a while or something like that. And my mom still had a fit. </blockquote><blockquote>Two days go by. He still ain't called, still didn't come home. She didn't want to move. And the third day, the news was on, and they said they have a decomposed body at the city park. Like, his girlfriend was curious and called. She asked for a description of the clothes they had. And he had on the same clothes. So they said my mom ought to come down there and everything. Down to the police station. It was true; it was my brother. And that made me think, like, that could happen anytime. He had got killed.  ...Now I call every minute where I'm at. </blockquote>	Stories such as this help make it clear why administrators and students viewed the creation of SAVE as such an important event in life at Marshall during the spring of 1993. <p><h4>Students Speak About Their Teachers</h4>Students also shared their views of teachers. One told us about her social studies teacher, Miss Quincy:<p><blockquote>She's not a teacher of mine, but I had her, like, last year. She's real nice and she's easy to take advantage of. And her feelings--she's real sensitive. If you say, like, "Boo!" she's, like, crying. She's real sensitive. That's why I asked her, "Are you sure you want to be a teacher?" You know, you have to do it. Teenagers! You've got to be, like, ruthless sometimes; you've got to be, like: "Sit down!"</blockquote><blockquote>She's supposed to give a test, but, like, I got A's in there. Like, she'd say, "Here's a test," and you're, like, "I ain't doing that!" She's, like, "OK, well nobody will take the test." And she would take all the papers back and stuff. And--do you know?--she's easy to take advantage of.</blockquote><blockquote>But like Mrs. Stenger, you know Mrs. Stenger? Mrs. Stenger can handle a joke. And Miss Powell, she can handle a joke. She don't mind no jokes. And Mr. Olds, and Miss George. Don't none of the rest of the teachers; they don't play that. When they say something, they mean it!</blockquote>	In the midst of this chaos, in the midst of worrying about violence, budgets, and changing personnel, students were telling us that they believed there were some outstanding teachers at Marshall. We find clues to their criteria for judging teachers in such comments. Contrary to popular opinion, the students favor the teachers who have high expectations for them.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ftpoi"><h3>From the Perspective ofIdea-Driven Restructuring</h3>There are several signs of progress being made in generating a revitalized education for the students at Marshall. <p><h4>Learning Through Exhibitions</h4>Some teachers expected their students to demonstrate their learning through Exhibitions.8 Not only was this happening in the Overland Charter, which identifies itself directly with the Coalition of Essential Schools; we also saw evidence of it in other charters.<p>	Within Overland, we talked with students about the Exhibitions they were completing that provided evidence of their accumulation of knowledge throughout their high school years. Other Overland students told us about Exhibitions they were completing during their junior year, within specific subjects.<p>	One student talked about his senior project on hunger and power, which led him to research the warring factions in Somalia. He told us he learned a lot about the country and its government, but emphasized that the research skills were something he had already learned because "that's what Overland is all about." Rolling his eyes, he described his nervousness as he appeared before a panel that interrogated him about his project. The panel included two Overland teachers, an eleventh-grade student, and a parent-liaison staff member.<p><blockquote>When I sat down, I tried to tell them everything, so they wouldn't have to keep asking me a lot of questions. So, they didn't ask me a lot of questions. I told them, "You can ask me about my graph." It showed about the percent of people that were starving in Somalia. </blockquote><blockquote>I was happy! They asked me about how my topic related to this year's essential question, "What is the relationship between power and inquiry?" I talked about the power the governments hold over Somalia and talked about the way I used inquiry in my research.</blockquote><blockquote>Also, I did my creative part: a poem with music in the background. I used Michael Jackson's "Heal the World" and said my poem.</blockquote><blockquote>Before the defense table, we had three worksheets to do on it, and we had to read. So when I got an 86.6 on the project, it was on a process grade, and then a portfolio as well as the defense before the panel.</blockquote>	The student explained to us that the portfolios included examples of work from each of his classes that was related to the essential question. Teachers helped us understand that the students could engage in a wide range of activities for the creative part of their Exhibition. For example, a student demonstrated how he could run a car on magnets. Others had used maps and drawings.<p>	While much creativity was in evidence, teachers and students tended to agree that too many waited until the last minute to complete the work--in one class, only three students indicated they had stayed on the suggested schedule for the project assignments. Still, unlike some schools around the country which have spent years talking about doing  Exhibitions, students in Overland were doing them, and teachers as well as graduating students were learning from these experiences. <p>	Every major class within the Overland charter required students to complete a project which went into the students' portfolios. The portfolios were judged by a panel of faculty members. Each charter faculty member was responsible for helping prepare five seniors for this exit presentation. For example, a math teacher told us about three-dimensional depictions of various math concepts which she helped students prepare, since the charter teachers were trying to encourage connections with the arts and the major classes. While this activity appears to build on the Coalition idea of Exhibitions, the teacher, Miss Roberts, made it clear to us that the projects had not been framed by any direct faculty discussion, study, or reflection concerning the Coalition Principles.<p>	Other students, besides those in Overland, also worked on Exhibitions. Juniors told us about presentations on various topics and explained the value they obtained from being members of the panel while seniors made their defense. In another charter, seniors told us, "We have already done our  Exhibitions and the grades are in. Those counted for 20 percent of our total grades in each class. So, we know pretty much how we have done." <p><h4>Becoming an Essential School</h4>As we noted in our first snapshot of Marshall,9 there is considerable conflict among the various charters within the school. There is a tendency of non-Overland teachers to complain that the Overland teachers get all the breaks: the good kids, the most money, the greatest amount of publicity and recognition. During our spring visit, we saw continuing signs of this problem and heard stories of conflicts among students as well as among teachers. However, we also learned of positive collaboration, such as the students from one charter who used their expertise with video to make tapes of Overland Charter Exhibitions. Perhaps more significantly, we saw signs of progress in relation to some Coalition Principles in various settings in the school. We even saw progress in classrooms like that of Miss Roberts, who disavowed direct connection with the Coalition, at the same time she acknowledged that her team may have "got the idea" while attending a meeting with the Overland Charter about Coalition Principles. <p>	In various parts of the school, we saw attention to the Principles of expecting students to use their minds well and of focusing on a limited number of important academic issues, as in the Principle of "less is more." <p><h4>A Lesson on Essential Questions</h4>One of the most vivid examples of attention to the Principles that we have seen at any high school we have observed emerged from conversation in an English classroom about what the essential question should be for Overland classes for the coming school year. <p>	The teacher, Mrs. Stenger, began the discussion by helping students know that essential questions would be ones which<p><ul><li>are not easily answered<li>must connect to all classes<li>contain key words and ideas<li>require a complex answer<li>require inquiry/research<li>should be worthwhile</ul>	These criteria were not simply listed for students to copy, but emerged out of a lively exchange between teacher and students. As the students began to work in groups to make recommendations of three possible topics, Mrs. Stenger circulated, prodding a group to think about how the topic they were discussing might play out in chemistry, or how physics would fit with a question being posed by another group.<p>	Some students revisited earlier topics of power and change. Others began to extend the issues by asking where power comes from and where it ends. Out of these conversations came some possible essential questions:<p><ul>	<li>	What is the effect of each person in the world?<p>	<li>	How does education affect me and my community?<p>	<li>	What is the real value of an education?<p>	<li>	How does an individual change the world?<p>	<li>	Who educates--the student or the teachers?<p>	<li>	Why ask why?<p>	<li>	What is the relation between education and learning?<p>	<li>	What is the difference between learning and wisdom?<p></ul>	Following the listing of these and other ideas, the groups continued their deliberation and finally identified the following possible questions:<p><ul>	<li>	Whose rights have the greater importance, the group's or the individual's?<p>	<li>	What kind of events produce change in the world?<p>	<li>	Where does society get its power to control others? To control individuals?<p>	<li>	How do you get access to quality education?<p></ul>	While these questions may need more work to satisfy the list of criteria articulated earlier by Mrs. Stenger, they are certainly questions which would demand that students use their minds well--questions which could serve the conserving function anticipated by the aphorism "less is more."<p>	During one of our interviews, two students revealed the extent to which the notion of essential questions had been internalized. After we had asked them about some questions they were studying, they turned the tables on us. They asked that our interviewer identify what the relationship is between power and inquiry. Nodding or raising their eyebrows as the interviewer spoke, they finally concluded that the answer was "Umm, pretty good." These students had a definite idea of what it means to learn something.<p>Jean: If you've just got somebody standing over you, saying, "This and that, and you must do this and that." And they're just talking to you, I mean, it's like, "I hear you." But somehow it's leaving. I'm hearing something but I can't really catch on to it, you know?<p>Donna: Yea. You mean somebody is like just talking <cite>at </cite>us.<p>Jean: Yea. And you know, you have to play around with it for a little while 'till you want to get the full meaning of it.<p>Gary: Which is what we get from our projects.<p>Jean: 'Cause by me doing research and stuff for my projects, that's how I'll be learning if I'm out there, 'cause sometimes the teachers don't give you the full meaning of it.<p><h4>Student as Worker</h4>The students extended this conversation to explain how "doing" <cite>Othello </cite>had helped them overcome the barriers created by differences between their own and Shakespeare's language. For them, the doing that had been important included more than reading the play aloud; it included translating it into their own time and own words--making a rap or a talk show of it. <p>	The notion of active engagement in learning that is central to the Coalition concept of "student-as-worker" was evident in one student's description of her assignment to become a teacher:<p><blockquote>In one of our projects, we had to be a teacher for three days. I taught my momma, my dad, and my sister. I taught them algebra. At first my dad said, 'I ain't doing it.' But he did it anyway. And, for three days, I gave them class work, and then gave them homework, and then gave them a test. And I graded it. And then our teacher gave us each a paper for them to answer questions and for me to answer questions. They  filled it out and I put it in my portfolio. My mom said that I would be an excellent math teacher.</blockquote><h4>Personalization of Instruction</h4>In addition, an emerging, focused academic curriculum that had characteristics of an Essential school, another important element of restructuring ,was evident at Marshall during our spring visit. For the MSRC that is initiating some of the change efforts in the district, the creation of small, personalized units is a centerpiece to their work. For the Coalition, personalization of instruction is an equally critical principle. As we saw Marshall in the spring, we translated the results of attention to these issues to matters associated with <cite>knowing</cite>--teachers knowing students, students knowing teachers. The extent to which knowing existed became a good clue for us as to the learning that was occurring for students, as well as to issues related to the climate of the school.<p>	Earlier in this snapshot we shared specific examples of chaotic conditions. Of particular concern for teachers, students, and administrators were the behavior or control problems, the instances of violence, that grew out of these conditions.<p>	With regard to this situation, consider the following comments (with emphasis added throughout):<p>Student: Overland, I mean, you don't see nobody roaming over here--when the bell rings, everybody's in class. Here we have to automatically be in the classroom or, see, we have consequences, <cite>'cause they know us</cite>.<p>Second student: Yea. They know us.<p>First teacher: The teacher comes and tells [the students] that they have to get to class--they won't. They'll just shove you out of the way with a few choice words: "You can't make me do anything." "What are you going to do because you can't get anybody fast enough and you can't make me, and I <cite>don't know you</cite>, and who cares?" <p>Second teacher: No, no. <cite>Knowing me, knowing me</cite>--there's a very different response from the kids than if they don't know me. So they'll get aggravated at me, but it's not when I'm with the kids that I feel in danger, even when they're ripping mad at me. First of all, they'd never surround me; they'd never cut me off; they just don't do things like that.<p>Third teacher: If they know the teacher, they respond better. I know that if it's a kid in our charter, I get a very different response than if it's a kid that I don't know. ...And kids from our charter that roam, I mean, other people in the building won't necessarily know who they are, and that they shouldn't be there.<p>	For some teachers, the unit was their classroom, rather than a charter, but in most cases there was an acknowledgment that there were few problems with students they really knew.<p>	The apparent dilemma raised by these comments is that while the small sub-schools (the charters) create situations in which students are known and thus less apt to be causing trouble, they also create situations in which students are <cite>not </cite>known, as they leave their part of the building and journey onto another charter's turf. <p>	This raises a significant question for those whose solution to the chaotic conditions is to create increasingly autonomous charters within the larger structures. However, this question should not cause us to ignore Marshall staff's and students' powerful testimony to the importance of personalization.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rotf"><hr><center><h2>Reflections on the Future</h2></center><hr>In the first snapshot, we encouraged the people at Marshall to examine the nine Common Principles in more depth in order to think about how they might find direction for their own restructuring efforts. We asked them to think about how pedagogy in the school needed to change to address the full range of students at their school. We also asked them to think about several issues related to leadership and support for restructuring. We were particularly concerned that they consider how to deal with competition among the charters, which appeared to be emerging in an unhealthy form. <p>	As new leadership joins with those who continue at Marshall to begin the 1993-94 school year, our original questions still seem to be ones which need attention. While we acknowledge the difficulties of planning that Earl Miller expressed when he spoke of "trying to imagine the problems for next year while we're experiencing the problems for this year," it can only be the people at Marshall who find solutions to problems. Ideas such as those provided by the local MSRC or the Coalition of Essential Schools can challenge their thinking, but only the teachers, administrators, and parents of Marshall can develop the school they need. <p>	As they plan for the future, the Marshall community would do well to keep in mind the following paraphrase of one of their teacher's comments:<p><blockquote>What we need is some freedom--some room. Right now I feel we can deal with internal struggles in our charter. What I need is a loosening of constraints that are around me. I can't do anything about the class size. The schedule is changed, but it is still hard to fit what we want to do in it. </blockquote><blockquote>I can deal with the spectrum of teachers. I can deal with struggles with integration and the curriculum. I can tackle the chaos generated by student behavior. I can deal with all these things because I know that as a team we really do work on it. </blockquote><blockquote>But I have no control on these outside things. I'm sandwiched into a place. I'm molded by something that doesn't understand me, doesn't understand where I want to go, where the team wants to go, what the problems are. And I'm forced within their limitations and can't really do anything about it. </blockquote>	For the future, the task seems evident. In the views of this teacher, the task seems to be creating a setting where there is freedom to grow and within which there are the supporting conditions required to enable people to take advantage of this freedom--in Tom Peters' words, finding ways to "thrive on chaos" instead of continuing to struggle in the midst of chaos. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><hr><center><h3>Notes</h3></center><ol><li> "Letter-of-intent" schools are those schools which responded to invitations from the joint committee of district and union officials responsible for developing site-based management.

Much of the program was, in fact, preserved. For Marshall, the loss of athletics would have been particularly significant, given the national reputation of its basketball program in particular.<p><li> Richard W.

Marshall perseveres in the context of a community where poverty, violence, racism, and other social ills conspire to make the task of educating children monumentally difficult. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="abdo"><h3>A Brief Description of the School</h3>Located in the large, eastern city of Jefferson, Marshall is a large, urban high school with 150 faculty and about two thousand students. Since the district has hired few new high school teachers in the past decade, the faculty consists of very senior people. About 45 percent of the staff are African-American, a statistic that becomes more significant as one looks at the student body, which is roughly 99 percent black.<p>	Marshall is considered to be a comprehensive, neighborhood high school, even though students from other geographical areas in the city attend the school. Marshall serves the students who remain after others have chosen to enroll in magnet programs created by the district as a means of integrating schools.<p>	The large, city school system in which Marshall functions, while committed to decentralization and strengthening of instruction, is a victim of the bureaucratic problems facing all large organizations. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rre"><h3>Recent Restructuring Efforts</h3>Marshall is part of a district-wide school revitalization effort initiated by the foundation-funded Metropolitan School Restructuring Collaborative (MSRC). The main thrust of the MSRC has been to break down Marshall and the other schools like it in the city into smaller units called "charters," which enable the teachers to know students better than they could before. <p>	Two charters, the Overland Charter and the Business Institute, were modeled after the school district's highly successful academies. These academies are externally funded, career-oriented programs within schools that draw students from various parts of the city. <p>	The Overland Charter was designed to provide the entire educational program for a heterogeneous group of tenth- through twelfth-graders who participate in classes organized around integrated, thematic units. The Business Institute provides the entire educational program for students interested in business careers. In subsequent years prior to 1992-93, an externally created charter, an Auto Academy, was added in addition to the locally developed Overland and Business Charters. A third comprehensive charter, focusing on communications, was also created. During our visit, conversations were under way regarding the creation of additional charters. <p>	Marshall is also affiliated with the Coalition of Essential Schools, through the state's Re:Learning initiative and through a direct linkage established between the Coalition and its district in 1992.1 Since 1992, the MSRC has also functioned as a Center for the Coalition and a link with Re:Learning in the state.2 Marshall's linkage with the Coalition, however, has been primarily in connection with the Overland Charter. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="stit"><h3>Still "Thriving in the Midst of Chaos"?</h3>In the spring of 1993 we described Marshall as "thriving in the midst of chaos."3 We suggested the school still needed to give attention to issues we had identified the previous fall: thinking in depth about the nine Common Principles, changing pedagogy to reflect the demographics of the student body, and determining how best to provide leadership and structure for the school. We were particularly concerned about conflict within the school stemming from competition among the charters, which function as sub-schools within Marshall. <p>	We concluded from our visit that the main task facing the school was creating a setting where there is freedom to grow and where there are the supports necessary for enabling people to take advantage of this freedom. We quoted Tom Peters:<p><blockquote>To thrive "midst" chaos means to cope or come to grips with it, to succeed in spite of it. But that is too reactive an approach, and misses the point. The true objective is to take chaos as given and learn to thrive <cite>on </cite>it.4</blockquote>	In short, after watching the school from 1989 to 1993, we concluded that Marshall needed to find ways to thrive <cite>on </cite>chaos instead of continuing to struggle <cite>in the midst </cite>of chaos. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fts"><h3>Focusing the Snapshot</h3>With these thoughts in mind, we returned to Marshall to produce our third "snapshot" of the school. As a snapshot, it does not seek to provide a comprehensive picture of the complexities of school life over time; rather, it is an attempt to capture the experience of learning and teaching at Marshall at one point in the school's change process. As part of a study of five schools, it is also intended to contribute to the overall understanding of whole-school change. <p>	The purpose of this snapshot is also to provide a mirror which teachers and administrators at Marshall can use to help them seek greater understanding of the challenges they face and to develop ways of addressing those challenges. Thus it is written for consideration by two audiences: the school being described and the people interested in school reform of the type advocated by the Coalition of Essential Schools and the MSRC.<p>	Unlike previous snapshots, which were based on observations and conversations from one visit, this snapshot is based on two data-gathering efforts by Neill Wenger and Barbara S. Powell at Marshall during 1993-94--the first in November 1993 and the second in May 1994. Documents describing classroom and school-level reform efforts were also collected from the school. It also reflects continuing interaction by the author with the Jefferson school system. During their visits, the two researchers observed classes and interviewed students, teachers, administrators, and parents. <p>	This snapshot focuses primarily, but not exclusively, on Marshall's Overland Charter, which attempts to use the nine Common Principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools as the guideposts for its educational program. (See Appendix B for a list of the nine Common Principles.) <p>	The first part of the snapshot summarizes events that occurred in the district-wide context of the school in 1993-94. The second and third parts, which correspond with the two visits that inform this snapshot, describe the challenges, problems, and progress at Marshall in the fall of 1993 and in the spring of 1994. To encourage and guide discussion about the issues raised by these visits, suggested questions are provided for the Marshall staff and for the reader throughout the snapshot. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tcom"><hr><center><h2>The Context of Marshall:Events in the District, 1993-94</h2></center><hr>At the district level, the 1993-94 school year in Jefferson was dominated by a variety of challenges and changes. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cftd"><h3>Challenges Facing the District</h3>The superintendent's resignation in August initiated a difficult selection process that went on for many months. After his resignation, an acting superintendent served the district throughout the rest of the year. While the board conducted a national search for a new leader, the board president and other members became more outspoken on day-to-day matters within the district.<p>	In May 1994, as the board narrowed its selection field to a pool of three, conflict erupted between various local officials regarding the selection of a new superintendent. The mayor and a group of local citizens supported one candidate, while the teachers' union and the administrators' union supported a different one, and the board objected that people were interfering with their conducting an orderly search. In mid-June, the selection by the board of the candidate favored by the mayor ended a dispute that was beginning to have racial overtones.<p>	During 1993-94, a judge ruled on a long-running desegregation suit, finding that Jefferson's schools had failed to provide education of a satisfactory quality, particularly for its students of color. As she announced the panel to address academic quality in Jefferson, the judge said, <p><blockquote>[I tried to] put together a team of experts that I think can come into [the city] and do what has to be done to develop a plan which will, once and for all, eliminate the disparities in academic achievement and bring about academic quality in the city.5</blockquote>	Financial woes continued for the district, with new cuts of $29 million being called for on top of the major reductions from the previous year. Credibility of financial projections continued to be a problem for the district when, after projecting a $30 million deficit for 1992-93, the district ended its fiscal year with a $12 million surplus.6<p>	Violence in and around the schools continued to be a major concern in Jefferson, as in other communities around the country.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rewt"><h3>Reform Efforts within the District</h3>Several major actions connected with reform efforts occurred in the district during this same period. <p>	The acting superintendent secured school board approval of a twelve-point strategic plan, based on work by a community-school task force. She and the board expressed pride in the inclusiveness of the group which developed the recommendations. Among other things, the plan continued work on high school reform. Specifically, it called for the initiation of collaboration by clusters of schools and for the development of full-service schools. People working in schools throughout the city demonstrated little interest in, or awareness of, this planning. <p>	The assistant superintendent for high schools announced a requirement that all students be enrolled in schools-within-schools by the fall of 1995. She described those sub-schools using a set of criteria slightly different from that previously used in the district. For the second year in a row, her office audited existing implementation--an act seen by some as indicating her support for the reform and by others as an indication that all the central administration can do is check on compliance with rules. Along with the MSRC, her office also took the lead in providing assistance to schools on implementation problems around matters such as rostering classes. In the spring, in efforts to equalize financial support for leaders of charters, the assistant superintendent also announced a controversial reallocation of the money paid for charter coordinators. <p>	Amidst transitions in the MSRC (the founding leaders of the MSRC resigned in August 1993, and an acting director was not appointed until midway through the year), a new Teaching and Learning Collaborative was created within the MSRC, and efforts were begun to staff centers that would provide support to schools seeking to implement reforms. One of these centers was located at Marshall. The MSRC funded a large team from Marshall and other schools in the district to attend the Coalition of Essential Schools' Fall Forum in Louisville, Kentucky, and continued to work with the Coalition and the state's Re: Learning offices. It also sponsored several workshops during the year, including a large Celebration of Charters in early spring. Teachers College Press published a book edited by one of the former leaders of the MSRC, which included chapters by teachers and others engaged in reform work in Jefferson.<p>	An independent evaluation agency released a report in March 1994 which noted that the charters being promoted by the MSRC had a positive effect on student attendance and promotion from grade to grade. While the report emphasized continuing implementation problems, it was a big boost for advocates of breaking the high schools into smaller units. <p>	Meanwhile, the union raised questions about the legitimacy of the board of the MSRC and expressed its continuing resistance to certain elements of the reform plan. The local AFT affiliate objected particularly to the notion of charters within the schools that would be semi-autonomous and thus possibly engage in practices that upset long-standing practices, such as seniority rights for teachers and traditional roles of department heads in high schools. This conflict arose as the MSRC and some of the people working in the schools, in interpreting provisions of the union contract, advocated treating charters as if they were schools. To do so would mean that seniority for transfer would be determined by charter rather than by building.<p>	As the year progressed, the acting director of the MSRC had some success in mediating conflict that had arisen between his organization, administrators in the district, the union, other reform organizations in Jefferson, and the primary funding agency. With the help of the funders, he also made progress in reconstructing the MSRC's board. The district and collaborative had to pay a high price for the time spent resolving (or at least calming) their differences. <p>	Eight ethnographers working in Marshall and other high schools reported in May 1994 that at each school where they had been, the perception was that there was no support forthcoming from central sources for school-based reform work. Much of this perception may have been created by the extent to which central figures (the MSRC, union, and school district) were concentrating on their own issues rather than on the needs of the school. In any event, reform progress, which had been stalled the previous year by the inability of the bureaucracy to adapt to a supportive role, continued to be inhibited rather than assisted by many district-and school-level administrators.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rotc"><h3>Reflections on the Context</h3>As we turn our attention to Marshall High School, we emphasize that the scenes we are describing in the school occur as part of the broader ecology of the Jefferson school district. They also occur in a city and in neighborhoods faced with the many serious social and economic problems confronting urban settings throughout the country. <p>	While organizational and leadership issues dominate the larger school system, teaching, learning, conflict, and survival are the matters of immediate concern to the people in the Marshall community. While the new leader of the school district will have a potentially significant effect on the direction the system takes, the problems of whether students will attend school and how they will behave when they do attend school are of much more immediate concern to the teachers and administrators of Marshall. Grand designs about providing social services occupy city planners, but such questions as, How can students be helped to learn? and, Who will take care of the children of the children who are attending the school? are central for those at Marshall.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="f1993"><hr><center><h2>Events at Marshall: Fall 1993</h2></center><hr>In spite of the general optimism with which people approached the year, we quickly learned during our fall visit that many of the elements that had led us to view the scene at Marshall as chaotic persisted. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tioe"><h3>The Impact of Early Retirement</h3>As 1993-94 began, two thousand professional educators had retired from the district in response to a state early-retirement plan. At Marshall, these retirements led to a number of changes, including an entirely new administrative team. 	When school opened for the year, Donna Foster was the new principal. She had previous experience at Marshall, but, as one teacher noted, it was experience at a "pre-restructuring" Marshall High School.<p>	Several years earlier, prior to a stint as an administrative assistant to the superintendent, Donna had spent fifteen years as a teacher. For two of those years, she had served as English department head at Marshall. Donna was the third principal in three years for Marshall and, like her predecessor, she was appointed as "acting principal." <p>	One of the new assistant principals had taught for seven years at Marshall, left the previous year for a six-month stint as assistant at another school, and returned in 1993. In the perception of several of the staff at Marshall, neither assistant had much experience with schools involved in serious reform. In fact, in the fall, the assistants openly shared their views that the climate of the school as a whole was suffering as a result of the focus on developing charters. In any event, it was to Donna and her new team that the task of helping the school "thrive on chaos" fell.<p>	Many at Marshall greeted the new principal and the new year with hope. Not only had Donna been a peer, she was familiar with the restructuring work connected with the Coalition of Essential Schools and supported by the MSRC. During her time in the central administration, Donna had established many contacts who the faculty hoped would help them get the support they needed.<p>	One teacher reported Donna's first communication with the teachers:<p><blockquote>After receiving her appointment in the summer of 1993, Ms. Foster called in groups of teachers. She told us that "group after group had the same things come out in their lists of what were the critical areas--it was hallway safety and discipline."</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="dwov"><h3>Dealing with Ongoing Violence </h3>We learned, as had the new principal, that the chief concerns of most teachers were, indeed, related to safety. We asked a longtime teacher and union leader at the school what she would say if an old friend asked her, "What's this place really like?" She replied,<p><blockquote>Murder. Right at the moment people have very negative feelings about the school, and rightly so. This is a school where you take your life into your hands when you enter the building. You don't know what is going to happen from one moment to the next. Yesterday a teacher's arm was broken by a student; he body-slammed her. He didn't even know her. He was not a student who she taught. Yesterday one of my current students and one of my former students were beaten with iron pipes outside of the school building. A carload of boys jumped out of their car and started beating them. No one yet knows why....</blockquote><blockquote>An off-duty policeman was shot one-half block from school at what they call The Stand. That's where people go to get sandwiches and sodas. </blockquote><blockquote>A carload of young men, armed with guns, pulled up in front of the school--this all happened yesterday--and started firing randomly out of the car windows. The principal was called by the police and told, "Hold dismissal," because it happened right before school was supposed to let out. Our own police officer, who is stationed in the building, took off after these guys. Somehow he caught one of them with a gun. Yesterday was a very exciting day. But these things happen all the time. </blockquote><blockquote>When I am teaching in my classroom--I have doors like we have in the library, old-fashioned double doors with glass panes. While I am teaching, groups of young men that I have no connection with--I've never taught them; they don't know me--come as a group and throw themselves against the door. They have this mission to break down my doors. It happens so much that my students ignore it. <cite>[She laughs.]</cite></blockquote>	When asked the same question, an administrator at first said that the friends would be surprised, because the school was much better than its reputation.<p>	However, he continued by telling us that the changes in the community, such as the heightening of violence, fighting in school, kids bringing in weapons out of fear of retaliation or out of the need for protection, have led to metal-detector searches on a random basis. <p>	When we asked students about their impressions of the school, some picked up on the violence identified by the adults in the school. One told us,<p><blockquote>I'll say, when you come to this school, only the strong will survive. I'll see people on the street and they'll say, "Marshall, that's the baddest school. You going there?"</blockquote>	When we asked about their impressions of Marshall, students also reported positive things happening as a result of the new principal. Consider, for example, the following dialogue involving several Marshall students:<p>	"Ms. Foster's like a Joe Clark."<p>	"Not really. She's not really strict. But she pulled the school together like Joe Clark."<p>	"She knows what to do."<p>	"She's more realistic."<p>	"You can tell a phony."<p>	For one student we interviewed, the difference between the fall of 1993 and the previous year could be quantified. He reported,<p><blockquote>Last year 60 percent of the kids were in the halls, 40 percent in the classrooms. Now it's doubled to 80 percent in the classrooms. If kids are found in the halls, they are put in class, so I say about 95 percent of the kids be in class. Even if they aren't learning, they still know something before they leave the class.</blockquote>	Students and others at the school shared a belief that they get a bad rap from the media. As one said,<p><blockquote>Every time you see something on TV about Marshall, it's about somebody getting stabbed, somebody getting shot. The media show the bad stuff, but they never come inside the school and see what's really good. The year before last, Tom Brokaw came, and it was the only time I saw something positive about Marshall. </blockquote>	In spite of this criticism of the media, most interviewees had some concerns regarding safety at the school. For several, the question of what to do about this problem dominated their thoughts about school improvement.<p>	One suggestion was to hold assemblies for the students. The following is a description of the "violence assembly" we observed at Marshall on November 17.<p><h4>A "Violence Assembly"</h4>Ninth-graders assembled in the large auditorium at Marshall for the second anti-violence assembly planned by the assistant principal, Pat Holmes.<p>	As the students took their seats, fifteen adult advisors remained standing in the aisles. Prior to the start of the assembly, while standing on the stage under the banner which read "New Year ...New Attitude. Marshall High School," Pat said to the advisors, "Give me the name of any student who misbehaves." <p>	She then turned to the students and told them the purpose of the assembly: "It's not an entertainment show. I am talking to nine out of ten of you. The ones who have not been in trouble. We're talking about your education, violence, and drugs." <p>	Reacting to the students who continued to talk, Pat said, "I know there is a wise guy, sitting in his seat, who says he doesn't need this."<p>	As if to prove the assistant correct, one boy began taunting a large girl sitting next to him, saying, "<cite>Free Willy, Free Willy</cite>." He obviously had more negative thoughts than the publicizing of the popular movie about a whale.<p>	The assembly officially began with the students reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. There were three adults and an ROTC student on the stage, but they were not the only ones we heard from during the assembly.<p>	The first adult told the students about a group she called MAS. She urged students to come to the office before a conflict reached the fight stage. To make her point, she described a recent fight in the lunchroom: <p><blockquote>One person looked at another. The first person took off his jacket. The second took off his jacket. They got into a fight when they didn't even know each other. It was just the way they looked at each other.</blockquote>	Speaking over the din of student conversation, she continued,<p><blockquote>A student at Marshall was killed over a basketball game. Let me tell you, death is permanent. You don't get to come the next day and talk about how good you look. On TV people die, and the next week they are on a TV program.</blockquote>	She chided a student for ducking down in his chair, then gave way to the next speaker, who explained the school's peer mediation program. <p>	This speaker explained four levels of discipline: suspension, arrest, transfer to discipline schools, and expulsion. She warned the students, "If you punch, you should be suspended."<p>	A sergeant in the ROTC followed with a description of ROTC and of the Student Assistance Program (SAP). He asked, "How many of you know what drugs and alcohol do to you?"<p>	No hands went up.<p>	He continued, "How many people have seen loved ones inflict pain? Drugs take your life, dignity, self-respect."<p>	It was hard to hear him, as students continued to murmur. He held up a yellow SAP card and assured the students, "We have to help you help yourself; to identify who needs treatment."<p>	The sergeant was followed by a woman whom some student greeted with boos as she was introduced. She tried to explain about a group called Rites of Passage, which provides drug and alcohol education in classrooms. <p>	Then Chris, representing the student organization, Students Against Violence Everywhere (SAVE), tried to speak. He paced back and forth on the stage, talking about drugs in the back hallways of Marshall, telling the students there would be a panel on racism in room 250, and assuring them that there were other ways to earn money than to sell drugs. Finally, frustrated with the inattentive audience, he ran across the stage, up the side aisle, and out of the auditorium.<p>	Identifying himself as the school ombudsman, the next speaker said, "I am like the school lawyer. This is your school. The only way it's going to work is if you make it." <p>	In response, a student shouted out, "Shut up!<p>	Struggling to maintain his composure, the ombudsman continued, "A lot of you females won't have a husband because there won't be any black men around."<p>	The girls cheered loudly.<p>	He muttered, "Think about it," and strode angrily off the stage.<p>	As if surprised, a student turned to another and said, "Look at him; he mad."<p>	Assistant principal Pat Holmes chided the students, "When you're older and more mature, you'll think back on this moment."<p>	Then Pat introduced a speaker from the Jefferson Anti-Drug/Anti-Violence Network by telling the noisy, inattentive students, "He did not have to come here today. This is not his job. I will not introduce him while there's talking. He's a guest! You treat him like one!" <p>	Then, first to the advisors and next to the students, Pat exclaimed, "I want the name and book number of students who are misbehaving. Remember, you're not anonymous."<p>	The final speaker told the students his aunt had died that morning, and began an emotional recital about his personal history as a drug dealer, gun runner, and prisoner in the state pen. The students laughed as he described foul practices that he had witnessed in the prison.<p><blockquote>It's a joke, until the handcuffs are slapped around your wrists. There are 150 people here <cite>[pointing to a section of the one thousand in the ninth grade at Marshall].</cite> The person sitting on your left or right will not be here in June.</blockquote>	The speaker went overtime, and the assembly was over. The ninth-graders, school security staff (NTAs), advisors, and speakers filed out past the police officer stationed at the back of the auditorium. <p>	Later, as we talked with Pat, we learned that part of the reason the assembly was conducted by grade level rather than by charter was because kids identify with their charter and "a lot of Marshall High School spirit is not there." <p><h4>An Anti-drug Video in Student Advisory</h4>As it happened, we had a chance to observe the same issue being dealt with in two other ways in the school. During a student advisory period, we watched as students saw an anti-drug movie on Whittle (Channel One) TV for the entire time. As the program began, there were eleven students in the room. One was listening to his walkman, two were sleeping, several were talking, and one was watching. <p>	The film features a white, thirteen-year-old freshman girl who dates an African-American boy. The boy lures her to a party in a fancy house where people are smoking crack. The girl takes up with a drug dealer she meets at the party. As her drug habit takes hold, her ability as a basketball player deteriorates. She asks her mother what she would do if she had a kid on drugs, but the mother is not helpful. <p>	As the film continued, students tuned in and out. Given the plot and characterization, their behavior was understandable. <p>	The teacher left the room. By this time, four students were watching the video. As the thirteen-year-old in the video was stumbling around the basketball court, one student in the class advised, "Take her out of the game."<p>	The scene shifts to a bunch of white kids, lolling in a haze of smoke, surrounded by drug implements in what, if the students were not already fully aware, would serve as a good lesson in how to prepare and do crack.<p>	As the film wound down, one student predicted that the protagonists were going to meet in the deserted hall of the school, fight, and drop the drugs. They did.<p>	One student in the advisory room commented that the children in the movie show no respect for their mothers. Another responded that black students would not treat their mothers that way. There was no other discussion of the video. <p><h4>Peer Connections to Stem Violence</h4>The third setting we observed was a meeting of a Peer Connections student group within the Overland Charter, which was followed by a meeting of these Peer Connections counselors with ninth-grade students.  Seven seniors met with their advisor, Michelle Sommers, to prepare for their first meeting with a group of ninth-graders from their charter. Previously they had participated in a peer counseling retreat at Princeton with young people from many different schools. <p>	As they prepared, the students commented on some of the recent changes at Marshall. They liked the new principal and spoke favorably of the new charter that had been created for students interested in teaching or medical careers. However, they were critical of the elimination of the ninth-grade Institute, a program that was originally developed to personalize ninth grade in order to ease students' transition into the high school. The students saw the elimination of the Institute as having contributed to this year's ninth-graders being more disruptive and less respectful of their school. <p>	All in all, they felt that Marshall was "what you make of it." Some felt that too many students were just playing around, and others said the school was "too violent." <p>	The day after their planning period they met with twenty-five ninth-graders in the school's community room. Michelle and two of the other Overland teachers were also present. While some of the senior counselors set up sodas, bagels, and assorted junk food on a table in the back of the room, the ninth-graders filtered in somewhat reluctantly. They picked up some of the food, then sat in metal folding chairs, which were arranged in a circle. The seniors, some with food still in their hands, moved into the middle of the circle and began to speak. <p>	One said, "I'm here for you. If you have any troubles in your classes, feel free to speak to me." 	Another added, "I'm like a shoulder you can lean on. This is my partner, LaTesha."<p>	After others had introduced themselves, Michelle intervened and suggested that the seniors needed to tell the group what their purpose was. The seniors got right to the point: "The purpose is to get your act together in class. Some teachers feel you're too wild."<p>	Michelle expanded on their comments:<p><blockquote>Some of you are feeling your little hormones. With the violence outside, we want to keep Marshall a peaceful learning environment. Some of you will need special loving care.</blockquote>	The seniors then explained that they had been trained as peer counselors to help these freshmen who had been identified as not taking their education seriously. (Actually, about twice as many as were present had been identified, but since the average attendance rate for ninth-graders in Marshall runs below 50 percent and this was a group which had more problems than the average, the turnout was a little better than could have been expected.) Some of the seniors shared the troubles they had experienced as ninth-graders, and then offered testimony to the way Overland, like a family, had been helpful to them.  <p>	Michelle asked Allie, a ninth-grader, to step forward. Allie said she had cut Mrs. Stenger's class. A senior acknowledged that he had not gotten along with Mrs. Stenger either. He said,<p><blockquote>I talked to her instead of cutting her class, and we worked it out so I transferred to Earl Miller's class. What you need to do is talk and work things out. You have a problem--come to us. Don't just come to class and sit there. Think!</blockquote>	Allie turned to Mrs. Stenger and said, "My name is Allie Brown. I'm on your roll."<p>	Mrs. Stenger replied, "Pleased to meet you."<p>	Everyone laughed.<p>	The conversations continued, with the seniors alternating between telling stories about their own difficulties and offering advice to the slouching but attentive ninth-graders. The seniors exhibited impressive maturity as they made this first attempt at connections with the younger students. They made it clear that in no way were they perfect, but that they knew talking things out would work, because it had become a tradition within the Overland Charter.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sq:vaop"><table border><tr><td><h3>Suggested Questions: Violence and Other Problems</h3><ol><li> What are the observable differences between these three attempts to deal with issues of violence and other problems facing the students of Marshall?<p><li> In what ways do the attempts appear to have produced different reactions from students?

To accomplish this increased personalization for its more than two thousand students, Marshall assigns all its students to a charter. One goal of these smaller units is the creation of settings in which each student is well known. Another goal of these settings is to improve instruction.<p><h4>Close-ups of Overland Charter Classrooms</h4>The Overland Charter takes personalization of instruction, as well as other Coalition Principles, seriously. The following "close-ups" of the researchers' observations in classrooms present some examples of instruction in the Overland Charter.<p><b>English.</b> Students in Mrs. Stenger's class are gathered in a circle, some leaning back, slouched over, with blank stares. Engaging them with her usual, bustling energy, she remarks that their body language does not communicate that they are doing well on their projects. <p>	She asks one of the students to review the story the class is considering, August Wilson's<cite> Two Trains Running</cite>.  Helped by a couple of other boys in the class, Anthony summarizes the story. Occasionally adding a comment, Mrs. Stenger makes the review, ostensibly for informing us newcomers to the group, serve the dual purpose of a review for the entire class. <p>	Anthony indicates that the story is a metaphor for the condition of race relations in the 1960s. He suggests that one of the events in the story symbolizes the feeling that some people had that you need to take what you want, because it is the only way you can expect to get it. Other events represent the concept of "going through the system" to get what you want. <p>	One student in the class comments that if you looked at all of Wilson's plays together, you could see the changes in race relations over time. As the conversation continues, the students focus on the alternative ways of getting what is wanted or needed. Mrs. Stenger then asks them if the main characters represent two ways of getting things:<p><blockquote>Which of these two ways, as African-Americans, do you identify with? Are you more like Sterling and Hambone [the ones who got theirs by taking it], or like Memphis [the one who got his by using the system]?</blockquote>	She assigns students the task of writing their answers. All have their writing materials and begin writing. When finished, the students begin discussing their papers in the circle, taking turns reading their responses, and making comments, such as: "I think it depends on the situation. I'm like both of them. If I can get in trouble, I won't do it ...but if I think I can get away with it, I'll do it." "I think both. If I know I can have it, then I'll go through the system."<p>	Several more suggest they would go through the system, and one latecomer asks for and receives clarification about the topic of conversation. Then Anthony says, "If I want some, I ask for it. But I'm not going to ask many times until I take it."<p>	Mike adds, "If somebody's standing in your way, you got to."<p>	Then Donnell joins with Mike and, in unison, they say, "Go around before them."<p>	And Mike provides an example, "Like, if you are standing in a long line at the movies. If the line is long, try to sneak in. If you get caught, then go through the system. Stand in the line."<p>	Students continue to read their responses, with some taking the point of view that they would stay within the system. Others say that they would try the system first and only "take it" if the system did not work. Some indicate, simply, that they would take one position or the other. <p>	Mrs. Stenger asks for a show of hands, "Does everyone agree that they are a mixture of both characters?"<p>	All but one of the twenty-one students raise their hands. <p>	Mrs. Stenger continues the conversation by asking them to talk about what they use to decide when they will stop asking and start taking. After a few student comments about this question (and the arrival of another student), Mrs. Stenger asks them to consider the system they have to go through to pass the class.<p>	Jeff says, "You have to do the work."<p>	Rose responds, "If you can't do the work, then cheat."<p>	The class breaks into laughter at this comment, and Rose hastily explains, "Wait! I'm<cite> not </cite>saying I'm cheating!"<p>	Mrs. Stenger then says, "Here's the point: The school represents a system. You can go through or outside of it."<p>	Mark responds, "But the system, peer pressure, parents, they cause the cheating."<p>	Another student joins in, suggesting that it depends on what you want to be: "If you want to be in the government, then go through the system. If you don't have goals, then be like Hambone and take what you want."<p>	Alicia responds, <p><blockquote>People can do things illegally so they can have a future. For example, I know a boy who sold drugs so he could go to college. If he had gone through the system, it would have taken too long to get through college.</blockquote>	Mrs. Stenger suggests that Memphis, and the students who agreed with him, are people who are willing to wait. But one of the girls in the class, indicating her agreement with Alicia, says,<p><blockquote>Going through the system can take too long. Like modeling school, if you can't do it right away, you can't wait. Time is hard on your looks, and you end up looking bad before you get out of modeling school.</blockquote>	The conversation begins to heat up. One girl mentions the dilemma a female faces about whether to sell her body. Several males suggest that is wrong--that they should work at McDonalds before they do that (clearly a solution within the system). <p>	Mike says emphatically, "Hold up! Say no more. A <cite>man </cite>wouldn't sell his body--he'd sell drugs." <p>	This remark causes Mrs. Stenger to jump in: "There you go! <cite>[To the others] </cite>Put your hands down; <cite>this </cite>is my turn."<p>	The room is in an uproar as the conversation focuses on sexism--a topic which clearly is an ongoing one in the class. The issue becomes defined as whether it is right for a female to sell her body in order to take care of her children. The room is in a frenzy. Everyone <cite>wants </cite>to talk. Males argue it would be wrong because it would set a bad example for the children. Females argue it is necessary because of basic needs--food, clothing, shelter.<p>	Mrs. Stenger takes the energy of this discussion and converts it to another writing task. Switching from a participant in the discussion to a facilitator of instruction, she tells the students to write their position on their paper: "Do you agree with the woman's point of view or the man's about doing what you have to do? Write it, don't say it....5-4-3-2-1--Write!"<p>	As students try to ask questions, the teacher redirects them to the task of writing. Moments ago, loudly engaged in debate, the students now write quietly. In contrast with students in other classes we have observed, these students expressed themselves in complete sentences. Not only have they been stimulated to write, they know they are expected to write well. <p>	In order to fit in another activity before the end of the first half of the two-hour class, Mrs. Stenger then asks the students to hand in their papers and tells them they will talk about them later. <p>	As she returns self-assessment essays students had written previously, she comments that she wrote notes if she disagreed with their perceptions. She asks for a show of hands of students ready for their major project (ignoring for a moment a comment by one of the boys in the class that was calculated to reopen the earlier discussion). Next, she asks the students to turn in project folders, including cover pages they had prepared as homework, and returns the class to a consideration of Wilson's <cite>Two Trains Running</cite>.<p>	Continuing to give attention to process and content, Mrs. Stenger talks with the students about the difference between <cite>debate </cite>and <cite>dialogue</cite>. She suggests that debate is intended to "solidify your position," while dialogue is a sharing and exploration of ideas. <p>	Mrs. Stenger returns to the original comments the students had written about the alternatives set forth by Wilson, and draws their conversation to a close:<p><blockquote>As of 1969, the author sees two choices. All of the discussion today is connected by what Wilson said that relates to your lives. August Wilson believes that individual lives are affected by the forces of history. What historical event do you think has had an impact on your lives and your family? <cite>Write it down; don't tell me!</cite></blockquote>	The bell rings and, predictably, Mark says, "Saved by the bell."<p>	Mrs. Stenger responds quickly, "You are <cite>not </cite>saved!"<p>	The students remain and finish the assignment, then take their break. The two-hour block enables the teacher to keep the students on task. 	Interestingly, as we left the class, we realized that it was a multi-age (ninth- through twelfth-grade) class. There had been no obvious differences in contributions from students of different ages. The core of the class was built on the content of a thought-provoking play that related directly to the lives of the students and served as a base for thoughtful writing.<p><b>English.</b> In another of Mrs. Stenger's classes, three groups of six students surround young playwrights/actors from the community. The students had written their own setting and opening dialogue for a play. <p>	In one group, the students take turns reading the first page of their plays. Then the playwright reads aloud from the beginning of several plays. He asks, "How does the scene evoke the mood?"<p>	Students talk about how the mood might be different if the scene were a country road, surrounded by dark trees, instead of the familiar urban neighborhood. Continuing his conversation with the students, the playwright explains how dialogue can reveal relationships between characters, and discusses, with the students, how exotic materials should be. He tells the students, "The theater shows what's special about the everyday."<p>	In another group, the students act out the scene one of them had written. The playwright working with them talks them through an analysis of what they have just acted.<p>	These students prepared carefully for these discussions. Each brought to class several pages of manuscript--most were neatly word-processed. The students in this class know they will be expected to meet high expectations. Such is the case. Talking about Mrs. Stenger's class, one says,<p><blockquote>I've been in her class for two years, and I be striving to get an A and I never get an A. She don't give out grades. You got to earn the grade you get. So if you ask, "Why did I get such and such?" it's because of how you did on your work.</blockquote><b>English.</b> A banner in Earl Miller's classroom displays statements related to the year's essential question for the charter: "What is community? What is good about our community?" <p>	This is another two-period class with twenty-eight of thirty-three enrolled students present. The day's agenda is on the chalkboard next to a complex diagram regarding student grading. For their first task, the students work in small groups, writing summaries of a scene for an author's talk show. As they write, Mr. Miller squats in front of desks, reading rough drafts, and smiling, asking questions, and making comments, such as, "Keep pushing this. You're doing a fine job. It's a great question. I want that answer."<p>	As the writing continues, he is interrupted by five phone calls. Some of the students become disengaged, one files her nails, several do nothing, and a boy taunts a girl about her mustache. Other students, however, continue on task. In one group, three girls take turns reading their scene aloud. In another, a girl checks the summary she had written and asks the rest of the group if they agree with her interpretation.<p>	After warning the students that they have five minutes to finish up their work, Mr. Miller calls on the groups to share their scenes. The first group does so animatedly. The second talks about the substance of their reading. <p>	Mr. Miller then shifts the class to the second task. He tells the students how they can estimate their grades by combining results from classwork/homework, attendance, tests/quizzes, and writing projects. He stresses the way process and product are both considered in grading. The students give him their complete attention. Like the students in Mrs. Stenger's class, they know this teacher has high expectations of them.<p>	<b>Physics.</b> Students explain "concept maps" and begin to create hypotheses about motion. In an unusual move, Mr. Bishop has students write out their preconceptions and explain these views to their peers. The students take their tasks seriously. At one point in the class, Mike is explaining a concept map prepared by his group. Hank criticizes the lack of detail in the presentation, as well as Mike's reading behavior, and makes a few more negative remarks. Shanda, a girl in Mike's group, explodes, interrupting Hank: "Not all people learn as fast as you do, and we did not have enough information to cover all the things you are talking about."<p>	This reaction provokes a discussion which Mr. Bishop enters, and eventually the group reaches an accord that lets them go on with the processes in the class. Mr. Bishop concludes by reminding them, as had Mrs. Stenger, about the qualities of dialogue, as opposed to confrontation. Attention to essential elements of building and maintaining a community carries over from one class to another. <p>	Mr. Bishop closes the class by commending the students for their "good work, good questions" and stressing that they are just starting their work on motion. The students turn in their concept maps and are reminded that when they come to class next, in two days, they are to bring a one-page, written description of the day's lesson.<p>	<b>Social Studies.</b> The chalkboard in Ms. Johnson's class is full of thought-provoking ideas about the status of women in Egypt and the ancient East. Taking turns reading paragraphs aloud, the students discuss a dittoed handout on Cleopatra. As the reading progresses, the students listen attentively, then begin to ask questions. Ms. Johnson answers some of them and then asks, "What do you think about Cleopatra?"<p>	The students mention how weird it was that she married her brother and ask if that wouldn't cause problems with the children. They engage in an animated conversation about the implications of such a marriage. <p>	The discussion is cut off by the entry of the Chapter I reading specialist, who passes out another ditto sheet that requires the students to arrange some of the major events in Cleopatra's life in chronological order. Students work on this activity quietly for ten minutes, and then, without any discussion of the events, exchange and correct papers.<p>	The class concludes with Ms. Johnson telling them to collect their homework sheets before they leave.<p><h4>Uneven Instruction in the Charters</h4>Some of the other classes we visited in Overland and in other charters were promising; some were disasters. <p>	Students offered us testimonials for a number of their teachers in the Overland Charter. One student said that the previous year she had got an F in Spanish from a teacher at another school. This year, she said, her Overland teacher breaks things down so she can learn it. She added,<p><blockquote>He makes it fun, and you learn at the same time. He'll talk to you in Spanish. Everybody says, "What?" then he'll say it over again. Then when you hear him say it, you know what he is talking about. When we get loud, he asks us to quiet down. Everybody quiets down, even though that class is a big class.</blockquote>	Another student chimed in, "He can leave us in there by ourselves and we finish our work. Nobody acts up. "<p>	Donna, the principal, described the unevenness of instruction to us when we talked with her. <p><blockquote>I observed an excellent class last Friday. First of all, I walked in, and of the twenty-four students seated there, twenty-three were male and one was a female. I asked myself, "What is this?" Then it dawned on me: it was a class in the Auto Academy. </blockquote><blockquote>The teacher had this great lesson with this classroom full of guys. I looked around and said to myself, "The media won't show this picture of African-American males sitting in a classroom <cite>really </cite>engaged in a teacher's lesson." But that's what was really going on there. He had great rapport with his students. They were about to go into an anthology of African-American writers. I looked through it. It was this nice, brand-new book with all these great authors listed. I thought, "Wow! What I could do with this book!"</blockquote><blockquote>And then I went on and visited the Communications Charter, where their whole theme was puppetry, and the kids were writing scripts for a puppet show. Then I went to Overland and the kids were writing scripts with a local playwright helping them. And I said, "This is great stuff! This is excellent, excellent teaching." And I went into one math class that was good. So that's what excites me.</blockquote><blockquote>And it also is what leads to my total depression when I go into classrooms where there is <cite>nothing </cite>happening. And you wonder how, in this same building, you have such extremes. And it's sad to say, where there's not a whole lot happening, many times, it's in a class where the person is not in a charter.</blockquote>	The unevenness of instruction which the principal observed between charter and non-charter classes may be due to one or more causes. Teachers who work together in charters tend to develop agreement regarding standards of instruction and to uphold their commitments to each other. Also, the process of organizing charters--beginning with volunteers and continuing until the only teachers who do not join these small units are the resisters to change--may have an effect within the school similar to the effect of creating magnet schools in the district in the comprehensive high schools. That is, the people "left over," like the leftover schools, may be those most in need of support and least apt to succeed without substantial assistance. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sq:i"><table border><tr><td><h3>Suggested Questions:Instruction</h3><ol><li> What is your impression of the preceding classroom vignettes?<p><li> What incidents from the preceding glimpses of instruction in the charters reflect signs that instruction is personalized?<p><li> What are some examples of students using their minds well?<p><li> What examples are there of students being held to high expectations?<p><li> What seems to be possible in small teaching and learning communities that is harder to accomplish in large "shopping mall" high schools?<p><li> What questions would you want to ask the teachers and students in these classes in order to better understand what is happening?<p></ol></td></table><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="catc"><h3>Conflicts Among the Charters </h3>Just as charters appear to be providing settings for more personal attention to students and for improved instruction, they are a continuing source of conflict within the entire school. <p>	In the fall, conflict between teachers took various forms. Some teachers refused to talk with us because they perceived us to be aligned with one of the charters, and thus against them. Students testified about the continuing differences among groups of students in different charters. As noted previously, administrators concerned about the conflict felt it necessary to generate cross-charter meetings to build a school spirit. The creation of charters to improve interpersonal relations seemed to be contributing to conflict.<p>	Not only were there examples of interpersonal conflict at Marshall when we visited in the fall, there were signs that this conflict masked a failure to develop a school which was sufficiently different to enable it to be a healthy host for a collection of charters. In the fall, the school was mostly charterized; most students were assigned to charters rather than remaining in an "unaffiliated" status. <p>	Still, no real changes had been made in the organizational structure of the campus, in order to accommodate this significant change in the way students were assigned for instruction. Teachers were still organized in schoolwide departments; students were in schoolwide classes. Administrators' responsibilities cut across the entire school. One rostering office was supposed to support the whole school (although some of the charters, out of frustration, assumed more of this responsibility).<p>	Many teachers were assigned to more than one charter. Even though Overland has a distinct location for much of its instruction, classroom areas for other charters were spread throughout the building.<p>	Thus we found Marshall in the fall of 1993--still in chaos, and still exhibiting evidence that students can learn to use their minds well, no matter the extent of the violence and confusion which persist in the world around them.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="s1994"><hr><center><h2>Events at Marshall: Spring 1994</h2></center><hr>In the spring of 1994 we returned to Marshall for a short visit to look again at some of the issues raised by our visit the previous fall. We also met with representatives from Marshall and other schools in Jefferson to help us understand the progress being made in the overall reform efforts in the city.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="til"><h3>Transition in Leadership </h3>During our visit in May of 1994, the principal was doing the same thing her predecessor had been doing when we visited the previous spring: making a list of schools she would consider applying to. In our conversation, she pointed out, <p><blockquote>[All my hopes for the school were] predicated on me being here next year. As we speak, nine people from the school who are on my selection committee are downtown getting instructions in "how to interview for your new principal," because this is an acting position and everyone knew that it was an acting year....</blockquote><blockquote>During the interview what I am going to stress is that this has been an exploratory year for me. Next year there's some real changes that have to occur. There will probably be a very different kind of me.</blockquote>	The projection that the Marshall faculty would see a very different "me" if she were selected as the permanent principal reflected, in part, Donna's concerns that she had not been able to place as much emphasis on instruction as she would have liked. Speaking of what she had learned from the year, she observed,<p><blockquote>An experience I will take into next year from this year is how to better work in instruction, because so much of my time this year has been just the cultural shock of realizing how much student social issues take away from instruction. So it's only been by past reputation and basic faith in people that I've been assuming that the instructional program is OK and that teachers are doing what they're supposed to be doing. And, for the most part, that's probably true. But, next year I really need to pay more attention to what is really happening instructionally at Marshall.</blockquote>	She explained that she needed to pay more attention to instruction so she can respond more knowledgeably to questions and criticisms from parents. She also said she wanted to find out, from among teachers, "Who has high expectations, who doesn't. And, those people who don't, can we kind of, 'up' their expectations a little bit?"<p>	Looking back on the year, she concluded, "Ah, but the social situation and the climate of student violence have really taken a lot of my attention away from instruction this year into really trying to maintain a safe environment."<p>	By June, Donna had learned that she would be continuing at Marshall for the next year, a situation which would lend some continuity to the office. However, she learned of her appointment on the same day the local paper reported that the board had selected a new superintendent for Jefferson. People familiar with urban systems are aware of how such appointments tend to produce more changes in staffing, and therefore, it may be premature to assume that there will not be more changes before 1994-95 is over. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="toio"><h3>The Ongoing Issue of Violence</h3>Several people confirmed the report by the principal that violence continued to be a problem throughout the year. There were two developments in regard to student behavior which seem worthy of particular attention. <p><ol>	<li>The assistant principal who had tried to use cross-charter, schoolwide assemblies as a vehicle to deal with violence in the fall was now focusing on peer mediation. <p>	<li> Student behavior within Overland was different from that reported by other charters in the school. <p></ol><h4>Dealing with Students' Behavior</h4>Assistant Principal Pat Holmes told us that the peer mediation program was one way to prevent violence. During the year, there were two training sessions which developed skills in one parent, six teachers, and twelve students. Emphasizing that the programs were designed to encourage students to talk about their problems instead of fighting, Pat told us,<p><blockquote>Most of the fights are one-on-one and sporadic, impulsive. Lots of time things are brewing beforehand. We encourage teachers, when they hear something, to fill out a form [for peer mediation]. The problem is, there is nothing in the budget to compensate teachers to be assigned to the mediation center and to be present at a mediation.</blockquote>	Pat did not suggest other approaches to dealing with violence, and he did not link the mediation approach to charters in which students are better known by their teachers and by one another. <p>	For the principal, a part of the problem of dealing with student behavior was a lack of resources for sufficient security staff (NTAs). She worried that students roamed the hallways and that some "kids can run real fast." One of the problems created by the hall walkers, as a teacher had told us in the fall and Donna told us in the spring, is that "they do nasty things like kick teacher's doors, or just open the door and yell some profanity into the room."<p>	Finally, she was frustrated that when someone from the school caught the students, the most that could be done was to give a three- to five-day suspension. Unlike the assistant principal, Donna connected the development of charters with a possible solution to such disruptive behavior:<p><blockquote>What I'm finding is that teachers in charters are willing to protect their areas, but they really feel as though their hands are tied when students who are not in their charters are in their area creating havoc. Therefore, one of the things I'm doing now is looking at rooms for next year. I'm making sure that all charters are together, so that students do not have to travel a whole lot outside of their own areas.  </blockquote><h4>Behavior in the Overland Charter</h4>Such an approach seems supported by the reports given by the teachers in the Overland Charter, which is mostly housed together, in comparison to those given by people from other, less closely connected charters. Overland teachers still worried about student behavior in the school, observing that when other kids roamed their halls, the behavior of the Overland kids is adversely affected. Still, one of the Overland leaders stressed that this year, especially the last half, was markedly more safe than the previous year. Generally, Overland teachers suggested, there was a trend away from disruptive student behavior, toward constructive learning activity. Some Overland teachers took heart in the progress they saw their ninth-graders making--progress toward becoming active learners instead of "bumps on a log." Others spoke with enthusiasm about student progress in their particular courses or in public performances that revealed the progress they were making. <p>	As he described his experiences as a peer counselor, an Overland student, Rod Jones, provided us with a student's perspective on the changes that were occurring in school climate: <p><blockquote>There are a couple of girls I call my "little sisters" now. They always come up and give me a hug and let me know how they are doing in the morning and what classes they got. It is good it turned out that way because I didn't have that in the ninth grade for me. I was on my own, because my mom had just died that year. Before I went into high school from eighth grade, she died. I went to a magnet school, but I spent the whole year there and in July, they sent me a letter saying, "We feel as though your academics has <cite>[sic] </cite>dropped; we want you to go to your neighborhood school." I came to Marshall and was in "non-affiliated" at first. </blockquote>	As an unaffiliated student, Rod said he had little help as a tenth-grader at Marshall. Rod said that at the end of that year, however,<p><blockquote>I talked to the counselor, Mr. Jordan; he's the Overland counselor. He talked to me. I saw all the selections. I didn't want auto shop and all that, you know, and wood shop. I read Overland and they were telling me, "College preparation."</blockquote>	For Rod, who was now assisting the ninth-graders to become more productive citizens, the choice of Overland had allowed him to continue work begun in a Coalition-affiliated middle school that also focused on student projects and group work, which he finds to be fun and challenging. It had also helped him, he said, to <p>look towards college, instead of just going to class, like, with the regular students who just go to class and the teacher'll give them a piece of paper, and, you know, the same old everyday. You get a book, textbook, and read to yourself. </blockquote>	For Rod and for other students from Overland with whom we spoke, the changed behaviors and the changed performance in classes were definitely linked. <p><h4>Schoolwide Reflections on Violence</h4>While emphasizing the importance of knowing students, a teacher from another charter addressed her response to safety problems in the school:<p><blockquote>Violence is certainly a significant issue in this school and across the city. Tension is emerging, especially since it has gotten warmer. There are things that go on that in past years I would have confronted. Now I walk away from them because I don't want to be hurt. In this particular society, they want to hurt anyone. I don't want to get hurt.</blockquote>	Another non-Overland teacher told us that there were many significant issues for her, but the biggest concern was violence. She described the extent of the violence:<p><blockquote>It's happening all over the city. Not just at Marshall; things are happening all over. It's a free-for-all--a spontaneous chain reaction--five or six fights, different skirmishes. Like you might see in a coliseum somewhere. We're understaffed and under-policed. It's gotten worse. It's a national thing with kids in the Midwest and kids doing things in places we didn't hear about.</blockquote>	In short, while some Overland teachers saw hope, others in the school saw the school as a place where violence is growing and as a place that is a victim of external forces over which they have no control. While many Overland teachers and teachers from other charters, charter-based students, and the principal saw promise of better learning conditions in the increasing personalization of charters, others saw only increased police and security forces as a solution to the problems. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sq:cis"><table border><tr><td><h3>Suggested Questions:Changes in Spring 1994</h3><ol><li> (For the teachers from Marshall:) What was the actual change from fall to spring in student behavior?

We want a charter around the arts. There are statistics that prove that charters are good for schools and good for students. The Collaborative did the research.7</blockquote>	Jealousy and competition among the charters persist, however. For a consultant who works with the school, the problem is framed as one of "finding unity in a school of many parts; finding common vision in a school of many parts."<p>	What the consultant and many of the people at Marshall seem unable to do is conceive of finding strength in a campus with many semi-autonomous schools. By seeking unity, many are looking for a continuation of school as it has been known, rather than the creation of a new, pluralistic setting. In a sense, the struggle for continuation of a single school mirrors the struggle in the greater community between forces that seek a single culture and those that envision multiple perspectives making a stronger national fabric--the difference between the melting pot and the fruit bowl as metaphors for  viewing our multiethnic society. <p>	Whatever metaphor is used, community requires understanding among the participants. Effective work at Marshall hinges on teachers knowing the students well and on knowing--understanding--each other well enough to plan together. As it is, either faculty do not know each other well enough to develop a common vision, or the absence of a common vision keeps them from knowing each other.<p>	Within charters, one of the big tasks is maintaining the momentum established when the charter is formed. Overland's continuing faculty assign themselves as mentors to the new teachers and thus keep the focus on the ideas which are driving the change. Given the large turnover in the school system between 1992-93 and 1993-94, this support of newcomers has been a major, but constructive, task for Overland's faculty. As one mentor told us,<p><blockquote>I mentor the new teachers, Martha, Alina, and Harold, and I see a lot of good, because not only do I talk about, you know, the nitty-gritty of survival, but also we talk about the Principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="iitc"><h3>Instruction in the Charters</h3>For some teachers in the charters, professional development exists only in the form of expert-led workshops and seminars. For other charter teachers, it has taken the much richer form of ongoing dialogue concerning how to improve student learning. <p><h4>Classroom Close-ups </h4>At Marshall there is continuing evidence of excellent instruction within the charters. In the spring, we witnessed the benefits of the continuing conversations among members of the Overland Charter, as a member of the group, who joined recently, tested a teaching technique that was new to her.<p><b>World History.</b> Martha Hardy was helping students prepare to teach a class on a variety of topics which were listed on the chalkboard:<p><ol><li>The Qin and Han dynasties in China<li>Life in America before the coming of the Europeans<li>Community<li>The Greek city<li>West African kingdoms<li>Central African countries</ol>	Ms. Hardy helped the students think about how to pace their lessons, how to take into account items such as reading announcements at the start of the period and developing a clear objective for the class. The students will be teaching before this class, or, if time becomes a problem, before another teacher. As the planning for the sessions continue, students and teacher explore some of the questions: Who will correct quizzes? Will they count on the students' grades? Where can the students find the information they will need as the basis for their class?<p><b>English.</b> In this class, we find a more sophisticated and complex version of the same approach being used in Earl Miller's classes that have been studying novels. On the chalkboard we see the assignment:<p><blockquote>Common Group Project Part II<p>1. Task: Teach your novel to the class in an interesting, interactive way. Each lesson must: <ul><li>explain the plot<li>discuss the issues and meaning of the book<li>have a part that gets everyone in the class involved<li>focus on an excerpt of the book<li>have a collectible writing activity<li>fill 30 minutes (up to 45)</ul></blockquote>	Five students in one group are "teaching" <cite>Lord of the Flies</cite>. Amy begins with a summary of the plot. She uses a large chart which the group has prepared and taped on the board. The chart includes black circles depicting the various deaths in the book and green lines showing relationships among the characters. <p>	Following Amy's narration, Roberta, another group member, shows a video of several sections of the story, to help explain the characters. Just as they had listened attentively to the narration of the plot, the class pays close attention as she plays the video segments. As the mournful sound made by blowing on the conch shell is heard, she explains, "That's the conch. That's Ralph. Whoever holds the conch gets to speak. That's Jack with no shirt on. Ralph sets the rules."<p> 	After the second video episode and a brief student comment about it, a third student informs the class, "Now we're going to do journals. Your choice is written on the board." <p>	On the board he has listed,<p><ol><li> How does this book describe community? [Community is the Overland theme for the year.]<li> If you were chosen to play the part of Ralph or Jack, who would you be and why?</ol>	Jeff tells the class he believes that the second question is much more interesting, then opens the floor for discussion. Students begin to talk about whether they would choose the first or the second topic. One student comments, "I thought this was a community. They came to an island and formed a community."<p>	One of the presenters responds, "After what you saw, is this what you would call a protective community?"<p>	Pointing to the book, another student says, "That's a community right there! People have different views within a community."<p>	As is too often the case in conventionally scheduled school settings, the bell rings at this point in the conversation between the student "teachers" and the people who are beginning to inquire into lessons about community which could be gleaned from the novel.<p><h4>An Overview of the Overland Charter</h4>The rich instructional repertoire of Overland teachers was displayed during our brief spring visit. We learned how Michelle, the physical education and dance teacher, had received compliments from a state department of education official for the way in which her program integrated the arts with academic subjects. Like other performance teachers, she gets good mileage from the motivation her students develop from preparing for various public exhibitions of their progress. She told us about her students' performances with professional entertainers and about an upcoming show for health and physical education teachers from several states. The previous evening they had performed tap and jazz numbers at a dance festival held at another city high school. <p>	Mrs. Stenger's playwrights were the subject of a local newspaper article because of their ongoing, joint project with a suburban high school. The collaborative program represents another example of Mrs. Stenger's varied approach to instruction. The discussion about the article began with Mrs. Stenger's asking, "So how do you feel about the title: 'Divided in Life, United in Art'?"<p>	As is often the case in her classes, the students moved into a thoughtful conversation. This time the conversation was about the differences between the two communities and between the approach the Marshall students took to their plays and the approach taken by the suburban students. The Marshall students tended to see their work as more about "real life," and the works of the suburbanites as more about "fantasy" things. Marshall plays were about violence, life in the streets, child abuse--things they considered to be real. The suburban students wrote about Santa Claus and "thinking through watching a smoke ring."<p><h4>Conversations About Senior Projects</h4>We gained more understanding of the instruction in Overland as we talked with students about the senior projects they were being helped to prepare. In addition to our observations of the teaching techniques we witnessed in our visits, these conversations helped us learn how the Overland teachers mentor their students.8<p>	Sam Smith, one of those seniors, told us that most of the charters in the school have senior projects, but that he thinks Overland's are particularly demanding. He reported that they had to address three topics: how to revitalize the community, how to revitalize or make something in your community, and how to create a new community. He talked enthusiastically about his own project, which he said would cost $65,000, half of which would be matched by Overland: <p><blockquote>I'm revitalizing a house on my block. It's next door to me. What I'm doing is using the first floor. I want to buy the house and rehabilitate it, you know, 'cause the copper was stripped off the front. The people, the drug addicts, tore it and sold the copper. And, it's nothing but just the wood, you know. It's boarded up now, but I want to buy it and then rehabilitate it. The first floor will be used. I'll have a deacon come in, on Fridays, every Friday. He'll speak to, like, drug and alcohol addicts and try to help them with their problems. </blockquote><blockquote>The second floor will be used for only teenagers. I have a mentor in real life, and he's going to come in and he's going to talk about STDs and AIDS and HIV with all the teenagers of the neighborhood. </blockquote><blockquote>We're going to have brochures to pass out, and they'll be able to discuss pregnancies, so you don't have to go to school to learn about health and all that.</blockquote><blockquote>And the third floor is going to be for little children of the neighborhood. You know, so they can have a safe place to play video games and ping pong.</blockquote>	As Sam confidently laid out his plans, our interviewer had to interject, "Is this for real?"<p>	Sam admitted,<p><blockquote>No. This is like on paper. But, like, people actually call, say if I was to call you and tell you about the project like I just did, you'd say, "Well, I can give you maybe a thousand dollars." I have to cover the eight different questions we were asked, including a description of the community, the area we want to revitalize, the budget, how we will manage the project, etc. </blockquote>	Sam said he was surprised at the community response to his project:<p><blockquote>When I surveyed people and told them what it was about, they actually thought I was doing it for real. And it really made them jump to it. 'Cause, you know, there's a lot of people on the corners who respect me from when I was a kid, and my dad and I talked to them. I told my school mentor I would like to do it someday--actually buy the house and rehabilitate it.</blockquote>	Sam explained how his science teacher worked with him as a mentor to prepare the various phases of his project. He patiently told us of the difference between his mentor from a local business, who helped him in "real life," and the work of the physics teacher, who helped him get ready for his year-end presentation before a parent, an eleventh-grader, and two Overland teachers: "We all, all the seniors, have a mentor that's in Overland to help us with the project as we go along--to tell us what's right and what's wrong and how it's going."<p>	From this activity, which he needs to complete satisfactorily (he told us it would count for 20 percent of his final term grade), Sam said he had learned, "Never stop short. Don't think that you can't accomplish something. Don't ever be lazy."<p>	And, thus, Sam, an early push-out from a district magnet program, told how this project and the other Overland activities had helped so that he is ready to attend a nearby state college where he will major in sports medicine. He told us, "I'm excited. I'm the first one in my family to go straight on to college from high school."<p>	Terry said his senior project, a grant proposal for a community center for teenagers, was the most significant part of his high school education. 	Another senior, Shawna, a young woman who had moved from Miami to Jefferson while in high school, shared her excitement about her senior project with us. Speaking of her grant proposal, she said, "[It has] taught me a lot and is preparing me more." She gave us a specific example of how work in the Overland Charter had been helpful to her:<p><blockquote>I've learned to write a monologue. We describe a person in our community, in school, the neighborhood, or work. We had to write a monologue using things she would have said. I interviewed Ms. Kornish. I had to stand in front of the class and dress like her. She's always saying, "Keep your legs closed." </blockquote><blockquote>I did a monologue on teen pregnancy. I was in a conference room with a podium, looking like Ms. Kornish, how she wore her hair. I had to use my mind to become the person. You had to put more into it. You have to get the information and go into them. You have to use your brain.</blockquote>	Other students shared their experiences of using their minds well at Marshall. They gave examples such as participating in a classroom performance of <cite>Harlem Renaissance</cite>, graphing equations in algebra, and learning in other classes that the whole group has to succeed for one person to feel success. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="qdos"><h3>Quantitative Data on Student Success and Failure</h3>Even with all these signs of student progress and evidence of creative teaching, in the spring the adults at Marshall focused on their frustrations with the ebbing support and continuing interference from external agencies. Also, in spite of the attention to reform we observed during our visits, student performance indicators for the school continued to be low. Consider, for example, some of the data (see tables on page 22) recorded on a schoolwide and charter basis.9<p>	The information in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> needs to be examined carefully. It does not reveal a full-year pattern; by the third marking period, many of the students who began the year were gone. Because of the rapid decline in enrollment by grade, totals can also be misleading. Not reported in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> are attendance figures which are closely related to course passage. Moreover, schoolwide information masks the success or lack of success of charters within the school. <p>	<a href="#table2">Table 2</a> reports progress for students in charters during the same time period. It also includes a comparison of charter and non-charter student attendance. Where charters outperform the group of students as a whole, a "+" has been inserted.<p>	In every instance of comparison of the results reported in the two tables, charter students outperformed non-charter students. However, before charter teachers begin to celebrate too loudly, there are some concerns that must be recognized. Overall performance is very low. For example, it is not much to say that charters do slightly better than non-charters, when half the students in the ninth grade fail English or when 35 percent of the ninth-graders are usually absent. Also, while 20.8 percent of Marshall's students are enrolled in special education, only 16.2 percent of the charter students are in special education. The higher percentage of special education students may, by itself, be enough to account for the difference. Nevertheless, the data are so persistently more positive for charters in their direction and so in keeping with findings in all schools in the district, that one has to conclude that there is some positive effect of the charters.<p>	It is also worth noting that more than one-fourth of the Marshall students are still not in charters, even though people at the school tend to speak of their school as "fully charterized." <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sqas"><table border><tr><td><h3>Suggested Questions aboutSpring 1993 and Fall 1994</h3><ol><li> Considering the examples in both the spring and fall, what are the different teaching techniques displayed with some success by Marshall teachers?<p><li> How can dialogue among faculty within Charters and use of student Exhibitions help improve instruction?<p><li> What examples are there of the use of essential questions and common themes to guide instruction?

Their heroes are gone, and they are left at the mercy of the evil forces.<p>	One of the teachers at Marshall told us about the myth of the school.10 This myth is built around an early principal who went on to become a superintendent of considerable national prominence in another city--a superintendent killed in racial conflict. During the reign of this principal, Marshall had flourished; then, during the term of Iris, his successor, Marshall had fallen into disfavor and appeared to be on the closure list. Another teacher described the time following the leaving of this principal:<p><blockquote>We have a time when, systematically, things were cut from the school: Cut a music teacher. Cut a language teacher. Cut this. Cut that. Cut the art department. Cut this. Cut that. </blockquote><blockquote>The principal [Iris] retired and Andy Washington was appointed to replace her.</blockquote><blockquote>Washington comes in and there's this moment of change and rebirth. OK? The place gets painted. It gets new windows. Suddenly we don't think we're teaching in a place that is going to be closed. <cite>I mean it was even, we were wondering, are they cutting us to the point where we're not going to exist anymore.?</cite></blockquote><blockquote>Washington comes in; we are an intensive school site for the MSRC restructuring work. We start this restructuring effort. But it was a battle and a push. We had this moment where we create this <cite>energy in </cite>Overland, the second year of the program in particular. This <cite>absolute </cite>energy. We're noticed by national television. We're written up in the local paper. The kids are doing senior projects. We're taking this to <cite>[pause] </cite>the ends of where we can take it.</blockquote>	Then the principal, Washington, left on a career-ending sabbatical. The discontinuity of the myth began again with the appointment of the first of two acting principals. The external support mechanisms which Washington seemed so adept at accessing turned sour. <p>	Teachers told us that the money which had been coming from the MSRC and the district to help reform is being taken away. Actually, the district provided less per charter during 1993-94 than they had committed to the funding foundation to provide. They took an amount which had been provided for leadership for existing charters and spread it over the greatly expanded number of charters that existed by the end of 1993-94. Perhaps most frustrating for the charter leaders at Marshall, other school-within-a-school programs in the district, such as career-oriented academies and motivation programs that pre-dated the work of the MSRC, continue to receive added district funding support beyond that given to the "home-grown" charters.<p>	Teachers and administrators also expressed their frustration over being required to produce eighty-page school plans for the district, which they doubt anyone will use productively. School staff complained that the union claims that seniority cannot be tampered with to allow flexibility in charter staffing, yet they can remember earlier years when seniority rules were changed in the district. Marshall leaders suggest that trying to institutionalize charters into a sick system will not produce sound reform. They (the evil forces in the continuing legend) will somehow prevent new progress. <p>	A comment by one teacher reveals the depths of Marshall staff members' frustration: <p><blockquote>We <cite>believed </cite>that we could be full professionals. We're, like, nobody knows what to do with us. <cite>We're like monsters that were created. We are empowered, knowledgeable, classroom teachers . </cite></blockquote><blockquote>[A central office administrator] will not talk with us. She will not talk to a teacher. I can't call her up and have a conversation with her...That was not true of the earlier people--that is part of the shift. We <cite>believed </cite>this. We went for the education. We took courses at the university. We took courses from the collaborative. We got involved with the Coalition. We took courses from Re:Learning. I mean, we have become more knowledgeable and we're here. </blockquote><blockquote>Now what? There's no place. Our voices are being shut out from all. There's no Governing Council, so there's no place to share this with our colleagues. We have a lot of knowledge about what works in integrating curriculum across the disciplines. We have a lot of knowledge about arranging the school day. We have knowledge about planning backwards.11 We know the ins and outs of the system and the contract. We have knowledge about outcome-based education. <cite>We've been living this! </cite></blockquote>	Make no mistake. Teachers at Marshall emphasize that if it comes down to having to choose between their union and the board, they will support their union. However, they are frustrated by what they see as their union's role in closing them out of a chance to use what they have learned. They feel abandoned by a district that encouraged them, and by leaders from the MSRC who pushed them to take risks. They object to rules that seem to say their charters have to have 396 students--no more, no less.<p>	The teachers see the move by the district toward standardization and control as just what it is: a perversion of the earlier ground-up, passionately felt commitment to new communities exhibiting caring for students and giving attention to the development of students' intellect. They know that the process of generating charters is necessarily painful and chaotic, if diverse groups of teachers are going to build a mutual understanding of the programs required for their students. They worry that school- or district-mandated charter structures created without sufficient teacher input in their conception and planning will fail and will pull down their own early efforts as well. <p>	Marshall educators even feel betrayed by the foundation that paid for the reform effort, but, they believe, that also agreed with their union and the district that none of the Marshall teacher group could be included on the continuing governing board of the MSRC. During the fall, several of these teachers met with the foundation leadership and were encouraged to speak out concerning their objections to union and district positions on charters. In midyear, as the foundation sought to work with district, MSRC, and union officials to calm the conflict among them, these foundation leaders failed to object when the district and union agreed to exclude references to charters in district work plans and to keep members of the Overland Charter out of the MSRC's ongoing advisory structures. <p>	The bargaining agreement reached between the district and the union in August 1994 seems to have restored <cite>charters </cite>as a term that can be mentioned. The agreement also seems to have addressed, at least slightly, some of the concerns about seniority and personnel transfers. However, the damage done during the year will be hard to erase.<p>	The court-appointed panel pursued recommendations for improving the Jefferson district during the spring of 1994, but, Marshall staff asked us,<p><blockquote>Where are all the charters in this? We haven't been invited to participate in those discussions! There's this whole big thing going on now from the court. And, here we are now. We've been laboring for the past five years to improve instruction, and we're not part of these conversations.</blockquote>	Later they told us that one panel member had talked with several leaders of the Overland Charter, but they still wondered if there should not be more awareness by this powerful panel of the six-year reform effort in the comprehensive high schools.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wp"><h3>Why Persist?</h3>For many at Marshall, their myth has broken down again. The external agencies are no longer providing the encouragement and support that allowed them to advance. New heroes have not emerged to help them regain their initiative. The "community" mentioned in the essential question in the Overland Charter eludes them and the school as a whole. <p>	But the faculty and administration at Marshall continue the battle. Why?<p>	One teacher told us that, for her, "school is about enhancing children's lives and not our lives." Her comment leaves us to ponder why a trade-off--rather than the possibility that both teachers' and students' lives could be enriched--has to be considered.<p>	Another teacher explained that he stays with teaching at Marshall because his teaching changes kids' lives and opens up more options for their future. He said,<p><blockquote>I know it works. I've seen it work. I've seen it have a profound effect on a large number of students. My teaching, the program, it works. It changes lives of students; it gives them other options. It helps them see larger pictures, gives them skills, and keeps kids in school who wouldn't have stayed. It makes socially unfit kids more socially fit; it can do remarkable things.</blockquote>	It is for the opportunity to do more of <cite>these remarkable things </cite>that the teachers and administrators continue to seek progress in the midst of the chaos within and around their school. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sq:ds"><table border><tr><td><h3>Suggested Questions:District Support</h3><ol><li> What are the essential elements of support that a school such as Marshall seems to need from without?<p><li> What are the supporting actions that teachers at a school such as Marshall seem to need from within?

The hallways near the entrance are light and airy, and they are decorated with hanging plants and students' work. The back hallways are darker, more like their counterparts in other urban schools. In some ways, the school is reminiscent of a pair of men's shoes with glossy toes, scuffed sides, and run-down heels. <p>	While the school building offers contradictory images, the conditions under which the students live is evident from the beginning. One student told us, "I feel safe here; it's just when I go outside that I'm afraid."<p>	Speaking of the students' poverty, one administrator at the school said, <p><blockquote>Families take turns sending kids to school because they can't afford the tokens. We feed everybody in the world. We are part of the universal feeding program; the entire school gets free breakfast and lunch. The first seating is 7:20 and the second is 8:10.</blockquote> <p>	This was our first visit to Forest Park High School, a comprehensive high school for approximately one thousand ninth- through twelfth-graders in the large, eastern city of Jefferson. A middle school in the same building, under the leadership of the same principal, serves students in grades six through eight. The regional superintendent is also housed here.<p>	Adjacent to the school, under separate administration, an elementary school completes this urban equivalent of the village school complex that dominated rural America in the first half of this century. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fts"><h3>Focusing the Snapshot</h3>During our visit in November 1992, two researchers spent two intensive days observing in classrooms and interviewing teachers, students, administrators, and parents in order to produce a "snapshot" of life at Forest Park High School. The snapshot is also based on information gained from additional observations and interviews by the author, who made two visits to the school, as well as numerous visits to other sites within the school district beginning in the 1988-89 school year through the 1992-93 school year. <p>	As a snapshot, it does not seek to provide a comprehensive picture of the complexities of the school over time. It attempts to chronicle life at Forest Park in order to understand school change more fully and, simultaneously, to provide a mirror to the people of the school community, which they can use to help them in their efforts to better serve the young men and women who attend their school. It is an attempt to describe the school as a whole--its shine and its scuff marks. <p>	It is also an attempt which we acknowledge from the outset is flawed by the limited information we have and the differences between the daily lives of the people of Forest Park and those of us who produced this snapshot. As we strive to understand the school, we acknowledge the social, racial, and experiential differences of the world we come from which inevitably distort our view.<p>	The snapshot begins with a description of the context in which Forest Park functions. In particular, this section describes the district-wide and school-based restructuring initiatives affecting Forest Park and their direct impact on the school. The second part focuses on instruction at Forest Park by presenting "close-ups" of several classrooms we observed. The snapshot concludes with reflections and questions for the future regarding the issues raised by the snapshot as a whole.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="riaf"><hr><center><h2>Restructuring Initiatives at Forest Park</h2></center><hr>Forest Park was identified four years ago as one of the schools to receive intensive attention by the foundation-funded Metropolitan School Restructuring Collaborative (MSRC). Understanding the school's evolution during the course of the MSRC initiative first requires recognition that the school has a life which precedes this time. Teachers have toiled mightily for years to educate a continually changing clientele. The fact that we pick up the story with the present efforts should not be taken to suggest a lack of effort and success by earlier educators.<p>	Nevertheless, four years ago, when the present principal and his number-one assistant arrived at Forest Park and joined with the MSRC, attendance and graduation rates were at an all-time low, morale and the rate of course completion were low, and the school's reputation in the community was very low. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="esor"><h3>Early Stages of Restructuring: MSRC Restructuring Initiatives</h3>Throughout the city, the main thrust of the MSRC has been to break down schools into smaller units called "charters," which enable the teachers to know and instruct students better than before. The MSRC has also focused on improving instructional practices in schools by offering numerous seminars, frequently in connection with the district and local universities. In addition, the district and the local American Federation of Teachers (AFT) unit joined with the MSRC to enhance the role of teachers and to promote site-based management in order to improve the quality of the schools. Attention was also given to supporting student transitions from the eighth grade into Forest Park and from Forest Park into the worlds of work and higher education. <p>	The restructuring at Forest Park began, as it did in all of the city's twenty-two neighborhood high schools, with the creation of a special program for ninth-graders. This program, the Institute, was promoted throughout the district to give support during a transition year during which many students were disappearing from the system. Within this ninth-grade Institute, teams of teachers concentrated on developing pre-school-year transition programs, getting to know students well, and providing personalized instruction.<p>	In subsequent years, teachers at Forest Park were encouraged to create a renewal team to plan the extension of personalized programs to grades ten through twelve. This planning led the school to respond to MSRC proposals to enroll all students in charters that would include ninth- to twelfth-graders, heterogeneously grouped, with a career interest as part of the defining characteristics. 	Responding to an initiative by the MSRC, the district, and the local AFT affiliate, teachers filed a letter of intent to become a school-based management site.1 A preliminary survey at the school in the spring prior to this visit indicated that the faculty had not yet reached the 75-percent level of agreement required to support the educational plan being developed at Forest Park. <p>	By the fall of 1992, Forest Park claimed to be a fully "charterized" school. This meant that all high school students were included in one of the three charters: a Business Academy, a Motivation Program, and a Metropolitan Schools Program. 	The three high school charters were directly derived from the "academies"--district-sponsored programs which had existed at the school prior to the initiatives from the MSRC. These academies were externally funded, career-oriented programs, drawing students from various parts of the city. The Business Academy, which originated in a business-school district partnership begun in 1971, was included at Forest Park in 1984. The Motivation Program was adopted at Forest Park in 1975, from a district program first created in 1964 to challenge students who had academic potential but were not fully realizing it. The Metropolitan Program evolved from the externally initiated, nationally widespread Cities and Schools Program.<p>	In addition, all middle-school students were in one of four "houses." One of these houses (College Prep) was for high achieving students; the other three were horizontal, grade-level groupings of students--for example, there was an eighth-grade house.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ribs"><h3>Reform Initiatives by School Administrators </h3>While much of Forest Park's approach to restructuring appears to be a response to outside initiatives, it would be a serious mistake to assume that the school is simply a passive implementer of others' ideas. One of the school's administrators told us that when the current leadership came to the school,<p><blockquote>Most of the staff had been here at least twenty years and no place else. It was a junior/senior high school. Morale wasn't that good either, and there was no staff development. People were resistant to change. Their attitude was, "I've got the lesson plans. It worked with these kids' parents; it should work now." But that attitude has changed over the past four years.</blockquote><p>	The administrators began multiple efforts to revitalize Forest Park as soon as they arrived. They sought and gained participation in a national network of renewing high schools, sponsored by the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. An assistant principal, who had been introduced to Ted Sizer's Coalition of Essential Schools and the nine Common Principles (see Appendix B for a list of the Principles), encouraged the school to affiliate with the state's Re:Learning initiative in order to use it to help Forest Park.2 The administration quickly recognized the financial advantages of the school's link with the MSRC and responded to opportunities provided by the group. Leadership at the school engaged staff in initiatives to enhance instruction in math and science by getting them to take advantage of small grants from a foundation-funded collaborative in the district that had evolved as a sort of outside curriculum department. The school also established several community partnerships, including one with park rangers, which led to a course in ecology.<p>	Each of these initiatives has had its effect on the school, yet, as the school has engaged in each, it has maintained its control over its own direction, rather than relinquishing control to any outside agency. Historically, people have sought to conquer nations such as China or Russia, only to discover that the culture of these huge expanses absorbs the would-be conquerors. Forest Park may function in much the same way.<p>	Consider the following administrative description of the school's engagement with Re:Learning:<p><blockquote>It's taken four years to get teachers interested in it. When we first worked with Re:Learning, I couldn't get anyone to go to the meetings, so I went. I think it's finally getting to the stage where people acknowledge it--are being exposed to it. So, I do see us moving toward the nine Common Principles, and it will probably take another year and a half to have people understand what it's all about. What works best with this staff is to go in through the back door: "Hey, you are already doing this, and it's Principle number so and so."</blockquote><p>	The leadership's approach to working with the staff about the various reform initiatives stands out most clearly in the way they have shaped the new charters around the old programs. While the new charters have evolved into very different entities, they have maintained many of the elements of the original programs. Further evidence of the leadership's approach of working toward reform with the staff also shows up in their determination to challenge the wisdom of the MSRC's insistence that ninth-graders be included in charters rather than attending separate grade-level Institutes, as they did during the first years of the MSRC.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="iafp"><hr><center><h2>Instruction at Forest Park:Classroom Close-ups and Reflections</h2></center><hr>At Forest Park we saw some excellent examples of collaborative, cooperative learning--of students using their minds well, of teachers acting as coaches and of students as workers. These positive examples, presented here as "close-ups" of what the researchers observed in classrooms, are followed by the researchers' comments on instruction at Forest Park as a whole.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="scie"><h3>Science </h3>Mr. Parker, a science teacher who combines many subjects in his own interdisciplinary teaching, is a walking, talking example of a Coalition-type teacher, as he engages students in projects that require them to be in constant interaction with course materials and with each other. For Mr. Parker, classes are built around problem solving. He stresses helping students formulate hypotheses and then testing them through their projects. In his class, as they create papers which get English as well as science credit, students do research papers by using library resources and making inquiries of different agencies. Mr. Parker described his approach as follows:<p><blockquote>This is fun. It's called a science project, but what we are doing is problem solving. [The students] present in class first, and we videotape it. Then they go down to [the local university] and they are judged by experts in the field. We are presently in touch with NASA and will do a project with them about the depletion of the ozone layer. ...The kids get out in the real world and get to meet all kinds of people through these presentations. It expands all of our horizons.</blockquote><p>	His room is decorated with student's work exhibiting their progress. A student in the room described the complex computer model which he would be presenting the next day at a prestigious, private university in a nearby city. The student was working with the Academy of Natural Sciences, using ultraviolet light to study plankton. A girl's study, on display in the room, won a $4000 scholarship for her to Smith, in a citywide competition in the social sciences. <p>	This teacher and many others in the school are proud of the school's successful initiatives in science, which have led to a special visit from the governor. The staff also take pride in their progress in mathematics, which has led to the involvement of several faculty in major national reform efforts.<p>	Mr. Parker serves students who are part of the Business Academy, but also teaches students who are in other charters.3 The Business Academy provides for the teaching of business, social studies, science, math, and English. Most of the course work is taught by members of a team, but math tends to be taught outside of the team, so students can take higher-level courses.<p>	During their senior year, students are placed in part-time jobs. Students come to school at 7:30 and leave at 12:10 for work. Many of these students begin their jobs in the summer prior to their senior year. The team takes a number of steps to help them get ready for the world of work, which includes providing mock interviews and visits to various businesses in the school program. Business teachers stress entry-level skills in subjects such as word processing and accounting. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="engl"><h3>English </h3>Ms. Hilton, who teaches in the Motivation Charter, has arranged students' desks in four circles, with six to eight students in each group. Photographs of Malcolm X adorn one of the walls in the classroom, and a poster of Nelson Mandela hangs in one corner of the room. In the back of the room, a display board advertises the MSRC-supported Forest Park Black College Fair, about which several of the students had expressed excitement in interviews we had with them before we visited their class.<p>	As we enter, students are engaged in peer reading, coaching, and editing of their biographies that Ms. Hilton has handed back. She tells them she wants to see brainstorming and clustering as part of this peer revision process. All twenty-nine seniors in this class participate intently in this writing-process activity. Ms. Hilton circulates among the groups, listening, responding, and talking with the students about their drafts. Students are discussing with one another in their groups, and talk is lively in the room. She stops them to draw everyone's attention to the board, where she reviews brainstorming and clustering. Then she asks students to use these processes in their discussions.<p>	As work continues, a girl asks to speak to Ms. Hilton in the hallway. She appears to be upset about her rough draft. While Ms. Hilton steps out of the room, the noise level increases slightly, but a number of kids "shh" across the groups, and work goes on.4 When Ms. Hilton returns, two of the groups combine, and Ms. Hilton suggests that they have become too large a group to work effectively.<p>	Near the end of the period, Ms. Hilton begins to listen to peer comments which have been shared in the groups and points out what the readers might have done to provide more helpful comments to the authors. These are real papers for the students--biographies which they have prepared to use for college admission and job interviews. As she talks, encouraging students to add mention of a specific honor or a certain work experience, Ms. Hilton demonstrates not only her ability to help them write, but her familiarity with them as students. The class ends with the students surrounding Ms. Hilton. Clearly, they like her. <p>	She tells us that when they continue this group process on the following day, the students will work through additional drafts until they have a finished product they can be proud to share.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="te2"><h3>Tenth-Grade English 2 </h3>Mr. Hartman begins by having the students compare the book and movie versions of <cite>Of Mice and Men</cite>. During the discussion, Mr. Hartman refers to six critical skills for reading comprehension which are posted on the board. The class next turns to consider a paper about Malcolm X. As he begins to read the paper, Mr. Hartman alerts them to think about the "major theme or point." Once he resumes reading, he stops to comment and discuss various points. He talks with the students, for example, about Malcolm X's assertion that blacks need to communicate in the language of the whites--ballots and bullets. <p>	Once his reading is completed, the students quietly form small groups to continue discussing the assignment. This group of sophomores is described by Mr. Hartman as "not necessarily the cream of the crop," and includes several students who are repeaters. Nevertheless, they concentrate most of the time on an animated, serious discussion of the article--engaging in hard work about real issues.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="geom"><h3>Geometry </h3>In Mr. Lawrence's geometry class, twenty-nine freshmen and sophomores are involved in their work. Most of these students benefited from a summer math institute attended by more than ninety Forest Park students during the previous two summers. <p>	Students begin by retrieving folders and organizing themselves into self-chosen groups. Then, working in their groups, they make use of personal journals, subject-matter journals, calculators, texts, and the teacher.<p>	As the students work, Mr. Lawrence circulates throughout the room, leaning over kids' desks and talking with them in their groups. Encouraging students who are stuck to use another resource, he says, "Remember: Your text is just one more resource. It's not the major or only one. Talk with each other; explain things to each other." Groups vary in size from two to five students, but all are gender-segregated.<p>	A girl in one group leans over and talks to two boys in another group who are confused about a problem. After she helps them, they try to tell the others in their group what she has told them. When several of the boys look confused, Mr. Lawrence comes over to work with them. Heads bowed over their work, they listen as he talks with them, questioning and coaching them through the problem. <p>	By the end of the class, each of the ten working groups has received help from Mr. Lawrence at least four or five times. The students keep working right up to the bell.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="alge"><h3>Algebra</h3>Solid, traditional teaching holds sway as Ms. Spiller leads the class in solving homework problems, assigns the next set of work, and varies activities somewhat by having students work on these new assignments in groups. The twenty-five students present, with the exception of one, arrive with their books and pay attention throughout the class. <p>	A second algebra class that we visited also features fairly traditional instruction--this time, by Ms. Langley, a young, promising teacher. The class begins with four pre-class problems which the students are invited to work on as soon as they enter the room. After the students have attended to these problems, Ms. Langley works through them for the class, commenting to several students as she works. <p>	Three girls and a boy then go to the front to try problems written across the top of the board. Students call out encouragement and questions to them as they work. When the students complete the problems, Ms. Langley talks through each of the problems with the class--catching a mistake, discussing and demonstrating the process for finding the solutions. As she teaches, she asks frequent questions and offers prompts for students to respond. <p>	When they complete these problems, students are told to turn to page 74 in their texts, where one of them is invited to read aloud about the language of algebra. As the student reads, Ms. Langley puts examples on the board, demonstrating, for example, why "." is used instead of "<cite>x</cite>" in algebra as a way of indicating multiplication.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ss"><h3>Social Studies</h3>Students in Mr. Hudson's class talk loudly and energetically in their work groups. Sometimes groups concentrate on the topic, often kept on task by a student secretary who records their progress. In other cases, basketball seems to be the dominant subject. However, most of the groups seem to time their work so that, like a good NBA team, they use the last few minutes of the class time to complete their task and come out with what Mr. Hudson wants. As they argue, the young students in this class compare the viewpoints of various authors and challenge the Eurocentrism of some of them. In spite of taking occasional side tracks, these students are engaging in high-order thinking. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rotc"><h3>Reflections on the Close-ups</h3>What happens in classes at Forest Park is not always as positive as the preceding examples. In one social studies class, for example, students wrote definitions from texts and dictionaries for twenty words listed on the board. The students' task, according to the assignment at the front of the room, was to learn four words per night so they could pass a test one week later. During the class the students worked quietly at their desks, entering definitions in their notebooks with no interference or help from anyone else, including the teacher. Even in this setting, those students who were present were attentive and under control. <p>	Most of the classrooms we visited displayed many of the nine Common Principles--particularly the Principles which speak of student as worker, teacher as coach, and of students using their minds well. However, when we talked with people at Forest Park about instruction, they did not use the language of the Coalition of Essential Schools unless we prompted them. They are engaged in a change process of their own, in which they adapt whatever they come in contact with to the needs of their school. <p>	We were outsiders at Forest Park, or, as one teacher put it, "interlopers." While, for the most part, students and adults alike were gracious and forthcoming, we observed tensions within the school which we do not fully understand. In several instances, in spite of the faculty having voted to take part in the study, following discussions with various parties over the span of a full year, and in spite of our having requested to speak only with volunteers, people were reluctant to be interviewed. Sometimes interviewees insisted they not be quoted. <p>	In one classroom, several teachers working as a team made a point to modify their normal routine because they had a "visitor," and insisted that the observer participate in the activity with the students. The problem was understandable to the observer. The day's activity called for students to engage in conversations that ordinarily they would expect to be treated as confidential. The teachers were concerned that the trust they had built with the students could not be expected to extend to an outside visitor. Still, in a situation where teachers had supposedly volunteered for participation, the climate in the room was what one would experience if an unexpected interrupter were thrust on the class. <p>	There may be several explanations why such tension was not always present. It may be only the reaction of some isolated individuals (or even an overreaction on our part to a normal hesitancy of teachers to share their space). However, there were some potentially related tensions among teachers, department heads, and administrators that surfaced during faculty meetings, interviews, and other conversations. In one instance this took the form of jousting over authority (who has the final say in the school). In another it consisted of the administrators' suggesting different things to different groups of people (as when "These are the greatest teachers we have" was said in front of several different groups). In still another setting, the tension came to light as an expression of concern about it being "increasingly difficult to have two schools here."<p>	One of our team members concluded with an overall impression that the people at Forest Park were cautious and suspicious of one another, with factions occupying a place in everyone's mind. Another raised a question about whether there are racial and gender issues behind these tensions. On the one hand, a teacher-leader said, "Our administration definitely hears what we say. They have relinquished some of their authority." On the other hand, an administrator made it very clear that no one talked with faculty at the school without clearance through that administrator.<p>	In a small faculty meeting for people who could not attend the regular meeting, there was general interaction about items on the agenda. In the larger faculty meeting, a parade of individuals spoke <cite>at </cite>the teachers, talking about subjects as diverse as paycheck schedules, Governing Council progress, grant opportunities, participation in the Coalition's Fall Forum, partnership opportunities with a local college, and a faculty Christmas party. <p>	The atmosphere in the large group was quiet and subdued. Everyone began his or her comments by saying "Good afternoon," and received a like greeting in response. Part of the problem in this meeting was clearly the large size of the gathering. Another part of the problem is harder to grasp. In some ways, the condition is like the front of the school and the back halls. There is an outward appearance of respect and cooperation that seems somehow to be superficial and to be covering up conflict. <p>	Although <cite>caring </cite>has not been discussed at length in this paper, let there be no misunderstanding: there was much evidence of care, strong support, and empathy for students from teachers, aides, support staff, and administrators. What were more uncertain were the relationships among the adults.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="qftf"><hr><center><h2>Questions for the Future</h2></center><hr>Several concerns, particularly about leadership and reform, arose from our first visit to Forest Park High School. These concerns raise questions about the future revitalization of the high school.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cal"><h3>Concerns about Leadership</h3>Forest Park is located in one of several states that have recently decided to help solve their financial problems by encouraging early retirements. One immediate, likely consequence of this decision for Forest Park appears to be the loss of its principal, who has provided the leadership during the recent period of school improvement. His departure (and the changing of many other leadership positions within the district) may also be accompanied by other leadership transitions at the school. <p>	In this school, perhaps to an even greater degree than some of the others we have visited recently, the thrust for some elements of reform comes from the administrative leadership. While department heads and other teachers have been giving attention to strengthening instructional programs for years, attention to whole-school change of the type envisioned by the Coalition and the MSRC has been largely generated by the principal and assistant principal. However, at Forest Park, as in other schools, the work of reform must come from the teaching corps as well as from the administration. Changes in the operation of the school must receive the same attention and engagement as have changes in curricular areas, such as math and science. <p>	One of the biggest questions for Forest Park, then, is, Who will be its new leaders and how will their presence affect the direction of reform in the school? How will they proceed to spread participation in change efforts? A part of the answer to these questions may lie in the success of the school in obtaining grant funds that will enable it to participate in intensive Coalition of Essential Schools staff development.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="iifr"><h3>Incorporating Ideas for Reform</h3>Another set of questions for the future revolves around how the staff who continue at Forest Park will choose to incorporate ideas from the MSRC and the Coalition of Essential Schools into their own approaches for organizing schooling and teaching students. <p><ol><li>How will they organize students for instruction? While there are many indications of "Coalition-type" teaching, there are equally obvious signs of the continuation of tracking5 and of other practices which are contradictory to the direction espoused by both the MSRC and the Coalition. <p><li>What will the decision-making processes be, and who will have the power to make the decisions? Will shared decision making become the real mechanism for determining direction, or will direction be set by the administration? <p><li>What are charters at Forest Park? In what ways are they really different from the earlier academies and programs at the school? <p><li>How can people best work together? How can the tone of the school truly be one which values trust and decency?<p></ol>	Leaders in the fledgling school-based management team told us, "[While] everything is not perfect, we will continue, no matter what. Whatever we can do for our students, we will continue to do it. We don't have self-centered people here." To the extent the spirit of such leaders permeates the entire staff, the future looks bright for Forest Park and for the students who come there to learn.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><h3>Notes</h3><ol><li> "Letter-of-intent" schools are those schools which responded to invitations from the joint committee of district and union officials responsible for developing site-based management in their district. The task of the interim councils at the schools was to develop "educational plans." If the plans they developed were approved by a 75 percent vote of the faculty, the school could ask the joint council for waivers of policies and contract provisions which would give them greater independence in their day-to-day operations.<p><li> Re:Learning, a partnership formed by the Coalition of Essential Schools and the Education Commission of the States in 1988, offers a framework for states and schools to work together to support school reform. Re:Learning also seeks to allow changes initiated by school-based professionals to influence state policy reforms.<p><li> Charter integrity--the extent to which teachers work only in a particular charter and/or students take all the classes from the group of teachers affiliated with the charter--continues to be a problem at Forest Park and at other schools in the district. Much of this difficulty is blamed on the inability of "roster" offices to arrange schedules, but in fact it may be a product of teacher specialization and of a curriculum which has not been reduced to essential content.<p><li> In this room, as in many of the parts of the school, our observer is clearly an outsider, but we are welcomed onto others' turf, and the students and teachers appear at ease during our intrusion. For exceptions to this "comfortable" relationship, see comments later in this paper, in the section, "Reflections on the Close-ups."<p><li> The school takes the position that there is no tracking, but we observed students in charters and courses that appear to be grouped by ability.<p></ol><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr><p><a href="../../../projects/sc/chanlong.htm">Appendix A: About the School Change Study</a><br><a href="../../../principl/principl.htm">Appendix B: The Common Principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools</a><br><a href="../list.htm#2">Return to Index of School Change Publications</a><p></body></html>

One student told us, "I feel safe here; it's just when I go outside that I'm afraid." The entire student population receives free breakfast and lunch at the school, with two seatings for breakfast.<p>	Located in the large, eastern city of Jefferson, Forest Park is an urban high school with approximately one thousand students in grades nine through twelve. A middle school in the same building, under the leadership of the same principal, serves students in grades six through eight. The regional superintendent is also housed here.<p>	Adjacent to the school, under separate administration, an elementary school completes this urban equivalent of the village school complex that dominated rural America in the first half of this century. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fts"><h3>Focusing the Snapshot</h3>In May 1993 we made our second visit to Forest Park as part of the School Change Study. This visit included two intensive days of observations in classrooms and conversations with people in the school community--students, teachers, administrators, and parents. From the observations we made and the conversations we had during our visit, we created the following "snapshot." <p>	As a snapshot, it depicts the school at a particular point in time and gives pertinent information about the environment in which the school operates.1 This snapshot, along with two additional ones we are producing from other visits,2 attempts to provide a mirror for the teachers and administrators at the school, to assist them in charting their own course. As researchers we will also use the snapshots to seek greater understanding of the challenges faced by schools that are committed to whole-school change.<p>	This second snapshot begins with a description of the challenges that beset the district and the school as a result of the complex, troubled urban environment in which Forest Park is located. The second part of the snapshot presents progress and problems within the school itself from the perspective of the teachers, parent/staff members, administrators, and students. The snapshot concludes with the researchers' reflections on questions raised by both the second and first visits to Forest Park High School.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tcof"><hr><center><h2>The Context of Forest Park</h2></center><hr>In order to understand what it is like to learn and teach at Forest Park in 1993, it is important to understand the earlier restructuring efforts that have shaped the school.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="dre"><h3>District-wide Revitalization Efforts  </h3>Forest Park is part of a district-wide school revitalization effort initiated by the foundation-funded Metropolitan School Restructuring Collaborative (MSRC). Throughout the city, the main thrust of the MSRC has been to break down schools into smaller units, called "charters," which enable the teachers to know and instruct students better. These charters include ninth- to twelfth-graders, heterogeneously grouped, with a career interest as part of the defining characteristics. <p>	By the fall of 1992, Forest Park claimed to be a fully "charterized" school. This meant that all high school students were included in one of the three charters: a Business Academy, a Motivation Program, and a Metropolitan Schools Program. The three high school charters were derived from programs which had existed at the school prior to the initiatives from the MSRC. The Business Academy, which originated in a business -school district partnership begun in 1971, was included at Forest Park in 1984. The Motivation Program was adopted at Forest Park in 1975, from a district program first created in 1964 to challenge students who had academic potential but were not fully realizing it. The Metropolitan Program evolved from the externally initiated, nationally widespread Cities and Schools Program. In some ways, these charters function like sub-schools within Forest Park.<p>	In addition, all middle-school students were placed in one of four "houses." One of these houses, College Prep, is for high achieving students; the other three are horizontal, grade-level groupings of students--for example, there is an eighth-grade house. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cwtc"><h3>Connections with the Coalition</h3>Forest Park is affiliated also with the Coalition of Essential Schools, whose reform efforts are guided by the nine Common Principles, through the state's Re:Learning initiative and through a direct linkage established between the Coalition and its district in 1992.3 (See Appendix B for a listing of the nine Common Principles.) <p>	Forest Park's connection with the Coalition has been limited; it has consisted mainly of contacts by a few of its staff at Coalition training sessions at Brown University, attendance at Coalition Fall Forum sessions, and participation in Re:Learning meetings. One consequence of this limited connection is that few of the staff at Forest Park believe the changes they are making are a direct result of involvement with the Coalition of Essential Schools. <p><a name="cap"><h3>Challenges and Problems, 1992-93</h3>During the 1992-93 school year, several circumstances significantly influenced the pace of restructuring within the district. <p><h4>The Need to Deal with Violence</h4>From the beginning of the school year, outbreaks of violence in the district's high schools absorbed considerable amounts of the top leaders' energy. Even when there were not violent acts at a particular school, the time devoted to establishing procedures for inspecting children to make sure they were not bringing weapons onto campus and the efforts involved in the general increases in supervision of students competed with the attention needed for improving instructional programs. <p><h4>Financial Problems Affecting Reform</h4>At the same time, the district was faced with a series of financial problems which directly affected high school reform efforts. <p>	The year began with financial difficulties that caused the school district to give each sub-school unit engaged in reform considerably less money than promised. These same financial problems also affected bargaining in the fall and continued to affect relationships between the school district and the union representing the teachers. Added financial woes were caused by cutbacks in the availability of federal Chapter I funds. <p>	The final blow came in the spring, at the time of our visit. Faced with reductions in state funding and slower-than-predicted local tax collections, the district decided to make overall cuts of approximately $60 million, with about $18 million of the cuts to come from the high schools. <p>	As they faced the task of making budget cuts, the teachers at Forest Park reacted with the same general lack of enthusiasm exhibited by teachers, administrators, and parents throughout the district. <p><h4>The Impact of Early Retirement </h4>By the spring of 1993, the most obvious influence of the world outside the school on life at Forest Park was the offering of bonuses by state legislation to employees who retired early. Because of some rather unique components of union agreements and past practices within the district, central office leaders, principals, and teacher-leaders not only left in large numbers, they began leaving prior to the completion of the school year. District-wide, more than eighty principals needed to be replaced. 	By the summer of 1993, the superintendent and her most senior, immediate assistants had added their names to the list of retirees. As planning was under way for 1993-94, the deputy superintendent had retired, and the associate superintendent for operations, whose duties included all personnel and labor relations functions, as well as one of the two assistant superintendents for high schools, had retired. The interim superintendent, appointed until a national search could produce a permanent appointment, had no direct replacements for any of these departed leaders--although their responsibilities had all been reassigned to continuing administrators. <p>	The effects of early retirement were felt at the school, as well as at the district office. During 1992-93, Forest Park's principal took a sabbatical and was replaced by an assistant principal, who was given the title of interim principal. The school also faced the loss of longtime teacher-leaders. One staff member informed us that they were losing fifteen teachers to retirement alone. <p>	This second snapshot took place at the height of rumors regarding the superintendent's plans and during the period of uncertainty concerning the individuals who were to be assigned as principals, vice principals, and teachers at Forest Park and at other high schools in the district. Other issues, such as a court review of district desegregation and new state mandates for curriculum, had less immediate impact on Forest Park but were part of the environment within which the people at Forest Park worked. <p><h4>The Crucial Role of Context</h4>The work at Forest Park takes place in a complex environment, consisting in part of a large city school system, which, while committed to decentralization and the strengthening of instruction, is a victim of the bureaucratic problems facing all large organizations. The work also takes place in the context of a community where poverty, violence, racism, and other social ills conspire to make the task of educating children monumentally difficult.<p>	Our focus in the snapshots is on the school and the people who inhabit it. However, the success of Forest Park High School in elevating student performance will ultimately be determined by the extent to which progress is made in curing the ills of the broader setting, as well as by what happens in the school. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fpof"><hr><center><h2>Four Perspectives on Forest Park</h2></center><hr>A brief examination of the school in the spring of 1993 reveals how it manages in the midst of the particular set of challenging conditions characterizing its larger context. This examination conveys what is happening at Forest Park from the point of view of the people who are part of the school community--its teachers, parents, administrators, and students.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ftpot"><h3>From the Perspective of Teachers</h3>Forest Park is a school buzzing with a multitude of change efforts. One of the teacher-leaders who has been engaged with Coalition ideas opened her interview with us by saying,<p><blockquote>Our biggest job now is educating the staff about the Coalition. We are trying to show and tell the staff about it all. We are trying to define terms, discuss what the nine Common Principles are all about. There are many who don't know about it, and when you put the nine Common Principles in their hands, they say, "How can we possibly do this? Especially the small class size puzzles us. How can we do this?"</blockquote><p>	Teachers expressed varying points of view concerning the school's direct engagement with the Coalition of Essential Schools. One told us,<p><blockquote>There are some people here for whom the Coalition is a religious experience. But I feel that I'm at a loss because I don't know much about it. I know that we are doing things that are Coalition-like. I know that we have interdisciplinary approaches. We definitely believe in "teacher-as-coach." We just need to learn more about it.</blockquote><p>	Perhaps the reason that the Coalition's role was not clear in the minds of the people with whom we spoke is that the faculty was engaged in so many different initiatives. One teacher stated, <p><blockquote>It takes time to do all this. It's one thing to hear experts talk about all this; it's another to come back and do it. There's a lot going on from the central office--a lot of programs--and you take faculty meetings to talk about all this--plus portfolios, assessment--and everyone is inundated. </blockquote><blockquote>But it's time for a change, and we are moving into the next century. If we want to prepare students for tomorrow, we have to change too. There's always apprehension. That comes with anything different. And there's always a group that says no, no matter what. But we have a majority who want to do these things. And, since it's a small school, you find us involved in a lot of things.</blockquote><h4>Reform Initiatives at the School</h4>What did this teacher mean when she said we would find them involved "in a lot of things"? In addition to the school's work with the Coalition, teachers told us about the following reform-related activities in which they and the school were involved:<p><ul><li>Taking part in the interactive math projects from California <p><li>Participating in the federally funded Chapter I programs, which are virtually schoolwide because of the pervasiveness of poverty in the school's attendance area<p><li>Offering a new course called Discrete Mathematics<p><li>Participating in the summer Algebra Transition Project<p><li>Working with the MSRC for the fourth consecutive year on restructuring that focuses on creation of small sub-schools (charters) <p><li>Participating in the PRIME program, designed to encourage students to enter engineering and science careers<p><li>Participating in the PACT program, encouraging students to develop careers in technology<p><li>Creating family groups that help students deal with the realities of their lives<p><li>Participating in programs designed to encourage students' engagement in community services<p><li>Participating in various science awards programs, highlighted by the presence of the state's governor at the school to see the summer school programs and the work in science <p><li>Involving students in the new Literacy Corps<p><li>Developing alternative approaches to assessment<p><li>Expanding the use of senior projects as a means of determining student progress<p><li>Expanding multicultural and technological materials in the library of the school (coupled with the possible elimination of the librarian position)<p><li>Developing an extended-day schedule<p><li>Creating double periods for teachers and students in some charters<p><li>Developing a schoolwide educational plan<p><li>Collaborating with a local college to match Forest Park kids with urban education majors--one example of why people at Forest Park consider themselves to be a teacher training center<p><li>Participating in the science and math networking affiliated with the Coalition of Essential Schools' School Change Study<p><li>Obtaining a grant for a teacher-leader to work on a literature-based approach to writing<p><li>Working with a new IBM computer lab<p><li>Developing shared decision making and school-based management capabilities<p><li>Making cuts of $292,000 from their annual budget<p><li>Engaging with an organizational development consultant from the MSRC in team building and in learning how to reach consensus<p><li>Structuring a program in which male faculty members keep their eyes on selected black male students--checking their grades and checking on attendance and other records<p><li>Engaging with the city program, Setplay, to develop self-esteem through culture, leading to academic excellence for young black boys<p><li>Participating in the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development network for high school restructuring<p><li>Engaging in transition meetings necessitated by the midyear taking of a sabbatical by the principal and the ascension of the assistant principal to the role of acting principal<p><li>Participating in staff development work facilitated by the city's Human Relations Commission, to help head off signs of racial conflict generated by a disgruntled parent<p><li>Being involved with a local college in a summer science enrichment project for students, with a focus on ecological concerns  <p></ul><h4>The Need for Accountability Amidst Change</h4>One of the teacher-leaders suggested that in view of the multitude of activities, everyone is doing something, but nobody knows what anyone else is doing; the school is "scattered." This same teacher went on to suggest that they needed to stop any more new "experiments." Another teacher responded, quietly but firmly, "The school needs to work on a focus that could be used to tie these experiments together." <p>	Both of these teachers agreed that some new form of academic accountability is needed. However, the teachers openly expressed their frustration with the system that requires them to construct elaborate educational plans as a means of responding to demands for accountability. They added, "And then all kinds of resources are taken away, and we can't move ahead."<p>	In some cases, teachers suggested, the various initiatives have contradictory effects. For example one noted that "charters are good for the students' sense of identity, but not so good for the whole school's morale." He was worried that while the sub-schools generated productive competitiveness, they also created an unhealthy divisiveness. <p>	For the teachers, the school is a place where they are engaged in many different programs seeking to serve the needs of the students. In some cases, it is a place where high expectations exist for students and deep concern is shown for their personal lives.<p><a name="cc"><table border><tr><td><h3>Classroom Close-ups</h3><p>The following close-ups are drawn from the researchers' observations in several classrooms during the May 1993  visit.<p><p><h4>Algebra</h4><p>Students worked with each other while the teacher checked to make sure they were applying the FOIL rubric correctly as they multiplied binomials. As they completed reviewing the previous day's assignment and turned to page 400 to do problems 1 to 11 and 28 to 30, the students formed groups, opened their books, and began working intently. A pair of them teamed up with the teacher. Another pair, actively engaged in their work, paused to explain to us that they had covered imaginary and complex numbers in only a week's time. Based on their application of these concepts in the earlier discussion, they appeared to have gained a good working knowledge from this quick study. The class ended with what the teacher told them was the best part--the assignment of more problems from page 400 as their homework.<p><h4>Geometry</h4><p>Twenty-two students practiced concepts they had been learning by working on worksheets in small groups. Moderately noisy at first, but more subdued as time passed, the students concentrated on the work they had been assigned. As the students pursued their tasks, the teacher moved from group to group, responding to questions and pointing out processes for solving problems. As the period drew to a close, the teacher reminded the students that they would be continuing the same work the next day. He told them, "This is our first practice with this new stuff, and I know that you are struggling. But you're getting it. You just have to keep trying."<p><h4>Business </h4><p>Thirteen students were engaged in a simulation of a business situation calling for the completion of four jobs. Working in groups of four, the students began by making a group decision concerning the role each student was to play. Not unlike the real world, one member of a group decided for himself what he would do. When the students protested, the teacher intervened to help the group make its decisions concerning who would be doing what. <p>	The students were using IBM computers and performing tasks such as composing a letter with an enclosure; typing a memo, bulletin, or outline; and creating a letter or list. This class is part of the Business Academy, which starts at 7:30 each morning, so its students can leave the building to go to their jobs early in the afternoon. For the teacher in this class, the academy is also her world. The jobs for which she is preparing students set the direction of the instructional program.<p><h4>Family Group Advisory</h4><p>In this class teachers worked with students in an advisory capacity in family groups. While not explicitly associating these groups with the Coalition Principle concerning personalization, the teachers and students in these groups clearly engaged in dialogue that revealed significant understanding by teachers of students' needs and interests. In one group, students talked about one group member's reluctance to apply for jobs because of an experience in which he once had been rejected for a job. Students in another group talked about concerns of violence, police brutality, and other factors that made living in their neighborhoods so difficult. Students seemed to respond positively to these conversations; but at least some teachers seemed unsure of their facilitating role, and some expressed concern that they have too little time in the short sessions to pursue topics the students raise. <p></td></table><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ftpop"><h3>From the Perspective of Parent/Staff Members</h3>We talked with several parents who serve as parent-community coordinators, in a dual role of parent and staff member. Interestingly, in the midst of efforts to decentralize school operations, these people told us, "We have two bosses. One is the principal here, and there's the School-Community Area Coordinator. We turn all our records into that person." Clearly these parent/staff members are dedicated individuals--both spoke of working Saturdays and Sundays in their efforts to contact the students and parents in the community. <p>	They shared their own views of the school and the community it serves. They told us about block organizations which make sure that the kids get to school, and about other segments of the area which the school serves, where they ventured only if accompanied by a family member or a current or former student. <p>	They told of marching to get the school built so they did not have to send their kids out of the community.<p>	One parent/staff member said,<p><blockquote>Yes, I marched. I was a young women then, marching because I had small children that hadn't started school yet. But all my children would attend the school. I was a parent here, and volunteered my time here, and I've seen this school. It has always been a great school. It's my school ...but I can say there have been some changes. There has been some improvement. I see the teachers and the students having a togetherness. Because of the houses [charters], the students have someone they can go directly to.</blockquote><p>	They explained how their involvement in the Get Set program helped their children get on the right track when they were three and four years old. <p>	These parent-activists shared their belief in the value of such initiatives as the Governing Council and the advisory councils. They spoke of their current engagement in the school's Governing Council and of their past involvement in advisory councils at the school and district level. They also expressed their worry that "teachers don't have a tendency to turn to parents as a partner." They identified problems of engaging parents in meetings, including difficulties in scheduling meetings at times that were compatible with parents' schedules.<p>	For these community members, as for some of the faculty, the answer to the problems facing the students, many of which they connect with the prevalence of drugs, is the creation of programs. One reported, <p><blockquote>We tried to start a program where we can get the young people back into school. We got quite a few back in last year. We had the ACE program, and we got some of the dropouts to come back in, but it's just hard when they see this money and see how fast it is, and drive around in the cars, and they're into designer things. I raised my children not to be into those kinds of things, OK? And that's the answer. We just have to teach our children, "As long as you've got shoes on your feet, decent clothing--go to school!" </blockquote><p>	Another parent told of investigating a Florida model which included creation of alternative housing, complete with "house parents" so there would be a stable environment for the students. One raised the possibility of using buses owned by local churches to get parents to advisory meetings and to help students who could not afford transit passes to get to school. One parent suggested having a summer program that would give parents and teachers a better understanding of how to help children.<p>	For these individuals, who combine the role of parent and staff member, much of the blame for student problems rests with families that do not follow up to make sure their children are in school. One described a boy who was the focus of considerable attention by the school:<p><blockquote>He told me he goes downtown. He walks around the Galleria. Nobody stops him, because he's big for his age. And he just walks around 'till school is out and then he comes home. You see him leave with his school bag and you see him come back with his school bag. We have worked--everybody I've talked with, the principal--we have worked everything out to help this particular child. I don't know what the answer is because his mother lives one place and he lives somewhere else. That's the difference. She doesn't know what he's doing. She's in her own world; he's got a room at an apartment in a friend's house.</blockquote><p>	For these parents, the students who succeed are the ones who are known--known by their parents, their teachers, the administration, and supervisory personnel of the school. As one parent told us, "They know when you know them!"<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ftpota"><h3>From the Perspectiveof the Administration</h3>Just as parent-community coordinators have two bosses, administrators at the school are often dependent on external decisions for day-to-day operations. For example, in talking about problems associated with disciplinary cases, one administrator told us a child could be transferred to another school if that child had a record of difficult behavior.<p><blockquote>The teacher has to fill out a form, I have to fill out another bunch of forms, and then once it leaves here and the request goes to Central Office, I have no control. They have a bunch of these requests sitting on the desk, and it takes time to process them. In the meantime, the child is still acting out and the teacher thinks that I haven't done anything about it. I tell them, "I acted on it," and I pick up the phone many times to follow up on the request, but it's out of my hands. Finally, someone else down at Central Office decides.</blockquote><blockquote>This is a problem throughout the system. The assistant principals have suggested that they be given the power to just pick up the phone and make the arrangement in another school--it would avoid a lot of paperwork and middleman stuff.</blockquote><p>	In another instance, union and central office directives left the school without security workers for a part of an afternoon, in order to have them present for an evening program.<p>	In spite of such concerns, we gathered a largely positive picture from the administration. As we noted earlier during our visit in the spring of 1993, the principal was on a career-completing sabbatical, and an assistant principal, who was seeking to become the permanent principal, was acting as principal.4 Not surprisingly, questions related to the transition from one administration to another dominated much of the work of the administration.<p>	The acting principal shared with us her numerous conversations with various advisory groups as she worked to build consensus for her administration. Borrowing from Thurgood Marshall, she adopted a theme of "the dream makers or the dream breakers" and encouraged people to be the former. Obtaining the necessary agreement required work with the segment of the school power base, represented by the union's Building Committee, the official leaders who were present on the Instructional Cabinet, and the fledgling Governing Council, which was seeking to define the nature of school-based management at Forest Park. <p>	During this transition time, meetings were held to work out an interim arrangement for leadership in the building. The acting principal initiated this arrangement to fill the gap until the district placed an assistant in the school. The administration called on the city Human Relations Commission to help with staff development that would enable the teachers to keep racial concerns from affecting fairness in student discipline.<p>	In a third instance of proactive leadership during this transition, the administration defused a demonstration by the National People's Party, protesting the failure of the school to emphasize African-American values. A quickly called assembly for both middle school and high school students helped keep them informed on this issue and probably contributed to the kids' response to the media, who showed up to cover the six marchers: "What is that woman talking about? None of that is happening here, and we have a fine school, and we like our principal, and leave us alone!"<p>	In spite of these instances of the interim administration's taking the initiative, the task of building the consensus needed for the continuation of the reform efforts at the school was complicated by the ongoing process of selecting a new principal--a process slated to take another month following our visit. One of the most recent events in this regard was the initiation by a community member of a petition demanding the hiring of a black male as principal. One of the African-American female staff members, a strong supporter of the acting principal, a Caucasian woman, made it clear she would have to talk with this man and "get <cite>that </cite>under control." <p>	The administration told us that they believe the faculty is convinced that "they're moving and they've changed and they're looking at different strategies, but [the administration and faculty] all worked on it together. It's not top down, and there's no <cite>one </cite>change agent."<p>	Still, the administrators see their role as vital in establishing a common vision in the school. In that regard, one administrator described another of the most pressing problems:<p><blockquote>I don't have time to reflect. I just don't. And that's the one thing that is missing in our piece here. It's a good school, but there's no reflective time, either for teachers, for students, or for administrators.</blockquote><blockquote>Maybe what we need to do is take a breath--take a breath and don't do anything different, don't bring in anything new. Let's look at what we have, and let's spend a year reflecting. People have been in this whole thing maybe now for three years. They have had a taste of different things. It's time now to say, "All right now, what do we like?"</blockquote><p>	Even as the administrators recognized the need for bringing people together to reflect on the various initiatives under way, they expressed the need for new efforts:<p><blockquote>Still, there are other things we need to do. I mean, I was all gung-ho next year to go into a different time schedule--an <cite>A/B </cite>schedule where you have half your classes on <cite>A </cite>day and half on <cite>B </cite>day. And we need to consider eliminating the seventh-grade and eighth-grade houses in the middle school and creating vertical houses with both seventh- and eighth-graders in them. </blockquote><p>	Looking ahead, the administration realized that building a more reflective environment--creating conditions which would allow teachers to examine their own teaching and to think about how to improve it--would be made even more complex by the big changes in staffing that would result from the state's early retirement plan. Again, examples of proactive administrative leadership emerged as they talked about plans to use retiring people part time as mentors, and about ways they could "personally recruit" within the system to assure that the teachers who came to their school would be ones who fit into the culture being developed at Forest Park. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ftpos"><h3>From the Perspective of Students</h3>"This school has a lot of really smart teachers." This unsolicited testimonial from a student may not be the view held by all students, but it represents well the generally positive views of their teachers and school which students shared with us. <p>	Another student told us, "This school is great because of the teachers and my friends. I'm a senior, and I've been here since seventh grade. I've seen lots of programs." She went on to talk about being involved with Upward Bound programs associated with a local university and of being taken on college trips to other schools. She also talked about her involvement in PRIME and how it was supporting her interest in becoming a mechanical engineer. <p>	Another student told us about his previous enrollment in one of the district's magnet programs:<p><blockquote>I went to Academic High School; I've been here for a year and a half. Here classes aren't as big, and there's more of a family atmosphere here. The teachers and counselors go out of their way to help you here. At Academic, you had to wait a month to see a counselor--and teachers, they taught old-fashioned ways and didn't go into much detail, as they should. The tutorials were larger than the classes.</blockquote><p>	These students explained they were from a charter where "99 percent of their group" went to college. One was headed for Spellman, the other for Morehouse. Both had just received $500 scholarships from the engineering program. They spoke about the support they received for effective group work in their Elementary Functions class and of the knowledgeable assistance they got from the English teacher who helped them deal with Shakespeare's language. <p>	Another student, not as mature nor as academically talented, described how she was trying out the various opportunities provided by the charters in the school. During the 1992-93 school year, she had enrolled in the Business Academy as a ninth-grader. She was convinced she wanted to be a lawyer, but was somewhat uncertain about the course of study to follow to pursue that dream. As of the spring of 1993, her intention was to try the College Prep Charter in her sophomore year and the Motivation Charter as a junior. Reflecting the feeling that she was being tracked (without using that terminology), this student said,<p><blockquote>After high school I want to go straight to college. And in Business [Academy], I think you have to go to a business school, a two-year business school. But I don't want to go to business school. It's not boring to me, it's just that I ...I want to take College Prep.</blockquote><p>	As she tried to determine the future of her school life, she identified the principal, counselors, and her parents as sources of assistance. She shared with us ways the teachers she now had encouraged her to stay with the charter in which she was currently enrolled. For this student, and for others with whom we spoke, being well known in the school obviously was a major factor in determining her attitude toward school. <p>	Given staff members' descriptions of students who fail to come to school, or who come to school only to hang out in corridors, we know that the students with whom we talked were not necessarily a representative sample of the whole student body. However, their observations did help us see the school from the perspective of one group of students--a group which one student admitted to us are often referred to as "nerds" or "geeks" by other students. Like their adult counterparts, the students realize the value of being known and are aware that a large number of different programs surround them. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="refl"><hr><center><h2>Reflections</h2></center><hr>Several themes emerged from our recent visit to Forest Park. This visit also provided perspective on questions raised by the first snapshot of Forest Park.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tnfa"><h3>The Need for a Coherent Vision</h3>When we visited, we noted that there were obviously many programs being tried simultaneously. It is not clear that the school community had a coherent vision of how this multitude of initiatives fit together. It was evident that the faculty did not have a holistic view of the change efforts. In this regard, the acting principal's recognition of the need for reflection about direction seemed to be right on the mark.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="damc"><h3>Divided Allegiance, Multiple Controls</h3>There was another facet of the multiple program effort that will need the district's cooperation before it can be addressed. Earlier we mentioned that staff needed to get outside approval for various kinds of decisions. One almost inevitable consequence of the presence of multiple programs is the existence of external offices set up to help the programs succeed. Unfortunately, these offices have a tendency to become control agents. Thus, in a school like Forest Park, where staff may be involved in more than twenty programs, allegiance of staff may become divided between the program leadership located in the central office or in a non-profit agency and the leadership and clients to be served at the school. This is particularly true during times of limited resources (the most common of times), when the outside programs offer money to enable staff to overcome fiscal limitations otherwise imposed on them.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tnfp"><h3>The Need for Personalization</h3>One of the key Principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools is the need to personalize high schools. This Principle is also key to the efforts of the MSRC in Forest Park's district. At Forest Park, students, administrators, parents, and teachers testified to the power of <cite>knowing </cite>students in creating a safer and more academically meaningful environment. They agreed that the charters in the high school and the houses in the middle school have been key contributors to their success in helping students feel known. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="thct"><h3>The Human Costs to Staff</h3>There is another element to school reform which came through as we talked with people at Forest Park: the human dimension of the costs of reform efforts, which too often gets ignored. We listened sympathetically as a young teacher explained the pressures on his family of his continuing involvement in reform efforts and in his own graduate study. He commented,<p><blockquote>My wife told me the other day she wished all this was over. The nights, 'till 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, at the word processor ...but it was something I wanted to do--a dream. And she was supporting me, but she said, "I'll be so glad when all of this is over, so you can come back down and be a normal husband."</blockquote><p>	In another situation, we heard descriptions of staff members working Saturdays and Sundays in order to make contacts with parents. We recognized the toll that engagement in the reform efforts can take on parents, as a parent/staff member told us about juggling her schedule to take care of her daughter's two-year-old baby so the daughter could stay in high school and go on to college. For another person, a heart attack had served as a warning about overdoing. Still another told of arriving before seven every morning and being too tired at the end of the day to read even a trash novel, let alone examine and reflect on professional literature. Of course, such conditions are not unique to Forest Park, but they do serve to remind us of the human element in the struggle for school improvement.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="qac"><h3>Questions and Comments</h3>At the conclusion of the first snapshot of this school, we posed several questions for the Forest Park school community about their struggle for school reform. Calling upon on our most recent observations, we repeat the questions in the following section and comment on them.<p><blockquote><cite>How will the school organize students for instruction? While there are many indications of "Coalition-type" teaching, there are equally obvious signs of continuation of tracking and other practices which are contradictory to the direction espoused by both the MSRC and the Coalition. </cite></blockquote><p><b>Comment: </b>The school continues to insist that since students have a choice of charter in which to enroll (as opposed to staff assigning them to charters), they are not tracking students. The reality continues to be ability-grouped charters, with their origin in college-prep programs in the middle school years, continuing into college-prep charters in high school. Particularly in math and science, we have witnessed some exceptional teaching, but real signs of integrating the curriculum have been less apparent to us.<p><blockquote><cite>What will the decision-making processes be, and who will have the power? Will shared decision making become the real mechanism for determining the direction or will direction be set by the administration?</cite></blockquote><p><b>Comment: </b>The school has not yet approved by a 75 percent vote the educational plan that would make it a shared decision making/site-based management school. Leadership in the Governing Council continues to be optimistic that this will be achieved. The faculty's participation in budget reduction and in selecting new administrators may help. Certainly, the interim principal has expressed a commitment to this approach.<p><blockquote><cite>What are charters at Forest Park? In what ways are they really different from the earlier academies and programs at the school?</cite></blockquote><p><b>Comment: </b>While the teachers in the charters acknowledge the origin of their sub-schools in the earlier programs, they insist that they have made modifications to adapt them to the principles of the MSRC. Questions remain about tracking and integrated curriculum, which we noted earlier. In addition, the people at Forest Park are still not sure whether ninth-graders should be included in the charters, or whether they should be treated as a separate, transitional group. <p><blockquote><cite>How can people best work together? How can the tone of the school truly be one which values trust and decency?</cite></blockquote><p><b>Comment: </b>There were encouraging signs that progress was being made in achieving qualities such as tone. Teachers worked to keep students in charters, administrators and teachers supported each other in solving problems, and all exhibited caring for the students.<p>	To these earlier questions, we now must add a new challenge:<p><blockquote><cite>How can the people of Forest Park manage the multitude of programs so that they repreresent a coherent program of reform, aimed at improving the learning of all students?</cite></blockquote><p>	In short, how can they be sure the many paths they are following lead in the common direction of better student learning? <p>	One alternative available to them is to use the nine Common Principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools to help them focus their efforts. As they do so, they can build on examples of students using their minds well, which we have observed already--particularly in math and science.<p>	They can concentrate on having high expectations for all students, and not just those who are in advanced classes. They can make better use of their limited resources by concentrating on doing a limited number of things well--on taking advantage of the notion that less can truly be more. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><h3>Notes</h3><ol><li>Each snapshot of Forest Park is based on field notes by two ethnographers: Janet Miller and Neill Wenger.

One student told us, "I feel safe here; it's just when I go outside that I'm afraid." The entire student population receives free breakfast and lunch at the school, with two seatings for breakfast.<p>	Located in the large, eastern city of Jefferson, Forest Park serves approximately one thousand students in grades nine through twelve. A middle school in the same building, under the leadership of the same principal, serves students in grades six through eight. The regional superintendent is also housed here. An elementary school, with separate administration, is housed next door. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fts"><h3>Focusing the Snapshot</h3><p>In the fall of 1993, we returned to Forest Park as part of the School Change Study. From the observations we made and the conversations we had during our visit, we created the following "snapshot." This snapshot attempts to depict life at Forest Park at one point in its process of whole-school change. In addition to giving the researchers and the reader a deeper understanding of school change, the purpose of this snapshot, like that of the previous ones, is to provide a mirror which teachers and administrators at Forest Park can use to help them understand and address the challenges they face. <p>	Unlike the two previous snapshots of the school, this one is based on two data-gathering efforts by Neill Wenger and Barbara S. Powell at Forest Park during the 1993-94 school year--the first in November 1993 and the second in May 1994. During their visits, they observed classes and interviewed students, teachers, administrators, and parents. Documents describing classroom and school-level reform efforts were also collected from the school. In addition, the snapshot also reflects the author's continuing interaction with the city school system. <p>	The snapshot begins with a brief review of the restructuring efforts and district-wide events that have helped define the context of Forest Park High School. The second part of the snapshot focuses on Forest Park--its classrooms, challenges, achievements--in the fall of 1993. The third part focuses on events and instruction at the school the following spring. The snapshot concludes with reflections and questions on central issues facing Forest Park during the spring of 1994. To encourage and guide discussion about the issues raised by these visits, suggested questions, originally provided for the Forest Park staff as well as for the reader, appear after various sections of the snapshot.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tcof"><hr><center><h2>The Context of Forest Park</h2></center><hr>The work of teaching and learning at Forest Park High School takes place within a complex, particularly challenging environment. This environment consists, in part, of a large, urban school system and its accompanying bureaucratic problems, and in part, of a community beset by the monumental burdens of poverty, violence, racism, and other social ills that make educating children monumentally difficult.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="abho"><h3>A Brief History of Restructuring Affecting Forest Park</h3><p>A brief overview of the recent district-wide restructuring efforts that preceded our visits to Forest Park provides a foundation for understanding what it is like to learn and to teach at the school today. <p><h4>MSRC Restructuring Initiatives</h4><p>For four years, Forest Park has been participating in a district-wide, foundation-funded restructuring effort. This effort is overseen by a collaborative we will call the Metropolitan School Restructuring Collaborative (MSRC), which is designed to include district and union leadership. Since 1992, the MSRC has also functioned as a Center for the Coalition and a link with Re:Learning in the state.1<p>	Throughout the city, the main thrust of the MSRC has been to break down schools into smaller units, called charters, which enable the teachers to know and instruct students better. These charters include ninth- to twelfth-graders, heterogeneously grouped, with a career interest as part of the defining characteristics.<p>	By the fall of 1992, Forest Park claimed to be a fully "charterized" school. This meant that all high school students were included in one of the three charters: a Business Academy, a Motivation Program, and a Metropolitan Schools Program. Built around pre-existing ability groups, these charters also provide continuity with existing ability-grouped "houses" that serve grades six to eight.<p>	In some ways, these charters function like sub-schools within Forest Park High School. Each charter has a teacher who acts as charter coordinator. <p><h4>Connections with the Coalition</h4><p>Forest Park's recent efforts at reform have been influenced in part by the school's affiliation with the Coalition of Essential Schools, whose reform efforts are guided by the nine Common Principles. (See Appendix B for a listing of the nine Common Principles.) Forest Park's connection with the Coalition has been limited, however; it has consisted mainly of contacts by a few of its staff at Coalition training sessions at Brown, attendance at the Coalition Fall Forum sessions, and participation in Re:Learning meetings. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="eitd"><h3>Events in the District, 1993-94</h3><p>In the Jefferson school district, the 1993-94 school year was dominated by many problems, as well as several developments related to reform.<p><h4>Challenges Facing the District</h4><p>The resignation of the superintendent in August created a situation that led to conflicts in the extended process of appointing his successor. After the superintendent's resignation, an acting superintendent served the district throughout the year. While the board conducted a national search for a new leader, the board president and other members became increasingly outspoken on day-to-day matters within the district.<p>	In May 1994, as the board narrowed its selection field to a pool of three, conflict erupted between various local officials regarding the selection of a new superintendent. When the mayor and a group of local citizens supported one candidate, while the teachers' union and the administrators' union supported a different one, the board objected that people were interfering with their conduct of an orderly search.<p>	In mid-June, the candidate favored by the mayor was selected by the board to be the next superintendent, ending a dispute that was beginning to have racial overtones.<p>	During the school year, a judge ruled on a long-standing desegregation suit and found that Jefferson's schools had failed to provide education of a satisfactory quality, particularly for its students of color. As she announced the panel to address academic quality in Jefferson, the judge said, <p>	[I tried to] put together a team of experts that I think can come into Jefferson and do what has to be done to develop a plan which will, once and for all, eliminate the disparities in academic achievement and bring about academic quality in the city.2<p>	Financial woes continued for the district, as new cuts of $29 million were called for, on top of the major reductions from the previous year. Credibility of financial projections continued to be a problem for the district when, after projecting a $30 million deficit for 1992-93, the district ended its fiscal year with a $12 million surplus.3<p>	In addition, violence in and around the schools continued to be a major concern in Jefferson, as in other communities around the country.<p><h4>Reform Efforts in the District</h4><p>There were several major actions taken regarding education reform during 1993-94. <p>	The acting superintendent secured school board approval of a twelve-point strategic plan based on work by a community/school task force. She and the board expressed pride in the inclusiveness of the group that developed the recommendations. Among other things, the plan continued work on high school reform, and called for the initiation of collaboration by clusters of schools and the development of full-service schools. People working in schools throughout the city demonstrated little interest in, or awareness of, this plan. In the spring, in efforts to equalize financial support for leaders of charters, the superintendent also announced a controversial reallocation of the money paid for charter coordinators. <p>	Several reform efforts emerged from the office of the assistant superintendent for high schools. The assistant superintendent announced a requirement that all students be enrolled in schools-within-schools by the fall of 1995, and she described those sub-schools using a set of criteria slightly different from that previously used in the district.<p>	For the second year in a row, her office audited existing implementation--an act seen by some as indicating her support for the reform, and by others as an indication that all the central administration can do is check on compliance with rules. Along with the MSRC, her office also took the lead in providing assistance to schools on implementation problems around matters such as rostering classes. <p>	Many changes also occurred within the MSRC. The founding leaders of the MSRC resigned in August 1993, and an acting director was not appointed until midway through the year. A new Teaching and Learning Collaborative was created within the MSRC, and efforts were begun to staff centers that would provide support to schools seeking to implement reforms. One of these centers was located at Forest Park. The MSRC funded a large team from Forest Park and other schools in the district to attend the Coalition of Essential Schools' Fall Forum in Louisville, Kentucky, and continued to work with the Coalition and the state's Re:Learning offices. The MSRC also sponsored several workshops during the year, including a large Celebration of Charters in early spring. Teachers College Press published a book edited by one of the former leaders of the MSRC, which included chapters by teachers and others engaged in reform work in Jefferson. <p>	An independent evaluation agency released a report in March 1994 which noted that the charters being promoted by the MSRC had a positive effect on student attendance and promotion from grade to grade. While the report emphasized continuing implementation problems, it was a big boost for advocates of breaking the high schools into smaller units. <p>	Meanwhile, the union had raised questions about the legitimacy of the board of the MSRC and expressed its continuing resistance to certain elements of the reform plan. The local AFT affiliate objected particularly to the notion of semi-autonomous charters within the schools that might possibly engage in practices that upset long-standing practices, such as seniority rights for teachers and established roles of department heads in high schools. The AFT's objection arose as the MSRC and some of the people working in the schools, in interpreting provisions of the union contract, advocated treating charters as if they were schools. Treating them as such meant that seniority for transfer would be determined by charter rather than by building.<p>	As the year progressed, the acting director of the MSRC had some success in mediating the conflict which had arisen between his organization, administrators in the district, the union, other reform organizations in Jefferson, and the primary funding agency. With the help of the funders, he also made progress in reconstructing the MSRC's board. The district and collaborative had to pay a high price for the time spent resolving (or at least calming) their differences. <p>	Eight ethnographers working in Forest Park and other high schools reported in May 1994 that at each school where they had been, the perception was that there was no support forthcoming from central sources for school-based reform work. Much of this perception may have been created by the extent to which central figures (the MSRC, union, and school district) were concentrating on their own issues rather than on the needs of the school. In any event, progress in reform, which had been stalled the previous year by the inability of the bureaucracy to adapt to a supportive role, continued to be inhibited rather than assisted by many district and school-level administrators.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ptci"><h3>Putting the Context in Perspective</h3><p>As we turn our attention to Forest Park High School, we emphasize that the scenes described here occur as part of the broader ecology of the Jefferson school district. They also occur in a city and in neighborhoods faced with the many, serious social and economic problems confronting urban settings throughout the country.<p>	While organizational and leadership issues dominate the larger school system, teaching, learning, conflict, and survival are the matters of immediate concern to the people in the Forest Park community. While the new leader of the school district will have a potentially significant effect on the direction the system takes, the problems of whether students will attend school and how they will behave when they are at the school are of much more immediate concern to the teachers and administrators of Forest Park. Grand designs about providing social services occupy city planners, but such questions as, How can we help students learn? and, Who will take care of the children of the children who are attending the school? are real ones for those at Forest Park.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="f1993"><hr><center><h2>Events at Forest Park: Fall 1993 </h2></center><hr>In the fall of 1993, Forest Park High School was marked by several serious challenges, as well as by signs of progress. In addition to coping with the loss of many teachers and administrators through early retirement, the school faced the ongoing problems of assuring safety for its students. Amidst these challenges were signs of progress in instruction in the charters. Still, reform efforts at Forest Park were hindered by a lack of the necessary support from the district and by problems within the school itself in moving ahead with reforms in decision-making practices.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="at"><h3>Administrative Transitions</h3><p>Two thousand educators responded throughout the state school system to a state-sponsored, early-retirement incentive program. At Forest Park, fifteen of the 110 teachers who served students in grades six through twelve retired. While the new principal, Patti Snow, expressed her concerns about the loss of institutional memory created by the departure of so many senior educators, Forest Park seemed less affected by the retirements than did some of the other schools in the system. <p>	One reason why the transition at Forest Park may have been smoother than at some of the other schools was that the principal and her assistants had both been at the school during previous years. Patti had finished 1992-93 as the acting principal, after the principal had taken a career-ending, midyear sabbatical. One assistant principal continued in her role from the previous year, while the other had been promoted from a teacher-leadership position within the school. <p>	One of the faculty members described the leadership transition as follows:<p>	Patti was acting principal; now she's the principal. So, we know who our principal is. We know that we were going to be going through some changes. We joked about retiring together. So I'm planning to have at least three to five years of the same person. Which is good. It kind of gives us a sense of knowing where we are headed.4<p>	And the vice principal is Andy Washington. He's "acting" or "interim" because everybody's "interim" for a year. But we all know Andy. Andy's been in the school for I don't know how many years--six years, whatever. So we all know Andy. So that's a sense of, "Good--we know the person, so we know who we're dealing with." So in that sense, I feel secure. <p>	Also, even though we seem to have our fingers in twenty pots, I'm more comfortable with the pots now because I know what they are. And I feel like I'm having a chance to deal with what we started.<p>	This continuity was advanced by an inclusive process of selecting the new principal. Among those taking part in the screening for the position was the president of the Forest Park Alumni Association, who participated in interviews and interacted with parents of current students. <p>	Because she knew her school, Patti was able to begin the year with three definite goals in mind. 	She described her first priority as follows:<p>	Number one: School safety and security. We had a lot of problems in the beginning of the year. They were out on the street, not so much with our kids, but with the bums and thugs who either I had transferred or who had just dropped out of school before. We're talking about guns and shootings and robberies and all that. I mean, I must be up to my fifty-fifth serious incident report to the central office.<p>	Her second goal was to influence instruction. Even though many people participate in workshops and read materials, she sees "too much of the old stuff with the reading of a chapter and answering the questions at the end of the book." <p>	Patti's third goal was to learn to delegate, and learn to plan and organize meetings more effectively so she could deal with the problems of keeping up with everything she was expected to do. Two school-district offices supervise Forest Park because it is both a high school and a middle school. This dual reporting relationship expands the paperwork for the principal.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="pis"><h3>Progress in Safety</h3><p>As in other urban centers, safety issues were foremost in the minds of leaders in many of Jefferson's high schools. Leadership continuity and clear focus on the issue of safety seem to have had a positive influence on this problem at Forest Park. In a comment one frequently hears in urban high schools, the principal, Patti Snow, told us, "Well for a lot of our kids, this is the <cite>only </cite>safe place for them. And, they want to keep it that way. This is a haven. That's something that <cite>has </cite>to be worked on daily."<p>	The students do seem to appreciate the concerted attention on safety. Consider the following comments when a group was asked what they would tell students who don't come to Forest Park about their school: <p>Deidre:<blockquote> There are a lot of stereotypes.</blockquote>Hillary (and others):<blockquote> Yeah.</blockquote>Alicia:<blockquote> I know a girl who goes to Rhodes [another school], and she was, like, "I'm scared to come down. I'm scared to go to Forest Park because I might be beat up."</blockquote>Hillary:<blockquote> I heard a student beat up a teacher at Rhodes.</blockquote>Alicia:<blockquote> But when she came down here, she was shocked because it was nothing like she thought it was.</blockquote>Interviewer:<blockquote> What was it like?</blockquote>Alicia:<blockquote> Calm and cool.</blockquote>Terry:<blockquote> It's like more of a family. You get to know more of your teachers and they care about you. </blockquote>Edie:<blockquote> My girl friend, she came from City Learning Center [another school], and she was, like, "Your school is so clean!" Some schools look all dark and dull, and, like, the Learning Center, some of them just look like a jail cell. </blockquote>Interviewer:<blockquote> Some schools I've been in, there have been gangs of people who come in off the street, get into the school, and roam the halls.</blockquote>Alicia:<blockquote> No, not here.</blockquote>Deidre:<blockquote> Every year our security gets tighter and tighter.</blockquote>Alicia:<blockquote> A lot of the reputation that Forest Park has earned--it wasn't in general the school itself, but it was the neighborhood of the school because a lot of the kids around here were in trouble because they weren't attending school.</blockquote>Edie:<blockquote> And most of the violence that happens, happens outside school.</blockquote>	In short, the students see their school as clean, calm, and cool, while acknowledging that the common view in the city of Jefferson would be different from theirs.<p>	The principal's cabinet met during our visit in November 1993. The discipline issues they discussed reinforced our notion that progress was being made on the principal's first goal. Some worried that teachers were allowing students to eat in their rooms, while others were concerned about student traffic patterns in hallways during lunch. An assistant principal worried that some teachers were sending students to the office for such infractions as chewing gum or failing to have a pencil.<p>	Most of these problems sound more like those typical of a suburban high school in the 1950s than the issues of personal safety commonly talked about in contemporary urban high schools. <p>	This apparent progress on safety did not happen accidentally. The principal and some of the teachers told us about various steps that had been taken, ranging from two metal-detector searches of all students (during which no significant weapons were found) to tight controls over entrances and exits to the school.<p>	Each day, the principal made sure any signs of graffiti were eliminated early in the morning, and she encouraged teachers to make their presence known by standing in their hallways. Patti also devoted much attention to building a sense of community around the school. This included generating attendance at parent meetings, and then working enthusiastically with those parents present.<p>	At a parents' night on November 15, 1993, Patti greeted the parents with assurances that Forest Park was one of the safest schools in the city. She then turned the floor over to a police captain, who described his efforts to build a safe corridor through the neighborhoods for the students to use on their way to and from school. As Patti had asked teachers to help in the hallways, the police captain asked parents to support police in this effort. <p>	As of November, it was clear that no one believed the issue of student safety could be ignored. However, at the same time, there were definite signs that a reasonable level of control had been achieved that permitted staff and students alike to focus on other issues affecting education at Forest Park.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="aoot"><h3>An Overview of the Instructional Programs</h3><p>The relatively safe environment has permitted more attention to instruction, Patti's second priority. Forest Park takes advantage of many different programs that are available from the outside to help improve instruction. <p>	As we observed in the 1992-93 snapshots of the school, there may be so many different programs that schoolwide or even charter-wide focus is harmed.5 In the fall, we received a five-page "Glossary of Programs and Terms" that had been prepared to inform the faculty as well as visitors about the various projects under way at Forest Park. While some of the change efforts relate to governance or to structural aspects of the school, many are directly tied to instruction. <p>	Forest Park takes advantage of two local nonprofit groups--MSRC and Humanities/Sciences. Besides helping to create the charters, the MSRC also created a center at Forest Park to help teachers there and at other schools in Jefferson learn to use "family groups." These groups provide a weekly advisory program in which approximately fifteen students are assigned to work with staff members, who become an advocate for the students in the group. Every Thursday, meetings of these small groups are provided for all students. A number of the other programs at Forest Park are available to teachers and students, because of the school's affiliation with one or the other of these nonprofit agencies. <p><h4>Subject-area Programs</h4><p>A number of the programs at the school concentrate on subject areas. <p>	There are two externally supported projects in math, for example. The math department chair leads both efforts. One is an algebra project, which is connected with the MSRC for funding purposes, and which has been under way for several years. The other project, the Interactive Mathematics Program, is tied with a national office in California, and involves several Jefferson schools through funding given to the other nonprofit school reform group in the city. <p>	Several projects focus on science. The one which receives the most attention is Science Force 2000--an upper-level science class designed to help students prepare for science careers through science fair competitions. Students from this class have won many scholarships and produced a great deal of favorable attention for Forest Park. <p>	One external support system, the Comprehensive Regional Center for Minorities, gives attention to students in math and science. One of its projects supports minorities from universities and industry who teach in tandem with science teachers at Forest Park. This group receives its funding through the same nonprofit reform agency in Jefferson that supports the Interactive Mathematics Program--an agency which, on occasion, seems to compete with the MSRC for resources and faculty attention. <p><h4>Interdisciplinary and Social Service Programs</h4><p>Several of the initiatives at Forest Park emphasize interdisciplinary studies. For example, an ecology/environmental science team for ninth-graders combines attention to English, world culture, and environmental science. <p>	Other Forest Park programs aim at improving the transition of students from school to college or work by creating specially designed instruction and other activities. Several of the programs emphasize preparation for prospective scientists, technicians, and engineers. Some have a career focus, such as the Business Academy, which is linked with office work, and an architect project, which links seventh- and ninth-graders with a local firm. A full-time aide at the school is funded through a program initiated by the MSRC to help students with college access planning. The Education for Employment Program, supported with federal Perkins funds, helps prepare students for employment through apprenticeships it arranges with community businesses. <p>	A number of the initiatives at Forest Park, such as the Student Assistance Program (SAP), School Support Team (SST), and the conflict resolution project, attempt to help student learning by providing access to social services. Some of these initiatives engage students in learning by having the students give service themselves. One program, known as Community Service, allows student to receive credit for services such as tutoring or working in nursing homes, hospitals, and other agencies. Another, known as the Literacy Corps, gives students service-learning credits for helping elementary students and working with "life-skills" students. Still another program, Reachback, links the school and community through a basketball league and tutoring. <p><h4>Continuing Work on Instructional Development</h4><p>The school identifies itself as affiliated with the Coalition of Essential Schools and with Re:Learning in the state. It is also a target school in the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development's High School Futures Consortium. Through this connection, Forest Park High School is one of twenty-four schools throughout the country that work on a five-year plan to improve organization, staff development, curriculum, and technology.<p><h4>Reflections on the Instructional Programs</h4><p>As should be evident from the preceding recitation of programs, not all of the initiatives complement each other. With outside assistance, focus on a specific subject may interfere with the development of interdisciplinary curriculum. Attention to the most able students in selective classes in math and science and in charters aimed at prospective college students may take resources away from truly heterogeneous efforts within the school or in other settings.<p>	Developmental efforts seem to be associated more with supporting services for students or with progress in various disciplines than with the development of more comprehensive reforms, such as those envisioned by the MSRC, the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, or the Coalition of Essential Schools and Re:Learning.<p>	The presence of multiple, centrally administered programs at Forest Park complicates change efforts. Teachers working with externally funded projects in math, science, and other fields get their direction from the central leaders of these projects and frequently seem to identify more closely with the project than with the school. As project and program leaders from the central administration and various nonprofit agencies contact teachers directly to involve them in in-service activities, provide instructional materials, or make suggestions concerning teaching approaches, they create a dual supervision condition for teachers that has some similarity with the problem faced by the principal.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="icc"><h3>Instruction: Classroom Close-ups</h3><p>During our fall visit we saw some lively classes in a variety of subject areas, including science, math, English, business, and information processing.<p><h4>Science Force 2,000</h4><p>Students were using data from a previous year's student project to study the scientific method. As students read off data, Mr. Butler entered it on a table displayed on the overhead projector. He then asked the students what kind of charts--line or graph--they would use to display such information most effectively. The fifteen boys and eight girls in the class discussed ways to report data. They addressed such questions as which form would best allow interpolation, what scale would be best for graphs, and which of the variables was independent and which was dependent. <p>	On the surface, this was a fairly conventional class. The teacher was in front with an overhead projector, and the students were responding to his questions. However, more careful examination reveals that there was more here than is frequently seen in classes. Students were working intently to understand the material. They were initiating questions, as well as responding to inquiry from the teacher. For example, one asked, "Can we interpolate now, even if we don't have a value we can interpolate?" Another caught a mistake that Mr. Butler made in a calculation. With hints from the teacher, the students worked out among themselves the best way to label the axis in the graph. <p>	Repeated observations of this class indicate that Mr. Butler establishes a comfortable, yet demanding, climate. Students know they are expected to complete their homework, to engage in discussions, and to raise questions--and they do. <p><h4>Math</h4><p>Twenty-seven of the thirty-five students enrolled were present when we visited Sarah Kemp's class. On the surface, this also was a conventional class. However, in the middle of a linear approach--review homework, present lesson related to new idea, assign student work, assignment of new homework--there was a different relationship between teacher and student and more variations in student activities than are found in the typical classroom. The students flipped coins and rolled dice as they collected data and tested their own predictions. The activities helped the students understand statistical concepts. Their text asked them to consider some questions beyond computation or recall of facts. One question, for example, was, "Evaluate this experiment. Does it test what it is supposed to test? How should it be changed?" <p>	The students in this class are responsible for maintaining portfolios which include their best work. They work in randomly assigned groups intended to facilitate cooperative learning. Students listen carefully when Ms. Kemp speaks. She refers to herself as "Mother," a name students are apt to use also. She has clear expectations for the students. Students know their assignments. As observers, we did not get as many clues from the students in this class as from the science class.<p><h4>Algebra</h4><p>Charlie Mitchell has a class of twenty students, about a dozen of whom show up on any single day. Although this is supposed to be an algebra class, he said he has to concentrate on the basic skills, because students shouldn't get into algebra until they can at least add, subtract, multiply, and divide.<p>	Mr. Mitchell told how he works with the students who have trouble in algebra:<p>	Basic skills, how to multiply, how to divide, number facts. By constantly drilling and drilling, some of the students now are beginning to get the process. It's sort of like one of those nine things [nine Common Principles] where you teach a skill and you teach it until they get it. Finally some of them are starting to get it, and it flows over into our [study of] percent, and we're always referring back to it. Now they are more proficient.<p><h4>Math</h4><p>In Ms. Simmons' math class we observed nineteen ninth- and tenth-grade students in a math enrichment program for the Motivation Charter. These students were using worksheets with algebraic equations, ratios, and proportions. Ms. Simmons encouraged students to work in groups, but they didn't. As the students worked, she moved around the room, checking answers and helping those who were off track. She told us that the enrichment class helps prepare students to deal with math in the format they can expect to see on the SAT. According to Ms. Simmons, the school's SAT scores have risen; however, students are not offered trigonometry or calculus courses. <p><h4>English, Business Academy</h4><p>Helen O'Conner told us she went out on a limb by assigning <cite>Waiting to Exhale</cite>, by Terry MacMillan, to her seniors. She said only one girl was not permitted to read the book, after the parents were informed of the reading selection. Ms. O'Connor's juniors read <cite>A Time to Kill </cite>by John Grisham. She likes to have the students study contemporary novels. <p>	She described a class in which the students did an "Oprah Winfrey show with a set of panelists, who were the characters in the novel, with the rest of the class acting as the studio audience, asking questions of the panelists." We had the opportunity to watch that class. We saw the student depicting Oprah, clad in a white, embroidered blouse and black pants, use a ball-point pen for a mike as she moved swiftly about the room, taking questions from the audience and probing characters on the panel for their motivations and true feelings.<p>Oprah <cite>[thrusting her pen-mike under the chin of a panelist]</cite>:<blockquote> Russell, you have a baby and another on the way. Do you feel more responsible?</blockquote>Russell:<blockquote> That's nature.</blockquote>Oprah:<blockquote> Does your wife know you are having a baby--with Robin?</blockquote>Student:<blockquote> My question is for Robin. Do you think if you kept the baby you'd be closer to Russell? </blockquote><cite>[Robin equivocates.]</cite></blockquote>Student:<blockquote> Why don't you use protection?</blockquote>Russell:<blockquote> I use protection, just not with Robin.</blockquote>	And so the show continues, with the student panelists, Oprah, and the class alternately revealing their knowledge of the text and interest in the topics it treats.<p>	Ms. O'Connor also told us that she has used a red packet of materials developed by a university professor retained as a consultant by the MSRC. She told the class about several African-American authors, including Frederick Douglas and Harriet Jacobs, and the students listed similarities and differences between them. For homework, she had asked students to pick one of the authors and tell why they might like to be that person. Helen told us what one girl wrote about Harriet Jacobs, a slave who lived in secret in the attic of a shed for seven years so she could be near her children. <p>	This little girl wrote the most glowing paragraph on Harriet Jacobs. I was just caught. She really caught the essence of what Harriet endured. This girl captured it. She wrote, "I understand why she slept with Mr. Sands. Part of it was right and part of it was wrong. She did it deliberately so she wouldn't have to sleep with her master, so that she would annoy him; he wouldn't be the first." I'm sold, because this is a difficult piece of writing.<p>	Ms. O'Connor was not sure the students would understand why Harriet chose to sleep with one white man as opposed to the other white man. Ms. O'Connor also explained to us how she, the social studies teacher, and the teacher within their charter who teaches word processing have worked together on various assignments. While some of the math and science instruction seems disconnected from charters, this instance showed some progress at Forest Park in developing curriculum for specific charters.<p><h4>Information-processing</h4><p>Ms. Cutter, who teaches information-processing in the same academy, began her class by having students write in their journals. She then switched to the main class activity, an exercise on centering and underlining, using an IBM word-processing package. The class was well organized and students were held to definite standards of correctness in their word-processing exercise. Throughout the period they stayed on task, helped and encouraged by the teacher, who circulated among the students as they worked. <p>	The class meets early because many of the students in the business charter have jobs for part of the day. The student with the highest grades in the school was enrolled in this 7:40 a.m. class. He arrived dressed in a white shirt, dark pants, and tie, ready for his afternoon job in a bank.<p>	Another teacher in this charter worked with a student who had use of only one arm to help the student make effective use of a keyboard. In essence, a new system was devised to permit the student to "touch-type" with his single hand.<p><h4>English, Motivation Charter</h4><p>In Motivation, a charter identified as being for "the college-prep students," we talked with Rhonda Stark, an English teacher. She told us she had asked her students to compare the role of a leader and the code of conduct in <cite>Beowulf's </cite>time and in today's school. She stressed her love for taking "canonical pieces" and helping students to see their relevancy. <p>	In one of her classes we watched while thirty students studied Chaucer's <cite>Wife of Bath</cite>. A fair amount of the teacher's yelling seemed necessary to maintain the attention of the students who, in variously color-coded groups, had been assigned to interpret selected passages from the text. <p>	Ms. Stark shared some examples of assignments she asked her English 4 students from the Motivation charter to complete.<p>Due Thursday, November 4:<p>	In response to Lorene Cary's <cite>Black Ice</cite>, describe the significance of the sports metaphor at the end of the excerpt. One-page minimum, more is always welcomed for those who are not faint of heart. Option #2 is to describe the social, cultural, and economic differences Lorene observes concerning teenagers of privilege and those denied access to privilege.<p>Due Tuesday, November 9:<p>	In response to Bebe Moore Campbell's <cite>Sweet Summer</cite>, describe an incident from your youth when either you, a friend, or a classmate defied a rule or custom in order to assert pride in your culture. More is better, minimum is a page.<p>Due Friday, November 12:<p>	In response to John Edgar Wideman's <cite>Brothers and Keepers </cite>(one of my favorite books), describe the way the resolution of family conflicts may permanently influence and/or impair children. Begin your essay by analyzing the events in the excerpt, then comment on practices you have observed in your own life. Finally, make some recommendations about effective ways to handle anger and frustration that will resolve conflicts rather than exacerbate them. Two- to three-page minimum.<p>Due Wednesday, November 24:<p>	You are writing an excerpt from your own life which will be included in the next publication of <cite>Growing Up Black</cite>. Describe a pivotal, illuminating, or powerful experience that you think should be included in the proposed, new volume. The publisher has requested no less than a four-page minimum. <p><h4>Other Classes</h4><p>A social studies teacher in the Motivation Charter jousted with her students throughout the period as she tried to get them to correct a test, show interest in some issues of race relations, consider rough drafts of essays that were due soon, and read from a large anthology. <p>	In the library, we had a chance to watch as some local architects helped student participants in the architecture project understand how design variations can affect the look and feel of something, such as the pocket park they were working on. Students showed interest in the project and expressed concern over the recent appearance of graffiti on the wall at their site. After a brief lecture from the architects, the students, using standard design symbols for trees, bushes, and other objects, worked in pairs to fill in an outline of their park. During our observation, we could not see how this work was tied to other aspects of the schooling for these students. Eventually, as these ninth-graders build the park they are designing, the connections between classes may become more evident.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="iqfc"><table border><tr><td><h3>Instruction:Questions for Consideration</h3><p><ol><li>What do these glimpses into the classes at Forest Park suggest their interpretation of the nine Common Principles to be?

Both teachers and students were moved around during this period. One teacher told us how difficult it is in this situation for the kids to make sense of what is happening in class:<p>	When I get a kid today, and a kid tomorrow, and I'm still getting kids--like, today, you know, it's been a bad day for me because I'm going from place to place [topic to topic] and it's not the kid's fault . . . because the kids are all starting out, so they don't know themselves.<p>	Other teachers saw problems stemming from the district's and union's inability to develop contract provisions that give schools more control over personnel decisions and place less reliance on seniority.<p>	Some people at Forest Park expressed their belief that the district administrators do not fully understand the school's condition. For example, one person at Forest Park told us,<p>	They don't talk to us. They sat downtown, the bureaucrats did. They sat downtown and made some of the rules and decisions instead of coming out to the school to talk to the people in the school about "How do you think this should be done?" And I think that is the problem. They work from the outside and make decisions, instead of getting it from the people that are right here at the grass roots of the situation. <p>	One problem with district support at Forest Park emerges from the dual reporting relationship the principal faces as the head of a high school and a middle school located in the same building. Sometimes, when resources can be obtained from both offices, this works to the advantage of the school. Often it simply adds to the complexity of the decision-making process for the school. <p>	Some problems with the support mechanisms of the district are mundane, but frustrating for teachers. For example, a teacher from the Business Academy told about difficulties getting the proper equipment. She described to us what had happened when she had ordered switch boxes to facilitate the sharing of her twelve printers with the twenty-four computers in her classroom:<p>	But what happened is the ordering people downtown sent me the wrong cables, male-to-male; they won't take them back. I have thirty male-to-male cables for Macs. I have been calling. I have been talking. The people in charge will not help me. The people downtown will not take them back. Nobody will take them back. So this year I have no money to reorder. So I'm stuck with them.<p>	Such problems with obtaining supplies seem to have been exacerbated by the early retirements in Jefferson. In some instances, people at Forest Park High School don't know who has what specific responsibilities in the central office; in other cases, people in the central administration don't know their new jobs as well as the people they have replaced. <p>	Other stories were told of district policies that do not permit students to be bused on local expressways. Such policies make it more difficult for teachers to gain the most from field trips or to share efficiently with schools at other sites. Such policies posed particular problems for Forest Park teachers' efforts to take advantage of vocational offerings.<p>	From teachers and administrators at Forest Park, as well as from staff at other schools, come complaints about paperwork and other interruptions that interfere with their ability to work together to develop improvements. One said,<p>	We have paperwork--paperwork that needs to go downtown. Someone comes to talk with us about this or that project, to talk about AIDS, to talk about the staff organization. But they still do not give me time as a teacher to talk to someone I need to talk to.<p>	Another teacher commented, "Our team meetings were devoted to discipline problems, this paperwork, that paperwork. We haven't really had time to sit down and say, 'Here are the nine Common Principles.'"<p>	An administrator responded to paperwork burdens by noting,<p>	I spend hours just trying to do the paperwork. We are sometimes under constraints--very short constraints. Sometimes we'll get--I don't know what happens--the mail; they say we have to have something downtown tomorrow. <p>	People at Forest Park do have ideas about how the central officials can be more supportive of their work. For example, one person suggested that central officials should come and visit their school and the classrooms, as the principals and assistant principals at Forest Park do. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tufo"><h3>The Unclear Future of Governance</h3><p>	Like many school districts in the country, Jefferson wants to develop school-based management. In the fall, Forest Park continued its efforts to become a school-based management site within Jefferson. The MSRC had provided some assistance to the school in this effort. Some district leaders have viewed school-based management and shared decision-making as a means of strengthening the commitment of school people to the changes which need to be made. <p>	In order to promote change, the district and the union agreed that schools which approve a plan for future innovation by a 75 percent vote will be allowed to follow certain decision-making practices and, supposedly, have more autonomy. Forest Park's faculty failed to achieve the 75 percent approval needed to implement the educational plan developed by the planning team to become one such "letter-of-intent" school.<p>	In the report we wrote following our second visit to the school in spring 1993, we asked, "What will the decision-making processes be, and who will have the power? Will shared decision making become the real mechanism for determining direction, or will direction be sent by the administration?"6 In November 1993 the questions were still not answered.<p>	The school makes much use of informal networks for decision making. These networks are built in part on the relationships between people working on many different projects in the building with colleagues in other buildings and in support agencies. These networks serve as a vehicle for decision making about a number of important instructional and student-service questions. Similarly, within the building, colleagues who are members of teaching teams, departments, houses, and charters carry out conversations through which they resolve many other questions. Still, the nature of formal governance processes remains unclear.<p>	While he was working as a teacher, assistant principal Andy Washington headed the school's interim Governing Council. During our visit, he was visibly impatient with ongoing conversations which seemed to replicate earlier deliberations. 	Some teacher-leaders were openly hostile toward the notion of shared decision making. Influenced by a union which was raising doubts, and by the experiences of other schools that had voted successfully to make decisions "school-based," only to find little benefit, faculty were beginning to question the value to the school of this step. One opponent explained his position: <p>	The people who have decided we should go the route of school-based management haven't given us the wherewithal to carry it out. When are we going to have time to meet with the principal, to hash out things, to do the work needed for making a decision or writing up a program?<p>	Several staff members seemed concerned that pursuing consensus on decisions was impractical. They sensed that they were simply being required to perform additional work without compensation. Others on the staff expressed support, but raised reservations such as the following: "I still believe in shared-decision, school-based management. But I think <cite>what </cite>decisions are to be made has to be defined. What can be done?" <p>	Beyond the question of what decisions the Governing Council should make, the issue which seemed to be uppermost for the interim Council in the fall of 1993 was, "Who is responsible for the ultimate decision making at the school?" <p>	The principal, who makes extensive use of consultation in her decision-making processes, clearly believed the ultimate responsibility belonged to her. She cited as an example the "allotments." She displayed a two-inch-thick document given to her on Friday and required by the district on Monday. To make her point, she asked, rhetorically, "Is the Governing Council going to meet with me over the weekend to work on it? I am responsible for getting it in, not the Council." Of course, another question that could be asked is whether anyone should be responsible for a request made in such an untimely manner.<p>	Timeliness of decision making joined with authority for decision making as a key issue at Forest Park. For example, at the end of a Governing Council meeting, Patti asked the members what they had planned for <cite>their </cite>faculty meeting later in the week. All seemed to have forgotten that they had demanded a whole faculty meeting to lay out the Council's position on the school-based management issue. For those members who wanted to make sure the Council was the last point in the chain of command, this simple question about what planning they had done seemed to be a devastating blow to their arguments. As one person put it, "Somebody has put us in an impossible position"--to which another replied, "I think it is us."<p>	By the end of our visit in the fall of 1993, the future form of governance in the school was still not clear. The new principal was engaging her cabinet and other groups in providing advice to a greater degree than they had before. Some of the functions of the Governing Council seemed to be capably performed by an after-school cabinet meeting. The letter of intent to become a school-based management school, which had been filed by Forest Park with the joint district and union committee, was to expire in December, and it appeared that there might never be a vote by the faculty at large.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="gqfc"><table border><tr><td><h3>Governance:Questions for Consideration</h3><p><ol><li>Other than the one suggestion offered, how could central support be changed to be more useful to the school?<p><li>What conditions would have to be satisfied in Forest Park for the school to embrace shared decision making and school-based management?

These issues concerned transitions in leadership, safety, classroom instruction, district support for reform, and governance. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="til"><h3>Transitions in Leadership</h3><p>For the most part, the leadership transition that began with promise in the fall of 1993 continued successfully in the spring of 1994. One veteran teacher shared her positive feelings about Forest Park:<p>	Keep in mind that we are a hidden secret here at Forest Park. People are not aware of the talent of our young people, our teachers. It's beauty in the school and a lot of warmth. That message needs to be gotten across. We have students with great minds. They just need to be tapped. We have a very innovative and creative principal. I can go to her with various ideas, and she gives me the latitude and support to go ahead.<p>	During our spring visit, we received additional testimony that the smoothness of the transition at Forest Park was related to the long tenure of some key people. Not only the administrators and charter leaders had prior experience; the lead security guard had been at the school for more than ten years, and the dean of discipline also had long tenure. In all cases, one of the relevant consequences of this tenure was that the people at the school <cite>knew </cite>the students. <p>	As is inevitably the case in a school of this size, the new administration had its detractors and supporters by the end of the year. Some still thought an African-American should have been appointed principal. Some teachers felt that the administrators intruded too much into their classroom life, and others applauded them for their interest in the classroom. Some students felt the administration was too strict, but others vehemently disagreed.<p>	All in all, the new team at Forest Park was well in place and thinking about its priorities for the future.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="apor"><h3>A Place of "Reasonable" Safety</h3><p>One teacher, who had recently returned from taking her students to a play only to find all her car windows broken in the school parking lot, said she felt "reasonably safe" at Forest Park. She attributed much of this feeling to being well-known in the neighborhood.<p>	Students also testified that they continued to see Forest Park as a safer school than others. One contrasted Forest Park with Hamilton, her former school:<p>	It's totally different. At Hamilton people were competing to see who could fight the best. It was a predominantly white school. Here it's friends help friends. We're competing for grades. <p>Another student who had come directly from elementary school said, "Contrary to its reputation, I think Forest Park doesn't have that much violence." A third student added, "I feel safe in this school. It's like a home away from home. <cite>Everybody knows each other</cite>. Sometimes I would rather be at school than at home." <cite>[Emphasis added.] </cite>One senior, who had *spent four years at Forest Park, told us, <p>	I think my first year at Park, it was kind of bad, as far as the violence and stuff. But after that, eighth grade or whatever, it wasn't violent. And now there's no violence in here; there are better programs.<p> <p>	It may not be entirely a coincidence that the principal reform efforts in Jefferson have spanned this same four-year period. One of the school's administrators echoed these positive comments:<p>	The students feel pretty safe here. We don't have real complaints about the kids being harassed by anyone, so they're pretty safe coming to school. They're pretty safe when they're in school. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="inst"><h3>Instruction</h3><p>The most important question that remains is whether this school, with its recent successful leadership transition and its relative safety, provides a rich learning environment for students. <p><h4>The Science Force 2,000 Program</h4><p>During our brief spring visit, we gathered evidence of exemplary student learning through the Science Force 2,000 program. As a result of the dedicated work of the teacher in this interdisciplinary program, only two magnet schools in Jefferson have produced more winners in regional science fair competitions. Evaluated by alternative forms of assessment, students in the program receive credits in English, health, mathematics, keyboarding, and information processing, as well as in science. During the summer of 1994, high school students from the program will mentor middle school students who will be doing research, writing papers, designing experiments, organizing data with computers, and constructing display boards. Using strategies likely unforeseen by the originators of the Coalition's aphorism of "teacher-as-coach," the teacher in this program is using his star students to reach down and help prepare the science scholars of tomorrow.<p><h4>The College Prep Charter's Quilt Project</h4><p>The College Prep Charter, in the middle school at Forest Park, engaged students in a quilt project modeled after a project described by Judy Logan.7 The eighth-graders assigned to this team sewed quilt squares to help them tell the story of important black women. Other boys and girls sewed squares that helped tell the stories of contemporary local figures, such as a popular newscaster, neighbors and relatives, and, in some instances, of historical figures they had researched in the library. Eventually, women from the community were to help them combine the patches into a full quilt. <p>	During an early phase of the project, students visited a local museum to see an exhibit of quilts. As they sewed, they continued to work on companion oral and written reports about the subject of their research. Rosa Parks was represented by several bright squares featuring buses and roses. Many students had chosen grandmothers or other relatives, and one patch was being sewn in honor of one of the teachers within the team. One student, who had selected Madame C. J. Walker, was appliquéing a dollar sign on her square, commemorating her accomplishment as the first black woman millionaire. <p>	As the students worked, the teachers were busy helping them with their research, working on their own patches, and documenting the project through slides, videotape, and photographs. While all students seemed deeply engaged in the projects, some boys were still sensitive about their peers' reactions to their newfound skills in sewing, and urged teachers who displayed pictures of the project to omit the scenes in which they were busy with their stitchery. Describing the students at work, one member of the team said,<p>	What I've seen is a community of learners within that room. Students, for example, who maybe usually don't come in and do a lot of communicating, they're there, they're sewing. And they're talking. You know? Like those old-fashioned sewing bees?<p><h4>The Challenge of Finding a Focus</h4><p>As we had the prior year, we observed in the fall that the school was having difficulty keeping a clear focus, given the rather large number of different programs in which faculty and administration were participating. In the spring, one teacher-leader commented, "I would recommend not too many changes at one time. That was our mistake. We had a finger in every pie. Every program that was coming down the pike, we'd say, 'We'll try that.'" Such comments pose dilemmas for leaders, because sometimes they are legitimate warnings that only so many things can be taken on at once. Other times they are excuses used by people who want to do nothing. <p>	The Forest Park principal, Patti Snow, was aware of this issue when she identified instruction as a main goal in the fall. By spring, she could report progress in this area, in which she had turned a problem into an opportunity. Also, she could report what for her was an important revelation about her own role in relation to the instructional program. <p><h4>Changing the Focus of Charters</h4><p>In the fall, all students had been assigned to one of four charters: Motivation, Metropolitan, Business Academy, or Tech/prep. However, since the district failed to provide the vocational programming in the way that had been counted on for continuation of the Tech/prep Charter, Patti determined that each of the three remaining charters would include a technology emphasis. Also, she concentrated on developing a career emphasis within each of the charters. <p>	Several factors contributed to the decision to add the career focus. First, the existing charters were derivatives of long-standing tracking policies. By introducing engineering and technology to the Motivation Charter, the pre-college track, Patti hoped to encourage a broader range of students, including those headed for technical careers that do not require a four-year college.<p>	Similarly, by emphasizing the Coalition Principles and including law and justice career preparation in the Metropolitan Charter, Patti planned to upgrade the charter so that it would be attractive to students making a range of post-secondary plans, from law school to the armed forces. In addition, the district provided a $50,000 planning grant from federal Perkins funds to enable the school to plan this integrated vocational program.<p>	In conjunction with this shift in the focus of the charters in the high school, Patti and her assistants were working to de-track the middle school, build more comprehensive houses, and encourage closer working relationships between the high school and the middle school faculty.<p>	Patti said she enjoys working on charter development, classroom observations, and other instructionally related activities. As the year progressed, however, she reported that much of her time had been taken up with the kinds of activities that had engaged her predecessor. Then, one spring day, talking with another Jefferson principal who was actively engaged with the MSRC and Coalition reform efforts helped her see the need to refocus her work. She described this realization:<p>	I've been spending 50 percent of my day on building and facilities. I hate building and facilities. That's not why I became a principal. Here I'm looking at this boiler and figuring out how to get the water to stop coming in from the yard. We had this big flood in one of the electrical rooms during one of the snowstorms. And the guy who's in charge of all this is telling me I need a sump pump and I'm saying, "No. It's leaking from the yard. A sump pump is not going to help; it's not coming up, it's coming down." And I went out and I got the thing--and made them go up and fix it and it's been working ever since. And that gives me a certain amount of satisfaction. But, that's not my perception of what I should be doing.<p>	That's not why I became a principal. I like curriculum. I like instruction. I like kids. I like staff development. I like to say, "All right; this is where we are and this is where we want to be." You can't do that with a boiler. It's there.<p>	And I finally realized, after talking with this other principal, and after going through all this stuff, that the reason I do facilities, and building, and security, is because my predecessor did. That was my <cite>ah-ha </cite>moment. And somehow, in my mind, it had never occurred to me that I'm the principal now and I can do whatever I want. I don't have to do building and facilities. <p>	By the time we left, one of the assistant principals was about to obtain the opportunity to worry about boilers and related matters. As Patti began looking forward to next year, she started to think of ways to realize her desire to emphasize technology, so she planned to place a computer on her own desk and invite others to help learn how to use it with her. She also began to think about new ways to increase the unification of the middle and high schools, including taking steps to make the assistants' roles encompass the entire building,  rather than having one of them assigned as the middle school assistant and the other as the assistant for the high school program. Success in this action was dependent on her securing permission from the district to broaden such responsibilities (permission that had been denied as of the end of the 1993-94 year).<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="idac"><h3>Insufficient District and Central Support</h3><p>One of the most telling comments about central support for Forest Park in the spring of 1993, one that was <cite>not </cite>made by anyone at the school, is that the experience that helped the principal to clarify her role occurred as a result of an accidental conversation with a peer.8 The office with responsibility for central support of high schools is stretched so thin that it does not have the personnel that are needed to help the large number of new principals and assistants in Jefferson.<p>	Generally, teachers and administrators testified that little assistance was forthcoming from central sources. Although Forest Park has more external connections (and resources) than most of the comprehensive high schools in Jefferson, the union and central administration are largely viewed as rule makers and enforcers rather than as supporters. Even though the MSRC has a center for family-group programs in the school, the collaborative was not viewed as having been actively engaged with the school during the year. 	Some of this perception stems from Forest Park staff viewing projects on their own, rather than as affiliates with the MSRC. Thus they noted their engagement with the Coalition when thinking about the revision of the Metropolitan Charter to incorporate the study of law and justice, but they did not identify the MSRC as the local connection with Re:Learning and the Coalition. Other projects in math and science with external connections were treated similarly. One exception to this tendency was the testimony of the benefits that had been obtained for a teacher when the MSRC established connections for her with three local universities and provided funding that enabled her to involve her students with these colleges and with books and transportation to cultural events.<p>	Frustration with the lack of central support was particularly high during our spring visit, because the school had just learned of district plans to reallocate money used for charter coordination. There was confusion as to whether this had been decided by the funding foundation, the district, the MSRC, or some combination of these agencies. There was also confusion about whether the funds being reallocated were district or foundation funds. There was agreement that, once again, the school was being jerked around by a structure that was supposed to be helping them.<p>	In thinking about institutionalizing change, attention is often given to the work performed by the proponents of the change. It may be that at least equal attention has to be given to whether the host institution is healthy enough to be a good medium in which to plant the new approach. Such seemed not to be the case in Jefferson.<p>	During the 1993-94 school year, the MSRC dedicated its energy to institutionalizing some of the changes it had helped initiate. Besides difficulties with transitions in its own leadership, the collaborative faced the challenge of trying to make its fairly radical reforms a part of a system that did not fully understand or support them. <p>	One means by which the central administration believed it was helping the schools was through its requirement of an educational plan. The following comments by a teacher-leader, which seem typical, suggest that the school people did not see it to be as valuable as did the central staff:<p>	When they have us doing things that have no relation to the students we work with, such as hours writing an education plan, I don't see it will benefit students. We wrote it over and over. They kept asking for the same thing over and over. I would rather have spent the time tutoring for the SATs or writing recommendations for scholarships. I'm on the right track if I can see direct benefit to students.<p>	At Forest Park and at other schools in Jefferson, teachers told us the same story about being required to prepare detailed strategic plans, which, as far as they could tell, were not useful to them and which were not used by anyone else. To say the least, such purposeless effort adversely affects trust between schools and the central administration.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="gpap"><h3>Governance:Problems Achieving Progress</h3><p>Frequently, school-based staff expressed their frustrations about central agencies by speaking of their lack of trust for them: lack of trust between the teachers and the central office, and lack of trust between the school and the MSRC. <p>	Distrust within the school, as well as confused messages from central officials, contributed to lack of progress on site-based management. The faculty vote we were told would be taken in December 1993 had not been taken by our May 1994 visit. <p>	One incentive to becoming a school-based management school was the opportunity to gain waivers from limiting contract provisions. In the spring, however, school staff reported that union officials had told them that no waivers were being given.<p>	As the school developed plans for making the middle school and high school schedules more compatible, to allow teams more freedom in controlling their time, the union reportedly intervened to say that the plan was a violation of the contract and could not be implemented. According to staff at the school, this rejection of the plan occurred even though school-based union leaders were supportive of the new schedule. <p>	Moreover, attempts to fill leadership positions in the middle school by involving teachers within the school led to a grievance. The central administration informed the school that it would not support them in the grievance, and a union official asked the principal why she had involved teachers in her decision making. But lack of external support was not the only reason school-based management seemed to be fading from sight. Questions of which decisions were the principal's to make and which should be made by some form of governing council were still up in the air.<p>	The administration's continued belief that it was being held personally accountable left little room for teachers at Forest Park to engage in final decisions. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rots"><hr><center><h2>Reflections on the Snapshot</h2></center><hr>Although Forest Park has created a safe environment for its students, and although it has evidenced some examples of exciting student learning, the work of the administration and staff at the school seems terribly difficult and largely unappreciated by the outside world. Why, then, do people persist in the effort?<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wc"><h3>Why Continue?</h3><p>Reasons vary. A slight few actually receive recognition for their efforts. For example, one of the teachers in the school was selected as the high school "Teacher of the Year" for the large Jefferson system. Others have been used as lead teachers in professional development sessions. Some, like the new principal and assistant principal, have seen their work pay off in terms of promotions that provide more status and pay.<p>	For the most part, however, people at the school said that it is relationships that sustain them. And, again most frequently, these relationships are with students. When asked "Why are you doing this?" Teachers gave us various reasons:<p>	I'm crazy. I love this more than anything on the face of the earth. It defines me. I love these kids. I love their lives. This is not missionary work. I don't view them as exotic. I feel very honored to spend my life with them. This makes my life. They do more for me than I could ever do for them.<p>	The children. The young people. You saw my students today; they were hugging me. I see instant gratification. It's like a cake coming out of the oven. It's so rewarding. This has become my extended family. Plus I love mathematics. I love teaching it. It's fun. It's not like a poem where we have to read it; mathematics just flows. . . . Maybe it is like a poem.<p>	I get a charge every day from the kids. I would go anywhere with them. They are warm, bright, humorous. The graduates are wonderful and come back and make me feel it is so worthwhile. I keep on going. I was told many years ago that kids keep you young, and they do. <p>	The teachers on my team sustain me. They're very supportive. For example, if I was sitting here and I had to get some papers out right away and they know that I was leaving for a funeral, the lady that's out there would say, "I'm all set. Can I do something for you?" And then we had testing this morning. One gentleman was not going to get his prep. Someone said, "Well if he does that, I'll use my prep to cover his classes--his wife's in the hospital. If I take over, he can go check up on her and come right back."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ct"><h3>Concluding Thoughts</h3><p>At Forest Park the administration and staff have created an environment that is reasonably safe for students and faculty. There are many creative, challenging programs for the students in grades six through twelve. The previous leadership worked with the staff to begin a process of innovation, in conjunction with external support groups. One reason the new leadership has been able to sustain progress in the school is that individuals promoted to leadership roles have been involved with the reform in the school for several years. Staff attributed their willingness to continue the reform work to their love for the students and to the support they perceive from their peers. <p>	Notwithstanding these positive conditions at the school, problems persist. Local school governance processes are still unsettled. District, union, and other external agency supports are viewed as somewhere between having no effect and being in the way. In spite of some exciting classes here and there, much instruction falls short of the ideals espoused by teaching and administrative leadership in the school, in that it fails to engage students actively and does not demand high levels of performance from students. The school is still searching for that clear vision that will enable the people within it to concentrate their energy for the good of the students, whom most people at the school value so highly. Few urban high schools serving non-selective student populations are better. Yet, as most of the leaders at Forest Park seem to realize, there is still a long way to go before all the students are learning as well as they can.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cqfc"><table border><tr><td><h3>Conclusion: Questions for Consideration</h3><p><ol><li>What issues need to be addressed first by the Forest Park school community?<p><li>What external support is most needed from the school district?

School administrators often face multiple requests to allow researchers with differing goals and methods of data collection into their schools. Many encourage research in their schools, believing that the findings may help their schools become more effective at their stated missions. Others feel pressured to allow research their intuition tells them to avoid simply because denying researchers access to their schools might suggest that they have something to hide. Still others worry that the research process may disrupt the business of the school as well as complicate professional relationships within the building.<p>	There are a host of good reasons for granting or denying researchers access to your school. In some school districts (especially those in university towns), decisions are often made by review boards that specify procedures for securing research permission. Still, we discovered that many school districts have no such boards, and administrators in those systems are unaccustomed to dealing with researchers' requests to work within their schools. The intent of this article is to provide school personnel with a broad understanding of some issues related to school-based research that can and should be addressed before research begins. Specifically, we hope to foster an understanding that helps schools to: <p><ol>	<li>	shape research projects so they increase the benefits to both the school and the researcher(s); <p>	<li>	protect the rights of those who collaborate in school-based research; <p>	<li>	avoid potential intra-school tensions that can be generated by a research project; <p>	<li>	promote educational research that avoids oversimplifying the issues faced by American education. </ol><p>	We offer here seven considerations that could inform your discussions with researchers and your decisions to allow research at your school. In outlining our suggestions, we want to emphasize that we are not promoting censorship; nor do we intend to dictate to school personnel what research they should allow. Rather, we feel that people working in schools and those studying schools will both benefit from thoughtful, thorough reflection by all potential collaborators before research begins. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="c1"><h3>Consideration #1:What is the focus of the research?</h3>Educational researchers do not just go into a school to look around; every researcher has specific research goals that shape his or her research. Therefore, school personnel responsible for deciding whether to grant permission for research should first find out what these goals are. Question the researcher: What are the guiding questions, the hypotheses, or, perhaps, the theme for the research? Quite frankly, some topics are potentially controversial. For example, examining student attitudes toward abortion or drug use is more likely to be controversial than conducting research on the relationship between student work habits and extracurricular activities.  <p>	Anyone who enters your school for the purpose of doing research should provide the school with a written proposal that outlines the scope of work and the guiding questions. Even when the research is modest in scope (for example, if a class of students has been asked to do classroom observations), you should still receive a copy of the research plan.<p>	As part of this research plan, you have the right to know how and why your school and the specific research topic were chosen. In cases in which the research has been funded by an outside agency, you can gain a deep understanding of the reason for your school's inclusion by examining the proposal submitted to the granting agency. In other cases, if the research goals are not clear to you and you do not probe, you may conceivably have researchers with political agendas coming to your school seeking data to support conclusions they have already reached.  <p>	A third issue related to the focus of the research is whether, in your opinion, the research plan allows enough time for the researcher(s) to do a thorough job. Thus, before research begins, school personnel should consider whether the time budgeted for research seems adequate to grasp and accurately represent the issue(s) investigated.<p>	Also, school personnel may want to inquire whether a research plan can be modified to address issues relevant to a specific school concern. This is not to suggest that schools have the right to dictate what research topics will be. Rather, minor adjustments in the research plan or the addition of a few questions to a survey may allow a researcher to examine topics of direct interest to that school. <p>	Finally, researchers should always provide prospective research participants with some understanding of how the information they provide might be used -- especially, the intended audience and potential uses for the findings. Uncertainty about the intended audience or the use of the findings may cause participants to be less than candid in their remarks and, consequently, may prove counterproductive to the researcher's efforts to investigate an issue at your school. Thus, before research begins, the researcher and the involved school personnel should ask the following questions and reflect carefully on the answers:<p><ol>	<li>	Who will have access to the findings of this research?<p>	<li>	Will the school receive copies? If so, at what stages in the writing and publication process and to what ends will the research findings be shared?<p>	<li>	Will those who participated in the research see the final product?<p>	<li>	What rights of distribution will the school have over the product? </ol><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="c2"><h3>Consideration #2:How will data be collected?</h3>Depending upon the scope and goals of the research, researchers may use different methodologies. Traditionally, educational research has relied on quantitative data (typically, surveys and standardized test scores) to create understandings of life in schools. More recently, however, the value of qualitative research, such as classroom observation and open-ended interviewing, has begun to be appreciated.1 <p>	As part of the overall explanation of their proposed research, researchers should explain their decision to use quantitative over qualitative methods or to combine them in their work at your school. It is important to clarify this point because each of these methodologies has implications, particularly in terms of research participants' time commitments, expected outcomes, and communication with the school. These issues are discussed below in some detail.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="c3"><h3>Consideration #3:Who will be asked to participate?</h3>Just as the questions and the ways of asking them shape what a researcher finds, so too may the selection of persons included in a study affect research findings. As part of the initial review process, we suggest that you ask the researchers how they plan to ensure that the research topic will be approached from an unbiased perspective and that key actors (or points of view) will not be excluded. Since every school setting includes many different actors with differing roles and responsibilities -- students, teachers, guidance counselors, coaches, social workers, and so on -- representing all the relevant actors usually involves collecting a range of opinions. This procedure creates a more accurate picture by revealing the nuances of difference that exist within the school. <p>	Keep in mind that schools are sites not only of teaching and learning but also of political contention. Any researcher co-opted by a specific school faction as a consequence of his/her research or as a result of how participants were recruited may jeopardize the quality of that research before the work even begins. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="c4"><h3>Consideration #4:What role(s) will school personnel be asked to play?</h3>Three concerns about the roles school people may play in the data collection process of research seem particularly important. First, what will participants be expected to do? Will they be asked to write about some aspect of school life, prepare a lesson using materials provided by the researchers, or simply answer a few questions about the school lunch program? Different degrees and types of involvement can influence a person's decision to participate in a research project. <p>	Second, can the researcher estimate the time that research participants are likely to spend? Is their involvement to be a one-shot, forty-minute observation session or a series of interviews and observations over time? Because the time demands of various projects make them appealing to different segments of the school population rather than to all simultaneously, the findings may not be wholly representative. Thus, time expectations should be clearly spelled out (estimated, at the least) to anyone asked to participate. <p>	Third, will participants be paid? If money or other incentives (for example, release-time from class) are provided those participating in a project, these incentives should be discussed thoroughly and uniform guidelines for their assignment established before research begins.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="c5"><h3>Consideration #5:How will confidentiality be protected? </h3>While school-based research offers the possibility of creating rich understandings about school life, these newfound understandings may also generate unforeseen difficulties. For example, participants may fear that their input into the research may be identifiable and thus damaging. The researcher should therefore discuss with those likely to be involved in a study how he or she will protect the participants' confidentiality. The researcher should also address the following questions:<p><ol>	<li>	What possible tensions or difficulties may arise, both during and after the research?2 <p>	<li>	How will participants be protected from any potentially damaging consequences?<p>	<li>	Will individuals remain anonymous?<p>	<li>	Will the school be identified by name in any publications? <p>	<li>	How will the researcher deal with potentially identifying references such as sex, age, experience, departmental affiliations, and so on? Uncertainty about any of these issues may limit the participants' willingness to discuss sensitive issues with the researcher, thereby limiting the depth of the research.  </ol><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="c6"><h3>Consideration #6:Will participants assist in data analysis?</h3>Obviously school personnel will provide the bulk of data for most school-based research. But, is that the end of their involvement? Will any of the participants assist in any way with data analysis? Will they have an opportunity to negotiate meanings or interpretations? Clarifying if and how participants will be involved in the later phases of research before research even begins may keep problems from arising both during the research period and later when reports or articles appear. <p>	Although researchers need not do this, we have found that collaboration with our research participants in a kind of feedback forum has benefited our research in three ways. For one, after viewing our work, participants often provide further elaboration on their actions and reasonings. Second, since through this review process they gain a more complete understanding of our research goals, they may assist our future research by identifying what they see as relevant data. Third, our collaborators have an opportunity to see their contributions "in context" and, thereby, to identify potentially damaging references that we did not recognize initially.3<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="c7"><h3>Consideration #7:What feedback will the school receive?</h3>Before anyone begins research at your school, you should think about what feedback the school and/or the participants in that research will receive. Quite simply, if a school does not ask for feedback, what incentive is there for allowing the research? Feedback may consist of an evaluative report, a summary of activities observed and interviews conducted, suggestions based on research findings, or any descriptive or analytic writing or, for that matter, further research that is negotiated between the school and the researcher. For instance, school personnel might ask the researcher about the possibility of collecting or considering additional data after the findings are released for the purpose of exploring alternative interpretations or addressing issues of specific concern to the school. This happened to us. At one of our research sites a survey revealed that students viewed one department less favorably than others. After discussing our findings with department members, we designed a second survey to investigate this specific issue in greater depth. Thus, the issue of feedback, taken up as part of the initial negotiations with the researcher, may help you shape its form(s), timing, and content -- with the interests of your school community in mind.<p>	Another issue related to feedback concerns research "relevance" -- that is, the value of any research findings for your school. For example, in quantitative research, standardized test scores that reveal a slippage in a particular aspect of math achievement may have implications for the existing math curriculum. More qualitative research, in turn, may create a fairly sophisticated understanding of some aspect of school life that can be used as a starting point for individual or group reflection. For instance, it may help reveal how different student groups value education or the range of teacher opinion regarding motivations for pedagogical change. However, in either case, feedback will not always translate directly into school or classroom practice. In general, we urge schools to conceive of "relevance" broadly. As Courtney Cazden observes: <p><blockquote>Exclusive concern with translating the outcomes of research into improved skills of the practitioner is too narrow; practitioners have not only skills, but also a view of reality, a vision of the achievable, and a commitment to act; and social science knowledge can influence all four.4</blockquote><p>	One final concern involves the time frame for research feedback. Though this may not seem a significant issue, it can become a problem in at least two ways. First, if those participating in research feel that they would like feedback, yet the researcher is afraid of distorting his or her findings by providing feedback prematurely, tensions may develop that affect research outcomes. Teachers may resent what they perceive as an unfair relationship -- that is, they helped collect data, but what do they get in return? -- and this may influence their continued participation in the research. Second, if requests for feedback, or offers to provide it, occur at specific times, for specific purposes, or for some individuals but not others, the feedback may become a part of the political life of the school, thus changing its usefulness and significantly altering the researcher's role within the school. Establishing a clear feedback schedule at the outset of research, however, can reduce or avoid such tensions. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="r"><h3>Remember: You can say "No"</h3>If you are dissatisfied with some aspect of the proposed research or worry about its likely effects on your school community, you can refuse to allow the research to be conducted. However, rather than an outright refusal, we suggest that administrators who have reservations about some aspect of a research design identify their specific concerns, tell these to the researcher, and allow him/her an opportunity to adjust the research plan. You may even choose to contact other persons who might offer useful perspectives prior to making your decision (for instance, administrators who have received similar requests or university personnel familiar with such research). If the research plan remains unsatisfactory, you can just say "no." Of course, no "yes" decision is irreversible. If, in the course of research, you feel that established guidelines have been violated, you can ask the researcher to explain, and perhaps change his or her practice, or stop the research.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="bocc"><h3>Benefits of Careful Consideration</h3>The preceding discussion identified some issues school personnel might consider when deciding whether to allow research to be conducted in their school. We feel that increasing awareness of these concerns will benefit school administrators and their communities in three ways. First, by providing an overview of the various dimensions of research and a sense for the criteria of solid, well-conceived inquiry, we hope to have reinforced the critical and collaborative pre-research role of school personnel with prospective researchers. Second, drawing on this understanding of school-based research may help school personnel address (or even avoid) potential tension points between the researcher(s) and school personnel or among school-based personnel. Finally, given the very public nature of the work schools do and their local accountability, as well considering the complexity of issues surrounding American education in the 1990s, we believe that if school personnel develop a deeper understanding of the educational research process, they can help promote research and inquiry that deepens our understanding of the business of schools without trivializing the problems and difficulties schools face in fulfilling their obligations to American society.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></center><hr><p><ol><p><li> The relative value of quantitative research (most commonly conceived of in terms of survey research) and qualitative research (research that relies heavily on description rather than numbers), is a topic often debated among educational researchers.

Our long-term research in our study sites has yielded, among its other products, some potentially controversial observations about what happens in schools that attempt to restructure themselves. Many of these observations and the associated implications that we discuss in this paper are interrelated. Our decision to discuss the implications in only one relevant context does not negate the fundamental interconnectedness of these observations or their importance. <p>	Taken together, the observations, the supporting evidence, and the implications we draw may seem somewhat disheartening. Therefore we would like to begin by making a few points to situate these observations and implications in a broader context. <p>	1.  <i>The study was conducted at a very early stage in the Coalition's history. </i>It is important to realize that all of the data used to support our observations came from schools just starting to initiate Coalition-related changes. We began our study about one year after the selection of the Coalition's first member schools. At the time of our first visits, many schools had created experimental Coalition programs but still viewed themselves as being in the preliminary state of deciding what else needed to change. At their earliest meetings, interested faculty discussed what they would like to see changed without any assurances that the desired changes might ever take place. Some schools spent substantial amounts of "start-up" time discussing proposed changes, and as we discuss further in our observations, the question of what, if anything, <i>really </i>needed to change re-emerged repeatedly throughout their reform efforts. <p>	Beyond discussions about what might need to change, there were also concerns about how feasible proposed changes were and whether they would have the desired effects. Teachers and administrators felt there were few guideposts because reforms of this nature and potential scope had yet to be attempted. As one principal at a Coalition school remarked when reflecting on the difficult learning process encountered by her school and the Coalition: "We couldn't expect wisdom that none of us had." <p>	2.  <i>Our aim was to discover the generalizable difficulties that accompany a school change effort.</i>  While all of the schools we studied experienced difficulties implementing change, some schools became so politicized or so embroiled in disputes over the shape and content of proposed changes (and ultimately of the school's philosophy) that their membership in the Coalition was questioned or, in one case, rescinded. When we selected our sample of study schools, we could not have predicted the fates that might befall each one. The importance of this second point is that, while all of the schools we studied faced problems of what to change and how to proceed with change, we have, in some instances, emphasized general problems that appear to be inherent in attempts to restructure schools by using specific cases that some might view as "worst-case scenarios."<p>	3.  <i>Different constitutents gauge "success" along different time lines. </i>Notice as you read these observations the multiple time frames that are used to gauge the effects of change by various "players" in the reform game. School people seem to conceive of change on a semester-to-semester or school-year-to-school-year basis, while outside observers may look for change in terms of the number of years of membership in the Coalition or the number of years devoted to trying to change some aspect of schooling. The pressures for "results" are different, and these multiple time frames are used for various purposes by those advocating and rejecting change. "Time" therefore is differently relevant for each observation we make and for the various players involved in the change effort. <p>	4.  <i>Advocating change inevitably challenges the status quo.</i> Closely related to the preceding point about time is another about change itself: change and the desire for change are not value-neutral. Whether or not the rhetoric of an organization (like the Coalition) suggests that everyone can benefit from school reform, efforts to effect change in specific settings simultaneously create a sense that there are winners and losers -- some people are perceived to benefit while others are perceived to be disadvantaged by whatever changes are implemented. <p>	Additionally, being an advocate for school change seems to preclude approaching the topic of change neutrally: advocates are vested in viewing change as improvement, and they are perceived as judgmental both by those who want to change and those who do not. In the case of the Coalition, Central Staff members and local adherents of Coalition ideas may perceive themselves as open-minded about good teaching or specific plans for change, but they are rarely viewed that way by those less interested in change. Advocating change seems to implicitly criticize the status quo and create perceptions of judgmental opposition, regardless of intention.<p>	5.  <i>There is an inherent value in recognizing all viewpoints in such an important undertaking. </i>Our final point is that awareness and careful monitoring of people's perceptions about change in local settings also represent important elements of the change process. The Coalition Central Staff is clearly aware of this point: many of their conferences and institutes are built on notions of improving interpersonal communications, increasing team-based decision-making within schools, and fostering shared leadership that are heavily dependent on the open exchange of perceptions and ideas. The Coalition's efforts to promote documentation of the work at school sites as well as of its own work -- of which the School Ethnography Project represents an important and independent part -- are based on an awareness of the importance of recording multiple perspectives (favorable and less so) about the changes they advocate in American education, an awareness of the magnitude of the task they face, and the conviction that a record should exist of what happened at schools that attempted ambitious change.<p>	The observations we present here are wide-ranging and may appear to denigrate efforts at change that are occurring today in Essential schools. <i>This is not our intent.</i> Our motivation in preparing this article is simple and straight-forward: schoolwide reform is going to be extremely difficult to accomplish, it is going to be time- and labor-intensive, and it will require rethinking and relearning on all parties' parts. To deny any of this is to believe that there are quick fixes or miracle cures. Our evidence suggests that even where there would seem to be consensus that change is needed and where there are dedicated and well-intentioned people trying to bring it about, there are issues and problems, often unanticipated, that threaten the change process almost from its inception. Structural constraints and power issues are realities in all institutions.1 Perhaps if others working on creating change in their schools can see themselves or their problems in these observations, they can take heart that they are not alone. Perhaps if others contemplating reform can begin with some awareness of these problems, they may be more prepared to address these concerns if and when they emerge at their schools.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="oeai"><hr><center><h2>Observations, Evidence and Implications</h2></center><hr>In this section, we offer seven observations about major school restructuring based on our four years of work in the study-site schools. Ethnographic evidence for each of these observations is provided, although all school and individual names (except that of Theodore Sizer, the chairperson of the Coalition of Essential Schools) have been changed or omitted. We also discuss some possible implications for the growing restructuring movement that might be derived from each observation. <p>	In the final section, we will present some brief summary and concluding remarks and offer some suggestions for what we view as essential precursors and necessary accompaniments to school-based efforts at change.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="o1"><h3>Observation #1</h3><b>Perhaps the most important point to be made is that in many of our study-site schools we found no consensus among faculty members that fundamental changes in school structure and/or teaching practices needed to occur. </b><h4>School-based Evidence for This Observation</h4>Despite the overwhelming claims that schools are failing our children and our society and the concomitant calls for change that have filled the public media and education journals for years,2 many teachers and administrators in our study schools did not think that their schools and/or their personal situations needed to be changed. Their views directly contradict the words of Mary Futrell, recent past president of the National Education Association, who wrote:<blockquote>We are finally arriving at a consensus on the need for meaningful reform of U.S. schools and on the direction which that reform should take. . . . I believe that our immobility is now coming to an end. We have forged a new consensus on the necessity of providing a high-quality education to all children. We have also come to realize that achievement of that goal will require a radical re-formation of our schools. If we can hold on to this consensus and build around it a new coalition -- characterized by mobility -- we will finally be ready to undertake the hard work of meaningful education reform (Futrell 1989: 10).</blockquote><p>	Most of the teachers in our study schools, whether they wanted school reform or not, did not agree with Futrell's optimistic assessment. Those supporting reform were, after four or five years of Coalition membership, more aware of the lack of consensus within their schools. Those teachers who saw no need for reform were often willing to allow others within the school to experiment with change, but personally these teachers had neither the time nor the inclination to experiment. In many cases, they did not perceive a need to change. Their refrain sounded much like this: "They can try what they want, but they can't (or better not) dictate to me what I need to do." <p>	Interview after interview and much of the documentary record at three of our study sites which enjoy the reputation of being "good" schools supported the contention that there was never consensus by the faculty that schoolwide change was necessary or desirable. In each case, one or two key administrators and a small group of faculty members sought membership in the Coalition. Schoolwide support, where it existed, encouraged pilot programs and the efforts of those teachers who wanted to change, but with the caveat that participation by others was uncertain and should not be required. <p>	Our evidence further suggested that even in schools characterized by poor attendance, low standardized test scores, and high drop-out and failure rates -- where outsiders might assume there would be a consensus about the need for change -- there was no such consensus. Rather, if there was any consensus regarding the need for change at these schools, it was that the larger society needs to change because present social conditions (single-parent families, drug abuse, general disrespect for authority, and so on) make it extremely difficult for successful teaching to occur.3 <p>	At some of our sites, schoolwide restructuring was quite far along. At one of these schools, in a district of choice, there was consensus among the faculty that schooling needed to be done differently and that all teachers would be expected to experiment with pedagogy and should be included in decisions concerning curriculum development, school policies, and classroom practice. This school was founded around the time <i>Horace's Compromise </i>was published (Sizer 1985) and used the Common Principles and some successful elementary schools as models.4 A second site, a public high school, teamed its faculty (in a variety of configurations) across almost the entire school over a four- to five-year period. Teamed teachers decided the allocation of time per subject in their weekly schedules. Periodically, they also suspended the "normal" schedule to allow for in-depth interdisciplinary work. <p>	These two schools shared four features: both were relatively small (the first had less than 450 students, the second less than 300 students, in grades 7-12); neither school had entrenched programs with "turf" to protect (such as magnet or AP programs or an extensive athletic program); both had been characterized by relatively high teaching staff turnover;5 and both were headed by forceful leaders, each of whom was described by faculty members as being charismatic and inspirational and as having a clear vision for the school. <p>	Finally, as we will see in later observations, the particular starting points for reform in our study schools (student-as-worker and personalization)6 suggest some awareness by those advocating change that in projects requiring schoolwide changes, starting points are a difficult issue. Student-as-worker and personalization seem to have been chosen because they are perceived as "do-able." Both allow everyone to point to change that is taking place, yet both can be attempted <i>without</i> schoolwide consensus that change is necessary or that the Coalition is the way to do it. <p><h4>Implications Drawn from This Observation</h4>Our evidence suggests that where schoolwide consensus about the need for change that involves everyone in the change process does not exist, schoolwide restructuring (with or without formal mandates) is very difficult. Phrased differently, the current system (with its loose teacher accountability and assessment measures at the classroom level) makes resistance easy for teachers who see no reason to change. The Coalition's emphasis on site-based management of change has led in two of our study schools to effective resistance to and blocking of change efforts once they began to affect those who did not wish to be involved and/or did not feel that the changes being made were appropriate.<p>	A second implication, following from the first, is that two distinct questions related to the change process need to be asked by those at schools: First, is change <i>necessary</i>? And second, if so, is the <i>proposed change(s) </i>appropriate? There needs to be a fairly broad consensus on the necessity for change if schools are to get past approaches that remain limited to individual classrooms or a few teams within a school. <p>	This observation, in turn, implies that there will need to be some kind of <i>continual communication </i>in place. And it is likely that the kinds of changes implemented may have to be <i>continually negotiated </i>among all factions within the school. (We will have more to say about communications issues in later observations.) <p>	Another implication is that if there is no consensus from the start, then no one should assume that it will be achieved at any point later in the process. At one level, this is a simple-minded point, but it suggests that school restructuring may be more difficult than many think. For instance, Coalition Central Staff and people in schools often assumed that those who chose not to be "actively" involved with Coalition reform at first would eventually become supporters. However, from our observations, it seems that once a program begins to expand and people see how it influences their daily life, these once disinterested persons often come to oppose these changes rather than to embrace them. We will explore this further in a later observation.<p>	A final implication of this point concerns research: perhaps a research priority should be to study those teachers who do not believe change is necessary to ascertain the basis for their beliefs. These people can make it difficult for schoolwide changes to occur. There are so many protections built into the system for experienced teachers that it seems unlikely anyone can be "forced" to change if they do not wish to do so.7 <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="o2"><h3>Observation #2</h3><b>CES membership, by "forcing" the issue of what constitutes the school's philosophy, tended to reveal differences various faculty had concerning their jobs, the school's mission, and the best ways to educate students. Making a school's philosophy problematic for its staff tended to disrupt the fragile (and usually unspoken and unquestioned) assumption that there was a sense of shared purpose, values, and belief underlying the everyday world of the school.</b><h4>Evidence</h4>The Coalition does not approach school change with a set "model." Rather the Central Staff emphasize that CES philosophy is open to multiple interpretations. Each school is encouraged to determine the appropriate interpretation of the Common Principles within its own institutional and community context. Also the Central Staff maintains that schools should work on all nine Common Principles at once because they are inextricably intertwined. Although the Coalition has adopted this nondirective stance in the belief that it gives schools a sense of autonomy and ownership over the change process, teachers often have a different reaction. They frequently comment that the Coalition "puts it <i>all </i>up for grabs all at once" (i.e., how you teach, what you teach, the structure within which you teach, how you assess learning, etc.). Moreover, they often perceive themselves as "owning" not a process or approach to school change but rather a whole new set of problems about how they can best do their jobs. <p>	At some schools, even those people who feel that there is a need for change and who believe that CES offers an appropriate means to address this issue may become divided with regard to varying interpretations of CES philosophy. At one of our study schools, the issue of offering an "advanced placement" (AP) course proved divisive. Some Coalition proponents considered the AP course to be fully congruent with the Coalition's notion of schools having an "intellectual focus."8 Other Coalition proponents viewed the AP course as a sign of "tracking," which they considered inappropriate, since the Coalition maintains that a "school's goals should apply to all students" (CES 1990:2). After a vote of the Coalition faculty, they decided not to offer the course "officially," although it was made available to interested students as a before-school elective. <p>	At two other study schools, concerns with philosophical integrity occurred when a pro-CES principal was replaced by a second pro-CES principal. Many teacher-supporters expressed dismay and confusion about the second principal's interpretation of the Common Principles.<p>	Other examples concern continued Coalition membership. After slightly more than a year of Coalition membership, one study school spent nearly an entire school year heatedly debating whether to remain a member. As the effects of Coalition membership began to influence more and more aspects of school life, the faculty came to recognize that there were strongly held philosophical differences among the faculty that had existed for years but had never been acknowledged or discussed before their Coalition membership brought them to the fore. Eventually, the school voted to continue their membership provisionally for one year. <p>	Those who worked to mobilize support for maintaining their Coalition affiliation had three reasons for feeling their school should do so: first, they felt that the structure of their initial effort, a school-within-a-school, had doomed the program from the start by dividing the faculty and allowing political issues to obscure the educational aspects of Coalition practice. Second, these supporters felt that if interested faculty began to experiment with Coalition philosophy and shared their experiences with their noninvolved colleagues in a nonthreatening way, their colleagues would see the value of this approach. Finally, the state appeared likely to join Re:Learning. As a member of the Coalition, the school would be entitled to up to $50,000 of additional funding to support this effort. Quite simply, they saw no reason why their school should not take advantage of this opportunity.<p>	Finally, once one school began to debate the issue of what it meant to be a "comprehensive" high school, so many philosophical divisions emerged within the faculty that they ended up leaving the Coalition altogether. Deriving consensus on the Common Principles, particularly those relating to the appropriate role of teachers and those perceived to imply that schools should no longer try to be comprehensive, proved impossible. After reflecting on whether Coalition philosophy was appropriate for their school, the faculty voted overwhelmingly to reaffirm their commitment to being a comprehensive high school. <p>	Again, the one exception to this observation we have seen was at the new urban alternative school, where the philosophy and its elaboration were from the start (and still are, to a large extent) negotiated among the faculty and administrators. Parents and students must familiarize themselves with the school's philosophy, visit the school, and then sign an agreement to support the school's aims before enrolling. In effect, the school seeks consensus regarding its philosophy and pedagogical approaches among all constituents before they become involved in the life of the school.<p><h4>Implications</h4>The most important implication of this observation is that "putting it <i>all </i>up for grabs" may prove too threatening and/or divisive for some people to want to do <i>anything</i>.9 It is a massive undertaking for a faculty to be asked to work as a whole to build consensus about what the school stands for, what it should do for its students, how it should do it and so forth. Not only are there no guidelines for how to do the rethinking, no one involved has experience considering change on that scale. And while most schools have a mission statement that suggests that all work for the common good, experience in the everyday workings of schools suggests that teachers often must be self-interested (at the individual and departmental levels) to get the most for their students. Even assuming there was consensus about the need for change (which we have already suggested does not exist), putting it all up for grabs implies that anything and everything could change. Where does one (or a faculty as a whole) anchor in that case? As we discuss further in our next point, teachers who are willing to experiment seem to select as starting points changes they can make on their own. The consequences of this selection are that it perpetuates the individual interests of teachers and delays the discussion of faculty-wide and schoolwide change.<p>	This second observation, then, also concerns the confrontation of the status quo and the forces for change. Schools have an uneasy, unspoken truce regarding their overall philosophy, and as long as faculty are allowed to teach in isolation from one another, the status quo is never seriously threatened by those who are interested in change. Making a school's philosophy problematic has generated lots of problems and shows us why the "myth" of schools' shared mission and purpose is so comfortable. 10 <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="o3"><h3>Observation #3</h3><b>The usual starting points for reform tended to be aspects of the common philosophy or agenda that individual teachers (or small teams of teachers) could do on their own, with little disruption to the school as a whole. For example, we found that proponents of Coalition reform tended to begin in their own schools by emphasizing student-as-worker and personalization. Attempts to implement these practices by individual teachers or teams of teachers provided little disruption to the daily business of school. Furthermore, they could be and usually were done without faculty consensus (and often with minimal negotiation by the entire faculty and relevant others, such as the school board) concerning their appropriateness or representativeness as a schoolwide philosophy. </b><h4>Evidence</h4>At most of our study schools, student-as-worker and personalization were the most common entry points into Coalition philosophy. Teachers regularly told us in interviews, as one humanities teacher did, that "student-as-worker and personalization are the backbone of the entire reform, they are the most important principles. That's why we got started right away on them." <p>	The incorporation of these principles into classroom life in each of our study schools was accompanied by some degree of teaming. In all but one case this teaming was completely voluntary. Generally, teachers who attempted to incorporate student-as-worker and personalization principles into their classrooms reported that students responded well to their efforts; the teachers noted that better attendance, more questioning, and a general tone of cooperation emerged in the classroom as students began to accept a more active role in the class.<p>	We are not alone in noting the rapid acceptance and incorporation of these two principles into school life at Coalition schools. In 1988, the CES Committee on Evaluation reported that "the changes that are most evident and most readily achieved related to the principles of personalization and student-as-worker" (CES Committee on Evaluation 1988).11 Sizer commented on the Evaluation Committee's finding, using it as evidence that schools needed to pass beyond the first threshold to what he called the "second stage of change." <p><blockquote>. . . [T]hree themes . . . emerge both from the Committee's report and from discussions we have had with many of you over the last few months. First is the matter of "thresholds," the stages a school must likely traverse for its students to gain the benefit of changed practice. The Committee found many schools at a first stage, one where several of the Common Principles had come into useful play in individual classrooms. Student-as-worker and personalization were most commonly identified as having an effect here. The pedagogy employed by individual teachers in their presently organized classrooms -- and the assumptions behind that pedagogy-- appeared to have changed, for everyone's benefit. Nonetheless, the gains are limited (however worthwhile): the extent of the effect is inevitably restricted by the teachers' load (1:95? 1:120? 1:150?) and by the pressure of many curricula to "cover" (without apparent concern for thoroughness) a wealth of specific information. The truly substantial achievement promised by these two of the Common Principles is impossible when so circumscribed.</blockquote><p><blockquote>However, stopping at this first stage is what (apparently) many schools do. The next steps for them to take are both unclear and likely to be tricky, as routines and structures beyond the individual classroom will have to be altered. More than individual teachers or pairs of teachers will be affected. The dominos will start toppling, and the politics of the faculty may become strained.  (Sizer 1989:6-7)</blockquote><p>	While we have ample evidence that teachers attempted to implement student-as-worker and personalization principles in their schools, to support our general observation we also site the continuing absence of evidence that the other principles were being defined and implemented in the local school context. In other words, our study schools had not yet attempted such Coalition-related reforms as applying the aphorism "less is more" to their curriculum; few schools had integrated exhibitions (defined as schoolwide assessment measures required for promotion or graduation) into their programs; most faculty were not operating as "generalists" unless that is interpreted as meaning to fill a number of different roles (e.g., colleague, advisor for students, teacher, etc.);12 and few schools had gotten their student:faculty ratios down to 80-to-1, unless it was for certain faculty members only (e.g., school-within-a-school faculty).<p>	One aspect of personalization required some structural change in the school as a whole (outside of the creation of a school-within-a-school program). Two of our study schools created advisory-like groupings of students and teachers. In both schools, the advisory groups were scheduled into the existing school day and faculty were recruited to advise a small number of students. In each school the program was mandatory for students but voluntary for teachers (and other adults in the building). In both cases students were resistant to the change partly because it is atypical -- there was no grade and the "requirements" were, at least initially, amorphously defined. Faculty at both schools eventually requested professional development activities to help them learn better how to cultivate more personalized relationships with their students. <p><h4>Implications</h4>One implication of the observation that those experimenting with change have defined a narrow arena (the classroom, their performance, their students' work, and possibly that of a teamed teacher) within which to make changes and evaluate their success is that, at the individual level, the reports of success can be and often are impressive. Focusing on these two principles often revitalizes teachers, demonstrating to them a potential for personal efficacy in the classroom that many report had seemed lost before they attempted to experiment with these two ideas.<p>	However, a second implication of this observation is that the effect over time of concentrating on student-as-worker and personalization can be to keep the change process focused on the teacher-student-subject matter relationship and away from larger issues of schoolwide change, such as changing the schedule, lowering the student-to-teacher ratio, or restructuring schoolwide into houses. Given the fragility of the schools' sense of shared philosophy, focusing on personalization and student-as-worker has allowed schools to point to new and different things going on within their walls. To many parties, this suggests that serious, institutionwide restructuring is occurring. A closer look, however, reveals little that is systemic or firmly in place beyond the formation of teams with perhaps some common planning time. Most changes that have occurred to date have had minimal impact on the overall structure and daily operation of the school. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="o4"><h3>Observation #4</h3><b>At most of our schools, a "vanguard" of faculty voluntarily came to embrace Coalition philosophy. While they may have seen themselves and been viewed by the administration as "harbingers of the future," these faculty were often perceived by their noninvolved colleagues as receiving preferential treatment within the school. Their efforts often ended up dividing the faculty rather than providing examples or role models. </b><h4>Evidence</h4>In general, the vanguard usually included those faculty who perceived a need for change, who viewed the Coalition's philosophy as an appropriate means to address this need, and who became actively involved in the change effort. Typically, these persons were either self-selected to participate in the Coalition program or encouraged by their principal to join. Administrators, almost without exception, supported these individuals in various ways (for instance, by creating school-within-a-school structures, by funding trips to Coalition workshops, and by providing additional release-time), believing that these teachers would demonstrate the effectiveness of Coalition philosophy for other faculty and that this would promote beneficial changes throughout their school. The vanguard usually had a similar perspective. They were committed to reform and they, too, saw a need for the support they were receiving and expected that their efforts would eventually benefit the entire school. <p>	Rather than being viewed as offering new ideas to the faculty, however, vanguard members were for various reasons often seen in a less-than-favorable light by many of their colleagues and this perception proved detrimental to efforts to spread Coalition reforms to the entire school. For instance, the vanguard were often perceived by noninvolved faculty as receiving preferential treatment. At our research sites, noninvolved faculty maintained that Coalition teachers had fewer students, better students, lighter teaching loads, and more free periods and that they received a disproportionate amount of professional development funds. This perceived preferential treatment often distanced the vanguard from the rest of the faculty, who dismissed any signs of vanguard "success" on the basis of these favored conditions. Moreover, certain Coalition faculty perceived as spokespersons for the reform effort might not be viewed as truly representing the educational interests or beliefs of their colleagues. <p>	For a variety of reasons, including personal style, reputation, and so on, the participation of these people in Coalition activities may have precluded the participation of others. (Hampel [1990] confirmed that this had been the case in his study of Re:Learning schools as well.) In addition to everything else that could impede participation, clashes of personal teaching styles and/or personality differences may also have limited involvement. Finally, the assumption that the vanguard would be able to demonstrate the efficacy and appropriateness of Coalition philosophy to other teachers was interpreted by some teachers as a critique of their existing teaching practices. Consequently, the "demonstration" approach did little to influence those faculty who were not committed to change in the first place. <p>	Although those not directly involved in the reform efforts often viewed the vanguard as receiving preferential treatment, the vanguard were likely to think just the opposite about themselves. Their involvement often entailed regularly volunteering their free time to the overall effort. They then saw themselves as making a contribution to school life above and beyond that of their noninvolved colleagues. Additionally, vanguard teachers and administrators usually worked hard to include a variety of actors <i>outside the school </i>in the process of school change -- parents, school board members, union representatives, and others from the local community. A number of our study schools, for example, established "advisory councils." One school sought out community members willing to hire students as "apprentices" in local businesses. Another school designed its "community service program," in part, to help the community see their students as responsible persons with something to contribute. Although often encountering intrafaculty resistance and skepticism and remaining relatively isolated from their noninvolved colleagues, Coalition supporters used these outside contacts to bolster their sense of the program's effectiveness.<p><h4>Implications</h4>By identifying and supporting a vanguard of faculty involved most intensively with reform, school administrators can unknowingly contribute to the creation of new "us vs. them" divisions within the faculty, which can act to heighten emerging philosophical differences. As one noninvolved faculty member at a study school commented: "We had some teachers who had 80 students, no duties, and fewer classes. How could anybody think that that wouldn't create tension?" This division is often exacerbated by perceived criticisms of conventional teaching seen as implicit in Coalition practice and rhetoric and can make those not directly involved with the reform even more likely to resist change, thereby strengthening the status quo.<p>	Furthermore, because administrators often chose to support the vanguard in ways that those not involved may have perceived as preferential, some of those outside the reform came to view the reform efforts as but one more top-down mandate directed by a core of faculty and a supportive administration. Given the Coalition's repeated assertions that in order for reform to be successful it must be grassroots, this concern is especially relevant for their effort. This situation is complicated because what constitutes "grassroots" lies in the eye of the beholder. Administrators, outsiders, and Coalition faculty who feel newly empowered may very well view the reform at their school as grassroots. Noninvolved faculty, however, may perceive the reform quite differently.<p>	As a consequence of the vanguard embracing the reform effort and some faculty feeling excluded, devalued, or somewhat skeptical of the reform in general, the vanguard often ended up isolated. Since many vanguard members expended considerable time and effort working to make their reforms effective, those supportive of the reform could end up physically drained. Coupled with the sense of isolation they might feel from noninvolved faculty, eventually what began as professional rejuvenation could end with disillusionment.13 <p>	Finally, involving "outsiders" in the school's change efforts seems to have had two effects. First, this involvement gave these new outsiders an insight into the "politicalness" of schools that can be unsettling and disillusioning to parents and community members unfamiliar with such a conception of American schools. Second, since these community members were usually very supportive of the vanguard's efforts, this could create the "illusion" of greater consensus for the vanguard's efforts than actually existed <i>within </i>the school. In retrospect, it appears that in planning their reform many of our study schools acknowledged the value of having a broad base of support and accordingly involved a variety of outside persons in their effort. Perhaps because of the tensions created by the reform, they were never able to get a similar base of support within their schools. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="o5"><h3>Observation #5</h3><b>Most Coalition supporters (teachers particularly) were politically naive in their use of power, in their negotiations with their less interested colleagues, and in their expectations about what school change would require. </b><h4>Evidence</h4>Taken seriously, the Coalition's Common Principles imply a significant rethinking of a school's purpose, activity, and curriculum. For the Coalition as a whole, there was, at first, a general naiveté about the degree to which school reform could be effected solely by focusing on academic concerns, specifically, the "triangle of learning" (i.e., the relationship between the student, teacher, and subject matter). Reflecting on this assumption, a Central Staff member remarked:<blockquote>There's no conceivable way that Ted [Sizer] could have known . . . just how little we grasp about the issues of institutional change. It was always the belief of the project that a very, very clear vision of pedagogy and pedagogical reform would be the point of leverage for the change. I think that that's true. . . . [Yet,] we were, in fact, all naive about that. It's the right point of view to have about change. It differentiates us from every other reform because we're the only ones that are working from an intellectual center. But we don't know much about institutional change.14</blockquote><p>	Paralleling this trend, Coalition supporters in member schools tended to focus on aspects of the "triangle" as well -- for instance, concentrating their efforts on program structure, curriculum, and their own pedagogy, while giving limited attention to political concerns or to the consequences of exerting their new influence within the school. <p>	In part, it seems that the comprehensive nature of Coalition reform contributed to this naiveté by somewhat obscuring the influence that Coalition proponents exerted. By making changes in curriculum, pedagogy, scheduling, and other aspects of school life, almost unknowingly the vanguard began to influence school life in ways they had not prior to the introduction of the Coalition program. They might have control over some professional development funds; their curricular choices might have ramifications for their noninvolved colleagues; their program structure might influence scheduling and class sizes within the larger school, and so on. <p>	Their influence, then, was not necessarily the authority to act or make decisions that directly affected others within the school (although in some instances it was). Rather, much of their influence emerged circuitously, as a consequence of changes initiated as part of the overall Coalition program. Also, these changes tended to affect different people in different ways -- and not everyone at our schools perceived benefits from the "reforms." Some teachers, for example, felt they were losing better students to the Coalition program, others considered the curricular changes inappropriate, and some faculty felt their positions might be threatened. Yet, most of those not directly involved in the reform felt that these changes <i>must </i>be benefiting those involved. <p>	The naiveté of Coalition proponents was especially apparent in their tendency to define those not involved with and/or disinterested in their reform efforts as potential supporters, instead of viewing them as equally liable to oppose their efforts. Given the time demanded by school restructuring efforts, convincing their skeptical colleagues of their program's merits was not a priority for those attempting to implement Coalition reforms. Yet, as some of those initially unconcerned about these reform efforts, or even supportive of the ideas <i>in theory</i>, began to realize the full ramifications of these changes <i>in practice</i>, what seemed like a good idea or, at worst, a harmless experiment could become the basis for substantial controversy and contention. Consequently, what began as disinterest could evolve into opposition, and supporters did not feel adequately prepared to deal with this development. <p>	Within the school as a whole, then, the vanguards' efforts were often perceived as a power struggle and as more interpersonally confrontational than anything Coalition supporters may initially have envisioned. Moreover, the vanguard were often faculty who had exerted limited influence prior to the introduction of the reform. They may not have been well known or widely respected among the faculty. Often, they were inexperienced teachers or relatively new to their particular school (especially since many schools hired new faculty explicitly because of their expressed support for and willingness to participate in the Coalition program). And they were often women. In any case, relative to their previous status, Coalition proponents began to influence aspects of school life much more than they ever had prior to the introduction of the Coalition program, and their political naiveté exacerbated existing tensions and created new tensions within the school.<p><h4>Implications</h4>There seem to be a number of implications for Coalition schools derived from this point. First, it is evident that what was considered "opposition" at our study schools was variable: opposition could potentially include <i>anyone </i>not actively involved in the change effort. Opposition, then, could be not just the outright hostile but the sum of the disinterested, the less interested (i.e., those who expressed interest but perhaps lacked the time to be actively involved), <i>and </i>the outright hostile. The vanguard in at least three of our study schools, due to their preoccupation with pedagogical, curricular, and structural concerns, gave little attention to the noninvolved, in effect treating them as irrelevant.<p>	Given that the Coalition advocates changing multiple aspects of school life, these reforms hold the potential for considerable opposition to arise. And it often did, over and over again in the same school, sometimes for the same reasons, other times in modified arguments or assertions. Since the changes implemented by the vanguard often came to affect those initially not involved in ways the noninvolved perceive negatively, these persons could shift from indifference toward the change effort to explicitly opposing any changes. <p>	This points to another important aspect of intrafaculty opposition and resistance to reform: in order to exert counterinfluence to Coalition reform, those opposed do not need a consistent theoretical or political basis. All the opposition needs is to be upset with some aspect of the changes they are experiencing. Since Coalition proponents usually attempt to change many aspects of school life, there are often multiple opportunities for resistance to mobilize. Thus, the opposition to reform does not need to be coherent: people can unite against change for varying reasons -- including philosophical differences, political concerns, or personal misgivings -- and this resistance can arise over and over again as unresolved or seemingly resolved issues re-emerge in new contexts or from new advocates. <p>	Tensions between the vanguard and the noninvolved arose almost from the start and were exacerbated by a vanguard unaware of the political implications of their efforts. However, as these tensions were for the most part unanticipated, most pro-Coalition faculty members were not prepared to deal with this resistance. On top of all the other difficulties these teachers faced (developing curriculum, organizing their schedules, and generally dealing with the uncertainties associated with something new and ambitious), political opposition at the school site was an unpleasant surprise for which few faculty had the time or energy. <p>	This situation was often worsened by the emerging tendency of those in the vanguard to view those skeptical of and/or opposed to their efforts as the "enemy." Conversely, by advocating change, the vanguard and their efforts were perceived by many of those noninvolved as implicitly critical of existing practices (e.g., lecturing). Furthermore, some faculty felt that those given the increased power and influence were being portrayed to the outside world in a very positive light, as the persons doing the most exciting and innovative work at their schools. Most often, these issues only served to further reinforce the us/them divisions that had arisen with the introduction of the Coalition program. With no forum in which to address these concerns and with most communication about these problems traveling through informal channels, these difficulties tended to worsen with time. As a result, the vanguard felt under siege, the noninvolved felt excluded, and life at some schools became less pleasant.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="o6"><h3>Observation #6</h3><b>The new divisions created within schools as a result of Coalition membership tended to restrict communication among the faculty. This, in turn, often meant that opposition built up based on hearsay as well as actual developments. It was an outcome of the political naiveté, and it heightened political problems.</b><h4>Evidence</h4>As previously mentioned, those at the forefront of Coalition reform were often so consumed with academic and logistical concerns that they had little time or energy left to address political issues. One consequence of this oversight, we have observed, was that communication flow between participants in the Coalition program and those not involved concerning the nature of the reforms being undertaken was severely restricted. In fact, only one school where we worked created forums explicitly intended for discussing developments related to their Coalition programs. Communication could become so poor that some faculty members might not even know whether a Coalition program still existed. As a noninvolved teacher at one school commented, "Are we still in the Coalition?" <p>	In part, this lack of communication seems to have resulted from a combination of influences: the perceived criticisms of existing practices; the sense that the vanguard were receiving preferential treatment; and the tensions, power struggles, and personal misgivings these feelings could generate. Commenting on the effect of these tensions among a faculty, one Coalition coordinator reflected:<blockquote>There were many wonderful things that happened with our teams but no one wanted to hear about them. I mean that literally. In the most casual and supportive ways, if someone with the Coalition said, "Gee, I did this neat program," people would absolutely get up out of the room and leave. They would just not listen. In fact, at one particular meeting, the freshmen had . . . produced a number of historical newspapers, a wonderful project. We wanted to share that with some other classes and some teachers outside the Coalition, and I got very specific, very angry letters . . . from faculty saying that they were tired of the Coalition. They didn't want to hear anymore about the Coalition. . . . Why weren't we asking other people to show the good things that they had done? It was just awful.</blockquote><p>	At another school, a political concern -- specifically, whether an actual faculty vote whether to join the Coalition had been taken -- emerged as a contentious issue. Commenting on the reaction of one faculty member, the Coalition coordinator described how such political tensions can restrict communication:<blockquote>I was engaged in a long but fruitful conver-sation with Christopher Jones and [the other Coalition coordinator]. Chris is furious at the way the vote (or non-vote) was taken years ago as to whether to join the Coalition or not. He summarily dismisses all Coalition activities because he resents the way the vote was taken. We realize how fragile and political so much of this is. </blockquote><p>	Because the teachers in Coalition programs that we studied had limited communication with their noninvolved colleagues, the latter rarely developed a clear sense for what changes were being enacted and what their effects had been on students, teachers, or the institution as a whole -- beyond how certain changes might directly affect their situation. And this, too, was misperceived at times. Furthermore, the program's goals, methods, and structure were not clear to all faculty members. Student-directed inquiry and cooperative learning, then, were seen by some as signs of a lack of discipline and order within a program. An attempt at curricular innovation may have been perceived as an effort to entrench the Coalition's philosophy and undermine the existing curriculum. In a discussion of the problems generated by this lack of communication, one Coalition teacher remarked, "We really neglected to communicate enough with the rest of the staff. And I think that a lot of really crazy ideas got circulated about what we were doing -- or not doing." <p>	At two schools, restricted communication within the faculty led to a perception by many noninvolved faculty that the school-within-a-school structure adopted by their Coalition program <i>was </i>the Coalition. When this structure generated political tension, the school-within-a-school and the Coalition became, for all intents and purposes, synonymous. Faculty debates, therefore, were not concerned with whether the Coalition philosophy was appropriate for their school but whether the school-within-a-school structure was appropriate. It was some time before this point was clarified.<p>	This is not to say that those in Coalition programs did not communicate at all with their colleagues. Often, those noninvolved received memos and updates on developments within the Coalition program. Most faculty at Coalition schools, whether actively involved in the school's program or not, had access to <i>Horace</i>, a newsletter published by the Coalition. This communication, however, had a tendency to be viewed by those not involved as not really addressing many of the issues they perceived as significant for two reasons: first, the Coalition members selected the topics to share with their colleagues; and second, communication tended to be one-directional (i.e., there was no forum that would allow those noninvolved to provide input or formally respond). <p><h4>Implications</h4>We have seen, then, that restricted communication among a faculty can have serious implications for program expansion and the understanding of a school's membership obligations, not to mention its effects on the workplace environment and the overall faculty understanding of the attempted reform. In part, this lack of intrafaculty communication also may explain why Coalition reforms to date have not been accepted more broadly, and why they have encountered problems in getting entire schools to adopt the Coalition philosophy. Quite simply, how can schools assess a program's desirability with an incomplete or distorted sense of what is happening with that program? The need for open and ongoing communication serves as an appropriate introduction to our seventh and final observation.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="o7"><h3>Observation #7</h3><b>There was an assumption that once a faculty had "accepted" a reform program, there was little if any need for the faculty to reflect on this decision in an ongoing fashion. In effect, planning for change seemed to become defined as part of the start-up for change rather than as part of an ongoing process of change.</b><h4>Evidence</h4>When our research schools initiated their involvement with the Coalition, they generally did so after providing their faculty as a whole with time to consider whether they felt that such a relationship was appropriate for their school. Most schools created faculty committees charged with examining Coalition philosophy and its implications for their students and faculty and/or sponsored open forums to discuss the feasibility of Coalition membership. Two of our study schools held faculty referendums to determine whether they would join. After this period of initial faculty reflection, however, there was much less facultywide discussion about the reform effort -- unless the program had become a topic of serious political contention within the school and the faculty was reconsidering whether membership in the Coalition was even appropriate. <p>	Similar tendencies were apparent within Coalition faculties. For instance, schools often began their Coalition association by selecting a sample of faculty volunteers to be part of an initial Coalition team. Generally, these teams were given time to plan and create a structure for their program -- often a nonteaching semester and/or support during the summer. The structure they created, in almost every one of our research schools, has remained virtually unchanged and unquestioned.15 Those who joined these teams later on had much less influence on the overall program structure and were never given comparable time to consider what they viewed as an appropriate structure. <p>	A parallel tendency can be seen in the socialization of teachers new to Coalition programs. Not only were the original team members of most Coalition programs that we studied allowed to create a structure for their program; often, they were also provided time to develop curricula, attend Coalition conferences, and generally familiarize themselves with Coalition philosophy. Those who joined later, however, generally received more <i>ad hoc </i>introductions to Coalition philosophy and their school's program. None were provided release-time from their teaching to learn about Coalition philosophy, and the introduction they did receive tended to be less in-depth and less comprehensive than that provided their veteran colleagues. This lack of socialization was often compounded by the tendency of some principals to hire persons from outside their school specifically to join their Coalition program, thereby increasing the likelihood that those new to Coalition programs would be unfamiliar with Coalition philosophy, at least as it was practiced at that school. <p><h4>Implications</h4>In view of the faculty effort and financial cost associated with creating Coalition programs, it is understandable that schools are reticent to have their faculties, either as a whole or as Coalition teams, redesign the wheel on a regular basis. Still, given that school change can bring to the surface many contentious issues -- both political and philosophical -- and that these issues can have a powerful influence on reform efforts, some pressing questions endure: Should schools assume that their first program design will be the most effective? Is there an implicit assumption that newer Coalition faculty require less socialization into Coalition practice? If so, why? And is there a need for greater perspective on school change before settling on a particular program structure? <p>	One implication of this finding is that there seems to be a need to make continual reflection on the change process a normal part of school life.16 Consider the alternative: without creating a forum for ongoing reflection or a mechanism for soliciting faculty feedback, the unanticipated effects of school change may never even be appreciated, much less addressed or resolved. Even when tensions have been acknowledged, with no means to address the concerns, the problems can intensify and become increasingly entrenched. Consequently, divisions within faculties may grow more clearly defined and those aspects of the school change effort that are dependent on faculty cooperation -- for instance, collaboratively defining a curriculum's essential elements or cooperative planning, instruction, and assessment -- may be less likely to occur. Also, in terms of philosophical issues, a lack of ongoing reflection may mean that faculty members have a limited sense of the degree to which they share standards and expectations for their students -- in effect perpetuating the intellectual incoherence that Sizer described as pervasive in his critique of American education. Ongoing reflection would offer a means to share positive developments within a Coalition program, resolve emerging tensions, and further collaborative efforts to improve schools.17 <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="conc"><hr><center><h2>Conclusion</h2></center><hr>It is all the rage for people to say that this new wave of reform -- this third or "restructuring" wave -- will be the "reform that's going to make the difference" (Fiske 1990; Mastery in Learning 1990). We would like to temper this enthusiasm. <p>	In addition to the many concerns that current economic uncertainties add to the discussion of change, we have discussed a denial of the need for change that strikes at the heart of schoolwide restructuring's chances for real success -- an especially significant concern given the Coalition's insistence that reform should eventually encompass an entire school. We have discussed how those seen in the vanguard of the reformers are often dismissed as the "teachers and students of privilege" within specific Coalition schools, and that this vanguard is often politically naive, or at least has focused its efforts elsewhere, so that political concerns receive little attention. We have suggested that the "entry points" into change usually involve something like personalizing education that does not require schoolwide consensus, and that making a school's sense of mission or its philosophy problematic can disrupt the fragile, often unspoken belief that there is consensus about the purpose, value, and meaning of schooling. We have also suggested that communication between the vanguard and the outside world (i.e., parents, local community, and so on) is often better than that between the vanguard and the rest of the school. <p>	Furthermore, two findings are clear from our research: school change is not neutral nor are its multiple effects predictable. As reform unfolds, it affects different people in different ways. Some benefit from change, others perceive disadvantages. Also, predicting what the effects of change will be at the outset is near to impossible. Because of these tendencies, school change holds the potential to engender considerable tension within a school faculty. And, on top of all this, finding time and promoting the expertise to deal with these multiple concerns is expensive.<p>	Our research also suggests that an effort at major restructuring, like the Coalition, can be so compromised in practice that it becomes a piece of the school structure that it was intended to change rather than a "force" for change schoolwide. For instance, many of the earliest Coalition member schools accepted the criticism that their schools were like shopping malls (Powell et al. 1984) -- and pro-Coalition faculty and administrators sought to change this. Yet, our evidence suggests that while many Coalition reform efforts are experiencing some success at becoming another specialty shop with the school, they have found it difficult to seriously challenge the school's current structure or practices more broadly.<p>	We do not intend to imply that our observations should ring the death knell for restructuring based on our research among a limited sample of the first Coalition member schools, although Sarason (1990a, 1990b), too, has raised concerns about recent educational reform efforts. We have been conducting research for nearly five years. Although this represents a substantial research period, we may need to keep in mind that American secondary schools have remained relatively unchanged -- in terms of their structure, predominant pedagogy, and disciplinary divisions -- for nearly 100 years. During this time these forces have become well entrenched. Creating change may take longer than the time framework we have employed allows us to observe (Fiske 1990; Schlechty 1989). <p>	It may help to keep in mind a point made by Phil Schlechty, a representative from the Gheens Professional Development Academy in Louisville, Kentucky, at a Coalition conference. In his words, the Coalition and Re:Learning are on "the cutting edge of ignorance." Change of the scope and nature presently being undertaken by the Coalition and others has no historical precedent. Many lessons, some painful, still need to be learned. <p>	This certainly seems to have been true at our study schools. While some things at these schools changed as the result of new efforts at restructuring, most of the schools appeared resilient in the face of schoolwide restructuring. There is little to suggest that other restructuring efforts will have more success without first seeking and obtaining widespread faculty consensus, establishing a clear sense of the processes that they will follow throughout the effort, increasing their awareness of the likely obstacles that they will encounter, and developing some sense for how everyone -- at all levels of the educational bureaucracy -- will be held accountable for the schooling of our children. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><hr><center><h3>Notes</h3></center><hr><p><ol><li> Seymour Sarason's <i>Predictable Failure of Educational Reform</i> (1990b) looks at these issues in some detail.<p><li> A partial list of books and articles on how schools fail and what should be done about it includes: Holt 1964, Kohl 1967, Kozol 1967, The National Commission of Excellence in Education 1983, The Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on Federal Elementary and Secondary Education Policy 1983, and The Task Force on Education for Economic Growth 1983.<p><li> Others, for example Orlich (1989) and Hatton (1989), have also found that teachers feel other factors, such as students' home environments, rather than their teaching approach or classroom organization, are what impede student success in school.<p><li> In effect, then, this school was not <i>re</i>structured, since it was a new school being designed as it grew over a six-year period.<p><li> The high turnover has facilitated both principals' efforts to recruit like-minded staff. While we cannot say with certainty why turnover is so high, several conditions are common to both schools, in particular low pay and difficult teaching conditions.<p><li> "Student-as-worker" is a common Coalition aphorism. This notion is often juxtaposed with what the Coalition views as the more traditional classroom conception of schooling -- "teacher-as-deliverer-of-instruction." In brief, this aphorism implies that students should be the active worker in the classroom, rather than the teacher.  		"Personalization" is an aspect of school reform explicitly advocated by the Coalition. Put simply, it means that in order for students to learn to use their minds well, teachers need to know their students well -- both what they can and what they cannot do. Thus, schools need to "personalize" the relationship between students and faculty. In practice, the Coalition often asserts that this means most schools need to work to reduce their student:teacher ratios. The Coalition maintains that this ratio should be no more than 80:1. 		These ideas are stated in the Coalition's Common Principles 5 and 4, respectively.<p><li> What we are suggesting is that it is important to look at all people at the school site, that is, everyone along the continuum from the strong advocates who push for change to those completely against change. While one important subgroup along the continuum are those who resisted change and then later embraced it, others too play a crucial role in determining the outcome of change. Much of the research on school change has looked hardest at the people who have advocated change; but without a balance, it is hard to understand why so little often results from change efforts. McLaughlin (1990) also advocates studying the resistant and the skeptical to better understand what happens in school change efforts over time.<p><li> In brief, the Coalition maintains that a school's number one priority should be intellectual, to help students "learn to use their minds well" (CES 1985).  The critique that underlies this assertion is that American schools often attempt to do too much (drug counseling, prenatal care, and driver education, for instance), and that the status accorded some nonacademic activities -- such as athletic contests, plays, or social events -- may distort the importance of a school's intellectual purpose.<p><li> This sense of having to tackle everything at once can be exacerbated if faculty and administrators feel that they do not have adequate time to address these crucial issues.<p><li> Hart's (1990) interesting study of the effects of the redesign of teacher work on the quality of school life also reveals increased contentiousness once aspects of leadership and decision-making are made problematic rather than taken for granted. She quotes one teacher who remarked that "there is more contention in the faculty meetings now because the administration is willing to listen, and talk means something" (p. 518).<p><li>  Hampel (1990) has also reported that these two principles were most often the starting points for reform in a sample of Coalition schools that he was tracking longitudinally.<p><li>  The urban alternative school of choice is again an exception to this point.<p><li> At a number of our study sites, the reform effort has generated such intrafaculty tensions that some faculty have sought transfers and others have left teaching altogether.<p><li> Sizer, too, has expressed a sense of the Coalition's being naive in focusing on the triangle as the primary focus of school change efforts. In a meeting with the Coalition's Committee on Evaluation, he remarked:<blockquote>I went to the [President of ECS] . . . and said, "In my opinion, the Coalition is too big and too small. It's too big for us to really understand what's going on, given our scale; and it's too small to have any leverage if anything works." He went away and thought about it and came back and said, "Yes, you're too big and you're too small -- and you're too naive." And the naiveté was our lack of attention to state political [concerns]. Unless you have support vertically in a state -- the governor through the newest appointed teacher in a school building -- you're gonna get creamed.</blockquote><p><li> At the one school where the faculty raised serious objections to the structure of their school's Coalition program and acted to change it, the entire issue of Coalition membership became so problematic that the school nearly left the Coalition altogether, and their continued membership remained uncertain.<p><li> Eubanks and Parish (1987) made a similar point: "Serious efforts to bring about reform require, among other things, regular time set aside during the work week to permit teachers and administrators to plan and implement effective change" (p. 614).<p><li> The Coalition's conception of an exhibition, by creating a mechanism for collaboratively assessing students' performance, could offer one means to address these concerns. Yet, the exhibition represents one of those "schoolwide" reforms that have proven difficult to implement. Of our seven study schools, only two have made the exhibition a graduation requirement. </ol><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="refe"><hr><center><h2>References</h2></center><hr>Coalition of Essential Schools. 1985. <i>Prospectus</i>.

(2) To impart or bestow power to an end or for a purpose; to enable, permit. (3) To bestow power upon; make powerful.1</blockquote><p>In examining two schools' explicit efforts to empower students, we found that administrators and teachers operated as if they took these conceptions of empowerment literally. They seemed to assume that granting power inevitably leads to sharing power and to view empowerment as a one-way process initiated by those with power and done to those without. <p>	We found the empowerment process to be more problematic than a literal interpretation of the <i>O.E.D. </i>definition might suggest. We argue that these definitions are overly simplistic and misleading and that school personnel operating in terms of the assumptions embodied in these definitions can undermine efforts to create and negotiate student empowerment. Specifically, we contend that the schools in our case studies encountered problems with the empowerment process because they tended to 1) view empowerment as a straightforward, one-way process <i>initiated by </i>faculty and administration and <i>done to </i>students; 2) assume a shared definition of empowerment and to employ the concept without clearly defining its parameters; 3) define empowerment in their own terms without any student input; and 4) promote student empowerment at their own initiative and convenience and with limited preliminary planning.<p>	Much recent research in education has shown that teachers have been both de-skilled and unempowered as schools have become more and more bureaucratized.2 Moreover, students have long been viewed as passive recipients of information in schools, not as active participants in a school community.3 Through more recent efforts to empower teachers (such as school-based management and teacher-leader projects), teachers are being given more of a voice in the school community. The rhetoric of the Coalition of Essential Schools (and other reform efforts) suggests that students, too, should be given more of a voice in their schools. Even though less research about students exists, our ongoing work suggests that students are nonentities in many school contexts, although the institution is (ostensibly) designed to serve them and to attend to their needs.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tgop"><h3>The Gift of Power</h3>At our study schools, the issue of student empowerment was complicated because for many school people, the term is an oxymoron. It is not that teachers and administrators deliberately deny students power; often they simply do not appear to think about it one way or the other. The faculty and administration in our case studies approached the issue of student empowerment with considerable optimism; yet many revealing forces -- from mistrust of student motivations to a preoccupation with order and control to a general disregard for student opinion -- restricted the degree of innovation and student involvement.<p>	Because the sharing or transfer of power came from administrators and teachers and was bestowed upon students, without necessarily any involvement by them in the process, we will examine these instances of student empowerment as if they were gifts, following Mauss4 and, more recently, Larson.5 As Mauss points out in his classic work <i>The Gift</i>: <p><blockquote>The bond that the gift creates between the donor and the recipient is . . . strong. . . . The recipient is in a state of dependence upon the donor. . . . The gift is thus something that must be given, that must be received and that is, at the same time, dangerous to accept. The gift itself constitutes an irrevocable link.6 </blockquote><p>Larson, too, suggests that gift-giving can be a useful way to think about why people have mixed reactions to efforts to empower them. Writing about workers' reactions to participatory management structures, she discusses efforts to create shared decision making:<blockquote>Many workers have learned "their place" in organizations. Consultants often find that workers believe management is making an effort to do something for them that it does not have to do. This thinking reflects their internalization of the dominant management ideology that assumes managers make decisions and workers carry them out. Any change from this ideology is unexpected and, therefore, often perceived as a gift. <i>It is difficult for people to critically examine the value of a gift. . . . </i>[I]f people are operating from within the dominant ideology of management, their expectations are constrained by the values of that ideology. Workers' expectations for inclusion in management decision making are so low that they are easily impressed with minimal participation in decisions and have limited expectations of true participation in an emergent participative management ideology.7 (emphasis added)</blockquote><p>	In the cases we present in this paper, students can be viewed as the recipients of the gift of empower-ment. Their reactions are somewhat similar to those described by Larson; that is, they had limited expectations that they would be true participants in the decision-making process, but they differed from workers by being less impressed with the minimal participation in decision making that they experienced. Instead, as illustrated in the cases, students expressed deep suspicions about and distrust of the empowerment they were being offered. We argue that as long as empowerment is bestowed by the powerful on the less powerful, the dangers and cautions that Mauss presents will be relevant, the reactions that Larson describes and that we also document will be present, and empowerment will be difficult to achieve. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="osos"><h3>Our Study of Student Empowerment</h3>Given our criticism of the assumptions embodied in the <i>O.E.D. </i>definition and the unspoken assumptions held by teachers and administrators regarding student empowerment, we address the issue of student empowerment by asking: Is empowerment a process someone can do to another? Can anyone empower an unwilling or disinterested other (in this case, students)? And ultimately, whose definition of empowerment prevails? <p><h4>Focus of the Study</h4>To investigate these questions, we examine five dimensions of the empowerment efforts that we observed. <p>	First, we consider what power administrators and teachers considered shifting to students. Although in both case studies, neither faculty nor administration were explicit about the power being transferred to students, issues of power were implicit in their interactions. <p>	Second, we look at the processes by which the two schools in our case studies attempted to empower students -- both of which focused on creating formal structures to elicit critical student input. <p>Third, we examine whether a shared definition of empowerment was ever sought or achieved. We are not the first to consider the significance of such a concern. Edward Sapir, for instance, began his classic essay on culture by raising this very issue:<blockquote>There are certain terms that have a peculiar property. Ostensibly, they mark off specific concepts, concepts that lay claim to a rigorously objective validity. In practice, they label vague terrains of thought that shift or narrow or widen with the point of view of who so makes use of them.8</blockquote><p>	We argue that <i>student empowerment </i>is a term many believe has a "rigorously objective validity." Yet, we have found this term actually "label[s] vague terrains of thought that shift or narrow or widen as the point of view of who so makes use of them."9 Beyond examining whether students, teachers, and administrators shared a definition of empowerment, we consider a related question: Do all these parties view the process(es) as empowering students? <p>	Fourth, and tied to this third issue, we discuss how students responded to these proposed changes. Rather than assuming that students are passive receptors of these reforms, substantial research indicates that students are "active participants in the dynamic interaction which [makes] any one class [and we might add "and any one school"] what it [is] on any given day."10 In this regard, we incorporated into our case studies both formal and informal student responses to change -- the formal is represented by student responses in the structured, institutional arrangements created to elicit their input; the informal refers to the more spontaneous, unofficial student reactions to change.<p>	Finally, we consider the place of such larger questions as, What power legitimately belongs to students in the empowerment process? Although faculties discussed this topic, neither school ever resolved the question of appropriate student power and neither school ever included students in these discussions. <p><h4>Context of the Study</h4>Both case studies for this article were conducted at schools belonging to the Coalition of Essential Schools, an ambitious school reform project aimed at improving teaching and learning in American schools. Begun in 1984, the Coalition includes schools representing a cross-section of American education -- the membership includes public, private, parochial, urban, suburban, and rural schools. Unlike many reform efforts, the Coalition emphatically rejects the notion of centralized and standardized solutions to school problems. Instead, it celebrates the diversity of its member schools and stresses that it is a grassroots movement. Consistent with this grassroots orientation, the nine Common Principles that form the basis of this reform are ambiguous by design; each member school is to interpret and act upon the principles within its own cultural and institutional context. Nonetheless, the Coalition does espouse a single overarching goal: "to help students learn to use their minds well."11<p>	One common interpretation of Coalition philosophy is that students should be empowered to take responsibility for their own learning.12 In Coalition rhetoric and writings, empowerment is presented as a desirable end, one closely linked with the goal of creating internally consistent and effective schools and thinking, probing, analytical students.13 In <i>Horace's Compromise</i>, his popular critique of American secondary education that provided the impetus for creating the Coalition, Theodore R. Sizer observed: <p><blockquote>Adolescents have far more power than they display, or are asked to or are expected to display, in most schools. We assume they will be truant, late, irresponsible -- and that prophecy is self-fulfilling. We assume they cannot figure things out for themselves, so we tell them things. Paradoxically, we are conspirators, often with them, in their depen-dence. Happy dependence is a pleasant state for many adolescents. If little is asked of them, their risk of failure is likewise small. . . . </blockquote><blockquote>No one is flattered more than when his help is solicited. People, adolescents included, respond to challenge, and they feel personal esteem when their power is recognized and sought. A school which assumes that students will respond to challenge, rather than shrink from it, will be effective.14 </blockquote><p>Similarly, Grant Wiggins, one of the Coalition's first staff members, observed that "[s]tudents should have a major role in the on-going evaluation of current Coalition experiments."15 <p>	As yet, the Coalition Central Staff has not provided a comprehensive or definitive statement about what constitutes empowerment. This is not surprising. Although the term has become popular, empowerment is not a central tenet of Coalition philosophy (the previous citations of Sizer and Wiggins notwithstanding). <p>	Furthermore, because of the Coalition's emphasis on local interpretation, member schools are encouraged to interpret the Common Principles within their own community context and with their own student body and faculty in mind. The Coalition, therefore, self-consciously avoids making broad interpretive pronouncements on <i>any aspect </i>of the Common Principles. Nonetheless, aspects of student and teacher empowerment are implied in Coalition philosophy, as students assume a greater role in determining the course of their education (see note 15) and faculty begin to make decisions previously delegated to others (e.g., budgetary allocations, policy development, and curriculum design). <p>	Although our analysis has critical implications for the two schools in our case studies, we emphasize that these were two of the few schools we have visited (Coalition members or otherwise) that have even <i>begun </i>to confront the issue of student empowerment. For most schools, student empowerment is not a priority. Issues of student rights and equal educational opportunity may have concerned American educators and jurists since the initiation of student activism movements in the 1960s,16 but recent Supreme Court rulings -- from permitting searches of student lockers without a warrant to awarding administrators the ultimate power to censor school newspapers -- underscore the paternalistic attitude toward students characteristic of American schooling.17 It is within this context that we examine these efforts at student empowerment. <p>	The data used to prepare this paper derive from ethnographic research conducted between 1986 and 1990 among the Coalition's Central Staff and a sample of early member schools. Research in our sample schools involved both observation and interviewing. We attended classes, school assemblies, planning-period meetings (a set time for teachers to meet to discuss students and their programs -- an innovation common to Coalition schools), and extracurricular school events. <p>	As these case studies of student empowerment demonstrate, our presence in several schools (as well as our work with the Central Staff) allowed us to see parallel processes in different schools attempting to create significant structural and behavioral change in accord with the Coalition's Common Principles. The two case studies that follow explore student empowerment with regard to two issues -- the bell system and a grading policy -- at different Coalition schools.18 We first present each of the cases and then discuss their relationships to the issues raised above.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="c1"><hr><center><h2>Case I:<br>A Timely Issue: Student-Faculty Government and the Bells</h2></center><hr>Barrett Preparatory School, one of the first schools to join the Coalition of Essential Schools, is a private, K-12 school with an enrollment of approximately 250 students located in a major suburb of a large eastern U.S. city. Since joining the Coalition, Barrett has undertaken several restructuring and reform activities. This case study examines one such effort, the General Assembly, a student-faculty governance organization intended to promote greater student involvement in the decision-making process at the school. <p>	A student executive committee, elected by the entire upper-school student body, along with their faculty advisor direct the General Assembly. Once a week students in grades 9-12 and all available faculty and administrative staff meet for the "general meeting," a forty-minute session devoted to discussing issues deemed of interest to all parties. The agenda for the meeting is determined by the executive committee, which consists of the officers-at-large, student members, and a faculty advisor. Anyone can raise an issue during the "new business" portion of the meeting. The headmaster receives a copy of the agenda and often meets with the Assembly's president prior to the meeting. Although administration and faculty attend these meetings, their votes hold no additional weight. They participate as "regular" members, waiting for the chair, a student, to recognize them before offering opinions. The headmaster, however, reserves the right to veto any decision made by the Assembly. Should he choose to veto a decision, his veto is final: it cannot be overridden.19 <p>	A typical General Assembly meeting is run in accordance with Robert's Rules of Order and the chair conducts the meeting using modified parliamentary procedures. The meeting is structured as follows: after students and faculty have filed in and found seats, the chair calls the meeting to order. Normally, several calls for order are made before the room quiets enough to conduct business. Announcements are the first order of business. Faculty, administration, and students use this time to note upcoming events, to request volunteers for various projects, and in general to keep each other informed about events happening at the school. As Barrett has no daily bulletin or intercom system, announcements are often lengthy and dominated by faculty and administrative notices (such as upcoming exams, deadlines for trips, etc.). After completing the announcements, "old business" is taken up. If the discussion of old business is concluded, new business is considered. Meetings adjourn roughly at the end of the period. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tdob"><h3>The Debate on Bells</h3>Early in the fall of 1987, one of the first issues considered was a motion to discuss recent changes in the bell system. Previously, bells had rung to signal the beginning and end of each class. Over the summer the administration decided to abolish the use of bells. In part, this decision reflected feelings by some faculty and administrators that bells were inappropriate and disruptive. They believed students could be responsible for managing their own time and getting from class to class promptly. They also hoped that removing the bells might create a more "relaxing" atmosphere, since the bells could be quite "jarring" and their absence would avoid a "crunch time" of student congestion in the halls by staggering class dismissals. Finally, for the double-period seminars (a major component to Barrett's pedagogical and structural reform), the administration thought each teacher should determine when to take a break rather than having bells dictate the flow of class time. <p>	In the course of the meeting, students, however, voiced concerns about the lack of bells. They felt they were being held responsible for being tardy when it was not their fault. They complained that many rooms lacked clocks or had unsynchronized clocks so dismissals were poorly coordinated. Both students and faculty expressed concern about the "orderliness" of the school without the bells and indicated that the length of time students were taking to pass between classes had expanded from the previous three-to-five minutes to almost fifteen minutes because of confusion about who was dismissed and where people should be. Occasionally, the students and teachers who were scheduled to use a classroom would arrive before the previous class had been dismissed, creating additional confusion. Some teachers and students felt the confusion was genuine; others felt students were exploiting the ambiguity of the present "bell-less" situation to socialize longer with friends and avoid class. Some faculty claimed that the lack of bells and lengthened passing time created disruptions that hampered their efforts to begin class on time. <p>	There are two points worth noting about the debate at this meeting. First, the faculty was split on this issue. The previous school year the idea was proposed at a faculty meeting but was rejected by a faculty vote. Many faculty resented the headmaster's decision and felt he was using the General Assembly to insure the elimination of the bells and to disregard the faculty vote. Also, they had discussed the bells informally as well as at a faculty meeting early that fall. Some were more vocal than many students about wanting the bells returned. The various faculty views were aired at the General Assembly, interspersed with student views. The forum thus provided an opportunity for students and faculty to listen and react to one another's opinions and concerns. <p>	The second point is that there was no dominant student opinion on the issue. Students adamantly disagreed about whether they felt more or less responsible and respectful under the new system. Both sides presented reasons for why its view represented the more responsible and respectful position. Those in favor of reinstituting the bells argued that, under the bell system, they were only responsible for themselves. Without bells, they became responsible for reminding teachers to dismiss them so as to avoid being tardy to their next class. In fact, they even contended that not having bells interfered with their education because they now paid more attention to the clock than they had when they could rely on the bell. <p>	Students opposed to the bell system maintained that the atmosphere was more relaxed without bells. Their absence made classroom behavior more respectful because people did not cut short a teacher or student speaking by jumping up as the bell rang. And they added that they felt more in control of their day without the bells and that they expected students would become more responsible about getting to class on time if the administration just gave the bell-less day more time.<p>	As the discussion continued at the meeting, a consensus began emerge among General Assembly members that the bells were important and that their absence created an ever-escalating series of negative consequences. Strong pro-bell arguments were made by several students and faculty members. The anti-bell position became increasingly linked to the administration, with students arguing that they had not been given a choice about whether to have bells or what a bell schedule, if reinstituted, might look like (that is, should bells ring each period or just at key points during the day?). Debate over the bell issue, often heated, was reframed now as an issue of whether students had the related power to determine the bell schedule. Many differing opinions were offered. The meeting adjourned without closure. <p>	Debate continued at the next meeting. Several students and the headmaster proposed options for the reinstatement of the bells. Discussion was again lengthy and punctuated by intermittent applause as proponents of the various motions stated their cases. Eventually one option, presented by a student, appeared most agreeable to all. The options officially on the floor -- an initial motion and an amendment by the headmaster -- were withdrawn and the student offered his motion: the first three or four weeks of school (which had already passed) would serve as a bell-less experiment; beginning the next week, the bells would be reinstated completely for a two-to-three-week trial period; then, the General Assembly would vote to determine which system they preferred. The motion passed and the meeting adjourned.<p>	Reaction to the return of the bells was uniformly negative. Not long into the experimental period, most students realized they preferred being bell-less. When the two-week trial period with bells ended, the issue was brought up for reconsideration, and the General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to remove the bells.20 Since then, the bells have been turned off.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="aoe"><h3>Ambiguitites of Empowerment</h3>In terms of the dimensions outlined in the introduction, this case highlights some of the ambiguities associated with student empowerment. The bell issue represented one of the first substantive issues tackled by the fledgling General Assembly. It was a topic that divided the entire school -- faculty, students, and administration. The power being shared involved resolving a situation in which there was substantial disagreement about what was best for all concerned. <p>	Since attendance at the General Assembly was mandatory, all parties (students, faculty, and administration) were present for discussion; but, of course, active participation could not be forced. In the bells debate, many students actively participated. Many offered no opinion publicly but expressed strong feelings in interviews or informally in other settings. Still others expressed a total lack of interest in the issue. For example, in a "focus group" interview with members of the junior class during the fall of 1987, all the students present agreed that they preferred not having bells. One student summed up the dominant position: "At first I wanted my bells back, but now that they are here, I don't want bells." In a focus group interview with sophomores, they dismissed the topic without comment, preferring to discuss school spirit and the strengths and weaknesses of the current academic schedule and teaching approach.<p>	Beyond the specific issue of the bells, not all students viewed the General Assembly as empowering. In group interviews by grade level, several students claimed that the only ones who benefited from the General Assembly were the teachers and administrators who used Assembly time to make announcements and a few seniors who controlled the student executive committee. One student suggested that faculty and administrators wanted the General Assembly because it would be an impressive public relations item. As he put it, <p><blockquote>I think they wanted to have it so at meetings with other high schools they could say, "Well, in [General] Assembly we have parliamentary procedure and it's really working well, and the students get everything done that they want and we have bright, bright students." I think that was the bottom line.</blockquote><p>Another student said, <p><blockquote>I think [the headmaster] decided to take away the bells so we would have a topic in General Assembly. . . . Just to have something to talk about; just to see what we would do with it.</blockquote><p>	Despite such common negative and somewhat cynical perceptions, students were virtually unanimous in praising the General Assembly's accomplishments during the 1987-88 school year -- first, because the Assembly elected a leader who kept meetings on task and, second, because it addressed issues of more general interest than it had the previous year. As a consequence of this student ambivalence, it was unclear whether students saw the General Assembly as a source of empowerment.<p>	For teachers, the General Assembly, by providing a forum to negotiate issues of governance, appears to have been conceived as a way to prepare themselves and their students for a restructuring -- or at least a renegotiating -- of decision-making power at Barrett. The faculty's reaction to this formal mechanism suggests that they saw it as a viable means for addressing issues of governance, and, implicitly, student empowerment. Their concern that the students would be "used" by administrators to override or undermine faculty decisions suggested that they viewed some power as shifting -- in this case, away from them. <p>	Finally, in the headmaster's view, the General Assembly represented one of many "teaching" strategies designed to help students learn to address difficult questions and make thoughtful decisions, in this case questions and decisions related to the entire school community. For him, the Assembly was part of a larger educational process, the goal of which was to help "students learn appropriate habits of mind." To this end it was unnecessary to determine conclusively whether the General Assembly was empowering. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wtse"><h3>Were the Students Empowered?</h3>Whether the General Assembly was perceived as a forum for students to raise issues, a component of broader educational processes, a means for the headmaster to reopen for further consideration issues the faculty considered resolved, or something else altogether likely influenced the eventual assessment of whether power was genuinely shared or transferred among the parties. Because no one party (student, teacher, or administrator) ever sought to clarify the notion of empowerment, these assessments about the sharing of power varied considerably. Ascertaining whether power was shared or transferred thus was quite problematic. <p>	While the headmaster may have subordinated the empowerment aspect of the Assembly to its educational purposes (since the Assembly needed participation to function), student and faculty views about whether this forum was empowering were probably relevant in that they affected student and faculty involvement in General Assembly meetings and sponsored activities. And the overwhelming majority of students -- in response to a survey conducted in 1989 -- said that the General Assembly was not important to them. The most common responses were that it was "a waste of time" and that "nothing ever gets accomplished." In focus groups during the 1987-88 academic year, many students made statements such as this one by a senior: "You can initiate discussion in General Assembly, but I don't think anything's going to be done." Another student commented that "[The Assembly] is boring and stupid and [the headmaster] vetoes most of what we propose to him anyway." One Barrett teacher cynically and privately suggested voting in the permanent return of the bells simply to see whether the headmaster would veto it: "If he thinks something is right, he'll get it one way or another."<p>	This example of Barrett's General Assembly highlights one other major consideration relevant to student empowerment: the significance of ascertaining <i>whose </i>definition of empowerment frames the issue. From the headmaster's point of view, it did not matter whether students felt empowered; the educational experience was foremost. The faculty helped create the General Assembly as a mechanism to promote student empowerment, and they brought the bells issue to this forum, but it appears that creating the structure alone was insufficient to engender student empowerment. For students, the divisions among their ranks regarding the value of the Assembly suggested at least that empowerment was not a uniform process; it may not even have been looked upon as desirable by everyone. The second case study, drawn from a different context, illustrates these dimensions of empowerment in similar ways.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="c2"><hr><center><h2>Case II:<br>Grappling with Grades</h2></center><hr>Earvin High School is a comprehensive, urban high school located in a northeast city and serving a student population composed primarily of racial and ethnic minorities. At one time, Earvin competed for students with the local "classical" high school, even attracting students from surrounding communities without public high schools because of its reputation. The decade prior to Earvin's involvement with the Coalition, however, it experienced a period of decline characterized by high principal turnover (twelve in thirteen years), building disrepair, rising drop-out rates, and falling attendance rates.<p>	Working together, the local school department, teachers' union, the school faculty and administration, and the Coalition's Central Staff created a school-within-a-school at Earvin by freeing for one semester a team of teachers (four subject teachers and one "head teacher" who administered the program and taught one class) to design their school, using the Coalition's Common Principles as a general guide. To assist the team, the Coalition created the position of "clinical professor." These persons, with specialties in social studies and English, participated in team planning sessions, consulted with teachers on curricular issues, advised student-teachers, and generally did what they could to promote school change at Earvin. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="aigp"><h3>An Innovative Grading Policy</h3>The "Essential School" created by the Coalition team included a number of differences from the more traditional, larger school. One that proved especially significant concerned the grading policy. Believing that students were often passed on to succeeding grades by compromising teachers who awarded low-Cs and Ds because students were present for most classes and caused no major disruptions, this team sought to create a structure that would encourage student engagement with their school work and promote mastery of their subject materials. To accomplish this goal, the team decided that the Essential School would award only three grades -- A, B, and "Incomplete." Students failing to earn a grade of at least 80 on their work received an Incomplete and the work was returned for them to redo. If Incompletes remained at the end of the quarter or if students simply failed to do an assignment, they received an Incomplete for that term, which would remain on their records until all work was satisfactorily completed. <p>	Describing how this grading scheme would promote "mastery," the head teacher explained: "The A-B-I system creates a struggle but, as a consequence, we end up teaching more because we can't give a kid an easy C. It creates a wall we both have to get over." In addition, he felt this system would motivate students to complete work they had missed because "in the past, [making up a missed assignment in order to earn a C at best] wouldn't provide much motivation . . . but now they can work for a decent grade as opposed to busting their butt for only a C." On parents' night, the science teacher explained it this way: "The point is that kids are forced to learn. They can't just say, 'Well, I flunked it.'" <p>	Initially, then, the Essential School faculty saw the A-B-I grading system as a positive change. During the school year, however, the system proved problematic. Many students never made up their Incompletes. Rather than redoing work and earning a higher grade as the faculty expected, many students simply ignored their Incomplete work. Moreover, as the quarters passed, the number of Incompletes mounted. In the first quarter, 74 of the Essential School's 97 students received at least one grade of Incomplete; in the second quarter 68 of 98 did; and, in the third quarter 65 of 104 received at least one Incomplete. <p>	While these figures might be seen as a sign that the Incomplete issue was slowly improving, Incompletes from previous quarters were seldom completed, so the problem was actually worsening. Besides the frustration engendered by this apparent student apathy, the myriad dittos and record-keeping procedures required to coordinate Incomplete make-ups drained faculty energy and time.<p>	In addition, overt student resistance to this grading system began to surface. The prospect of never failing excited some students; but as others realized that teachers would adhere to the standard of 80-or-better and Incompletes piled up on student report cards, students began to criticize this system. In an interview, one student voiced a sentiment that grew increasingly popular throughout the school year: "Why should I not pass if I have a 70, and 70 is passing in the rest of the school?" In fact, as the number of Incompletes grew with each passing quarter, more and more students maintained that the Essential School should expand the A-B-I system and reinstitute the C.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="psi"><h3>Promoting Student Input</h3>As student opposition became increasingly vocal, the Essential School staff began to consider ways they might resolve this problem. Most of the deliberations occurred during the twice-weekly "planning periods," when the entire Essential School faculty, the clinical professors, and student-teachers met to discuss various issues relevant to the program. In these sessions, three interrelated issues often arose: What was to be done about the number of Incompletes? What should be the future of the A-B-I grading system? And, how much say would students have in the program? <p>	Intertwined in these discussions was a faculty sense that student empowerment was an estimable goal that might help them resolve these other concerns. In the first month of school, for instance, the team instituted town meetings, advisory groups, and the Leadership Council -- each structure designed, in part, to promote student input in running the Essential School and thereby assumed to promote student empowerment as well. Town meetings involved the entire Essential School population by providing a forum to propose school activities, air student concerns, and recommend policy. In advisory groups, students met with a teacher or clinical professor to discuss matters the Essential School team had identified. The Leadership Council was a student-elected body intended to serve as a liaison between Essential School students and the faculty as well as a forum for proposing social activities. <p>	Prior to the first town meeting, the head teacher discussed a theme that would run through faculty discourse the entire year: how faculty actions could empower students: <p><blockquote>[Town meetings will] allow students to voice general concerns that they have. We'll probably have to be prepared to defend ourselves. We'll let students speak and eventually those with good common sense will speak out and the big mouths won't be the only ones heard. . . . Even if they don't come up with any resolution, [going through the process] will be good. Student councils, to my experience, seldom allow students to talk about things that matter. . . . [But] we want to let kids discuss their program. . . . They can't just <i>feel </i>like they're part of this plan, they have to <i>be</i> part of it.</blockquote><p>	Advisory groups were perceived in a similar vein, as offering a means by which faculty "can get feedback from students about various issues." They had a similar view of the Leadership Council. As one teacher commented: "Students will take [our program] more seriously if we do this. I may try to tie the [Leadership Council] in with my social studies class. I want to convey the message that this is important." Yet, by the end of the year, two of these forums would be defunct and the third would face an uncertain future.<p>	This view of empowerment as beneficial, necessary, and desired carried throughout the school year. When considering a proposal by the Leadership Council to gauge whether the Essential School had been adhering to the Coalition's Common Principles, the head teacher told the team: <p><blockquote>I think it's exciting. . . . Students are going to create a dialogue and we'll have to jump into it and defend what we're doing. In a very positive sense, it'll be a means for students to discuss the program. . . . It's beginning to be a group decision-making process. </blockquote><p>	When discussing the A-B-I issue in March, he again noted the value of student input: "Before we make suggestions, let's decide if it's effective or not. . . . We need feedback from the people it affects most: the students." Even in May, after more than six months of overt student resistance, the team still acknowledged the potential of student involvement. As one teacher commented, "If [students] have power to make decisions that will stick, the kids will do it."<p>	Although the Essential School team supported the notion of student empowerment, they had a sense of the limits to student power. In planning for a town meeting, one teacher remarked, "We can let kids discuss their concerns, but we have to prepare them psychologically for the fact that some concerns aren't within their power to change." More clearly delineating their official institutional influence, a clinical professor told the Leadership Council, <p><blockquote>It's important that you know the power of the town meeting. . . . You don't have absolute power with regard to changing the lavatory and locker privileges and assessing the program in terms of the Common Principles, but you do with regard to the Halloween party. </blockquote><p>	When it became evident that the A-B-I grading system was proving difficult, the faculty was at first hesitant to solicit student input. When this grading change became a serious issue in mid-November (the end of the first marking period), it was proposed that the faculty discuss the problem with the students. However, a teacher and a clinical professor both argued that this would "undermine [student] confidence in the program" and that "too many kids [would] manipulate this information to their benefit." In December, with the A-B-I problem still very real, the staff decided to request student input through advisory groups. In so doing, they discovered overwhelming opposition to this policy and substantial support for reinstituting the grade of C. In mid-January, advisory groups again reviewed the grading system and again students expressed disapproval. <p>	By late January, a group of students developed a questionnaire to elicit student feedback on a range of issues relevant to the Essential School, including the grading policy. The head teacher agreed to distribute the questionnaire, but before it was distributed, advisory groups once more discussed the A-B-I issue. Students again voiced displeasure. When the questionnaire results were tabulated, as expected, the grading policy received enormous criticism. (Summarizing student responses, the head teacher said, "The A-B-I system got bombed.") Compared with other categories, the grading policy received the most negative responses and the second-fewest positive comments -- just behind "phone calls home for homework and discipline reasons." In mid-April, the grading system was presented to students for discussion for the fourth time, and again teachers and the clinical professors reported significant opposition.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rc"><h3>Related Concerns</h3>Besides concerns with student empowerment and their reactions to the grading policy, the Essential School team struggled with a series of other concerns that emanated from their decision to adhere solely to grades of A, B, and I. For example, in mid-October some teachers admitted to "inflating" student grades so that students would receive at least an 80. As one student-teacher commented: <p><blockquote>I don't have a problem with the C. . . . I feel I may have been inflating grades anyway, especially after students had turned things in five or six times. . . . Looking at these A and B students, I wonder if they are really A and B students.</blockquote><p>Earlier in the year, the math teacher had made a similar observation. Although the nature of his discipline prevented straight grade inflation, his compromise entailed "helping" students complete work they had difficulty with so that they could earn the 80. <p>	In a November planning-period meeting, the team identified other problems associated with their grading policy. These included the possibility that students might copy one another's make-up work ("If a student turns in a paper four weeks late, how do you know they didn't copy?") or that it might be unfair for students to earn the same or even better grades on make-up work as those who completed work on time ("I couldn't live with myself. . . . Those taking the test for the third time got the highest grades. If I thought they were really learning it, I wouldn't mind"). <p>	As student opposition and logistical problems arising from this controversial grading format built throughout the school year, the C gradually became a part of the Essential School program. In February one teacher suggested that Cs might be more equitable for make-up work; otherwise, teachers might be shortchanging students who completed work on time. In May, the Essential School decided that students withdrawing from the program with course averages in the 70s would receive Cs on their transfer records21 and that students with grades of Incomplete but averages in the 70s would remain eligible for sports. Within the Essential School, the team's stance shifted to the point where they decided to accept the C for some classwork, though students still had to maintain an overall average of 80. <p>	In June, the C was officially accepted for all student work. At a key planning-period meeting, numerous arguments favoring the C surfaced. After a year's struggling and reflection, teachers now viewed the C as a "realistic goal" that would "reduce student anxiety." Others mentioned that "some kids work hard and can only get Cs." Furthermore, throughout the second semester, the head teacher lobbied heavily for a decision -- any decision -- on this issue. He had lived with the controversy and associated administrative head-aches all year and was tired of it. From his perspective, <p><blockquote>The grading system isn't an answer. [Rather, it] presents a meaningless obstacle. I see kids [who were] used to doing nothing [now] working their tails off [and] getting Cs, . . . so it doesn't change the learning we want to see take place.</blockquote><p>	With the school year ending, the head teacher wanted closure on this issue.22 When pushed to a decision, the teachers voted 6-to-2 to expand the grade range by five points to include the C, from 79 to 75. The vote was taken on June 26, approximately a week and a half after students stopped attending classes. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wtse2"><h3>Were the Students Empowered?</h3>At the end of the June 26 meeting, one team member commented that the vote to include a C <p><blockquote>will show kids that they're being empowered. . . . If we didn't offer the 75, we'd be sending a very negative message to the kids. It would be like saying, "We're asking for your opinion, but we really don't care what it is."</blockquote><p>	For many students, however, a negative message had already been conveyed. Their feelings had been clear since November, yet they saw little formal action. In addition, students learned of the faculty's decision so late that it seemed inconsequential. As one student asserted in his advisory group the following fall, "When we have these meetings, nothing ever gets done. When we suggest something, nothing happens. . . . We've asked for about 20 things and only got one. That's a bad percentage." Another claimed, "Every time we bring something up at these meetings, it goes in one ear and out the other."<p>	From the head teacher's perspective, three factors prevented the faculty from acting more directly on student objections to the grading system. First, they had no hard data to go on until well into the school year. A large numbers of Incompletes appeared during the first quarter, but given the novelty of this grading approach, the team did not want to abandon their innovation before it was fully tested. Second, they had no precedent on which to base a decision. As the head teacher explained, "It seemed inconsequential to rest our decision [solely] on student objections." Finally, the head teacher feared that acquiescing too quickly to student demands would lead to abuse by students: "Divulging our own questions would . . . [leave] the program open to manipulation."<p>	Still, students may have responded as they did simply because they did not fully understand the situation. An exchange between students and a clinical professor in an advisory group, for example, suggested that some students were not even aware of the connection between the grading policy and intellectual mastery, the central element in the faculty's adherence to the A-B-I policy. After hearing students complain about not having Cs, the clinical professor explained, "From the teachers' point of view, we want to create a school where students master skills." Students reacted quickly: "How will school be good if everyone gets Incompletes?" and "Obviously, it isn't working." The clinical professor responded, "Your teachers are saying that you have to learn [this material]. The idea is that you keep getting chances to learn it rather than saying you failed it. Does that make any sense?" Immediately, a student replied, "No." Another added, "Making us do all this work makes me not want to learn. That's what makes me mad. So I say I'll do nothing." In this instance, at least, empowerment might have been promoted through better communication.<p>	In this case study, as in the first, empowerment involved soliciting student input as the basis for shaping program policy. Although the team created three forums for this purpose among others -- town meetings, advisory groups, and the Leadership Council -- the parameters of their power and appropriate student roles were never systematically clarified, either for students or faculty. This lack of clarity seems to have influenced how both groups viewed the empowerment process. What teachers saw as empowering for students (forums the faculty created to allow students to express their opinions), many students viewed as virtually insignificant and/or they had no conception of how or why such a forum should have been empowering. Even the basis for the faculty's adherence to the A-B-I grading system -- the desire to promote student mastery of course materials -- was not clear to some students. <p>	Moreover, those who initiated the empowerment process (faculty and administrators) seemed ambi-valent about what power students should have. At the year's end, teachers emphasized that student input had caused the grading change, but the faculty had at first been hesitant to solicit any student input. Furthermore, although the faculty highlighted the role played by students in enacting this policy change, concerns with grade inflation, record-keeping procedures, and student cheating also influenced the faculty's decision. <p>	Another factor that may have influenced this process was students' responses to the faculty's efforts at empowerment. Some faculty clearly felt that students were manipulating the situation, somehow violating the faculty's trust. Yet, student manipulation was <i>ad hoc </i>at best, given that their input was limited and two of their three forums eventually proved to be short-lived. Moreover, since these forums for promoting student empowerment were novel for both students and faculty, it seemed (from an outsider's perspective) that it would take time for students to appreciate the value of these forums as well as to learn how they best functioned. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tfos"><hr><center><h2>The Fate of Student Empowerment</h2></center><hr>In this final section, we will take a look at how the issues presented in the two cases evolved over the next three years and explore some common issues raised by both. We will then present some observations and conclusions about these cases and offer a few suggestions of our own for faculties that want to empower their students.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="bag"><h3>Bells and Grades: 1987-1990</h3>What happened to the issues of the bells and the grades at the case-study school between 1987 and 1990? The General Assembly continued at Barrett for the remainder of the headmaster's tenure at the school (i.e., until June 1990). During this time, the Assembly was "plagued" by poor leadership and accusations of being a popularity contest, a lack of credibility stemming from the Assembly's raising and passing a series of motions that were then vetoed by the headmaster, and a general apathy and lack of participation leading to a complete restructuring of the use of the General Assembly period by the fall of 1989. On a rotating basis, the weekly time slot was devoted to General Assembly meeting periods, schoolwide assembly periods, and class meetings. Students initiated a self-study of the General Assembly during the 1989-90 school year, and preliminary results of a student opinion survey revealed low levels of support for the Assembly. <p>	With a change of headmasters in the summer of 1990, the General Assembly time slot was eliminated from the 1990-91 school schedule. Interestingly, students were not a part of the decision-making process that led to its elimination; some were told informally of the Assembly's likely demise only in conjunction with preparing a student-initiated survey report about the Assembly. The results of that survey did not inform this decision, since they were not available to the faculty and administration before the decision was made. Most students learned of the change only upon returning to school in September. While few students mourned its loss, it is revealing of the lack of shared/ transferred power that they were not involved in deciding its fate and were relatively unconcerned upon learning of it.<p>	At Earvin, Incompletes remained an issue for the Essential School team through June of 1990. By the end of the 1986-87 school year (discussed in the body of this case study), 76 of the Essential School's 102 students had at least one Incomplete. Thirty-one of these students had Incompletes in all four Essential School subjects.23 However, the addition of the C the following year did little to alleviate this problem. Over the next two-and-a-half years the Essential School team continued to struggle with this issue before agreeing upon a second and later a third revision to the Incomplete policy. <p>	After the first year that the faculty grappled with the Incomplete issue, students had little say about it. Furthermore, in terms of general student input, two of the structures created to promote student empowerment became defunct that first year. The Leadership Committee initially held regular pre-school meetings, but poor student attendance and general disinterest led to its demise mid-way through that first school year. Only two town meetings were ever held. Advisory groups are the sole remaining forum for student input, but only about half of the Essential School students have an opportunity to participate in them.24 <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sci"><h3>Some Common Issues</h3>A number of parallels exist between these two case studies, although the school settings and issues under contention are quite distinct. The clearest parallel concerns structural changes: both schools created one or more forums to give students a voice in school matters. In doing this, school personnel appeared to equate creating a new structure with the realization of empowerment and the transfer of power. Acting in terms of assumptions implicit in the <i>O.E.D. </i>definition of <i>empowerment, </i>they saw themselves as authorized to endow students with power and viewed these new structures as appropriate vehicles for this transfer. However, there were factors involved in these two case studies (and, we believe, in most American high schools) that made such a straightforward conception of empowerment more problematic. <p>	For one, in both cases there was no administration or faculty consensus on the issues under consideration. The bell system and the grading policy had been ongoing concerns. By entwining concerns with empowerment with efforts to resolve these issues, the issues were further complicated. Also, neither faculty had much experience in dealing with issues of student empowerment, and the students had had no experience in exercising a voice in school matters. <p>	Moreover, as part of their work with the Coalition of Essential Schools, both schools were engaged in extensive efforts to change traditional practice and to re-examine aspects of the everyday life of their schools -- bells, grades, and concepts of responsibility and accountability, for instance. This work already took up much time, effort, and attention. There was never a high priority given to helping students understand and work through the process of empowerment at either school because student empowerment (had it emerged) would have been almost a side effect of the change process more generally. In practice, this meant that there was little, if any, effort to socialize students about the transferring or sharing of power or about problems that might be encountered in the empowerment process.25 Teachers and administrators seemed to view <i>their </i>stamp of approval and <i>their </i>attendance at meetings as sufficient engagement in the empowerment process for student empowerment to occur. Reflecting this lack of concern with the process of student empowerment, the head teacher at Earvin commented that although the town meetings might prove a bit disorderly at first, "eventually those with good common sense will speak out and the big-mouths won't be the only ones heard." <p>	The difficulties engendered by these factors -- the complexity of the issues being confronted, the inexperience of all parties with student empowerment, and the lack of sustained attention to the process of empowerment -- were compounded by two additional factors. First, as evidenced by the accusations of manipulation that abounded, there was a pervasive lack of trust among teachers, students, and administrators. Students at Earvin were accused of manipulating teachers to get by with less work and earn grades they did not deserve. Teachers at Barrett accused the administration of manipulating students to their own ends and negating the limited power faculty felt they had. Furthermore, teachers at Barrett felt that students used the ambiguity created by the lack of bells to socialize longer with friends and come late to class. <p>	Beyond accusations of manipulation, there were also specific actions taken by those in power that further suggested a lack of trust and seemed to impede efforts to empower students at both schools. For example, the absolute veto of the headmaster at Barrett seemed reasonable to some but to others it signaled a lack of confidence in the outcomes empowered students might produce. And, as the head teacher at Earvin remarked when explaining why the faculty had virtually ignored student responses to the program's grading policy for so long: "It seemed inconsequential to base our decision on student objections." <p>	A second factor that further seemed to influence these scenarios was that not only were students new to exercising power, but the teachers as well were new to having and using power. Much of the power teachers of both schools had, they had only recently received themselves (through being selected for the school-within-a-school team at Earvin or in the creation of a faculty review committee at Barrett). In part, the teachers' ambiguous attitude toward student empowerment may have stemmed from their own inexperience with power coupled with an emphasis on classroom control and orderliness within the school as a primary order of business between teachers and students.26 <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="oaf"><h3>Observations and Findings</h3>In both of our case studies, discussions about the dimensions of student empowerment in the abstract and vis-à-vis the particular issue at hand were never clarified for any party prior to, during, or even after the resolution of the particular issue. Although most of those involved agreed that empowerment was desirable, our observations and interviews revealed that what various participants meant by student empowerment, as well as any concomitant expectations, were never fully clarified. Student input was solicited at both schools with no guarantee that it would be acknowledged or accepted -- the Barrett headmaster reserved complete veto power to himself, and the Earvin faculty were ambivalent about whether to solicit student input at all. <p>	As we have seen, students' formal responses to attempts at empowerment ranged from active involvement in discussions about the issues to resistance (assertive questioning as well as more passive nonparticipation) toward the new institutions, teachers, and administrators. In both cases the surveys seemed an appropriate formal response consistent with actions one might take to ascertain the group's opinion. Informal student responses to change were more skeptical -- for example, the Barrett student who wondered if the bell issue was an invention of the headmaster's to give the fledgling organization something to do. Responses to the efforts to empower students, then, led to a variety of other responses -- formally and informally expressed -- from compliance and participation to skepticism and silent attendance at mandatory meetings.<p>	When students did act in ways that could be perceived as using their "new" power, the faculty and administration reacted to these efforts with ambivalence. At Barrett, during the 1987-88 academic year, students introduced and passed a motion that limited the time allotted for announcements during General Assembly in order that these meetings would not be dominated by faculty announcements. In 1989, the students initiated a survey to assess the status and perceived value of the General Assembly. Earvin students also produced a survey to assess student perceptions of their Essential School program. Yet, these efforts were never encouraged or publicly acknowledged by the faculty or administration, and students were never part of discussions about the implications of these data. Earvin faculty eventually acted on the findings of the student-initiated survey, but it was well after the fact and after students had left for the summer. Along similar lines, Barrett faculty observed the time limitations for announcements for a few weeks, but gradually began to forget or ignore the rule. Further, the General Assembly was abolished before the faculty received any findings from the student-initiated survey. In effect, then, students in both cases were asked to play a game where the rules were never specified and where they might or might not even be allowed onto the field. <p>	Furthermore, students were never a part of any discussions regarding what should or would constitute student empowerment. The concept, therefore, was defined <i>by </i>teachers and administrators <i>for </i>students. Likewise, interpretations of what constituted empowerment originated with teachers and administrators as well. Thus, what teachers and administrators identified as acts of student empowerment -- eliminating the bells at Barrett or adding the C to Earvin's grading scale -- seemed less authentically empowering to us as outsiders, since many students viewed their roles in these decisions as insignificant. Since the interpretations of empowerment originated from the teachers and administrators, they may simply represent convenient interpretations. <p>	Based on these two case studies, we have argued that the process of transferring or sharing power that must occur in order for student empowerment to manifest itself is difficult to actualize. By creating forums to solicit student input, faculty and administrators could equate new organizations with student empowerment, while never systematically having to plan or negotiate the conditions of its appearance.27 While personnel at both schools made some attempts to link notions of student empowerment with existing aspects of schooling that might offer philosophically compatible means to the same end (for example, looking for opportunities to empower students in the classroom or in extracurricular activities), their primary response was to create new forums. As the Lynds observed of Middletown years ago:<blockquote>As in so many other aspects of Middletown's life, criticism of individuals or creakings in the [educational] system are met primarily not by changes in its foundation but by adding fresh stories to its superstructure. . . . [Thus,] strains or maladjustments in education are being met by further elaboration and standardization.28</blockquote><p>	Another finding evident from our research is that <i>all </i>sides manipulated whatever power was available to them in what they perceived to be their best interests. In these cases, however, one side -- the students -- began with and always had less power to manipulate. Moreover, inexperience with the more overt negotiation and manipulation of power in formal contexts by students and teachers in both school settings hindered their ability to use, develop, and assert their <i>new </i>power effectively when they were given some.29 <p><i>	Given </i>is the operative word here. Teachers (and to a lesser extent students) are now being given power (or, following Larson, what may be the illusion of power) in much the same way that gifts in general are bestowed -- with the façade of voluntary transfer and the reality of incurred obligation. As Mauss writes:<blockquote>To give is to show one's superiority, to show that one is something more and higher, that one is <i>magister</i>. To accept without returning or repaying more is to face subordination, to become a client and subservient, to become <i>minister</i>. (italics in the original)30 </blockquote><p>In other words, as we have seen in our case studies, if student empowerment is given to students by those seen as their superiors, the power allegedly transferred or shared may actually remain intact in the original structural arrangements and/or the new structural arrangements may replicate the existing structure, hierarchy, and ideology, rather than serve as a harbinger of new power relations among those involved. Our case studies show that distrust (on all sides) and continued denial or ignoring of the students' perspectives made the question of whether there was any transfer of power problematic. Further, for our purposes, Mauss's book and Larson's recent article raise the question of whether there can be genuine empowerment at all. If empowerment is the transfer of power by someone to someone else, might it not inherently recreate the problematic nature of all gift-giving?<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="seas"><h3>Student Empowermentand School Reform</h3>In view of our work and with a careful reading of Mauss and Larson in mind, we suggest that the emphasis on "giving" power (or voices) to teachers and students may explain some of the difficulties that current reforms are facing. The giving of power to others brings the unequal power relations between the parties into focus by making the everyday workings of the school community visible and increasingly problematic, without necessarily changing or even addressing their ideological underpinnings. In the long run this may create change, but in the short run it seems to increase distrust.31<p>	Because distrust seems common in situations of unequal power, the previous point suggests an additional question: Can someone become empowered by others for whom there is strong distrust? Our evidence suggests that empowerment will not occur if all parties do not believe that the transfer of power is genuine rather than a provisional gift. As we saw in both our cases, this condition was not met, and distrust impeded the sharing of power. At Earvin, there was such a lack of clarity on the part of all parties about the dimensions of power that, in retrospect, students may have been smart to be skeptical. Opinions were sought, forums created, and then pronouncements and qualifications that sounded suspiciously like backpedaling began. "You can decide about a dance; otherwise, you have little power" was one message. "We don't trust that you will not abuse the system, so we want to make it harder to do that" was another. At Barrett there was a clearer sense of what power students had -- they could make any decision they wanted -- but everyone knew that any decisions could be overruled by the headmaster. This could be viewed as having substantial power or none at all.<p>	Aside from the implications regarding the difficulty of sharing and transferring power, acknowledging the problematic nature of this process has another important consequence: it highlights the importance of understanding the actions and reactions to proposed and enacted changes by <i>all </i>participants in school reform. Student reactions are particularly important in this case for two reasons. First, as the Coalition's avowed purpose is "to help students learn to use their minds well," student perspectives become central to understanding both the processes and outcomes experienced as changes are enacted. Second, the emphasis on student empowerment in Coalition writing and in member schools implies that student voices on school issues are relevant and should be heard. <p>	Furthermore, it is important to document how students "test" their power, since this may affect their receptivity to and participation in the formulation of additional reform. Finally, though the weight given these voices may vary from school to school, the Coalition's use of empowerment strengthens our contention that analysis of reform focused on teaching and learning must include student perspectives, even if the formulation and enactment of reform do not. <p>	The genuine or spurious argument about student empowerment could begin with one question: What power legitimately belongs to students? Neither school in our case studies had (to our knowledge) discussed this issue at any point in their efforts to empower students. Such a discussion might clarify what is expected of <i>all </i>parties and thereby reduce levels of mistrust.32 It might also offer schools an opportunity to explore how they might incorporate student empowerment into existing structures rather than making it another addition to the "shopping mall high school."33 <p><hr><p>Many schools have included new attempts at shared governance in their restructuring efforts or other reform strategies. This paper has focused on two such efforts in order to define student empowerment, to illuminate the issues raised by efforts to promote student empowerment, and to consider the question of whether it is attainable. A parallel investigation of efforts to create teacher empowerment from the perspective of how shared meanings are created, negotiated, and used in practice could be an important addition to understanding how people share, transfer, or receive power -- if in fact they do.34<p> <a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><hr><h3>Notes</h3><hr><p><ol><li> <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, eds.

The Coalition also talks about empowerment that emerges from changes in the classroom. For example, contrary to what many contend is the normal, passive attitude taken by students toward school work (e.g., Goodlad [n. 3]; Sizer [n. 3]; and Ernest Boyer, <i>High School: A Report on Secondary Education in America </i>[New York: Harper and Row, 1983]), the Coalition maintains that students must be active workers in the classroom. Concomitantly, as students adopt a new classroom role, so must teachers. Rather than rely on lecturing, teachers need to conceive of themselves as "coaches," helping students to develop the essential skills and intellectual habits integral to using one's mind well. Enacting these philosophical tenets of "student-as-worker" and "teacher-as-coach" is often seen as resulting in a sharing or transfer of power within the classroom. For example, students may assume responsibility for teaching the class, selecting their own assignments, or editing the work of other students. <p><li> Sizer, 65-66.<p><li> Grant Wiggins, "Eleven Suggestions for Reform that Are Radical -- But Shouldn't Be," <i>Horace </i>3:6 (1987).<p><li> David P. Ericson and Frederick S. Ellet, Jr., "Taking Student Responsibility Seriously," <i>Educa-tional Researcher </i>19:9 (December 1990): 3-10.<p><li> It is not only in the school setting where students have little significant responsibility and/or power. Marion Lundy Dobbert et al. in their article on cross-cultural analysis of cultural transmission ("Cultural Transmissions in Three Societies: Testing a Systems-Based Field Guide," <i>Anthropology and Education Quarterly </i>15:4 [1984]) observed that American children <blockquote>although valued, are often excluded [from adult activities and responsibilities]. They are put to bed; they are placed in front of the TV; they are not encouraged to join adult work or conversation with nonfamily members. Our protocols show a great number of these child-excluding situations for children . . . who, in other societies, especially at the higher age levels, are often regarded as valuable aides. (pp. 302-303)</blockquote>	Also, Beatrice and John W. M. Whiting revealed a similar trend in their book <i>Children of Six Cultures. A Pyscho-Cultural Analysis </i>(Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1975). In their cross-cultural assessment, they found that children in "complex" societies, as compared with those in "simpler" societies, were not responsible for many "important economic and domestic tasks" and, when they did become involved, they did so at a later age (p. 94). Consequently, children from "complex" cultures tended to be more dependent and less responsible, than children brought up in "simpler" cultures (pp. 128-29). Ironically, a key factor that restricted children's involvement in such activities as well as the degree of responsibility they held was their need to attend school (p. 101). <p><li> The efforts of faculty and administration in Coalition member schools to work within the ideological framework of the Common Principles appear to be an effort to create a widespread cultural consensus. See James Fernandez, "Symbolic Consensus in a Fang Reformative Cult," <i>American Anthropologist </i>67 (1965): 902-27.<p><li> On one occasion where he considered vetoing a resolution passed by the General Assembly, the headmaster discussed the possibility with members of his administrative committee at a separate meeting after the Assembly passed the resolution.<p><li> Faculty and students voted. Since there was no count, it is not clear whether faculty votes changed or not, while it was clearly evident that many students' votes changed.<p><li> Though this policy was formulated, it was only necessary for three or four students.<p><li> In many respects, this final planning period differed from most meetings held during the school year. Specifically, no clinical professors were present; one team member was absent; and this was the first meeting attended by members of the Essential School team to be added the coming school year. This seemed to increase the likelihood of resolving the A-B-I issue for two reasons: first, opposition was less likely to arise since three members of the present team were absent, two of whom were consistent proponents of the A-B-I policy; and second, the new team was relatively unfamiliar with the issue and thus, one could argue, less likely to challenge the head teacher's wishes. <p><li> We make this distinction since Essential School students also take classes in the larger school (e.g., gym and electives such as foreign language and computers).<p><li> Between 1986 and 1990, the Essential School expanded to include four separate teams. After the first year of the program, the Essential School faculty decided that each team would determine whether to have advisory groups. Presently, only two teams have chosen to have advisory groups and, as in the past, they meet irregularly.<p><li> This point is especially important because, as numerous researchers have observed, in attempting to use power students can actually work against their long-term interests. As Judith Friedman Hansen observed in <i>Sociocultural Perspectives on Human Learning. Foundations of Educational Anthropology </i>(Prospect Heights, IL: Waveland Press, 1979): "In many classrooms, student-teacher transactions can be understood as processes of political conflict in which students win the battle and lose the war." See also, Paul Willis, <i>Learning to Labour </i>(New York: Columbia University Press, 1977); Reba Page, "Lower-Track Classes at a College Preporatory High School: A Caricature of Educational Encounters" in <i>Interpretive Ethnography of Education at Home and Abroad </i>eds. G. Spindler and L. Spindler (Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers, 1987); Ray McDermott, "Achieving School Failure: An Anthropological Approach to Illiteracy and Social Stratification," in <i>Education and Cultural Process, Anthropological Approaches </i>eds. G. Spindler and L. Spindler (Prospect Heights, IL: Waveland Press, Inc., 1987); and John Ogbu, "Variability in Minority School Performance: A Problem in Search of an Explanation," <i>Anthropology and Education Quarterly </i>18 (4: 1987).<p><li> One Coalition principal suggested that effective teacher empowerment might stimulate student empowerment since teachers offer powerful role models for their students. See Philip Cusick, <i>The Egalitarian Idea in the American High School</i>; and Mary Metz, <i>Classrooms and Corridors: The Crisis of Authority in Desegregated Secondary Schools </i>(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1978).<p><li> George D. Spindler and Louise Spindler, "Roger Harker and Schonhausen: From Familiar to Strange and Back Again" in <i>Doing the Ethnography of Schooling </i>ed. G. D. Spindler (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1982). The Spindlers discussed a similar phenomenon and called it a substitutive change, i.e. a change which appears to be revolutionary but in fact does little to alter the existing relationships and/or situation. They contrast this type of change with a change in principle which is a significant change in how people interact or how resources are dispersed, for example. <p><li> Robert Lynd and Helen Merrel Lynd, <i>Middle-town </i>(New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, Inc., 1929). Jules Henry in <i>Culture Against Man </i>(New York: Random House, 1963) made a similar connec-tion between what happens in American schools and what occurs in society at-large: "American classrooms, like classrooms everywhere, express the values, preoccupations and fears found in the culture as a whole " (p. 287). And as we have found, power relations issues in schools mirror those in the larger society as well. Recently, Larson (1991) has suggested that creating new structures in business can create an illusion that change is occurring while actually impeding active consideration of why so little is changing.<p><li> The negotiation and manipulation of power, through such mediating concepts as those suggested below, has been an important focus of anthropological and sociological attention for the past thirty years: reputation: F. G. Bailey, <i>Gifts and Poison: The Politics of Reputation </i>(New York: Schocken Books, 1971); J. B. Haviland, <i>Gossip, Reputation, and Knowledge in Zincantan </i>(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1977); honor and shame: David Gilmore, <i>Honor and Shame and the Unity of the Mediterranean </i>(Washington DC: American Anthropological Association, 1987): 2-21; Michael Herzfeld, "Honor and Shame: Problems in Contemporary Analysis of Moral Systems," <i>Man </i>15 (1980): 339-351; J. G. Peristiany, ed., <i>Honour and Shame: The Values of Mediterranean Society </i>(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1966); Unni Wikan, "Shame and Honour: A Contestable Pair," <i>Man </i>19 (1984): 635-652); gossip: M. Gluckman, "Gossip and Scandal," <i>Current Anthropology </i>4 (1963): 307-316; Sally Engle Merry, "Rethinking Gossip and Scandal," in <i>Toward a General Theory of Social Control, Vol. 1: Fundamentals </i>(New York: Academic Press, 1984): 271-302; Robert Paine, "What Is Gossip About? An Alternative Hypothesis," <i>Man </i>2 [1967]: 278-308, and Robert Paine, "Gossip and Transaction," <i>Man </i>3 [1968]: 305-308); class and status: James Fernandez, "Consciousness and Class in Southern Spain," <i>American Ethnologist </i>10 (1: 1983): 165-173, Wikan, 1984; Donna E. Muncey, "Social Differentiation, Reputation, and Return Migration in Eastern Andalucia: A Case Study from Eastern Jaen," (Unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Brown University, Department of Anthropology: 1990).		The British school has made more of an effort to incorporate interactionist and negotiation strategies into educational anthropological research, for example: Martyn Hammersley, "On Interactionist Empiricism," in <i>Pupil Strategies</i>, ed. Peter Woods (London: Croom Helm Ltd., 1980): 198-213; Andy Hargreaves, "Synthesis and the Study of Strategies: A Project for the Sociological Imagination," in <i>Pupil Strategies</i>, ed. Peter Woods: 162-197; Peter Woods, "Negotiating the Demands of Schoolwork," <i>Journal of Curriculum Studies </i>3 (1978): 309-329; Peter Woods, <i>The Divided School </i>(London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1979); Peter Woods ed., <i>Teacher Strategies </i>(London: Croom Helm Ltd., 1979); and Peter Woods ed., <i>Pupil Strategies</i>. Our research findings suggest this emphasis is a natural and underutilized one in studies of school change. Power is contested in every domain of a school community undergoing change -- including not only the power to determine what terms mean, but also the power to establish the standards of evaluation for enacted changes and the power to determine when "full implementation" has been achieved. We are currently preparing a book about the Coalition of Essential Schools that traces some of these negotiations and their outcomes during five years of its growth and expansion.<p><li> Mauss, 72.<p><li> In addition it often alienates participants who feel overburdened by their present situation and intimidated by the ever-increasing magnitude of the tasks at hand.<p><li> Scholars studying social change and applied anthropology (for instance, Roger Bastide, <i>Applied Anthropology</i>, trans. Alice B. Morton [New York: Harper and Row, 1971]; Elizabeth M. Eddy and William L. Partridge, <i>Applied Anthropology in America </i>[Boston: Bergin and Garvey Publishers, Inc., 1978]; Louise Spindler, <i>Culture Change and Modernization. Mini-models and Case Studies </i>[New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1977]; and George Foster, <i>Applied Anthropology </i>[Boston: Little Brown and Company, 1969) have long advocated including the intended recipients in the formulation of change and discussions about it.		 Thus far, the Coalition, too, seems to have limited the inclusion of these intended recipients of change. For instance, they have two publications, <i>Horace</i>, an informational newsletter on the Coalition of Essential Schools, and <i>The Conversation</i>, a joint publication with the Education Commission of the States (ECS). Of the twenty-seven issues (twenty-one <i>Horaces </i>and six <i>Conversations</i>) published between March 1985, and June 1990, teachers have authored seven articles; school administrators, nine articles; Coalition or ECS staff fifty-four articles; and professional journalists, three articles. Students have authored two articles. And even though a recent issue of <i>Horace </i>focused on "What Students Say About Essential Schools," there was no discussion of student governance or formal mechanisms for soliciting student perspectives.		Student attendance at Coalition-sponsored events has also been proportionately low. At the first National Fall Forum (1989), no students from member or interested schools were present. At the second Fall Forum, out of a total of approximatately 850 attendees and conference presenters, 20 were secondary students. Other conferences exhibit the same tendency toward low numbers of student participants.<p><li> Arthur G. Powell, Eleanor Farrar, and David K. Cohen, <i>The Shopping Mall High School: Winners and Losers in the Educational Marketplace </i>(Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1985).<p><li> These three options focus on a sharing or transfer model. Another possibility exists. The intended recipients of power, in this case the students, might simply seize power and define it themselves. Although that did not happen in either of these cases, it should be viewed as a possible scenario. </ol><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><hr><p><a href="../list.htm#3">Return to Index of SEP Publications</a></body></html>

The nine Common Principles that undergird this effort have implications for pedagogy, curriculum, and school structure (see Appendix A). Now in its sixth year, the Coalition's Central Staff have encouraged a variety of approaches to reform in member schools. One strategy initially adopted by a number of member schools was to create a school-within-a-school (SWAS) program. <p>	Given the multiple concerns that public schools face -- including structural, political, and philosophical considerations -- using the SWAS approach as an "entry point" to Coalition-based school reform seemed to offer member schools a convenient compromise, a way to engage in a measure of reform without being seen as too radical. The initially unspoken assumption was that these programs would eventually expand to include their entire schools. As one principal commented: "Our school is taking the Pac Man approach to school reform. We expect that the Essential school will eventually swallow up the entire school." <p>	The following factors provide a sense for why the SWAS structure was initially so appealing to many schools:<p><ol>	<li>	Because of the nature of the school's responsibility to society, public schools find it difficult to implement unproven, broadly encompassing reforms that may be perceived as "drastic." As one principal remarked about her SWAS program, "We wanted to try something different without experimenting on kids. Remember, we are a public school and cannot rashly enter into wholesale change." Thus, many schools felt that they needed to "start small." <p>	<li>	There were not enough teachers willing to implement change when the program began, partly because they were uncertain just what this change would entail. The SWAS ostensibly offered schools an opportunity to involve those willing to experiment with change without forcing others to change. <p>	<li>	School administrators -- both at the building and district levels -- are in the precarious position of having to satisfy many different constituencies with many different concerns (students, parents, teachers, unions, coaches, and so on). Consequently, many administrators consider it most appropriate to approach change cautiously, allowing them to balance concerns and reactions among their various constituencies.<p>	<li>	School budgets are seldom "fat." School departments may not even have funding available that would make wholesale change possible. School-within-a-school programs have often involved start-up costs that exceed normal expenditu res by more than 10 percent, based on per capita expenditures, although the Coalition's nine Common Principles maintain that Coalition-related change should not exceed a 10 percent increase (see Appendix A, Common Principle #9). Each of the four schools in this case study relied on supplementary funds secured through private and state-sponsored sources to support their programs.</ol><p>	Schools adopted the SWAS structure, then, because they felt that it offered a means both to undertake a measure of reform and to maintain peace with their multiple constituencies. Yet, our research has found that this approach has proven problematic to the educational nature of the reforms being undertaken as well as to the "peace" of the school. Member schools that have implemented SWAS programs have become aware of these problems and have taken steps to address them. Moreover, the Coalition's Central Staff have been aware of these problems and, although they realize that SWAS programs may offer an appropriate way to initiate change, they no longer view the SWAS as a realistic strategy for long-term school restructuring. <p>	We will sketch below an overview of our long-term, ethnographic research with the Coalition of Essential Schools (for a brief history of the Coalition's work to date, see Appendix B). We then present detailed case studies of four SWAS programs. Based on a comparative examination of these case studies, we have extracted five central tensions that arose at all four sites, and we then discuss their effects on schools attempting to restructure. Finally, we consider some implications for school practice derived from these common tensions. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tsep"><h3>The School Ethnography Project</h3>The School Ethnography Project (SEP) is a multiyear ethnographic documentation and research project focused on the schools and staff that are partners in the Coalition of Essential Schools (CES). The data-collection portion of our research began in August of 1986 and was concluded in June of 1990. Our primary objective was to document the activities of the Coalition of Essential Schools reform movement. This entailed collecting data on four interrelated components:<p><ol>	<li>	individual schools involved in the project; <p>	<li>	the Central Staff's activities and the role(s) they played in developing the movement's philosophy; <p>	<li>	the interaction between the Central Staff and the individual Coalition schools at workshops, symposia, and conferences; and <p>	<li>	the developmental history of the Coalition itself. </ol><p>	The majority of our research was conducted in individual schools and focused on two broad questions about the Common Principles: How are the Common Principles interpreted by individual schools? And, how do those involved in Coalition schools (teachers, administrators, and students) proceed to implement the principles as they are developed in each setting? Although our research was focused on the school site, we also attended many Coalition staff meetings, interviewed Central Staff members, and generally stayed abreast of developments within the Central Staff. <p>	We acknowledge that there is much concern regarding the influence of these reforms on student performance. Nonetheless, we are anthropologists studying change broadly. Our research focus was not on educational evaluation. Accordingly, we did not make the evaluation of student learning a research priority. Our work, therefore, does not attempt to assess how these reforms affected student academic performance.<p>	One related final point: our research did not involve evaluating the Coalition of Essential Schools; rather, we sought to document broadly what occurred as a consequence of the Coalition's reform efforts. With this goal in mind, we consciously sought to include an array of perspectives in our research -- including supporters and opponents of Coalition philosophy and practices, Central Staff members and school personnel, and students, teachers, and administrators. Nonetheless, we realize that the topics we choose to focus on and the perspectives we present may privilege certain persons and viewpoints. <p>	To minimize this privileging and to guarantee that we include a wide range of perspectives in our work, we shared initial drafts of our work with people in our study schools and the Coalition's Central Staff. This allowed those who collaborated in our research endeavor an opportunity to respond to our writing, to clarify factual inaccuracies, and to offer alternative perceptions. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cs1"><hr><center><h2>Case Study I:<br>Silas Ridge High School</h2></center><hr>Silas Ridge is an eastern city of 65,000 inhabitants. Located in the heart of the city, Silas Ridge High School is a comprehensive high school that serves a student population of slightly more than 1,000 students. Academically, most students are grouped into a five-tier tracking system that includes advanced placement, honors, college preparatory, general, and basic. Those students who do not fit into this tracking system are offered alternative programs (such as English-as-a-second-language, special education, vocational education) although they may still attend some tracked classes. <p>	Silas Ridge High also offers its students a wide array of clubs and athletic teams. Although historically most students have been white and middle class, nearly half the student body qualifies for the "reduced lunch" program. Furthermore, in recent years Silas Ridge has enrolled increasing numbers of minority students, primarily Southeast Asians and Eastern Europeans. The Silas Ridge faculty, therefore, serves a diverse student body -- one that includes students on-track toward Ivy League educations, students from the city's poorest neighborhoods, and students with little understanding of English or the United States. <p>	In the opinion of many faculty and students, theirs is a very fine high school. In 1983 Silas Ridge was selected as a "National School of Excellence." In the fall of 1985, the school was chosen by <i>Omni </i>magazine as one of seventy-seven schools in the United States that "point the way to the educational system of the future." The following spring an educational consulting organization designated Silas Ridge as a central site for a national school network of "effective schools interested in implementing new practices." And in 1987 then-Secretary of Education William Bennett named Silas Ridge a "James Madison High School" -- acknowledging the strength of its curriculum and noting that "whoever they are, Silas Ridge students . . . must satisfy Silas Ridge High's core requirements" (1987:40).<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="pp"><h3>Planning Phase</h3>Silas Ridge High School's relationship with the Coalition of Essential Schools was initiated by a school committee member who had become familiar with Ted Sizer's ideas through her graduate work. As part of the Silas Ridge Teachers' Association's professional development activities, the school department invited Sizer to speak to faculty from both Silas Ridge high schools. After this talk, a group of teachers from the two schools decided to continue exploring Sizer's ideas, as well as the possibility of Coalition membership. <p>	With encouragement from a supportive superintendent, the Sizer Committee, a volunteer group of teachers from Silas Ridge High that included Katherine Shaw, the woman who would soon become the Silas Ridge principal, authored an application to the Coalition of Essential Schools. In January of 1985 Silas Ridge High School became a "charter" member of the Coalition of Essential Schools. <p>	To assist Silas Ridge in this effort, the superintendent's office provided some financial support to the school with the understanding that, after a year and a half of planning (from January of 1985 through the summer of 1986), Silas Ridge would have a Coalition program in place. In preparation, the school undertook various activities. Much of this effort focused on professional development. Silas Ridge faculty members traveled to Brown for Coalition-sponsored workshops and had Coalition Central Staff members visit and consult with faculty and administration at Silas Ridge. They initiated a relationship with a profes-sor from a local university who served as something of a mentor and helped guide the Sizer Committee through varoius aspects of this planning phase. <p>	Aided by a grant secured through a state-administered program, the school also brought in prominent authorities in such areas as curriculum development and pedagogy to run workshops for the faculty. To gain an understanding for how other schools had "restructured," Silas Ridge teachers visited several schools that had already attempted some form of restructuring. Silas Ridge faculty, and Katherine Shaw attended Princi-pals' Council meetings at Brown University, where the administrators from various Coalition schools and prospective members were brought together by the Coalition Central Staff to discuss their efforts and to see what they might learn from one another. <p>	During this planning phase a preliminary structure for Silas Ridge's Essential school program began to emerge, although there was, as yet, no clear sense of what the Coalition program would look like <i>in practice</i>. As one preliminary step, the school created the position of Coalition Coordinator. The teacher selected to fill this position, a member of the Sizer Committee, was given release-time from some teaching responsibilities so that she could oversee formal planning for the Coalition program. She resigned at the end of the first year because she found the release-time inadequate to meet the job's demands and because her responsibilities as Coalition Coordinator detracted from her classroom teaching. <p>	During the second year of planning (1985-86), many of those from the Sizer Committee and others generally supportive of Coalition philosophy continued to meet and gradually evolved a more formal framework to support their efforts, the Coalition Steering Committee. During the planning phase, the Steering Committee had three subcommittees (although it would later expand to include eight subcommittees and an executive committee): pedagogy, curriculum (which included such areas as graduation requirements and "exhibitions"1), and funding (since it became evident that most Coalition-related activities required some financial support and that the Silas Ridge School Department was restricted in how much funding it could provide). Formally, the committee's power was purely "advisory," and membership was open to any interested faculty. During the planning phase, the Steering Committee seldom included more than one-quarter of the faculty, most of those being active supporters of the Coalition effort at Silas Ridge. <p>	One other aspect of this planning phase, although somewhat informal, deserves mention. Katherine Shaw often sponsored potluck dinners at her house, attended by Steering Committee members, faculty supportive of Coalition membership, and interested others. These dinners had one overarching purpose -- to generate support and goodwill toward their Coalition effort by bringing together faculty to discuss school restructuring, at Silas Ridge and more generally. <p>	In summary, the planning phase had five components: sponsoring professional development activities intended to promote school change; investigating other schools' attempts at restructuring; creating new structures to facilitate the change process; communicating with the Coalition Central Staff; and generating goodwill and support for their Coalition program. <p>	Two final points are worth noting about the planning phase. First, in order to participate, faculty and administrators had to assume additional responsibilities to their existing workload, such as attending before- and after-school meetings to write grants or plan professional development activities. And second, to avoid forcing any disinterested faculty into becoming involved or accepting responsibilities they had never sought, no faculty member was required to participate in any Coalition-related activity, all involvement was purely voluntary.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="impl"><h3>Implementation</h3>In its first year Silas Ridge's Essential school consisted of a team of four teachers -- from English, history, math, and science. Three of these four teachers were veterans at Silas Ridge, having taught there at least five years, and one of these teachers had served as the Coalition Coordinator during the previous planning year. The fourth was relatively new to the school. This team taught the same eighty ninth-grade students -- two general-level classes, one honors class, and one college. Although these divisions represented the "official" student groupings, since classes were block-scheduled (i.e., the Essential school had all their four classes in a row), Coalition faculty intentionally grouped their students heterogeneously on occasion. Teachers taught four periods a day, had two planning periods to work with their Essential school colleagues, and one free period.2 To help administer the program, an assistant principal assumed the position of Coalition Coordinator in addition to her existing responsibilities. <p>	During the program's first year, there was a "shadow" Coalition team of four teachers who represented the same disciplines and who would form a second SWAS team when the program expanded, as planned, the following year. These teachers taught a full class load and had one additional free period, rather than some form of "coverage" (e.g., cafeteria duty or study hall monitoring), so they could plan for the coming year, meet with other SWAS teachers, and participate in the professional development activities offered to the SWAS faculty.<p>	In its first year, the SWAS proved relatively uncontroversial for the school-as-a-whole. For the most part, the Coalition teachers preferred the Essential school structure to their previous teaching situations. Many felt that they and their students derived real benefits from the structure they had created (to be discussed in greater depth later). <p>	Yet, internally, the team encountered problems, some of which emerged from philosophical and personal differences among team members. Some team members, for example, were more enthusiastic than others about grouping students heterogeneously, changing the schedule, or experimenting in general. As the year progressed, these differences grew more pronounced, and tensions emerged that made group cooperation, a key element in the context of teaming, increasingly difficult. Furthermore, one team members' personal difficulties came to have a powerful emotional impact on the team and strained the team's energy and enthusiasm.<p>	In the larger school, there were two common reactions to the implementation of the Essential school. First, when polled, nearly half the faculty expressed a willingness to help the program in various capacities (e.g., as a participant in professional development activities, offering professional assistance to the program, etc.), but few ever became actively involved. Second, faculty viewed the Essential school as an interesting experiment. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="expa"><h3>Expansion</h3>In its second year (1987-88), the SWAS program expanded to include four more teachers and an additional eighty students. Of the teachers who served on this second team, all had been on the shadow team the previous year. Two were veterans of the building and two were recruited from outside the school because of their interest in being part of the Coalition program. Since two members of the original team left Silas Ridge at the end of the previous school year, they had to be replaced with new teachers. <p>	A week and a half into the school year, one of these new teachers decided to leave teaching altogether. The Essential school, then, had to find a replacement after the school year had begun. This team also planned on having a student-teacher for much of the year but he, too, left teaching shortly into the school year. Since the assistant principal had found it difficult to add Coalition-related business to her other responsibilities, a teacher from the shadow team, a relative newcomer to Silas Ridge High, assumed this duty and was, in turn, assigned a slightly reduced teaching load. In its second year, then, the SWAS had 160 students, eight teachers -- four Silas Ridge veterans and four teachers new to Silas Ridge -- and a coordinator who was also new to the school.<p>	During this second year, not only did the SWAS program expand, but so did the Coalition Steering Committee. To understand its expansion requires going back to the previous spring. That spring, a Steering Committee vote was held to determine whether the Essential school would expand and whether it would continue to enroll general, college, and honors students; the issue of whether the SWAS would have a second honors division was the key concern. Since this motion passed, the Essential school was guaranteed to have a second group of honors students. Thus, each teacher in the Essential school would teach at least one group of honors students. <p>	For some Silas Ridge faculty, teaching honors sections was viewed as a professional privilege. When some larger school teachers realized that the number of honors sections available to non-Coalition faculty would be limited by this expansion, they voiced their concerns to the administration. The administration made it clear to these teachers, however, that this decision would stand. These teachers then decided to mobilize faculty to monitor the workings of the Steering Committee, to ensure that similar developments would not recur. Thus, the Steering Committee expanded. Moreover, the faculty members who joined the Steering Committee and who led the opposition to the SWAS were not marginal, inexperienced faculty. They were influential, experienced, and respected persons at the school. <p>	This expansion had a number of effects on the Coalition program. For one, whereas the Steering Committee had been comprised primarily of Coalition supporters, it now became an arena for many politically charged debates. As the Coalition Coordinator from that year explained:<p><blockquote>At the end of the prior year [1986-87], there was this little group of elite people, mostly the people who had been actively involved in teaching on the teams. At the beginning of [1987-88], a number of people who were staunch critics of the Coalition decided to pull a coup and join the Coalition [Steering Committee], figuring that if they were at all the meetings and their votes carried as much weight as anyone else's, they could keep tabs on what was happening. . . . So I was faced in the beginning of the year with a Steering Committee that consisted of people who were staunch supporters, people who were actively involved, and people who were active critics.</blockquote>	Reflecting on her involvement with the committee, one of those who had come to oppose the Coalition provided another perspective on this new atmosphere:<p><blockquote>The second full year that [the school-within-a-school] was in place, I joined the Steering Committee. . . . I went to every meeting. I am not a negative person. I work <i>for </i>things. I work <i>with </i>people. . . . But I spent one year as a member of a two-person team of hinder, stall, and delay. And we hindered, stalled, and we delayed that Coalition school-within-a-school right into the ground. We questioned every vote. . . . We made them accountable for who was involved and what was involved, the reasons behind the changes. </blockquote>	As the year progressed, faculty divisiveness and disaffection with the SWAS program and struc-ture continued to grow. Eventually, the Coalition Steering Committee decided to abandon the SWAS structure because it seemed to generate too many divisions within the faculty. Instead, in a conciliatory gesture toward Coalition opponents, the Steering Committee decided that they would "encourage innovation and creativity among the entire staff." The school-within-a-school then became the "teacher teaming project" -- but one of several Steering Committee efforts. <p>	Furthermore, the many subcommittees created by the Steering Committee, and the increased overall faculty involvement that resulted from dismantling the SWAS, generated a sense that the Silas Ridge faculty had pulled together in a common effort to reform aspects of their school life. Nonetheless, the factions which had arisen within the school were not as easily dismantled as was the SWAS structure, and many intrafaculty tensions remained.<p>	In the spring of this same school year (1987-88), the faculty also created the Faculty Forum, a faculty governance body that eventually assumed many responsibilities heretofore the prerogative of the Coalition Steering Committee. The complicated process that eventually led to the creation of the Faculty Forum began when the principal and Steering Committee realized that any further school reform efforts at Silas Ridge would require increased funding. One inviting opportunity seemed to be an incentive grant of $50,000 a year for three years from the State Department of Education for "restructuring schools." Since Silas Ridge had been involved in school change efforts for nearly two years, Katherine Shaw and many of those on the Steering Committee thought that their chances were good. <p>	As a state-mandated prerequisite to the grant-writing process, all applicant schools were to have their faculties conduct "needs assessments" of their schools. Among other things, the subcommittee in charge of the needs assessment used findings from this schoolwide study to recommend that Silas Ridge create a faculty governance body to streamline and facilitate the change process. This became the Faculty Forum, a seven-person committee elected by the faculty and given authority subject to the principal's veto. With the formation of the Faculty Forum, the Coalition Steering Committee was subsequently dissolved. <p>	Although formally tied to the grant application, the creation of the Forum also signaled the faculty's disaffection with both their principal and the unintended and somewhat unanticipated effects of the SWAS expansion. That is, some people argue that the creation of the Forum was merely an effort by those opposed to Katherine Shaw and the SWAS to limit the power of both the Coalition Steering Committee and Principal Shaw. (The reasons for faculty opposition to the SWAS are discussed in greater depth later.) To complicate matters, these changes and the resistance they encountered were fueled by personal animosities. <p>	Silas Ridge's Coalition program spent the next three years in something of a state of limbo. Although the Forum eventually subsumed the Coalition Steering Committee, Silas Ridge decided to continue its Coalition membership. The Forum, therefore, named a Coalition subcommittee of three teachers who were charged with maintaining contact with the Coalition Central Staff, attending Coalition-sponsored events, and keeping the faculty up to date on Coalition-related developments. <p>	During the 1988-89 school year, in the name of the Coalition and in place of the SWAS program, there was an effort made to allow teachers throughout the building to team. Teachers submitted many teaming proposals but, in practice, it proved difficult to promote teaming on such an <i>ad hoc </i>basis and most of these teaming proposals were never realized. The next year (1989-90), Silas Ridge had one group of three teachers who teamed to teach a humanities course, two of whom were members of the Coalition subcommittee. <p>	During this same year, the school held a faculty referendum on whether to remain in the Coalition. When the vote was taken, fifty-three faculty and administrators participated -- 63 percent of the staff. Of these persons, twenty-two (42 percent of the total who voted) voted "Yes, Silas Ridge High School should continue its membership in the Coalition of Essential Schools. We will vote on continuing our membership at the end of each year. I would like to be involved." Fifteen people (28 percent of those who voted) supported the same initial statement with the addendum: "I don't feel I can be an active participant at this time." And sixteen people (30 percent of those who voted) voted, "No, Silas Ridge High School should not continue its membership in the Coalition of Essential Schools." <p>	Prior to the vote, the subcommittee had announced that anyone choosing not to vote would be assumed to fall into the second group -- neither opposed to Coalition involvement nor willing to be an active participant. In 1990-91, the Coalition subcommittee continued to serve as Silas Ridge's liaison with the Coalition's Central Staff, the teamed humanities course continued, and more teachers expressed an interest in teaming and interdisciplinary instruction. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sosa"><h3>Signs of Success andthe Involvement of Others</h3>Although the Coalition SWAS encountered a range of problems during its existence, many of the teachers who participated in this program identified a number of professional benefits that derived from their involvement. For instance, teachers found that teaming allowed them to know their students better, in part, simply because they taught fewer students but also because their planning meetings provided multiple perspectives on their students' lives in school. By working as a team, the teachers felt that they were able to establish consistent, teamwide standards for their students. The SWAS faculty also felt that they had considerable success getting parents involved in their students' education and keeping parents up to date on developments within their program, a situation helped in great part by their additional planning time. Many parents appreciated these efforts, and at one meeting Coalition faculty were very encouraged by a number of parents who wanted to know how they could ensure that their younger children could be in the Essential school program as well. <p>	In addition to the positive developments the teachers sensed from this new structure, the team perceived benefits from experimenting with different pedagogies as well, such as interdisciplinary teaching, heterogeneous grouping, and cooperative learning. For example, the team felt that grouping students heterogeneously and allowing them to work cooperatively created a productive, stimulating learning environment that also challenged some social barriers and common preconceptions within the student body. <p>	Many Essential school faculty insist that the team's most significant accomplishments involved their ability to motivate general students and hold them to the same standards as those in college and honors groupings. These SWAS teachers felt that their general-level students were Silas Ridge's forgotten students, overlooked and ill served by their school (following Powell et al. 1985). By personalizing their educational experience, these teachers found that many of these students had either been tracked as "general" throughout their education so that no one ever seriously questioned whether this track was the most appropriate, or that these were students with ability who found the general track the most comfortable means by which they could negotiating their high school diploma. <p>	The SWAS structure, however, allowed these teachers to know these students better, to force them into using their minds more critically and thereby to reveal their true potential. This structure also helped them maintain consistent standards for all their students. As the sophomore team noted in their report to the Steering Committee:<p><blockquote>We feel very happy to report that perhaps the most gratifying result of our efforts this year is the academic program and achievement of our "general-level" students! We made high and consistent demands of these students and their curriculum and achievement were much closer to the "college-preparatory track" than we imagined or realized was possible at the beginning of the year. A significant number of our general-level students requested college-level courses for next year, and we felt confident signing most of those requests.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="prob"><h3>Problems</h3>Discussing the "expansion" of the SWAS program previously was somewhat misleading. To understand those developments more fully, one also needs to appreciate the problems that arose within the faculty-at-large throughout the life of Silas Ridge's SWAS program. For many reasons, resentment toward the SWAS arose, and this generated problems for Silas Ridge's restructuring effort. <p>	For one, many faculty contended that the SWAS teachers received preferential treatment. As one teacher commented: "We had some teachers who had eighty students, no duties, and fewer classes. How could anybody think that that wouldn't create tension?" Further contributing to accusations of preferential treatment, the principal actively sought to hire faculty who expressed an interest in teaming, interdisciplinary teaching, or in being involved somehow with the changes associated with the Coalition program. <p>	Another common criticism of the Coalition SWAS program centered on the degree of faculty input into the reform process -- specifically, whether it represented a democratic change coming from the faculty or merely an administrative mandate driven by the principal and a small core of teachers. Although a faculty committee had initiated Silas Ridge's involvement with the Coalition and the open Steering Committee had created the SWAS program, not everyone felt that they had access to the decision-making process. As one teacher remarked, "I think what created the problem was that the school began to make a major turn to [the Coalition], a very powerful turn, through a small number of teachers." Even though all teachers were invited to participate in the Coalition program, faculty maintained that participation was restricted since this process excluded those who could not attend the voluntary before- and after-school meetings so critical to this reform effort. <p>	Others saw the problem in terms of top-down change. In the words of one teacher: "The perception within the school was that it's not coming from the faculty; it's coming from the principal. And that's how [the opposition] coalesced." Others contended that the faculty never voted as a single entity on whether to be affiliated with the Coalition, nor did they vote on what "form" their Coalition involvement would take.3  As one teacher remarked: <p><blockquote>What started out as tacit agreement -- because why would you be against change? Why would you be against improvement? -- all of a sudden turned into a school-within-a-school. And that was not voted on by the full faculty.</blockquote>	A third source of resistance and resentment on the part of the larger school faculty emerged from what many noninvolved faculty sensed as implicit criticism of their conventional teaching practices embedded in Coalition rhetoric (e.g., teachers are lecturing too much). Some noninvolved faculty were also insulted by the associated implication that many of them were unwilling to change. Looking back on the tension this alleged critique generated within a veteran faculty, one teacher commented in a local newspaper article:<p><blockquote>Whether it was real or perceived, I don't know, but there was a feeling that what (older) teachers were doing and had been doing was not good and should be changed, and the new people were doing things right. You just can't suddenly say to people who thought that they were doing a good job all along that what you're doing is all wrong.</blockquote>	Another reason the SWAS program encountered problems concerned a tendency common to most American high schools -- the tensions that develop between principals and faculties (e.g., Lortie 1975, Hargreaves 1980). The predictable tensions that arise between administration and faculty were exacerbated in this situation by the common perception that the principal was an active proponent of Coalition reform and the SWAS faculty -- so active that many considered her manipulative. Some teachers, for instance, felt that she parceled out funds from various grants disproportionately to those supportive of her educational ideals. Others felt that she avoided holding faculty-wide meetings so that the opposition to her plans could never mobilize. Regard-less of the accuracy of these and similar assertions, the overall effect was that many faculty members and the principal came to distrust one another.<p>	The structural effects of expanding the Coalition program in its second year also fed into the opposition experienced by the SWAS. The required block scheduling of SWAS classes, now including sophomore and freshman teams, upset some teachers because they felt it disrupted scheduling for the rest of the school. Non-SWAS teachers also saw this expansion cutting into the number of honors sections available to them, since each SWAS grade (and therefore teacher) was guaranteed to teach one honors section. <p>	One significant factor which seems implicit in a good deal of the opposition to the Coalition SWAS, but which was never voiced directly in these terms by anyone at Silas Ridge, was that the SWAS teachers were now <i>exerting power </i>within the school. Prior to the creation of the SWAS and the Coalition Steering Committee, there was no faculty governance body with formal power, although there were "cluster coordinators" who were viewed as having some formal power. By creating this SWAS program and Steering Committee, SWAS faculty began to exert influence throughout the school, although that was not necessarily their intent, nor do they appear to have been fully aware of how far-reaching were the effects of their decisions and policies. <p>	Nonetheless, other faculty members felt that they were being adversely affected. They lost classes that they enjoyed teaching. They felt insulted. They saw the school's curriculum being changed without their input. Furthermore, some non-SWAS teachers felt that the SWAS teachers, those exerting this influence, were portrayed to the outside world in a very favorable light, as those persons doing the most exciting work at Silas Ridge. And many of those perceived to be the most supportive of this Coalition effort were women with Ivy League affiliations who were relatively new to the city of Silas Ridge and who had not been especially influential within the school prior to the creation of the Coalition program. Thus, it became a common perception that a clique of relative newcomers was now changing Silas Ridge High. Moreover, these newcomers appeared to be the persons who benefited the most from these changes. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wcpb"><h3>Will Coalition Philosophy Becomethe Prevailing Ethos?</h3>Presently, Silas Ridge is in an awkward position. They have received faculty support for Coalition affiliation. Nonetheless, those who expressed a desire to be actively involved in the program represent approximately one-quarter of the faculty. This leads us to view their prospects skeptically. We have seen faculty "vanguards" in other schools advocate for a program and receive the tacit support of their colleagues. The faculty vanguard expect that this passive endorsement will, in the future, turn into active support. <p>	Most often, however, due to a lack of consensus regarding the need for change and concerns about whether the changes being implemented were the most appropriate, we have found that rather than becoming supporters of the program, these indifferent or undecided faculty become opponents as they begin to see the changes affecting them. (This seems to have been what happened with Silas Ridge's SWAS program.) <p>	Furthermore, the Silas Ridge school system recently established a formal relationship with the Effective Schools Movement and committed all their schools to Effective School reform. However, the Coalition Central Staff presently maintains that all member schools must work toward "total school involvement" regarding their Coalition affiliation. This then raises the questions: As part of the Effective Schools Movement, can Silas Ridge designate Coalition philosophy as an appropriate strategy for school improvement? Will the Silas Ridge school system accept this? Will the Coalition Central Staff accept it?<p>	Although Coalition membership is guaranteed for at least the current academic year (1990-91), there are no plans to reinstitute a SWAS program at Silas Ridge. Even without a formal Coalition "structure" (aside from the subcommittee), Coalition supporters at Silas Ridge are optimistic. They note that some influential faculty have begun experimenting with Coalition-related reforms and that these ideas have begun to spread to other faculty who have expressed similar interest. These Coalition proponents also point to the recent meeting between the history and English departments of both city high schools to discuss the possibility of creating an interdisciplinary American studies course as another positive development. Moreover, they feel that the current Coalition effort at Silas Ridge has learned from the SWAS experience and has sought to create a broader base of support for their work, to allow faculty to experiment with Coalition ideas on their own terms, and to avoid any hint of preferential treatment. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cs2"><hr><center><h2>Case Study II:<br>Evans Hill High School</h2></center><hr>Evans Hill High School is located in a small, upper-middle-class community near a large urban center on the eastern seaboard. The school enjoys an extremely favorable reputation in the local community and throughout the region. The per-pupil expenditure at Evans Hill High School, the only public high school in the district, is well over $10,000. There are virtually no dropouts and most students attend post-secondary institutions. As of 1986, the student/classroom-teacher ratio was 1 to 15 and the average class size was 20.4 The school's population is about 96 percent white, 3 percent Asian, and less than 1 percent "other."5<p>	Between 1982 and 1990 the high school experienced a serious decline in enrollment -- over 30 percent -- from approximately 440 students to less than 300. This decline resulted from a series of demographic changes in the local population, not from any dissatisfaction with the school. The school's enrollment decline, coupled with a fairly fixed set of expenses for the school, meant that the per-pupil expenditure increased dramatically during the same period, even though school spending did not change greatly. <p>	The same circumstances that created the declining enrollments -- that is, a growing number of residents with no children enrolled in the public schools either because they were young and newly arrived in the community or because they were retired with no children at home -- also created a shrinking tax base. According to the superintendent of schools, the tax base in 1987 was between 8 and 10 percent less than just five years earlier. These taxpayers failed to pass one bond for school building improvements and appeared increasingly less willing to support ever larger school budgets. In his opening remarks to teachers in September of 1987, the superintendent stated: "The last apparent class that will graduate with one hundred or more members was the class of 1987. We have lower enrollments to look forward to and the Board has asked us to begin to plan accordingly."<p>	Against this backdrop of declining enrollments and concerns over stabilizing the district's budget should be juxtaposed a few additional salient points about the community and the school. First, parents and other members of the local community are intimately involved with the operation of the school. Several parent organizations meet regularly with school personnel for briefings on various school activities. <p>	Second, parents and the local community are often perceived as pressuring their children to participate in more activities and the high school as a whole to offer more electives and extracurricular activities. In a report prepared for the Coalition Central Staff, members of the Evans Hill High School faculty addressed this concern: <p><blockquote>[I]n a college preparatory program the pressure is to offer more rather than less, because more is better both to the community and to the colleges. The more [advanced placement] classes, foreign languages classes and other activities a student participates in, the better the student is able to compete in the college admissions game.6 </blockquote>	Third, in 1985 Evans Hill High School introduced an entirely new master schedule "to allow students to take more classes than in previous years." <p><blockquote>The schedule provides an opportunity for an "eighth period" without lengthening the day or shortening class periods. The eight periods, designated by letters A-H, rotate daily. Each day one period drops so that students have seven class periods. The cycle repeats itself every eight days.7</blockquote>	Fourth, most faculty at the high school hold multiple degrees, are tenured, and view themselves as professionals and specialists in their specific fields of study. Finally, in 1988 the school experienced an unanticipated turnover in both principal and assistant principal.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cotp2"><h3>Creation of the program</h3>The path that led Evans Hill High School to membership in the Coalition was summarized by a teacher-ethnographer at the school.8 In her re-port for the 1985-86 school year, she wrote:<p><blockquote>In the fall of 1984 at the opening day faculty meeting, Dr. Smith invited the faculty to engage in discussions about recent national reports on high schools published by the National Commission on Excellence in Education, by Goodlad, Adler, Boyer, and by Sizer. In October four teachers and Dr. Smith went to Brown to meet Theodore Sizer. Dr. Smith then invited Theodore Sizer to speak to the faculty at a December meeting. Following his address, interested faculty members formed a study group to discuss the high school curriculum. A dozen teachers representing most departments met weekly through the winter and spring.</blockquote>	<p>	According to participants, these sessions offered teachers a chance to talk about special and routine problems of teaching at Evans Hill. During these often emotional discussions, the teachers shared their frustrations with the status quo and developed a desire for change. The committee became interested in joining the Coalition of Essential Schools. In April, three members of the committee attended a meeting in Rochester directed by Theodore Sizer. There they learned how the Coalition was to be formed and how to apply for membership. The committee recommended that the Board of Education authorize the district to become a member of the Coalition. The proposal was accepted by the Board of Education in June 1985.9 Evans Hill High School joined the Coalition apparently without a vote of the faculty, but with a strong vote of support from the Board of Education.<p>	A summer workshop for the entire faculty and many other communications efforts during the 1985-86 school year -- including memos and time at regularly scheduled faculty meetings -- were designed to "generate faculty support for the Coalition."10 Meanwhile, the original committee (variously referred to as the Sizer committee, the Sizer Coalition committee, and later as the Exhibitions committee and Interdisciplinary Teaching Core)11 met voluntarily once a week after school to plan a Coalition program to implement during the 1986-87 school year. The first proposal for a pilot program was described as follows:<p><blockquote>The pilot program would offer a core interdisciplinary program on Western civilization for eighty students, forty each at the ninth and tenth grades. Grade nine would center around early European interdisciplinary studies and grade ten around the modern period with each following a chronological structure more or less organized by themes. Four teachers, two each from the English and social studies depart-ments, would be primarily responsible for coordinating their disciplines, but teachers in the arts and sciences would be released to work with students in the program as schedules permitted.12</blockquote>	As the principal and school's Coalition coordinator met with parents to "test out" the proposal, parents raised two sets of concerns: first, they were against creating a "special program" and argued "that if the pilot were good enough for a few it should be offered to all"; and, second, they wanted to make certain their child was part of the program. Responding to these concerns, the principal suggested changes in the pilot interdisciplinary program:<p><blockquote>To accommodate these concerns and to keep the program voluntary, Dr. Smith suggested that the social studies curriculum be changed to Western Civilization for the entire ninth grade and that an interdisciplinary elective be offered to ninth- and tenth-grade students as a skill and content enrichment course to complement work in English and social studies. Students who signed up for the elective would automatically be placed in the same English and social studies classes.13 </blockquote>	Dr. Smith and the coordinator returned with this proposal to the faculty and to students. A letter was sent to incoming ninth- and tenth-graders, and guidance counselors described the program in meetings with students. Despite this heavy recruiting, only twenty-five or thirty students enrolled in the program. The Evans Hill teacher-ethnographer thought students preferred a second foreign language to an "unknown" elective and added that "students were also concerned about having more homework assignments in English or social studies than those not taking the interdisciplinary elective."14 <p>	Myriad problems surfaced at this point in the planning process (early spring of 1986). The Sizer committee was fragmented due to other obligations that each member held within the school community, either as a part of their professional responsibilities or as voluntary work they did for the school. In addition, the planning for and implementation of other changes within the school began to exact a toll on the Sizer group. For example, in the second half of the 1985-86 school year, some Sizer supporters began to devote their time to planning for the creation of the middle school, scheduled for the fall of 1986. The lack of common planning time within the scheduled day meant that as these other responsibilities became more pressing, and as the end of the year loomed, there was no formal time available for the group as a whole to meet to react to the proposed program revisions and begin planning to incorporate them. <p>	In addition to these problems, which were somewhat internal to the group, other more external concerns developed. The teacher-ethnographer wrote:<p><blockquote>The Sizer program became entangled in the political life of the school. Historical alliances and rivalries in the faculty mobilized around the interdisciplinary elective and the work of the Sizer committee. In part, the committee became the issue in the struggle between these factions to establish some control over school reform. In part, it became the scapegoat for all the fear, confusion, and frustration that the faculty suffered during a year of much change: the new schedule, the establishment of a middle school, curriculum changes, the bond issue, and last, but not least, the leadership from Dr. Smith.15</blockquote>	The interdisciplinary elective became the focus for the classic struggle between those who wanted change and those who resisted change. Some felt that a few teachers experimenting with the curriculum might have a negative impact on the lives of the rest of the faculty. For example, the art and music departments worried that the interdisciplinary elective would conflict with their courses and thus reduce enrollment. In a community where the study of the arts is not considered as important as the study of "academic" subjects, these teachers saw the interdisciplinary elective as another threat to their survival. Reduced enrollments in their courses could mean the loss of jobs. Others were reluctant to let teachers experiment with the curriculum or with teaching practices because they suspected that, eventually, everyone would be forced to teach according to the Coalition's principles. The teachers who had taught the same courses for ten years were not prepared to change lesson plans and teaching methods. In essence, the committee's work was perceived to touch on the most sensitive of issues in teaching: job security and autonomy within the classroom.16 <p>	While someone less committed to the Sizer group's efforts might have used different language to describe these issues, there is consensus that all of these factors were issues at Evans Hill. We discuss these and other factors that emerged at the school in more detail below.<p>	Although they attempted to salvage the program, the Sizer group finally decided <p><blockquote>that the better part of valor would be to retrench. Instead of offering a new program, the four English and social studies teachers would try to incorporate the principles of the coalition into the teaching of Western civilization at the ninth- and tenth-grade levels. The two teachers at each grade level would try to plan a unit or two during the year that would involve some interdisciplinary work, would coordinate reading and writing assignments, and introduce the arts into the curriculum with the help of the art teacher. These activities would be offered to the entire grade level, not to one section alone.17</blockquote>	Those who were available planned together over the summer. The teacher-ethnographer summarized the Sizer group's planning year as follows:<p><blockquote>According to all committee members, the year ended painfully. We had suffered from personal attacks and the lack of faculty support for our activities. We had sacrificed a lot of our time and energy for a program that was far from the one we had envisioned in our early brainstorming sessions. We were frustrated and impatient with the pace of reform, but we had also become wary of the risks and the responsibilities of orchestrating an experimental program. Instead of moving forward, we felt that we had succumbed to a powerful resistance to change from faculty, students, and parents. </blockquote><blockquote>Looking back on the year, all agree that we learned some important lessons about change. We learned the value of political savvy in times of reform, the need for mutual support and comradeship, the fact that curriculum building is an evolutionary process, and that responsibility for reform must shift from those who lead to those who do.18</blockquote>	Despite the rather gloomy end to the teacher-ethnographer's report and the apparent scrapping of all plans for a formal interdisciplinary program to be implemented in the 1986-87 school year, a very small program was piloted the following fall.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="impl2"><h3>Implementation</h3>The first interdisciplinary program (often called simply Interdisciplinary) began in the fall of 1986. Fifteen ninth-graders volunteered for the program, which paired their history and English classes five times during each eight-day cycle. The ninth-grade curriculum was designed to integrate a history of Western civilization course with an English curriculum that emphasized myths, legends, and classic works from the same periods. For instance, while studying ancient Greek history and philosophy in their history course, students read <i>The Odyssey</i>. <p>	Projects incorporating the fine arts also were undertaken as part of the integrated curriculum, especially during the back-to-back periods scheduled for the interdisciplinary program. Part of the integration of fine arts into the Greek and Roman curriculum included a visit to a nearby museum where students conducted a "treasure hunt," looking for examples of Egyptian, Greek, and Roman art illustrative of types they had learned about in preparatory sessions with the art teacher. <p>	Dr. Smith and the Sizer group felt it was a top priority to "coordinate the English and history curricula in grades nine and ten to forge, wherever possible, an interdisciplinary program without violating the integrity of any discipline."19 Accordingly, the two major subjects continued to be taught as separate entities, and the teachers moved at their own pace. Art projects formed the basis of integrated projects -- each art project (mask, manuscript, etc.)20 required a presentation, called a mini-exhibition,21 that linked it to the themes of the major works being read for English and history classes. <p>	The interdisciplinary elective was not attempted at the tenth-grade level during this first year. However, in the second semester all tenth-grade classes did an interdisciplinary project that used the study of art, history, literature, music, and philosophy to look at the Romantic Age and the Industrial Revolution. This project involved lectures, simulation projects, and group work, and required students to prepare interdisciplinary research papers.<p>	SWAS teachers in both grades were encouraged by these interdisciplinary experiments.22 Planning to implement some interdisciplinary ideas across grade nine and to expand the pilot interdisciplinary elective to grade ten the following year began that spring.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="expa2"><h3>Expansion</h3>In the second year of implementation (1987-88), the interdisciplinary program included a ninth- and a tenth-grade component. Each class had approximately twenty students.23 During the second year the ninth-grade team continued building their interdisciplinary program in the same manner as the previous year, that is, staying roughly in sequence and using art as the primary integrative feature. <p>	The tenth-grade team adopted a different approach: while they had some participation from the art teacher and used the music teacher as a resource for one unit, their interdisciplinary emphasis primarily entailed sequencing each course's readings so that they remained chronologically parallel as they moved through the modern epochs of Western civilization. Several mini-exhibitions consisted of "trials" where characters from one or more of the literary works and key historical figures testified for or against a historical figure accused of villainous acts. For example, the characters from Dickens' <i>Hard Times </i>and such noteworthy historical figures as Karl Marx and other economists and historians "testified" at a trial about living and working conditions for England's poor in the early industrial period. Most often the English and history classes studied the same time periods simultaneously; however the teachers taught independently and they seldom combined their classes.<p>	The third year (1988-89), the program expanded once again to include ninth-, tenth-, and eleventh-grade interdisciplinary courses. The ninth grade maintained roughly the same interdisciplinary schedule.24 The tenth-grade SWAS team maintained its approach and incorporated more mini-exhibitions. <p>	The eleventh-grade SWAS teachers took yet another approach to interdisciplinary teaching. They used the back-to-back periods (and some separate periods) to team-teach the course, moving back and forth between discussion of American literature and American history. That is, they made connections between the two fields through trying to sequence the study of the literature and history and through debate and discussion in classes with both teachers present. They made limited use of the fine arts resource teachers who worked with the other grades, preferring to integrate these subjects into their discussions and debates.<p>	During the 1989-90 school year there was lateral expansion, that is, the ninth, tenth, and eleventh grades each had two interdisciplinary sections, but no twelfth-grade interdisciplinary program was established. Several personnel changes and some shifts in scheduling priorities resulted in a revised program. Scheduling changes meant that while teachers in English and history now had more common planning time, the SWAS teachers had fewer back-to-back classes and were no longer assured of being free during the "other" period of their interdisciplinary course. This had an enormous impact on the ninth-grade program, where much of the work of linking art projects had only been possible due to the back-to-back periods and the voluntary use of each teacher's free time in the other subject's class. <p>	The tenth grade underwent similar modifica-tions due to the absence of one of the primary teachers. And the eleventh grade's entire approach was endangered since schedule changes dictated that the two teachers could rarely be in the same classroom together. By the midpoint of that year there were serious discussions about whether the programs could continue and whether, in their current embattled situations, they were even remotely interdisciplinary as they were originally envisioned. The interdisciplinary program continued into 1990-91, but all parties -- administrators, SWAS faculty, and parents -- currently voice concern about further expansion and scheduling issues, as well as the program's overall intent.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rots"><h3>Recruitment of Teachers and Studentsto the SWAS Program</h3>Between 1986 and 1990, the number of teachers directly involved in the interdisciplinary program increased from three to seven. The number of students increased from 15 to approximately 115 (roughly one-third of the school). <p>	Planning time for involved teachers also became more routinized. In the planning and first years of the program (1985-86 and 1986-87), substitutes were hired and a few long blocks of planning time were created for the Sizer group teachers. In addition, these teachers met during their free periods, at lunch, and after school to design the interdisciplinary (and seminar) programs.25 Numerous complaints about the lack of planning time were acknowledged in the 1989-90 schedule by instituting a block arrangement that guaranteed English and history teachers at least three periods per eight-day cycle for planning.26<p>	Faculty who became involved in the interdisciplinary program at Evans Hill High School were, for the most part, drawn from the original Sizer group. As the program expanded, the principal took advantage of leaves of absence to hire two long-term substitutes for the History Department who were eager to join the interdisciplinary program. Both were later hired and tenured. These leaves, departures, and hirings were crucial to the successful expansion of the interdisciplinary program because the two departments are quite small (four members in history, five in English).27 Also, Dr. Smith said she was unwilling to hire any new faculty who were not committed to the Coalition philosophy. As she saw it, the school was committed to the Coalition, and new personnel should be as well. <p>	The teams had complete autonomy to determine the form and content of their interdisciplinary program. Realignments of teachers among the teams occurred last year (1989-90) and continue this year. Each grade level has subsequently re-examined its interdisciplinary program and experimented with different approaches, further highlighting the teachers' autonomy. <p>	Dr. Smith actively recruited new staff members committed to interdisciplinary instruction who subsequently were socialized by and through regular meetings of the Sizer group.28 The two new history teachers attended summer work sessions at the high school. Both participated in Coalition-sponsored events, and one served briefly as the school's Coalition Coordinator. <p>	As mentioned earlier, first-year student recruitment was accomplished by asking the parents of incoming ninth-graders to approve their son's or daughter's participation in the special program. The following year, recruitment was not an issue because of the well-publicized descriptions of the program and its "successes" throughout the year (to be discussed in the next section). Many students continued in the program as sophomores and, according to the principal, there was more interest expressed by ninth- and tenth-grade parents than the two pilot interdisciplinary classes could accommodate. <p>	At the eleventh-grade level, SWAS recruitment remained problematic, largely because some students who might have continued in the interdisciplinary program opted to take advanced placement (AP) American history, a junior-senior elective. Consequently, the eleventh-grade teachers maintained that their interdisciplinary program was not as heterogeneous as the other programs. That the program lost students to the AP course is not entirely unexpected, since Evans Hill students are under tremendous pressure (both self-imposed and from parents) to take AP courses, in part for the challenge but also to make their transcripts as competitive as possible for their college applications. <p>	A final point about recruitment into the program: Occasionally, a few students had to be scheduled into the interdisciplinary program because it was the only English and history sequence that fit into their schedules. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sioo"><h3>Success/Involvement of Others in SWAS</h3>Throughout the early implementation and expansion of the interdisciplinary SWAS, involved teachers and administrators made frequent presentations about the program's activities to various parent groups associated with the high school. They also took some of the products of the interdisciplinary program's artistic component to school board and parent group meetings to emphasize the high quality of students' work. In addition to reporting the program's successes, faculty and administrators invited those present to visit the classes, accompany them on field trips, and in general to explore the program for themselves.<p>	Support for the program was not long in coming from parents and board members. This support remained relatively constant, except when new changes were made. For instance, in 1987-88, the seminar program was created, made mandatory, and attached to the interdisciplinary program. Parents were initially skeptical of this program, which many of their children found "confusing," "boring," and an "obstacle" to elective courses or study halls they preferred. Involved faculty and administrators patiently met with parents and attended numerous parent group meetings to explain the new program's purposes. <p>	While parents and other community members raised concerns about new programs -- particularly whether they would be as rigorous as existing programs or whether participation in the program would preclude participation in something equally worthwhile  -- the patient and respectful support-building by SWAS teachers and both sets of administrators has to date yielded positive results. Townspeople seem very supportive of the program, a bonus for involved teachers who, as we discuss below, do not find the same levels of support and enthusiasm among their noninvolved colleagues. The reporting of success and the involvement of parents in the program have provided some much-needed goodwill for the involved teachers and have spread the word of the interdisciplinary program's success and desirability throughout the community.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ptsf"><h3>Problems the SWAS Faced </h3>Thus far, the Evans Hill SWAS program has encountered a number of problems, some directly related to the program (such as structural constraints that impinged on the program's expansion) and some that affected the program although they were not direct outgrowths of the SWAS program (such as administrative turnover).<p><h4>Articulation with the Rest of the School</h4>	From the foregoing description, it is apparent that several issues of articulation with the "larger" school emerged in the Evans Hill High School SWAS case. For one, there were difficult scheduling issues. According to Dr. Smith, it required ninety-nine computer runs to schedule the school in the 1987-88 school year. In part this large number was caused by the exceptionally high number of "singletons" in the schedule. But it also reflected the problems of scheduling the two interdisciplinary classes back-to-back five days out of eight and adding the seminar program into the schedule. <p>	Furthermore, while initiating membership in the Coalition, the school was also experiencing declining enrollment. Some faculty viewed both the Coalition and declining enrollments as a threat to elective courses. Many members of the Foreign Language Department in particular (which offers three languages -- French, Spanish, and Latin) were concerned about the Coalition program and the reform's philosophy more generally. They argued that this approach excluded foreign languages as core subjects. As for the interdisciplinary program specifically, they felt it would create an additional conflict for students who wanted to study a second language. <p>	Also, the expansion of the interdisciplinary program was made difficult by the existence of the AP program. And no expansion into the twelfth grade was deemed possible because the senior English teacher did not wish to restructure her class syllabus around the twelfth-grade Global Studies curriculum. <p><h4>Faculty Resistance</h4>	From the outset, as the teacher-ethnographer observed, noninvolved faculty were skeptical of and resistant toward the SWAS planning and implementation. Since the vast majority of the staff was tenured, they felt immune to any efforts to convince them to change and embrace CES philosophy. Further, they saw no need to change what they had been doing: they were professionally trained and their students had always been successful. <p>	The noninvolved faculty expressed little concern that efforts at socialization -- through recruiting people to the Sizer group, speeches by the principal, being placed on "new" committees somehow linked to Coalition ideas, or being asked to attend a Coalition-sponsored conference -- would effect a change in their attitude. One teacher, upon hearing rumors of Dr. Smith's probable departure, said, "I knew I could wait her out. I've been here more than fifteen years; she's been here less than five. I figured she would be gone soon. So much for her pet programs." <p>	Although there was opposition to the Coalition at the school throughout the five-year period discussed in this case, little of it focused specifically on the interdisciplinary courses -- except as involved teachers were portrayed by the opposition as "the principal's favorites." Yet charges of favoritism were more than petty labels. Dr. Smith was new to the school and she introduced the Coalition ideas to the faculty. The Sizer group was largely comprised of female teachers, new or fairly new to the school -- in other words, the teachers who were most likely to have little power in a business-as-usual environment. The charges of favoritism in this context helped to create a battle line between the Sizer group and the skeptics that lasted long after Dr. Smith departed.<p><h4>Administrative Turnover</h4>	Between 1984 and 1990, Evans Hill High School had two principals. The first, Dr. MaryEllen Smith, brought the Coalition to the faculty's attention, encouraged the school to join, and helped to found the interdisciplinary program.29 During the second semester of the 1987-88 school year, she took a leave of absence and resigned later that spring. Mr. Thomas Winters was hired as the new principal and began in September of 1988. He too expressed a strong commitment to Coalition ideas. All Coalition-related programs, begun during Smith's tenure, have continued, albeit in slightly different forms.<p>	The departure of Dr. Smith was accompanied by the departure of her assistant principal. The replacement, hired from within the school, was a supporter of the Coalition and much of what had gone on in its name at Evans Hill. The simultaneous departure of both administrators could have been a blow to the Coalition project at the school (and as we shall see, some argue that it was). However, throughout the hiring process, both the Board of Education and the superintendent made clear their strong commitment to the school's Coalition membership and sought candidates who were knowledgeable of and enthusiastic about the Coalition. Nevertheless, the very different interpretations of CES philosophy by the two principals and their completely different approaches to creating school-site change had serious consequences for the interdisciplinary SWAS program. <p>	Where Dr. Smith had encouraged meetings of the Sizer group, had given priority to the interdisciplinary block in scheduling, had found ways to provide the group with release time, had scheduled common planning time into their cycles, and had released them from certain duties (homeroom, for instance), Mr. Winters discouraged "private" meetings, arguing that if it was a whole-school effort, the entire faculty should take part in the conversations about the shape of any Coalition efforts at the school. <p>	Winters and his assistant principal also made tradeoffs in the schedule for 1989-90: while <i>all </i>English and history teachers were given common planning time, the cost was in the number of back-to-back periods for the interdisciplinary program. Additionally, while Dr. Smith had striven to schedule the English teacher's free period to coincide with the history teacher's interdisciplinary period, this could no longer be accommodated once the common planning time was blocked into the schedule. Consequently the "specialness" of the Sizer group was questioned -- a prelude, in the thinking of SWAS faculty, to the Coalition's demise at the school, but in Mr. Winter's view a prelude to schoolwide acceptance of Coalition philosophy. Thus, this change in leadership, with concomitant changes in how business at Evans Hill was conducted, had immediate consequences for the interdisciplinary program and the Sizer group.<p>	Much of the original opposition to the Coalition had resulted from its close identification with Dr. Smith, the first principal. Those opposed to the Coalition (and the SWAS) viewed her as incredibly manipulative, and there were accusations of trade-offs (power for allegiance and so forth). Pro-Coalition teachers found her to be visionary and inspirational, a leader who shook up the complacency of a faculty accustomed to being pampered because of its prestigious setting and success with its students: in other words, a crusader who was asking the faculty to rethink their jobs. SWAS teachers felt she asked parents and the entire school community to consider the moral education of their children rather than simply their performance on standardized tests. <p>	Further, Dr. Smith encouraged the pro-Coalition teachers to think that success with the interdisciplinary pilot program would lead to its gradual expansion throughout the school. Therefore, they viewed their work as a pilot, and were encouraged when a science and a math teacher volunteered to lecture on the contributions of the ancient Greeks to their respective disciplines.30<p>	The arrival of Mr. Winters at the school suggested that much could change. Those currently-in-favor with the administration might be less so, a new group might emerge, or the school might return to business as usual. Winters was aware that factionalism in the school was a major problem and viewed it as essential that he unite the faculty. To do this he reintroduced faculty-wide discussion of the nine Common Principles and suggested that, since the Board had approved membership in CES for at least another eighteen months, the faculty should define how their current practice was consistent with the Common Principles and determine what needed to change, if anything. <p>	This, in essence, pleased everyone and no one. The Sizer group felt Mr. Winters' interpretations of the nine Common Principles were watered down and conciliatory rather than thought-provoking and challenging. The rest of the school was still uninterested in considering the Common Principles. Many of these teachers were thrilled by Dr. Smith's departure. They found the rhetoric from the Smith years so emotion-laden that it was stressful for many even to consider having "those" discussions again.31 <p>	In a very short time Winters' suggestions to assess where the school stood vis-à-vis the Common Principles created hostility from all sides. The anti-Coalition faction had few open confrontations with him, but the Sizer group, initially relieved that they were to continue meeting, soon found their meetings stressful, perceiving Winters as critical of their conception of <i>interdisciplinary </i>and as suggesting that it was inappropriate for them to meet privately to discuss what they considered to be vitally important issues. Ironically, they perceived that he was manipulating them and were resentful of it.32 By the fall of 1990, there seemed to be a growing consensus among the faculty that Mr. Winters too was manipulative, but those who felt they had experienced the brunt of Dr. Smith's manipulation (the noninvolved faculty) found his style less offensive.<p>	From the above discussion, it is clear that there had been much support for the school-within-a-school program from the first principal. In retrospect, some contend that it may have been too much support, given how unprepared the Sizer group felt to defend itself after her departure. The new principal was also supportive of the program, but was unwilling to make it the school's number-one priority  -- a fact that won him some support from the noninvolved, but created much tension with the Sizer group. Throughout Evans Hill's membership in the Coalition, both assistant principals, the superintendent of schools, the school board, and parent advisory groups have been supportive and enthusiastic about the interdisciplinary program.<p><h4>Union Issues</h4>	Unlike unions at some of our study schools, the Evans Hill teachers' union made no aspect of the interdisciplinary program or the Coalition a union issue.<p><h4>Isolation of SWAS Faculty </h4>	Both the SWAS and the noninvolved faculty acknowledged that SWAS faculty became isolated from the rest of the Evans Hill faculty. Initially, the SWAS faculty believe, the isolation began because they needed every available minute to plan. Meetings took place in classrooms during lunch, free periods, and after school. Once the "battle lines" were drawn between supporters and nonsupporters, it simply became less stressful for SWAS faculty to work during their free time than to socialize in settings that seemed full of skeptics and barbed remarks. Gradually, contact between the two groups was reduced to occasionally sharing the same lunch room (at different tables) and attending the same faculty meetings.33<p>	The isolation seems to have had three consequences, aside from the ill feelings that teachers described. First, because there was little direct contact between the noninvolved and the involved teachers, there was not much awareness of what the SWAS program was doing on the part of the noninvolved teachers. <p>	Second, this "ignorance" was accompanied (and probably heightened) by mistrust that was fostered by the SWAS teams' perceived "favored" status and the sometimes-mentioned "secrecy" that they maintained about their activities. The involved teachers disputed the label of "secretive" and asserted that they were tired of being criticized and were too overworked to care much about keeping their noninvolved colleagues up to date about their activities. Mistrust of motives and intentions was a serious problem at the school, especially given the perception that the first principal would "foist" the program onto the entire staff as soon as she thought she could "get away with it." The isolation of the SWAS faculty, for whatever reasons, was seen as contributing to the mistrust of the noninvolved. <p>	Finally, the alliances necessary for the program to spread throughout the school were more difficult to initiate once the program's teachers were seen (and defined themselves) as isolated from the rest of the school.34 <p><h4>Lack of Consensus about the Program </h4>	The very different configurations of interdisciplinary classes and the frequent restructuring to accommodate individual teaching styles led some parents, as well as the new principal and assistant principal to ask, "Just what is Interdisciplinary all about?" This placed the teachers directly involved as well as other teachers in the Sizer group in the position of having to defend themselves and the program against what they saw as both new and further political harassment. <p>	As will be apparent below, the SWAS teachers were feeling "overwhelmed" or "overburdened" by the added pressure of having to defend their program in addition to planning and teaching in it. They saw the present principal's attempts to clarify the interdisciplinary nature of the current interdisciplinary program as an attack on their efforts. Mr. Winters viewed it as an important clarification that would provide consistency in expectations and understanding of the goals of the interdisciplinary teams. He also questioned whether Interdisciplinary should be "marketed" to students and parents as one program if each grade's offering was so different from the others.<p><h4>SWAS or Whole-School Effort?</h4>	Neither principal ever labeled the school's participation in  the Coalition of Essential Schools as a SWAS project. Both saw Evans Hill High School as a whole-school effort.35 Dr. Smith was unwilling to label her school a "school-within-a-school program" because as she put it: "The whole school will be undergoing change as a result of our Coalition membership. The interdisciplinary program is only one aspect of our Coalition reform effort." <p>	This is an important point, because, while other SWAS programs were the concentrated effort of the reform-minded people at their schools, the Evans Hill High School reform platform straddles two normally distinct categories of Coalition schools: "school-within-a-school" and "whole-school effort." The other two changes introduced under the first principal's tenure (and continued, although with modifications, by the new principal) were more schoolwide efforts at change: the Student-Faculty Legislature and the seminar programs. <p>	Creating the interdisciplinary program at Evans Hill muddied the waters vis-à-vis the Coalition of Essential Schools for two reasons. First, it was labeled a pilot program and as the teacher-ethnographer wrote in her first-year report, the noninvolved faculty expressed concern that they might be required to change as a result of the school's Coalition membership. In those circumstances, the pilot was potentially the wave of the future. <p>	Second, faculty uninterested in teaming or interdisciplinary work saw the part (the interdisciplinary program) as the whole (the Coalition) and rejected it. Although both principals made a concerted effort to separate the SWAS program from Coalition philosophy more broadly and to identify the seminar program and the Student-Faculty Legislature as Coalition-related, faculty still refer to Interdisciplinary as "the Coalition" at Evans Hill. As recently as a faculty meeting in June of 1990, one teacher said: "Why are we asking what will be different in four years as a result of Coalition membership? We have the interdisciplinary program, that's the Coalition in this school."<p>	One result of this confusion has been that those teachers not involved in the SWAS program have been uninterested in the supposed implications of Coalition membership. Another result is that two differing views of the school's Coalition status exist: the school's administrators, the superintendent, and the Board of Education view the high school as a whole-school member of CES, while both the involved and noninvolved faculty see the school-within-a-school faculty as the Coalition.<p><h4>Local Community Concerns</h4>	With specific regard to Evans Hill, an upper-middle-class community, one large issue in the community was the need to balance "goodies" -- i.e., "If this is such a great program why aren't all students involved?" Second, the staff felt it important to reassure the community, and to some degree the faculty, that this program was worthwhile; i.e. some people were asking, "Why should the school change the way it is doing things? Evans Hill is an outstanding school with a superb reputation. Show me why this is better. What is your proof?"<p>	Both these issues demonstrate the close working relationship that exists between the school and the local community. Parents and other taxpayers are very involved in the life of the school -- more so than at most of our other school sites. Parents are knowledgeable about college admissions and about current debates about educational reform in America. While the parents are willing to experiment, they nonetheless ask for justifications that a proposed change will not jeopardize the more "privileged" position their children hold vis-à-vis public education in general.<p>	The SWAS teachers have kept parental groups and the local school board informed of their activities and their success in large part in deference to these concerns. While the first issue (whether all children should have the interdisciplinary program) remains unresolved, the frequent reports from SWAS teachers about their activities and student performance seem to have convinced the local community that this approach is not a threat to the intellectual development of the students involved.<p><h4>Was It Grassroots?</h4>	The first principal's close association with the SWAS, the widespread opposition to both Dr. Smith and the SWAS, and the limited involvement of faculty in planning for and implementing reform programs suggest that differing interpretations exist regarding whether the SWAS (and the Coalition) were grassroots efforts at change. Teachers who are actively involved often describe it as such -- and given their autonomy and the direct and sustained interaction they have had with the school administration as part of the planning process, they feel they can support their claims that the program has been grassroots. They proposed activities or changes, and while their requests were not always granted, for the most part they felt that members of both administrations listened to their requests. Additionally, initial membership, they recall, was the result of faculty recommendations based on a year of study. <p>	For the most part, the noninvolved teachers viewed neither the program nor the Coalition as a grassroots initiative. They saw both as Smith's "babies." Some said Coalition membership was "foisted upon" a faculty that generally lacked interest in change and cited the limited participation of veteran teachers in the project, the manipulative and overly protective behavior of the first principal toward the SWAS and other Coalition initiatives, and the marginal place of the SWAS program in the life of the school as evidence to support their stance.<p>	Both administrations have characterized the reform as a grassroots initiative -- either because of the new roles the involved teachers have taken or because many of the suggestions for change that were implemented have come from the planning work of the involved teachers. Both characterized their role as one of nurturing and supporting the efforts of the Sizer group by making time available as well as providing thoughtful and challenging feedback to their proposals. <p>	The two principals also agreed that broader participation was essential if Coalition ideas were to spread throughout the school. As previously mentioned, the two differed in how best to effect this expansion. Both principals made decisions that, by inadvertently (or intentionally) supporting the SWAS, challenged other programs and content areas in the school. As a result both were seen by some teachers as imposing the Coalition (and/or the SWAS) on the school. Each time that occurred, the noninvolved (that is, the uninterested and the opposed teachers) felt justified in their assessment of the whole enterprise as the "principal's pet project."<p>	These multiple interpretations raise an important question: What is the appropriate role for the principal in a grassroots educational reform project? If using the power that he or she has is seen as mandating change, it may undermine any claims to "grassrootness." Equally, a more hands-off approach by the principal might signal indifference, rather than enthusiastic support.36 At Evans Hill, the first principal was seen as overly authoritative by the noninvolved, the second as less impositional but equally unreflective about membership in a program that had, in their view, little grassroots support schoolwide. <p>	The efforts by the first principal on behalf of the SWAS team were viewed by team members as heroic confirmation of her commitment to the program. The second principal's insistence that a broader base of support for the Coalition as a whole was necessary was viewed as an effort to phase out or overhaul the SWAS, rather than as support for it.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wcbt"><h3>Will CES Become the Prevailing Ethosat Evans Hill High School?</h3>Currently, it seems doubtful that Coalition philosophy will become the prevailing ethos at the school. Coalition philosophy may have been compromised due to its initial definition at the school site and particularly because of its close association with the interdisciplinary program, which participating faculty continue to defend,but which noninvolved faculty still dismiss or ignore. In the Evans Hill High School case, then, the equating of the SWAS with Coalition philosophy and practice at the school proved unfortunate because interdisciplinary teaching is not likely to become a major organizing principle schoolwide.37 <p>	Apart from the SWAS, since the seminar program and the Student-Faculty Legislature are viewed as quite successful by the school's faculty and the larger community, the ultimate fate of CES philosophy remains to be seen. Students are still resistant to full participation in both of these other programs, although their resistance seems to have lessened with time. <p>	The foregoing comments are not intended to judge the effectiveness of the SWAS program or the teachers in it: they are an assessment of how early politics and perceived manipulation by the principal may over time continue to hamper specific programs and general acceptance of Coalition involvement and ideas. As one teacher who defines himself as hostile toward the Coalition said, <p><blockquote>Despite what the literature said and the number of times MaryEllen brought Ted Sizer here, the Coalition at Evans Hill High School was MaryEllen's Coalition, not Ted's. If you liked her, fine. If not, then you did not -- could not -- like the Coalition. It was that easy.</blockquote>	Not only are these problems impediments to CES philosophy becoming the prevailing ethos, there are also issues related to the size and composition of the school that will affect its more general acceptance. For example, some issues that were present at larger schools seemed to be even greater obstacles at Evans Hill because of its small size. These include: faculty recruitment, the myriad scheduling issues (particularly concerning singletons) that existed from the start, and the competition for students and with established programs, like AP and honors, that created recruitment problems. In the absence of consensus that experimentation is needed, it is hard to imagine how the program could expand further.<p>	Nevertheless, the school's commitment to many aspects of the nine Common Principles, such as personalized education, has been enhanced by such developments as the creation of grade-level meetings for all involved faculty and the seminar program and Student-Faculty Legislature. Some faculty and all administrators (past and present) trace the impetus for these new programs to CES philosophy. Whether these schoolwide programs come to be recognized as part of the school's involvement with CES or not remains uncertain.38 <p>	We conclude that the initial local interpretation of CES at Evans Hill created and justified the actions of those who wanted to experiment and change, but has subsequently made it more difficult to include others in discussions and implementation of change -- in part because the emphasis of the early interpretation was on interdisciplinary work and in part because everyone involved recalls a turbulent history of accusations and actions that separated rather than united, that increased factionalism rather than reducing it, and that made power relations within the school more problematic.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cs3"><hr><center><h2>Case Study III:<br>Earvin High School</h2></center><hr>Earvin High School is one of four magnet high schools in Eastown, an eastern city of 150,000 residents. The student body of approximately 950 students is minority-majority. In September of 1987, the breakdown of students by self-reported ethnicity or race was as follows: African-American students made up the largest single group, 45 percent; 21 percent of the school was Hispanic; 15 percent, white; 8 percent, Portuguese; 6 percent, Asian; and 5 percent, Cape Verdean. <p>	Within the city's secondary school structure, Earvin has been designated an "arts and communication" magnet -- offering courses in theater, chorus, art, photography, and dance. Currently, less than 15 percent of Earvin students participate in this program. Besides its magnet program, Earvin has a Coalition SWAS (which enrolls approximately 31 percent of Earvin's students), a special educa-tion program (which enrolls about 6 percent of the student body), and an English-as-a-second-language program (which enrolls nearly 26 percent of the students). Earvin also has a traditional comprehensive high school program (which enrolls 25 percent of the student body) where students are tracked according to a three-tier system. <p>	In the late 1980s, the time period relevant to this report, Earvin's dropout rate was estimated to range between 40 and 50 percent, and student "course failures" numbered around 1,800 annually -- on average, nearly two per student.<p>	In the fifties and sixties, Earvin had been a neighborhood school that attracted a racial mix of students from the city's East Side, competed with the city's College Preparatory High School for Eastown's top students, and even enrolled students from nearby towns that had no high schools. After a "disturbance"39 by African-American students in 1969, many of the more affluent families in Earvin's "feeder pattern" gradually withdrew their children from Earvin to attend either private schools or the city's College Preparatory High School. <p>	In the decade prior to Earvin's involvement with the Coalition, the school experienced a period of decline characterized by high principal turnover (twelve in thirteen years), rising dropout rates, falling attendance rates, and building disrepair (the local newspaper even wrote an article entitled, "Walls of School Literally Tumbling Down, Some So Bad Emergency Repairs Have to Be Made"). To bolster enrollment, the city began busing students to Earvin from the city's south side, an area of low income families and high numbers of minorities. In the "Year One" report on the efforts of Earvin's Essential school program, the head teacher described how Earvin's reputation influenced its student composition in the late 1980s:<p><blockquote>The image of the school in the neighborhood, both on the East Side and the less affluent neighborhoods, is that Earvin is a rough school and you'll be lucky to learn much as a student there. This distorted image does not match the reality within the school, but we do need a larger backbone of those excellent students who help determine a higher standard for any school. </blockquote><blockquote>As head teacher I have had the opportunity to meet with many different groups and visit the many different public middle and Catholic intermediate schools. The general theme is that the counselors and teachers put the top students almost into a pipeline for [the college preparatory school], or even direct them toward some of the Catholic and private high schools. The next level of students is pegged for the [business/vocational magnet]. The next level of ambitious students is encouraged to go to the other magnets which are left; this includes Earvin's arts magnet. </blockquote><blockquote>And then there are the many other students who are not headed into any program or magnet school. They may have applied but did not get in. Or they did not apply because they had no specific interest or motivation to follow a set direction. Many have a negative self-image to start with and in many cases do not wish to come to Earvin, partly due to what rumors they've heard, definitely because it's too far away from their homes, and also because the school can't teach them a specific trade. They are told they have no other choice. As a result, there is a self-fulfilling prophecy which leads to their poor performance in high school (Head Teacher 1987:1). </blockquote>	Although minorities comprise only 20 percent of the city's population, they constitute 57 percent of the public school population -- in effect, Eastown is a white city with a minority school system. In November of 1987, the city enrolled 43 percent white students, 25 percent African-American, 20 percent Hispanic, and 11 percent Asian. In the high schools, minority representation is even higher, since many middle-class Eastown students attend public, neighborhood grade schools (which often serve more racially and economically homogeneous clienteles than the high schools) but private secondary schools. <p>	To understand Earvin High School more completely, it helps to situate the school within the Eastown school system. Eastown's four high schools are all part of a magnet system instituted in the 1970s as a way to voluntarily address desegregation issues through "choice." Of the other three magnet schools, one is a science magnet, one is a business/vocational magnet, and the third is a college preparatory school. The business/vocational and science magnets have "open" enrollment, while the college preparatory school restricts enrollment through an entrance exam. <p>	Although the magnet system was implemented with the intent of providing a quality education to all city students while adhering to federal desegregation guidelines, issues of race, ethnicity, and social class are still very much a part of the system's structure. For example, although minorities make up more than 57 percent of the secondary school population, at the college preparatory school they represent but 22 percent of the school population, whereas at Earvin they make up  closer to 80 percent.40 <p>	Student scores on the Metropolitan Achievement Tests from the spring of 1987 reveal how this magnet structure influences the city's schools. The average of math, reading, and language scores at Earvin was in the twenty-fourth percentile, the lowest in the state. The business/vocational and science magnets fared little better, receiving scores in the 26th and 31st percentiles, respectively. The college preparatory school, however, scored in the 84th percentile, nine points higher than any other high school in the state. <p>	Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores provide another perspective on this magnet system. In 1989, the College Preparatory High School had a mean SAT verbal score of 494 and a mean math score of 534. The science magnet had a mean verbal score of 298 and a mean math score of 355. The business/ vocational magnet had a mean verbal score of 297 and a mean math score of 353. Earvin had a mean verbal of 326 and a mean math score of 353. The national mean SAT scores for the same year were 427 verbal and 476 math. <p>	The number of test-takers at the schools is also revealing. At the College Preparatory High School, 19 percent of the student body took the SATs while at the business/vocational magnet, the science magnet, and Earvin 5, 6, and 7 percent, respectively, took the exam. In part, this breakdown reflects the fact that Eastown supports four private schools because many parents of children who do not qualify for the College Preparatory High School send them to private schools. <p>	A graduate student from the nearby university who student-taught at Earvin and who had himself gone to Eastown schools reflected on this common tendency as he described his personal "fear of failure": <p><blockquote>Forget college [entrance] exams. They were nothing. The most frightened I ever was taking an exam was when I took the entrance exam for [the College Preparatory High School] because, if I failed that exam, I would have gone to Earvin.41 </blockquote>	One other factor important to understanding life at Earvin High School concerns the geographic mobility of the student population. For example, in October of 1985, there were 343 students enrolled in the freshman class at Earvin. By September of 1986, as sophomores, there were 237 students enrolled in this class. In November of 1987, 223 students were enrolled as juniors at Earvin. By their senior year, the class that had begun with 343 students graduated 130 students -- <i>69 of whom had spent all four years at Earvin. </i><p>	Of course, some of these students dropped out of school, but many simply moved out of the school district. Earvin's guidance staff noted that such drastic turnovers in the Earvin student body are typical. They had found that it is common for 30 percent of those students enrolled at Earvin in September to be gone by June, and 30 percent of those enrolled in June to be new to the school since September. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cots"><h3>Creation of the SWAS Program</h3>As with many of the earliest Coalition schools, Earvin's official involvement with the Coalition began with a visit from Ted Sizer (in March of 1984). After this visit, the faculty set up an <i>ad hoc </i>committee to consider Coalition membership. This committee reviewed the Coalition's <i>Prospectus </i>and read <i>Horace's Compromise </i>as a way to get a sense for what Coalition involvement might mean for them as a school. <p>	Concurrent with this faculty study committee, a second committee composed of representatives from the local university, the Eastown teachers' union, and two teachers from the Earvin faculty, met with Earvin's principal and the city superintendent of schools to address systemwide issues related to this proposed reform -- such as how to preserve the "building seniority" of Earvin teachers, how faculty would be selected for the SWAS, how credits from the Essential school would be awarded, whether SWAS teachers would work outside their certified disciplines, and what the official status would be of the new "head teacher" position proposed for the SWAS. In a city with a powerful teachers' union, the support of the union president was integral to alleviating faculty concerns regarding these issues because it would assure them that the SWAS "would be good for kids but that it would be good for teachers as well" (Corcoran n.d.:12). <p>	Eventually, the two committees reported their plans to the Earvin faculty. The study committee recommended that the school join the Coalition, and the university-Eastown school system collaborative committee proposed a SWAS program as the school's entry point into this reform effort. When a vote was held, two-thirds of the faculty voted in favor of creating a SWAS program and accepting the necessary modifications to union guidelines that would allow this to occur (for instance, creating a joint administrative/teaching position, head teacher, and providing an extra planning period each day for SWAS teachers). <p>	Noting that this approach to school change was unique for Eastown, especially given the faculty's role in the process, the principal commented: "It wasn't thrust upon the school. It was born from within, with bottom-up change. It was democratically voted on by the faculty" (O'Neill 1989:B-1). <p>	With this support, a team of four subject teachers (English, math, social studies, and biology), plus a head teacher who would administer the program and teach one class, were recruited through an application process open to all Earvin teachers. To jointly plan their program for the coming fall, these persons -- all of whom were experienced Earvin faculty, the least experienced of them having been at Earvin for ten years -- were relieved from any teaching responsibilities for the half year prior to the SWAS's creation. <p>	During this time the team engaged in a variety of activities to prepare for implementing the SWAS the following fall. Some were rather procedural: they wrote curricula, interviewed student applicants, and designed a structure for their program. Other activities involved professional self-reflection. The teachers read various works related to American schooling -- for example, <i>Horace's Compromise </i>by Ted Sizer, <i>The Paideia Proposal </i>by Mortimer Adler, and <i>A Place Called School </i>by John Goodlad. These works then provided some philosophical stimuli to help the team design Earvin's Coalition program. Reflecting on this experience, one SWAS teacher remarked, "It was nice to operate in the domain of the 'ideal' for a while." <p>	To assist the team and in consultation with the Coalition, the university created the position of Clinical Professor. These persons -- with specialties in social studies, English, and biology -- began working with the SWAS team after their planning was completed. In the role of clinical professor, these persons participated in team planning sessions, consulted with teachers on curricular issues, advised student-teachers, and generally did whatever they could to promote school change at Earvin. As part of this collaborative effort, the Essential school also agreed to accept university student-teachers each semester, thereby bolstering the Essential school staffing as well as providing student-teaching sites for these prospective teachers.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="impl3"><h3>Implementation </h3>The SWAS program this team created was structured as follows: A team of four teachers shared the same 104 students.42 Classes met for double periods (approximately an hour and forty minutes) every other day. Each teacher taught two double periods each day (equivalent to four "normal" periods a day) and had eight free periods a week. Twice a week, the entire team, including clinical professors and student teachers, met for common "planning periods" when they discussed topics ranging from student performance and teaching strategies to program policies. <p>	Since the SWAS planned to enroll both freshmen and sophomores during its initial year (1986-87), students were recruited for the SWAS from Earvin's ninth grade and from the middle schools. The SWAS's head teacher was the person responsible for most recruiting. This entailed making presentations to various school and community groups, putting ads in neighborhood newspapers, and contacting the parents of some prospective students by telephone. Some Earvin teachers contributed to this effort by suggesting to certain students (usually their better ones) that they might want to enroll in the Essential school. <p>	In order to enroll, students were required to have a "solid" attendance record, to submit recommendations from two teachers, to write a personal statement as to why they wanted to be in the Essential school, and to have attained at least a sixth-grade reading level. After the first year, recruitment focused on attracting incoming middle school students although the program did enroll transfer students and ESL students who had "graduated" from that program. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="pe"><h3>Program Expansion</h3>In each year of its first four years, the Earvin SWAS program expanded by adding new freshman students, a few upper-class transfers, and additional teachers. Initially, it was planned to add 104 students and four teachers each year. Yet, yearly enrollments proved to be slightly below what had been anticipated. For instance, in the second year of their expansion (1987-88), the Essential school added four veteran Earvin teachers and nearly a hundred students. The following two years, fewer experienced Earvin teachers applied to the program and student enrollments were below the anticipated 104 students per year. <p>	By September of 1990, the program encompassed all four grades and enrolled about 290 students -- approximately one-third of the Earvin student population -- with a staff of about a dozen teachers, roughly three-quarters being Earvin veterans and one-quarter being personnel new to Earvin. Currently, the SWAS has no plans for further expansion. <p>	Unlike the teachers who joined the program during its first year, those who joined the Essential school in succeeding years have not had the half-year released planning time provided the original team members. They have had opportunities to attend Coalition-sponsored workshops and about half the SWAS faculty have attended these activities. They also have had extra paid work days, at both the beginning and end of the school year, when their teams dealt with various program-related concerns. Furthermore, as the program has expanded, the SWAS now holds occasional "omni-" meetings, when all the teams meet to discuss issues relevant to the program as a whole. Thess, too, function as a socialization process for new faculty since they expose those new to the program to the perspectives of veteran SWAS faculty.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="succ"><h3>Success </h3>As signs of success for Earvin's SWAS, the program can point to a number of developments. Compared to non-SWAS students at Earvin and citywide figures, Earvin's SWAS performance seems rather impressive. For one, the attendance rate averaged 87 percent (for the period from 1986-88), while the larger school's average attendance was 78 percent during the 1988-89 school year.43 The SWAS dropout rate during 1987-88 was 9 percent while the city's official dropout rate for that same year was nearly 45 percent.44 Ninety percent of the Essential school's first graduating class (1989) went on to college, whereas normally about 55 percent of Earvin's graduates attend two- or four-year colleges. Furthermore, students from that first graduating class made up 60 percent (nine of fifteen) of the National Honor Society members that year, although they represented only one-quarter of the graduating class. <p>	Another sign of success experienced by Earvin's SWAS concerned some changed perceptions of Earvin's reputation within the school system. In his end-of-the-year report for the SWAS's first year, the head teacher observed that he had sensed a shift in the attitude of middle school guidance counselors toward Earvin High, and the SWAS in particular. This seemed to be an important concern because one reason for establishing the SWAS-university collaborative at Earvin was to attract more "local" students -- that is, academically talented, middle-to-upper-middle-class whites -- instead of having so many attend private schools. As he wrote:<p><blockquote>I'm happy to say that this year, thanks to the Earvin Essential program [the selection of students for Earvin] is beginning to change. Thanks to the fact that we are now one of "ten ways"45 that Eastown youngsters can go to high school, we have an excellent group of ninth- and tenth-graders. In addition, I have been well received by the many middle counselors, both public and parochial. Now that we are in operation, they can see that we mean what we say. What's most important for them is that our students have given us good marks. In fact, in one school last year I encountered extreme reluctance on the part of the counselor to send any of his students to us. This year he followed up by checking with the graduates he did send us. They are having a good experience, are learning more, and are working much harder. The counselor is now taking us much moreseriously as well (Head Teacher 1987:1).</blockquote>	As a consequence of joining the Coalition program, SWAS teachers also noted a variety of positive developments related to their work, many of which seemed to result from their program's structure. For example, many SWAS teachers felt that their common planning time allowed them to establish clear and consistent standards for their students, something that their previous experiences working in isolation did not promote. The planning periods also offered teachers an opportunity to meet with their colleagues, something most found professionally stimulating as well as serving as a respite from the onslaught of student demands. Moreover, these planning periods provided teachers with a more in-depth understanding of their students -- both academically and socially -- since these meetings served in part as a forum for discussing student performance in <i>all </i>their classes. <p>	During the first year of the SWAS program, an educational researcher visited Earvin's SWAS as part of a larger study of school districts viewed as among those at the forefront in educational change. His impressions of Earvin's restructuring effort were rather encouraging and rather positive. Commenting on the SWAS program, he predicted that it "could have a profound effect on the structure and quality of American public education and on the nature of the teaching profession." He went on to say, <p><blockquote>The experiment at Earvin may not prove to be the general model for renewal of urban schools that everyone keeps looking for. It may not even succeed in turning Earvin High School around. Yet it is an admirable effort by dedicated people who deserve to be taken seriously. (Corcoran n.d.:)</blockquote>	In the course of its five-year existence, Earvin's SWAS has been visited often by educational researchers and various other persons interested in school change, such as teachers and administrators considering similar reforms. Often, these persons have found the Earvin SWAS to offer a promising alternative to traditional high school education. 	The following letters show how two visitors viewed Earvin's SWAS. The first, written in the fall of the SWAS's second year (November 1987), is from an educator: <p><blockquote>You were so gracious to insert a piece of time for me into that impressive patchwork of learning you are creating every day in the Earvin Essential High School program. When I say "you" I mean everybody involved, but particularly the people I observed -- the youngsters, the folks from [the university] and from the Eastown School Department, your principal, and those amazing [SWAS] teachers. </blockquote><blockquote>What I saw in the planning meetings and classrooms reminded me of that phrase "grace under pressure"; I had an image of the teachers' job being like the task of orchestrating a giant quilting bee with hundreds of people coming and going as they engage in doing some part of some project, with leadership and membership constantly shifting, circles changing, both craft and artistry manifested and encouraged continuously. </blockquote><blockquote>I hope to come back sometime after Thanksgiving to wander around a bit more, and add a few more squares to my own quilt of learning, with your permission.</blockquote>The second is from the executive director of an educational consulting organization in a nearby city:<p><blockquote>Thanks so much for letting me visit. . . . It was a great experience, and one that gave me many ideas. I was especially impressed by the way the teachers were working together, by their approach to solving problems, and by their clear concern for the kids. You're all doing a good job. I hope we can get something similar going in [my city].</blockquote>	Some other positive developments associated with the SWAS program derived from the foundation support secured for Earvin through their SWAS. In conjunction with creating their SWAS, the university helped Earvin secure a philanthropic grant of $215,000. Besides helping to off-set the expenses of having a head teacher, clinical professors, and a SWAS secretary, these funds were used to create a new teachers' workroom, to refurbish classrooms, to paint and repair the school library, and to get new lockers for the school.46<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ioo"><h3>Involvement of Others</h3>As part of its structure, the Earvin SWAS included an Advisory Committee and a Parents' Group. The Advisory Committee was composed of a SWAS teacher, a SWAS student, the head teacher, a union representative, two parents, and a person from the community. This group was charged with advising the SWAS on such matters as program policies, student recruitment, and expansion within Earvin. The Essential School Parents' Group met monthly with the head teacher and occasionally with SWAS faculty and teachers. This body served as an informational forum for interested parents. Most often, the Parents' Group focused on SWAS-specific topics, but they also brought in outside speakers to address topics of potential interest to parents with high school-age students, including adolescent development, the Coalition of Essential Schools, and the college application process.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="pebt"><h3>Problems Encountered by the Program</h3>Since its implementation, Earvin's SWAS has encountered various problems. These difficulties have taken multiple forms, including the program's relations with the larger school faculty, the SWAS's efforts to recruit students and faculty, policy innovations implemented by the SWAS, and university relations with the Earvin faculty, both SWAS and noninvolved teachers. <p><h4>Preferential Treatment</h4>	In the initial year of the program, there was criticism of aspects of the SWAS from noninvolved faculty who felt that the SWAS faculty received preferential treatment. They maintained that the Essential school had extra planning periods and taught the school's better students (since those enrolling in the SWAS were required to have a sixth-grade reading level, a "solid" attendance record, and two teacher references). Some noninvolved faculty were also upset because they expected that the SWAS would develop curricula or course materials to share with them -- since the Coalition teachers had access to university personnel and had five extra nonteaching periods each week. <p>	Noninvolved faculty also argued that the SWAS received a disproportionate share of the schools' resources. As one noninvolved teacher commented to a reporter who inquired about Earvin's SWAS: "They have their rooms painted, and they get more resources than we do. The Essential school gets all the trappings, they get preferential treatment. It is discriminatory, although I voted to set it up here" (Cohen 1988:B1). More succinctly, a department head once remarked to a university visitor, "How about throwing some of your funds our way, [toward the larger school]?" <p><h4>Faculty Divisiveness</h4>	The tensions engendered by these perceptions of favored treatment were heightened by a SWAS report in its first year that maintained that such intrafaculty skepticism emanated from a "bunch of naysayers." Those who perceived themselves to be the target of this reference, many of whom belonged to the same department, quickly picked up on this slight and hung a sign on the door of their department office that read: "Naysayers Inc. All Others Stay Out. No Yes-Men Here." Since that incident no one from this department has applied to the SWAS program and their involvement in related school-change efforts has been minimal.<p>	The structural effects of some SWAS changes also generated problems with noninvolved faculty. During the program's first year, Essential school teachers were released from study hall duty three times a week so that they had free time for SWAS-related planning and preparation, although prior to this change the teachers now in SWAS had been responsible for the study halls. The students were added to classes taught by larger school faculty. Besides generating some resentment from these larger school teachers and adding to their workloads, this incident further reinforced existing perceptions of preferential treatment among noninvolved faculty. <p>	In the "Year Three Report" on Earvin's SWAS, the Head Teacher reflected on the tensions that had arisen over the SWAS's first three years and addressed charges of preferential treatment. In doing so, he revealed some of the perceptions that had fostered this divisiveness within the building: <p><blockquote>When persons come to visit Earvin Essential, eventually the question pops up: Is there any envy between our program and that of the regular school? The answer is a qualified "Yes." To some extent there's envy because the feeling of the regular school's faculty is that our students are markedly "better" than their students. There is also the feeling that the Earvin Essential teachers "have everything," so they have a better job teaching. </blockquote><blockquote>Yet, the fact is that when we have one of our teachers absent without a substitute, many regular Earvin High School teachers dislike covering our classes because our students ask too many questions, make too many requests, and are, in some ways, too noisy. And, despite the fact that we do have additional funding and additional planning time, there has been a paucity of applicants for the Earvin Essential teaching positions. . . . </blockquote><blockquote>The plain truth continues to be that many faculty members know that we work very hard. Since we have 84% attendance, the students we have in the program make our working daily class size much larger than most classes in the larger school where attendance is oftentimes less than 75%. And, because we insist on students redoing work which does not measure up to our standards, we increase the load of paperwork tremendously. We believe, however, that we are making a difference. The students are progressing and that is our special payoff. And, if they do ask too many questions, make too many demands, and are sometimes noisy, it's refreshing to see that they are no longer in a catatonic state and have begun to expect more from their experience within school (Head Teacher 1989:6).</blockquote>	Regardless of their perceptual accuracy, these assertions by the head teacher coupled with the perceptions of favored treatment for SWAS teachers by noninvolved faculty created a basis for significant faculty divisiveness at Earvin. <p><h4>Intrateam Difficulties</h4>	Not only were there difficulties with the noninvolved faculty, but within the SWAS teams problems arose as well. In the long-term planning outline for the SWAS, the Head Teacher wrote:<p><blockquote>It is easy to say that faculties should work in teams. Not all faculty members wish to do so. This applies to some of those here and it certainly applies to the many others yet to come as the veterans retire. If the school moves in this direction, the old agreements should be changed so that those members not wishing to work in teams will be reassigned elsewhere and any new people coming in should be interviewed and selected by the principal and the teams they will be working with. The usual process of the Personnel Office determining teacher placement should be changed (Head Teacher 1987:11).</blockquote>	Intrateam tensions took many different forms. As briefly alluded to previously, on one occasion certain SWAS members felt that it was imperative to file a union grievance to secure three additional free periods for themselves, rather than overseeing tutorial-like study halls for students from their teams.47 Other team members disagreed strongly. They felt that these tutorials/study halls provided students with much needed individual attention and that they offered a means to reduce some of the Incompletes that had been building throughout the year (a topic discussed in greater depth later). Fallout from this difference endured for some time, especially between those persons viewed as the primary supporters of the differing positions. <p>	Another basis for intra-SWAS divisiveness emerged when some faculty members sought to initiate an AP program. On the one hand, some SWAS faculty considered the AP course to be fully congruent with the Coalition's notion of schools having an "intellectual focus."48 On the other hand, some SWAS teachers viewed the AP course as a sign of tracking, which they considered inappropriate, since the Coalition maintains that a "school's goals should apply to all students" (CES 1990:2). The SWAS faculty eventually decided not to offer the course but, again, not without some emotional meetings and controversy. <p>	In general, although many SWAS teachers have found planning periods to be professionally stimulating and rejuvenating and feel that they help them to do their job more effectively, they also hold the potential to expose differences that teaching in isolation would never bring to the surface. Exposing these differences can then provide the basis for divisiveness that may affect relationships within the program long after the meetings end.<p><h4>University Involvement</h4>	The university has had a history of involvement with Earvin, and faculty feelings about these interactions have been mixed. Some have appreciated the opportunities generated by the university's association. Others have viewed the university as opportunistic, involving themselves with Earvin only when it suited their interests and doing so in such a way as always to have the upper hand in these dealings. For instance, Earvin had been a site for student-teaching; they had been an object of various university researchers; they were now part of a university experiment. It was clear to Earvin faculty how this involvement benefited the university, but many teachers questioned its value for them and their school. <p>	As one faculty member angrily commented to his chair in a department meeting, "We're just a lab [for the university.] That's all." Expressing a similar sense of resentment, one teacher recalled his feelings of frustration and exploitation with an article written for a national education journala few years earlier by the clinical professors' coordinator after she had visited his class as part of a study of Eastown's social studies departments:<p><blockquote>There's not a positive thing in it. . . . At the end of the class, she took the ditto with her, said how wonderful the class was, and I never saw her again until I read the article. They came unannounced. It was five minutes before class when the principal said, "You have a visitor." And some guy from Harvard was with her. . . . And I don't think they intended to see anything positive. When I read this [article], I start to boil a little bit, even now. . . . To be perfectly honest . . . I think they were looking to downgrade the system. . . . And believe me, there were lots of things wrong, but I don't think they had the solutions.</blockquote>	Those skeptical of the university tended to view this latest effort as but one more instance of the university imposing its interests on the high school.49 <p>	In part, this skepticism and ill will seemed tied to the fact that the university has had most of the resources to share in their dealings with Earvin, not vice versa. In establishing programs at Earvin, therefore, there was potential for Earvin faculty to be both winners and losers. Some teachers were chosen for the Essential school faculty, others were not. When the university sponsored a drug-prevention program, only three faculty applicants were accepted, although more had applied. When a computer-based curriculum development project was offered to the faculty, only two persons could be funded. <p>	One instance where allegations of university power-brokering generated ill will toward the university as well as within the SWAS faculty occurred when the head teacher position became available in the SWAS's fourth year (1989-90). In the opinion of some SWAS faculty and some noninvolved teachers, the university imposed its wishes on Earvin in making this decision. As one applicant for this position wrote to the super-intendent:<p><blockquote>I hereby withdraw my application for the position of Head Teacher of the Earvin Essential School. The reason I am doing this is because I feel that the criteria used for selection were not congruent with the job specifications given to the applicants. I have come to believe that one individual used the prestige and the financial clout that the university enjoys to impose their[?] choice on the SWAS program. It seems that little or no consideration was given to the mandate of the Earvin High School faculty.</blockquote><blockquote>The most frustrating aspect of this process is the fact that while [the university] brags that this is a "bottom-up" plan, "the power that is" has circumvented the "bottom," the real workers. The fact that this most basic tenet has been ignored renders the Essential School program no longer credible. Furthermore, I and perhaps others, no longer feel a sense of "ownership" of Earvin Essential High School. Please note that Earvin High School claims ownership of the Essential School program. Along with my request you might consider a name change.</blockquote><blockquote>I have always directed my efforts toward the best interests of my students and our program. My resentment comes from a feeling that I have been manipulated and, to an extent, made to play out the farce. I am truly sorry that I find myself writing this letter. I will continue to do the best job that I can do for my students.</blockquote>	Although the university relationship presented multiple opportunities for Earvin faculty to experiment with aspects of their teaching, to involve themselves with social programs, to participate in the SWAS program, and to earn extra money, these opportunities also caused some faculty to feel slighted and insulted as a consequence of the choices made by the university. Often, these perceived insults had a negative influence on future interactions these persons had with the university. <p><h4>The Clinical Professors</h4>	The presence of the clinical professors50 also generated some tensions at Earvin. Although the Coalition stresses "grassroots" reform and local autonomy, the clinical professors were still trying to change accepted practice. Regardless of how blameless they may have considered the Coalition's critique of traditional practice to have been, for many teachers, to suggest change, even respectfully, is to imply criticism. Consequently, some teachers resented the clinical professors' efforts for this implicit criticism of the status quo. One veteran teacher, for example, acknowledged support for aspects of the SWAS program but expressed reservations regarding professional change:<p><blockquote>I would not be too willing to have anyone from the university start telling me how to teach. Although I know that is technically not what happens. . . . But you know, the strong suggestions and the "do it our way or else" kind of thing. I like a little bit more freedom in teaching.</blockquote>	A second source of tension (faced primarily by the clinical professors) emerged from a general skepticism toward innovation held by many experienced Earvin faculty. They had seen reforms come and go. Few had had any lasting effect. Only the faculty had endured. Moreover, some teachers simply opposed aspects of the Coalition's philosophy (or what they thought were aspects of Coalition philosophy). One faculty member alluded to both these themes in an interview:<p><blockquote>When anything [called] "new or . . . innovative" comes along, it's usually perceived as something to be wary of. . . . From my own experience . . . I've seen that [many] lack substance. . . . [Just] change for the sake of change. . . . The question in my mind is: If it ain't broke, why fix it?. . . . [A]nd I'm not sure if the method . . . is right. Who's to say that the innovative program is the right one? </blockquote>	Another source of tension for the clinical professors arose from the ambiguity of Coalition philosophy coupled with the nature of their work. That is, although schools must approve, devise, and implement their own Coalition program, the clinical professors had been hired explicitly to assist this process. They then had to strike a difficult balance between directing change and letting the faculty make their own decisions. Juxtaposing two statements by the same clinical professor that outlined this person's conception of the clinical professor's role at Earvin suggests some of the tension engendered by the nature of this position. In the first, the position is described as that of being <p><blockquote>helpful "insiders" rather than outside consultants coming in and telling people what to do and pretending to know better. . . . Eventually, [the faculty] has the final say. That's how it has to be. . . . Otherwise, the whole thing's a farce.</blockquote>	This view certainly fits with the Coalition's stress on local autonomy. Yet, the role was not as clear-cut as this statement might imply. Respecting the faculty's autonomy was but one aspect of their work. They were also there to help the faculty change. They were not merely supportive but were active agents in the change process. <p>	In discussing problems encountered during planning period meetings, the same clinical professor described the tension associated with this aspect of the position: <p><blockquote>I'd prefer to deal with tough issues first . . . often key issues get obfuscated. . . . If I'm not confrontational, I have to swallow it and accept their policy and the issue never gets dealt with. . . . [S]o how do I accept being manipulated [now] for value in the long-run?. . . . I pay a price whether I put it off or deal with it. My relationship with Joan is a perfect example of this bind. I want to say, "You've got to be kidding me!" You haven't been successful in getting work done. You know the standards are slipping and still only 50 percent of the students are passing. How can you say there's no more work to do? . . . And she'd portray this as the college professor forcing her to go with my ideas.</blockquote>	Outright resistance to the university's efforts arose when one clinical professor volunteered to teach a class. This person willingly accepted the additional responsibility with no salary compensation and, at first, everything in the classroom seemed to go well. Larger-school faculty "grieved" this action, however, on the grounds that having nonunion personnel take this position discriminated against union members qualified to teach the course. Clearly, this grievance was in accord with the union contract. Nonetheless, if the university had had a better relationship with Earvin, the faculty might have accepted this apparently effective interim solution. Instead, the situation was resolved by having a teacher interested in teaching that course join the SWAS program on a part-time basis for that year. <p><h4>Student and Faculty Recruitment</h4>	Throughout its existence, Earvin's SWAS program has had difficulty recruiting both faculty and students. Recall that the program was initially planned to include sixteen teachers and over 400 students but, to date, has not expanded beyond 290 students and a dozen teachers. The Head Teacher's earlier comments about improved relations with the city's guidance counselors notwithstanding, summarizing the problems he encountered in recruiting students for an as-yet-unproven program, the Head Teacher wrote in a long-term planning outline prepared during the spring of the SWAS's first year:<p><blockquote>The simple fact is that without the gimmick of the magnet or the "proven" academic tradition of the [College Preparatory High School], this academic program needs a lot of careful talk and explanation for students and parents to buy into it. (Head Teacher 1987:7)</blockquote>	In his report for the third year of the SWAS (1988-89), the head teacher discussed problems encountered in recruiting teachers :<p><blockquote>For many eligible members of school faculties, getting them to shift at this point in their lives requires giving up what they see as good positions. At this point in time, those who will consider the Earvin SWAS are teachers who are unhappy with their current placement. (Head Teacher 1989:9)</blockquote>	Providing another perspective on the difficulty of teaching in the SWAS and its effect on recruiting teachers, the head teacher wrote in the same report:<p><blockquote>Those who apply to Earvin Essential need to be hardy, idealistic people ready to take on the challenge and the risk of working within the SWAS program. This also carries with it the additional pressure of teaching within a fishbowl. This year, we have had over 150 visitors spanning the globe from Denmark to Los Angeles. We have also become a showpiece for Re:Learning, [our state's] effort at restructuring schools. We are the living example of what is happening here, so we have welcomed teachers and administrators from throughout the state. For teachers who are accustomed to working anonymously in their classrooms, the thought of attaining celebrity status can become an unwelcome intrusion to a private world. (Head Teacher 1989:6)</blockquote><h4>Faculty Burnout</h4>	The previous excerpt serves as an appropriate introduction to another problem the SWAS faced, teacher burnout. Although the SWAS faculty taught one less class than their noninvolved colleagues and some had student-teachers to help them, many sensed that they were working much harder than they had in previous years. As the head teacher observed in his Year One Report:<p><blockquote>Of the major problems, probably the biggest and most generic to life for all in general and us specifically, is when to get all their work done. The teachers have had to compound their efforts because the Incomplete necessitates a large amount of regrouping, rechecking, reteaching, and chasing the many students who need to complete their makeup work. </blockquote><blockquote>The head teacher position would seem to be a piece of cake. With only one class to teach, a secretary to work in the office, and only a small group of students and teachers to manage for this the first year, this should be a snap. However, the day seems to go on with lots done and more that needs to be done (like this report which is now three days overdue). With visitors coming in at an increasing pace, new teachers to orient and still more students to recruit, the job takes itself into the evening with still the never-ending feeling that only a little was accomplished throughout the day. The position is very much needed, but if so much work comes with only 104 students and four teachers, what will happen in the very near future when the group is doubled? (Head Teacher 1987:7) </blockquote>	The SWAS teachers certainly concurred with this view. Even with the additional time provided by their contract, many felt tremendous demands on their time. Commenting on these pressures, one SWAS teacher remarked:<p><blockquote>There's much more this year. I never get my free periods. There's lots of work, more than I've ever done before. It's hard to get used to, coupled with all the other work you have to deal with. . . . Correcting and class preparation . . . take two hours each day outside of school -- beyond my . . . planning periods. . . . I've had three meetings with parents this week during my free periods. . . . In two years [in the larger school], I saw no parents.</blockquote>	Besides increased time demands, the SWAS teachers faced tensions in their relationships with colleagues, generated in part by a perception of implicit criticism of the status quo by SWAS faculty. If some teachers were changing, didn't this imply that others should do the same? Were Coalition teachers somehow "better" teachers? Coupled with accusations of preferential treatment, rifts and resentment emerged within the faculty. Even in the faculty lunchroom, one could usually draw a line between tables that divided SWAS faculty from their larger-school colleagues. Touching on multiple aspects of these tensions, the head teacher wrote in the Year One Report:<p><blockquote>When teachers work hard they have little time left to socialize. No doubt that's why Horaces make compromises. Life seeks comfort. For us in the SWAS and for the head teacher who has "only" one class to teach, there is no time for socializing amongst the faculty or even amongst ourselves. So there is little casual conversation. We are a pretty serious, goal-oriented group with lots of papers to correct, so "coffee-time" discussion with faculty outside, or even inside, the program is hard to come by. </blockquote><blockquote>At present the SWAS is small and does not represent a huge threat to the larger school. But, the expected movement of English faculty to the second floor, the labeling of budget money (proportionate to the number of students in the SWAS), and the renovations to the [SWAS classrooms] will no doubt raise the envy of some faculty members in the larger school. But there is no rush for faculty members to join the program. (Head Teacher 1987:4)</blockquote>	For Earvin's SWAS, two factors appear to have worked in tandem to contribute to some teachers' professional exhaustion and frustration. First, there was the increased workload that accompanied being part of a new program. Second, there were the professional rifts and animosities that arose among the various parties and that made for some tense relations between the SWAS and their larger-school colleagues. <p><h4>Grading System</h4>	As part of their SWAS "structure," the initial Essential school team instituted a grading innovation, the Incomplete. In practice, this innovation has proven difficult to actualize and the various SWAS teams have had to confront the consequences of adopting this strategy and have had to continually revise this policy throughout the program's existence. <p>	Believing that students were often passed on to succeeding grades by well-meaning teachers who awarded low Cs and Ds to students who were present for most classes and caused no major disruptions, the SWAS's initial team sought to create an educational environment that would encourage greater student engagement with their school work and promote student mastery of their subject materials. <p>	To support this goal, the team decided that the Essential school would award only three grades -- A, B, and Incomplete (I). Students failing to earn a grade of at least 80 on their work received an Incomplete, and it was returned for them to re-do. If Incompletes remained at the end of the quarter or if students simply failed to do an assignment, they received an Incomplete for that term, which would remain on their records until all work was satisfactorily completed. <p>	During the school year, this grading system proved problematic. Many students never made up their Incompletes. Rather than redoing their work and earning a higher grade as the faculty expected, many students simply ignored their incomplete work. <p>	Besides the frustration engendered by this apparent student apathy, the myriad dittos and record-keeping procedures required to coordinate incomplete makeups drained faculty energy and time. In a report that summarized the developments within Earvin's SWAS at the third year mark, the head teacher discussed the "Incomplete problem":<p><blockquote>We have continued to backtrack and it has continued to be an enormous problem. Accurately keeping up with the students who have Incomplete grades is very difficult. We now have seniors who still need to complete coursework from two years ago. The fact that students now need to earn their Incomplete has made a big difference.51 There is still a question for a number of faculty members whether the Incomplete itself erodes student ability to assume responsibility for what needs to be done now. (Head Teacher 1989:9)</blockquote>	Indeed, since the SWAS continues to grapple with the "Incomplete problem," it has become something of a mixed blessing. One the one hand, it has helped some faculty to maintain high standards for their students.52 On the other hand, attending to the multiple problems associated with this grading shift has taken time from SWAS planning period meetings; it has meant that teachers have had to make numerous logistical arrangements with their students and in their record-keeping procedures; and it has required that the SWAS adjust its schedule each semester to accommodate students who have completed or who are yet to complete their incomplete work. For a reform effort already strained to fulfill its multiple responsibilities, the Incomplete, although provoking change in some contexts, also required time and generated tensions within the SWAS as the various teams have sought to resolve this difficult issue.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wtpe"><h3>Will the Program Expand?</h3>Assessing the likelihood of Earvin's SWAS expanding to include more or even all of the school relates, in part, to the problems the program has encountered. For instance, although the union-negotiated SWAS charter stipulates that Earvin faculty members have the first choice of whether to teach in the SWAS program, the program has had difficulty recruiting faculty from within the school throughout its existence. Presently, the program is staffed mainly by "original" Earvin faculty, but aside from the program's first year, only once did two people from within the school apply for the same position. Moreover, a number of those most recently recruited to teach in the program have come from outside Earvin, either as teachers from other schools or long-term substitutes given full-time positions, suggesting that any further expansion may well require recruiting faculty from outside Earvin. <p>	In terms of recruiting students, Earvin's unflattering image in Eastown is a second factor that seems to have restricted the SWAS's expansion. As the head teacher noted in his Year One Report:<p><blockquote>The image of Earvin High School as a place for the hopeless students of Eastown was another major obstacle. Despite the fact that this was a new program working under the aegis of the university, we did not get the hundreds of students flocking to our door. I knew the image of the school was poor, but had no idea until I got out there and began talking to people about coming here.</blockquote>	Although the SWAS has had teams in all four grades since 1989 and anticipated having 400-plus students in their program, enrollment has never exceeded 300 students. <p>	Structural factors at Earvin High have also restricted SWAS expansion -- specifically, the existence of the arts and communication magnet, the English-as-a-second-language (ESL) program, and the special education program which, combined, account for nearly half of Earvin's students. The arts magnet, for example, has often seen itself in competition with the SWAS for students and financial resources, especially since both programs require block scheduling of students (thereby making it difficult for students to participate in both programs if they need to take such electives as foreign languages to get into college). <p>	Although faculty and administration have considered combining the two programs -- since students can (and do) enroll in both programs and the programs share certain philosophical and practical commonalities (e.g., both programs focus on active student learning and a "demonstration of mastery" as the basis to assessment, both seek to personalize their students' learning experience, and both involve teams of teachers working with the same block of students) -- the programs remain separate. ESL students have joined the SWAS, but they must first attain appropriate language proficiency. Again, the ESL program also shares much with the Coalition's SWAS: the faculty are teamed and have students in common; learning is personalized; and assessment is tied to a demonstration of competence. <p>	Special education is a self-contained program that never seriously viewed itself or was viewed as a program that might be compatible with the SWAS. Nonetheless, the special education faculty are teamed and share common students. Structurally, these programs are kept distinct, as each has its own budget, chairperson or director, and they are located in different parts of the building. With little or no opportunity to discuss their philosophical commonalities and possibly resolve their differences, it seems unlikely that these programs will find common ground. <p>	The remaining 250 students are enrolled in the school's comprehensive program. There has been discussion of structuring this program like the SWAS (or at least creating a ninth-grade house for these students, when they are most at risk), but logistical difficulties, a lack of time to plan such a structure, and limited faculty interest have prevented any momentum in this direction from overcoming institutional inertia. Moreover, for the SWAS to expand and join with any of these other Earvin programs, it would likely require renegotiating their union agreement, a development that might cause problems for the SWAS and might even jeopardize their present, relatively secure status.<p>	A final factor that has inhibited the expansion of the Essential school SWAS model concerns funding. Quite simply, the SWAS structure at Earvin is expensive. To fund its program, Earvin has required support from philanthropic foundations, the Eastown School Department, the State Department of Education, and Chapter II funds. Since SWAS faculty teach one less class per teacher than noninvolved faculty (i.e., four rather than five), in terms of the number of classes being taught the SWAS teachers are roughly 20 percent more expensive for the school system than are teachers with the full five-class load. If the entire school were to become "essential," it is uncertain whether the School Department could fund an additional nonteaching period each day for the entire faculty. <p>	Furthermore, although a portion of the salaries for the clinical professors, the SWAS secretary, and the head teacher are assumed through various foundation grants and by the university, if the school system were to adopt the SWAS model as it exists for the Essential school, the salaries for these persons would represent another significant cost increase. <p>	In his first end-of-the-year report, the head teacher speculated on the possibility of expanding the SWAS structure to encompass the entire school. Although optimistic about the SWAS and the team structure, the head teacher was uncertain whether the school system would or could find the finances sufficient to allow this to happen:<p><blockquote>If teamwork is a process that works and the School Department recognizes it as a desired reality for its schools, other faculty members outside the SWAS could form their own teams in a self-selection process. Just as we do now, teachers would have their own power within the group and accept full responsibility for their students. But again, communication is of primary importance. This could work if three key factors are met:</blockquote><ol>	<li>	Teachers have at least two additional planning periods a week for each team.<p>	<li>	The school's administration communicates regularly with each team either through a head teacher or some alternative procedure which engages administrators as educational leaders.<p>	<li>	The clinical professors lend their assistance to each new team's curricular needs.</ol><p><blockquote>For a school system which needs bond issue money to fix its roofs and has not increased the dollar amount of its book budget for the schools in the past ten years, these measures represent large financial hurdles toward changing the climate and operation of school, for Earvin and all the rest in our school system. </blockquote>	Elaborating on the hurdles that would confront schoolwide expansion of the SWAS structure the head teacher expressed some ambivalence toward his own recommendations in his report:<p><blockquote>Having gone through this full year with the program it is now quite obvious that the teachers need relief in some way, either through gaining the extra three periods of planning time or by reducing their student/ teacher ratio. . . . The fact is . . . that giving each teacher the additional three periods of planning time will make the program that much more expensive for the School Department and therefore jeopardize its own existence. Obviously this is more than a serious problem. Its resolution is central to the program's continued operation beyond the Schottenheim Foundation's generosity. (Head Teacher 1989:11)</blockquote>	Oddly enough, then, the head teacher saw a need for funding to support the structure that they had created; however, he also realized that Eastown might not have the funding that would allow the program to expand. <p>	In sum, four factors appear likely to restrict the growth of Earvin's SWAS program: the difficulty of finding faculty interested in teaching in the program, the problems encountered in recruiting students to Earvin, the interests of existing programs at Earvin, and the uncertainty of securing adequate funding to support such a structure.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wtcb3"><h3>Will the Coalition Becomethe Prevailing Ethos? </h3>From our perspective, it appears unlikely that Coalition philosophy will become the prevailing educational ethos at Earvin. For one thing, many noninvolved faculty have come to equate the SWAS with the Coalition of Essential Schools. Consequently, the we/they divisions between the SWAS and the larger-school faculty that have emerged as the program was implemented and has expanded have caused many non-SWAS faculty to view anything related to the Coalition of Essential Schools -- its philosophy or the activities undertaken in its name at Earvin -- with considerable skepticism and some animosity. One hurdle to be overcome, then, in having the entire faculty embrace Coalition philosophy would be for them to distinguish Coalition philosophy from the effects of the Coalition SWAS and from their relationships with SWAS faculty.<p>	Opposition to the Coalition and its philosophy is also tied to the principal. Although the principal considers himself very supportive of his school's Coalition efforts, his involvement may detract from efforts to engender broader acceptance among the faculty. Specifically, some faculty who have evolved long-standing feuds with the principal in his eight-year tenure vow to oppose the SWAS -- if for no other reason than its potential to make the principal "look good" in the public eye and in the opinion of the city school department. The principal is aware of these attitudes and maintains that he has taken a hands-off stance toward the SWAS as much because he wants the program to be self-directed as because he does not want the program to be overly associated with him. <p>	Evidence of the difficulty of spreading Coalition philosophy to encompass more of the school emerged during one university-initiated effort to promote school commitment to educational change -- the 1992 Committee. This effort was not explicitly designed to promote Coalition philosophy; rather, the initial 1992 Committee meeting sought to have the faculty collaboratively address two questions: "What will Earvin High School look like in five years?" and "What should be the relationship between the Essential school and the arts magnet?"53 This meeting sparked faculty interest, and voluntary, ongoing faculty discussions of these issues began during the first year of the Essential school's SWAS program (1986-87). <p>	During the 1989-90 school year, the 1992 Committee received a powerful boost when Re:Learning, the Coalition's joint initiative with the Education Commission of the States, was undertaken. As a potential Re:Learning school, Earvin received $20,000 to help the school investigate the feasibility of Re:Learning membership. The financial support from the Re:Learning initiative allowed the 1992 Committee to solicit proposals from the faculty and fund those they considered appropriate. These included visits to schools that had attempted programs viewed as relevant to Earvin's concerns, plans for interdisciplinary curricula, conferences for various types of professional training, and so on. To keep people informed of these efforts, the 1992 Committee published a faculty newsletter. <p>	During the 1989-90 school year, Re:Learning funding ran out. That school year, interest in the 1992 Committee also declined. By the 1990-91 school year, there was little activity at Earvin undertaken in the name of the 1992 Committee. In part, 1992 Committee members attributed this lack of activity to the fact that Earvin expected to be involved in an accreditation study during 1990-91, but that that study was postponed. Thus, they had no time set aside for the 1992 Committee, since they had planned to combine that effort with the accreditation work. <p>	However, it would seem likely that a lack of funding and the voluntary nature of 1992 Committee involvement also contributed to this lack of participation. Thus, to spread Coalition ideas more broadly among faculty members, there would seem to be a need for both time and funding -- two resources that have proven difficult to come by in Eastown. <p>	While we maintain that the prospects for spreading Coalition philosophy at Earvin to include the entire school are, from our perspective unlikely, recent developments suggest that there may be some potential for these ideas to spread. For one thing, in 1990 the city of Eastown offered an early retirement package to city teachers. Many Eastown veterans took advantage of this opportunity. Consequently, relative to recent years, there has been substantial turnover in the Earvin faculty. Although not every veteran teacher was opposed to the SWAS program, these persons tended to be the more skeptical members of the faculty. They had seen reforms come and go before and they were some of the persons most resistant to the University's presence. Moreover, this early retirement plan afforded the principal an opportunity to hire persons who were philosophically compatible with Coalition philosophy and/or who believed that school change was necessary. <p>	A second development that may help to promote Coalition philosophy at Earvin involves a recent faculty referendum. In this vote, the faculty approved restructuring their daily schedule to add an additional period that would be used as a daily planning period for faculty collaboration, planning, and reform work in general. This vote becomes even more significant given that a similar effort attempted three years earlier had failed. The school as a whole should now have time built into its daily schedule that can support their restructuring efforts.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cs4"><hr><center><h2>Case Study IV:<br>Lewis High School </h2></center><hr>Lewis High School, located in a large mid-Atlantic city, is a comprehensive urban high school that presently enrolls an entirely African-American student population of about 1,100. As a report by the Osgood Foundation54 observed, comprehensive high schools in this city serve <p><blockquote>students who are in an area of the city after many of the higher achieving children have left it for citywide schools [i.e., magnet programs]. . . . Of all the high schools, the lowest attendance, worst scores, and the highest dropout rates are found in the comprehensive high schools. (Osgood 1988:1)</blockquote>	Although Lewis is officially a comprehensive, zoned high school, it does offer two programs that are not available citywide and for which non-zoned students may attend Lewis -- a Naval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (NJROTC) and a Communication Arts program that includes fine arts, dance, music, photography, and journalism. <p>	When the Coalition program began at Lewis High School, nearly 2,000 students were enrolled. However, because of structural problems with their building, the school has had to relocate to another site while repair work is being undertaken at their original site. For the past three academic years (1988-89, 1989-90, and 1990-91), Lewis has shared a building with another city high school. This move necessitated that the school decrease its enrollment by approximately 900 students and modify its schedule so that the normal day now runs from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. (Some effects of this move are discussed later in this report.)<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cotp4"><h3>Creation of the Program</h3>Lewis High School's membership in the Coalition of Essential Schools was promoted by a city superintendent who had become familiar with Sizer's work and was looking for a school where the city could pilot a Coalition program. As she wrote in a letter to Ted Sizer: <p><blockquote>We feel that the time has come for serious structural reform of the design of the American high school and realize that a sustained long-term effort is needed. We would like to begin that effort by moving one of our 17 high schools in the direction outlined in your <i>Prospectus</i>.</blockquote>	The superintendent then informed her high school principals that the city would be piloting a Coalition program and that she was looking for an interested principal and the appropriate school setting. After consideration of a number of city schools, Lewis High School was chosen. The principal, David Johnson, then recruited faculty willing to participate.<p>	Although as the Osgood report observed, comprehensive high schools are in many respects the less privileged and less desirable schools in the city, the administration and many faculty and students at Lewis are proud of their school. Being chosen as the city's pilot Coalition school was seen by many at Lewis as an opportunity to display to the city what the school was capable of achieving. The principal and many faculty members, then, undertook this reform effort with considerable fervor. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="impl4"><h3>Implementation</h3>Lewis's first effort to create an Essential school program involved an Experimental Cluster of four teachers (English, social studies, science, and foreign language), who shared a group of 150 ninth-grade students (the normal teaching load for city teachers) and had common planning time for one school year (1985-86). During this year the team experimented with new teaching and assessment strategies and spent their common time discussing the effectiveness of these innovations. <p>	The following summer (1986), with the full support of the building principal, the team was given the opportunity to design an Essential school program for the coming school year. That summer teachers from the Experimental Cluster as well as other faculty spent six weeks preparing for the coming school year. They attended Coalition workshops and a ational conference focused on critical thinking. They held their own workshops at Lewis and had Coalition staff members visit and facilitate various sessions. And they offered the twenty-seven students from the Experimental Cluster who had not finished their work from the previous school year the opportunity to attend a two-week "lab" school as an alternative to summer school. <p>	The SWAS faculty used this as an opportunity to develop curricula and to design the structure of their Essential school for the coming school year. The original students from the Experimental Cluster were not kept because the SWAS's limited funding allowed them to support only one SWAS team for that school year, and the team wanted to test the effectiveness of their restructuring model with a totally new group of ninth-grade students. <p>	When the current SWAS began its first year (1986-87), the new team included math, English, social studies, foreign language, and science faculty. One major difference from the previous year with the Experimental Cluster was that the SWAS added a coordinator, an administrator whose main responsibilities entailed overseeing the operation of the SWAS program. <p>	These teachers and their coordinator created a flexible block schedule that allowed them to vary their class length according to the needs of their curricula. Their classes could run anywhere from forty-five to ninety minutes. This flexibility allowed them to create time for field trips, guest speakers, and special Essential school assemblies. The SWAS team also used this time to tutor students in preparation for the State Functional Tests (discussed in more depth later). <p>	Typically, SWAS faculty taught four "normal" class periods (i.e., forty-five minutes) each day and used what had been a fifth teaching period for collaborative as well as individual planning. This team also offered before- and after-school tutorials that allowed the SWAS faculty a variety of options:  for example, they could focus on the State Functional Tests, or they could provide students with individual tutorial assistance. In general, they could adapt this time to whatever they viewed as their most pressing needs. <p>	In its first year, the program identified a cohort of 116 students and enrolled them in the SWAS program. This cohort was selected by the assistant principal in charge of scheduling, who made two concessions for the SWAS program: first, the five homerooms assigned to the SWAS were smaller than the average Lewis homeroom; and second, she made an attempt to avoid assigning to the SWAS students who were "attendance problems."<p>	During this first year, most teachers on the team were enthusiastic about the changes they experienced. They felt students were more engaged in their school work and were performing better. Many faculty expressed a sense of increased professional vigor tied to these changes. As one Lewis veteran who joined the SWAS commented: <p><blockquote>Teaching became what it was meant to be. I really began <i>teaching. </i>In the past, I just gave kids information; I never let them use their minds. And, now that we are flexible with our time, if I need students for more time [to cover certain topics], I can get them.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="pe4"><h3>Program Expansion</h3>The following year (1987-88), the SWAS program expanded to include a new group of freshmen students. They also kept the ninth-graders from the previous year. In recruiting faculty for this expansion, the Essential school sought teachers they viewed as skilled and committed to their profession. This recruiting was aided by the overt support and involvement of the principal, an outspoken advocate of their SWAS program as well as Coalition philosophy in general. Paraphrasing the principal's description of those teachers recruited for the SWAS, one faculty member commented, "Some who volunteered, and some we volunteered." In the next two years the program continued to expand, adding both students and faculty. <p>	However, although the SWAS program has had broad-based support for its expansion -- from SWAS teachers, administrators, and the superintendent's office -- one factor, completely unforeseen, has restricted this expansion: Lewis was closed for repairs that have, thus far, taken more than three years. Consequently, the entire school has been forced to share a building with another city high school and to attend classes on a staggered schedule, from roughly 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. During this period, the SWAS program has not expanded as much as had been planned. Presently, the Lewis SWAS program enrolls roughly 425 students, slightly less than half the school's total current enrollment. Lewis High School will return to its original site during the 1991-92 school year.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="succ4"><h3>Success</h3>One sign of "success" regularly cited by the SWAS is their students' performance on the state's functional competency exams. These exams are given in four subject areas -- reading, writing, mathematics, and citizenship -- and students <i>must </i>pass them before graduating. For three school years (1986-87, 1987-88, and 1988-89) and for all four areas, SWAS students did better than their larger school counterparts and did better than the systemwide performance in all but one exam, where they equaled the systemwide score.55 <p>	Although these figures are impressive, an independent study conducted by Dr. James McPartland, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Education Research Center, suggested a need for caution in viewing these figures. <p><blockquote>The evidence shows that <i>going in </i>the students begin with sizable advantages over other Lewis students; they are younger, thus more likely to have been promoted on time at each earlier grade in their respective histories; and second, the students turn out to have had much better attendance rates historically than their non-Coalition counterparts at Lewis have had. An objective observer might argue then that the Coalition students are in fact the most likely students to succeed anyway -- in whatever enrichment environment they are in or not in. </blockquote>	While expressing these reservations, McPartland added that, after controlling for the differ-ences in student characteristics, <p><blockquote>the thrust of the evidence is that participation in the SWAS program at Lewis increases a student's school attendance and promotion rates, which are important behaviors linked to school academic achievement and graduation. </blockquote>	Drawing on "less tangible criteria," the Osgood report went on to say:<p><blockquote>[I]t is clear that if student interest in, and enthusiasm for, the program is proof of how well the program works, it appears to work well. The dropout rate is zero. The whereabouts of all students who have left the program is known; they are in other school districts. Observers talking to the students, in small groups and one-on-one, find they have a special sense of enthusiasm about the program, and about their place within it. They appear to be not only more interested in the schoolwork they are currently doing, but in going to school in general. Their aspirations in life are high. Of seven SWAS students asked to indicate what they would do on graduation, all seven say they intend to go on to college. (Osgood 1988:4)</blockquote>	In terms of attendance, dropout rates, and college acceptances, the SWAS has had an impressive record as well. During the 1988-89 school year the SWAS program had an attendance rate of 92 percent, whereas the larger school had an attendance rate of 74 percent and the citywide rate was slightly more than 80 percent. The SWAS has also done better than either the city or the larger school in terms of its dropout rate. For the SWAS, the dropout rate during 1988-89 was less than 2 percent,56 for non-SWAS students it was 23 percent, and for the city it was over 11 percent. <p>	The Essential school has had a disproportionate number of its students join the National Honor Society.57 SWAS students have also done very well in citywide academic competitions. In the same vein, the SWAS has been relatively successful in terms of college acceptances -- having over half of its graduates go on to higher education in 1988-89 (its first graduating class) while 42 percent of Lewis' non-SWAS students planned to attend college, and the city overall averaged about 11 percent. <p>	The Lewis SWAS has used these data in various ways. For one, since many parents find these statistics reassuring, the program has used this information to help convince parents to enroll their children in the SWAS. Many students are also impressed by this success and join the SWAS without any parental urging. Since Lewis's SWAS program has been funded, in part, by private foundations, these data have proven useful in their reports to philanthropic foundations. The Coalition has also used these figures as signs of success by one of its "second-step" schools.58 Finally, Lewis High has used these figures to help persuade the city superintendent of the program's effectiveness and of the need for continued funding.<p>	Although these various measures suggest that Lewis's SWAS program has experienced substantial success, within the larger Lewis faculty, there is skepticism regarding the validity of these findings. Quite simply, some noninvolved faculty maintain that the SWAS program works very hard to "appear successful." On a number of occasions, noninvolved faculty have suggested that an ethnographer should make an unannounced visit to Lewis -- the clear implication being that, if given no notice, the SWAS would look very different from when the faculty are given advance notice. As one veteran faculty member explained:<p><blockquote>Even when we were at [our original site], it would be announced that "Mr. or Dr. Someone is coming in at such and such a time," and they would go around and ask . . . certain teachers, "Would you like to perform for Mr. So-and-So.?" And I've had some friends say, "No, I don't want to be bothered." And they'll go to another teacher [and say], "I want you to perform. I want you to show this or that." And I've seen them even move what they thought were the worst children out of the room and put them in somebody else's room while they are performing. </blockquote>	Moreover, many non-SWAS teachers feel that the "successes" cited by SWAS faculty are the consequence of having better students, not improved pedagogy or curricula. For instance, one faculty member who visited SWAS classes looking for ways to improve his teaching found that although their pedagogy had been "touted as revolutionary," he did not feel there was "anything very different going on." Commenting on the SWAS's summer professional development efforts, another noninvolved faculty member remarked, <p><blockquote>I came to the workshop -- took a week out of my summer vacation -- because I knew I was going to come and hear something so different, so profound, and . . . I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know or that we weren't already doing. </blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="pta"><h3>Problems that Arose</h3>Although Lewis's SWAS has expanded every year but one, the program has experienced some resistance and opposition from noninvolved faculty. One common criticism directed toward the SWAS is that those involved, both students and faculty, receive preferential treatment. With regard to SWAS students, noninvolved faculty maintain that they are provided privileges and opportunities unavailable to other Lewis students -- such as being able to take overnight field trips (although many non-SWAS faculty thought that such trips were banned), having more opportunities to study a foreign language (since the SWAS has most of the foreign language teachers on SWAS teams), and being allowed to make up incomplete work over holidays and the summer (rather than failing or having to attend summer school). <p>	Discussing the use of additional funding the SWAS had received, one noninvolved teacher said:<p><blockquote>[The SWAS] has been given a lot of money -- grants -- and they can do just about anything they want to do. I think it's unfair to leave out your other students. I think they should be able to do some of the things that the [SWAS] does.</blockquote>	In talking with noninvolved faculty, it seemed that they were upset not only because of specific actions that they viewed as favoring SWAS students, but by the attitudes promoted by such privileged treatment as well. As one non-SWAS teacher recalled:<p><blockquote>There was a rule that no one was supposed to be selling candy in the school and I happened to see a young man who is in the SWAS in the office selling candy and I said, "I thought you were not to be selling candy." He said, "Oh, I'm in the SWAS." I'm a rule person. If you set a rule, I think all people should abide by it. </blockquote>	Addressing the same concern, another noninvolved teacher remarked:<p><blockquote>A student feels as though when he's in the [SWAS] program downstairs he's permitted to do what he wants, as long as it meets the teachers' expectations. [Then] he comes to our classes. We are told specifically, "A students is not to wear shorts. There's to be no eating in the classes." And the [SWAS] student has no qualms whatsoever of coming to our class, taking from his bookbag a soda or a sandwich, and thinks that he should be permitted to eat it. . . . It's difficult sometimes for them to understand why there's such a difference of being able to do it there and not being able to do it here.</blockquote>	Touching on this same concern -- preferential treatment of SWAS students -- another non-SWAS faculty member revealed something of the tensions among the faculty that this perception had created: <p><blockquote>The students -- not all of them -- have an attitude, an air, as if they are the top students. They kind of look down on other students. . . . And these students resent the authority of what we are called -- "traditional school teachers." I don't feel that these students have learned this on their own. I think they've been prompted. You know, we see things and we do things. In other words, we see people as we grow up doing things and we learn to do the same thing. We take on the same attitude as the adults and I believe the students have taken on attitudes. . . . [The SWAS students] seem to have an attitude that they're different from the rest of the students. </blockquote>	Besides resenting their SWAS colleagues somewhat because of the perceived attitude of their students, some noninvolved faculty feel that the Coalition teachers receive preferential treatment as well. As with other SWAS programs, these teachers cite the SWAS teachers' reduced student load and additional planning time as clear signs of this preferred treatment. They also point to the number of professional development activities SWAS faculty are able to afford because of their grants and what they contend to be the disproportionate dispersal of funds for school supplies directed toward the SWAS. <p>	Intrafaculty tensions have also emerged from concerns with job security. Some elective teachers, for example, have noted that, since the advent of the SWAS program, their departments' sizes have decreased markedly. They connect this development to the SWAS's curriculum which -- because of its increased requirements in math, social studies, foreign language, and science -- restricts the number of electives many Lewis students can take. No faculty members have taken formal action because of this departmental reduction, but non-SWAS teachers have filed union grievances over other practices that they perceived to be discriminatory. Specifically, they felt that they had seniority over SWAS faculty who had been kept at Lewis to teach within the SWAS while they were assigned elsewhere. Although union policy mandates that the person with the longer departmental tenure has the right to select the preferred teaching site, the superintendent's office (with some lobbying from the David Johnson who was temporarily transferred to this office), recently assigned Lewis' SWAS "special program" status. Thus, rather than assessing tenure in terms of years in a department, tenure was assessed in terms of the SWAS program, thereby according the Coalition SWAS the same status as traditional departments. <p>	A final school-site tension which has emerged at Lewis concerns intrafaculty communication. From the perspective of some noninvolved faculty, there has been little effort to discuss developments within the SWAS and/or future plans for the program with the faculty as a whole. There was no faculty vote taken to approve the initiation of the program, and these persons maintain that there has been no effort to create a forum for the faculty to discuss any issues related to the SWAS that arise. <p>	The initial remarks by one veteran faculty member in an interview suggested something of this perceived lack of dialogue: <p><blockquote>My first comment [for you] is that I appreciate the fact of being able to talk with you simply because you're the first individual who has ever come to me to ask [for my opinion about] about the school or the SWAS program. </blockquote>	Another Lewis teacher made the same point: "[The administration] needs to do what you're doing. They need to ask teachers [about the SWAS]. They leave the teachers out." <p>	Besides discussing a lack of communication or faculty-wide discussion regarding the appropriate structure and philosophy of the SWAS program, non-SWAS faculty also felt that the SWAS did not communicate effectively about simple logistical developments within their program. As one teacher who felt slighted in this regard commented:<p><blockquote>I feel that whatever goes on [in the SWAS program] should be a part of the total school. We should all be involved in it. [For instance,] if they're going to take a trip, that we should all know about this trip. For example, the [SWAS] junior class trip that went to Florida. We didn't know anything about that until a day or two prior to the time that they were leaving. There was nothing made public about it. </blockquote>	Another teacher remarked, "When they take field trips, we may not find out until the day of the trip, but we are expected to accommodate these students."<p>	Although non-SWAS faculty elaborated extensively on these tensions in interviews, there is little public acknowledgment of their existence. As these teachers explained, declining student enrollments citywide combined with Lewis's drastic reductions due to their move have created tremendous job insecurity among the faculty. In such a situation, few teachers want to be perceived as dissidents and risk being assigned to another school or possibly needing recertification in order to keep their job. In the words of one non-SWAS faculty member: "The Essential school is the 'fair-haired child' in this building and no one's going to question the principal on it."<p>	Beyond the school site, the most pressing problem facing Lewis's Coalition effort appears to be financial. During the program's first year, for example, a visiting teacher was told by the principal that start-up costs, rather than being 10 percent, as they had anticipated, were closer to 30 percent. <p>	In the fall of the SWAS's second year (1987), a local newspaper article expressed similar concerns. The article observed that David Johnson had secured a $50,000 foundation grant and a $15,000 state grant that allowed Lewis to support the SWAS during its first year and that the foundation had provided Lewis's SWAS with the same funding the second year as well. The article went on to note that: <p><blockquote>In the city, where secondary schools average at least 30 to 35 students per class, [reducing the class load to 20 students] would mean the addition of hundreds of teachers in a system with limited resources. [The] chief financial officer for the city school system said it would cost approximately $12 million to reduce the average class size in grades 9 through 12 to 20 students per class." (1987:G4)</blockquote>	The Osgood report's assessment that same year discussed financial issues as well: <p><blockquote>The question about class size raises an important point: to reduce all high school class sizes to 20 [the approximate size of most Lewis SWAS classes] would be prohibitively expensive within existing resources." (Osgood 1988:4)</blockquote>	Given that Lewis's SWAS program has found that, in practice, they have not been able to bring their student/teacher ratio below 100-to-1, rather than the 80 to 1 suggested in the Coalition's <i>Prospectus</i>, these concerns seem appropriate. Moreover, with a change of superintendent, the degree of financial support the school department is willing to commit to Lewis remains uncertain. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="pfea"><h3>Prospects for Expansion at Lewis</h3>Of all the SWAS programs discussed in this paper, Lewis High School appears to hold the most potential for successful program expansion. David Johnson, the principal who initiated the program at Lewis, intends to make his entire school a Coalition school when they return to their original building in September of 1991. To assist this effort, he hopes that the City School Department will designate Lewis High a "research and development" school that serves as a pilot for the rest of the system. Of course, to receive such a designation, the program will need some "good results" for the new superintendent. <p>	Contrasted with the other schools we have discussed, a number of factors appear to have contributed to Lewis's successful expansion and the potential for continued growth. For one, there were no vested interests in place to restrict the SWAS's expansion. At other schools there were magnet programs, AP and honors courses, and sizable numbers of faculty members committed to the existing curricula. Although Lewis offers Communication Arts and NJROTC programs, there has been no serious conflict among the programs. The NJROTC program has actually coexisted amicably with the SWAS program, possibly because it requires no more than one period a day and many Essential school students have enrolled in NJROTC. <p>	Lewis's expansion has also been aided by the unqualified support the program has received from the original principal, David Johnson. Throughout the program's existence, Johnson has been a vocal proponent of this effort, within the city as well as nationally.59 As principal, he has provided the program with forceful administrative support -- recruiting teachers, securing foundation grants, assigning disinterested teachers elsewhere, and reallocating staff positions. Although the superintendent who initiated Coalition involvement at Lewis has left that post and, in the summer of 1989, David Johnson was appointed to a position in the superintendent's office, Johnson has remained in close contact with the program. <p>	The principal who replaced Johnson shared a similar enthusiasm for the program, although some program members were uncertain whether his commitment to the program or understanding of Coalition philosophy were the same as his predecessor. Due to restructuring in the superintendent's office, Johnson returned to be principal at Lewis in the fall of 1990. <p>	A recent reassignment of over thirty teachers at Lewis due to decreased enrollment -- a consequence of having moved to a new building combined with citywide demographic shifts -- may also help the expansion of Lewis's SWAS. When this reassignment occurred, the Essential school held "interest meetings" to determine which faculty were interested in joining the SWAS. This allowed Johnson to keep many of those who wished to stay and teach in the SWAS and to transfer some who were unwilling or uninterested in joining the SWAS program. <p>	At Lewis it seems that the program will continue to expand and continue to receive administrative support at the building level for this expansion. In fact, the most recent freshman class has about 200 students in the SWAS program but has another 140 students in a similar program with teamed teachers and student cohorts, all in preparation for the program's planned expansion to include the entire school next year (1991-92). As the principal observed, "We've seen that the program can work with 250 students; now we need to do it with an entire school." <p>	The main uncertainty that faces Lewis's SWAS seems to be the degree of commitment and funding the program will have from their central administration. With decreasing enrollments citywide and a new superintendent, there are no guarantees about the program's continued existence. Lewis's SWAS must still compete with other programs for funds from a shrinking budget. Furthermore, to date, the program has been dependent on city funding as well as foundation support in order to reduce class size, to provide professional development opportunities for its faculty, and to offer special field trips to its students. If this support were to be withdrawn, it is uncertain how the program would be affected.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="wcpb4"><h3>Will CES Philosophy Becomethe Prevailing Ethos?</h3>To say that the prospects for Lewis's program expansion are promising is different from saying that Coalition philosophy will become the school's prevailing ethos. Coalition philosophy has implications not only for a school's structure but also for the participants' behavior and belief. Indeed, one can restructure the school day with a new schedule and organize the faculty into teams, but these structural changes cannot ensure that teachers will change their classroom practices or attitude toward student learning. At Lewis, there are signs that such a common philosophical understanding is being promoted; there is also evidence that the faculty is divided on certain issues. The question of Lewis's prevailing educational ethos, then, seems less certain than issues related to program expansion.<p>	One development that may aid this change in educational philosophy at Lewis is the existence of the summer workshops Lewis's SWAS has initiated (the only one of these four study schools to have done so). These workshops, often held in conjunction with another Coalition school in the city, have been funded by a combination of grants from private foundations and Chapter II funds. This work is intended to help faculty members deepen their understanding of Coalition philosophy, develop aspects of their program, and introduce new faculty to Coalition philosophy.60 <p>	As we have noticed with many Essential school programs, however, for more recent recruits this introduction to Coalition philosophy tends to be shorter and less in-depth than that provided the original SWAS team (which included an entire year as the Experimental Cluster and six weeks during the summer prior to creating the SWAS). Not surprisingly, it is these original SWAS members who have been some of the strongest proponents of Coalition philosophy and the SWAS at Lewis. Therefore, this period of socialization and whether SWAS members volunteered or were volunteered to participate seem to have some implications for faculty members' ensuing attitude toward Coalition philosophy.<p>	Yet there are signs of informal opposition and resistance to the program that may prevent such a "philosophical" expansion from occurring. For instance, informally non-SWAS faculty express numerous concerns with the SWAS program. At a professional development session sponsored by the SWAS faculty, a number of faculty voiced explicit concerns with aspects of Coalition philosophy as presented by the Lewis SWAS faculty -- questioning whether Socratic questioning represented an appropriate strategy for all teachers, for instance. Also, some noninvolved faculty argue that Coalition philosophy is not appropriate for their students. They view the SWAS's curriculum as college-oriented and question whether it is appropriate for all Lewis students. In the words of one non-SWAS teacher:<p><blockquote>My concern is that every child in Lewis High School is not going to college. We know this. And yet the program is set up strictly academic with little or no room for electives. And Zone 16, where our students come from, most of these students go to work. They're looking for immediate employment. We would like to see them do something other than fast food, which is fine to a point but, once they graduate, it hurts to see them slinging hamburgers when they could be operating a computer. But they must be proficient in those areas. They must have marketable skills.</blockquote>	Finally, although the SWAS program expanded continually and intends to encompass the entire school next fall, as with other SWAS programs, a sense of divisiveness within the Lewis faculty remains. In talking with a SWAS faculty member about accusations of preferential treatment for the SWAS program, this faculty member's response revealed this sense of division:<p><blockquote>They want to know why our kids were the only kids who participated. [They said,] "It should have been a Lewis project. All kids should have been given this opportunity." And I say, "No." One thing: whatever I'm responsible for, I give it all I've got. I'm not responsible for the remainder of the school, so I'm not looking for programs for those kids. And I'm not saying the kids shouldn't have them. But I'm not looking for things for them. That's those teachers who are responsible for them. That's their responsibility.</blockquote>	Intrafaculty tensions were also evident in the professional development session mentioned earlier. At one point, a noninvolved teacher questioned a SWAS faculty about Socratic instruction. When the SWAS teacher seemed a bit defensive, the other teacher remarked, "I'm asking questions to try and find out. I'm not arguing." The SWAS teacher replied, "Well, I just think these things are fun to try. Any other questions?" <p>	Although their interaction ended there, the sense of tension and defensiveness suggests that not everyone on the faculty is prepared to adopt the Common Principles without question. While program expansion may guarantee that there is no longer a SWAS structure, it does not guarantee that the divisions generated by this structure will disappear nor does it guarantee that Coalition philosophy will become the school's prevailing ethos.<p>	These observations are not intended as a basis for contending that Coalition philosophy will <i>never </i>become the prevailing educational ethos at Lewis; rather, they are offered as acknowledgment that adapting Coalition philosophy to most school settings will require changes in both behavior and belief on the part of teachers. People may need to reconceive curriculum, pedagogy, assessment, and structure. Given the autonomy provided teachers once they "close the classroom door," it is unlikely that anyone can <i>force </i>any of these changes on anyone else. <p>	Therefore, it seems that there are concerns on the part of both the involved and the noninvolved faculty that would need to be addressed if one expected to initiate successful change on the scale espoused by the Coalition of Essential Schools and soon to be attempted by Lewis High School.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="aaot"><hr><center><h2>An Analysis of the Case Studies</h2></center><hr>Despite differences among the schools in terms of their size, location, primary clienteles, and other key features, we have seen from the case studies that they shared many difficulties, constraints, and outcomes as they planned, implemented, and elaborated their SWAS programs. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cp"><h3>Comparative Perspective</h3>Five points (analytically separable but actually all inextricably intertwined) emerged in each case study and are worthy of further elaboration. Briefly, these points concern: allegations of favored treatment; isolation of SWAS faculty from larger school faculty; the perceived need to appear successful; the problematic nature of expansion due to a lack of consensus from the outset about the need for reform; and the problematic nature of expansion due to scheduling and space constraints within the school. In this section we assess the similarities and differences of the SWAS programs with regard to these points, in the process further demonstrating their interrelatedness and its consequences for the SWAS programs.<p><h4>Perceptions of Favored Treatment</h4>	Faculty who participated in SWAS programs and other aspects of the schools' efforts to implement CES ideas were, in each case, quickly seen by their colleagues as receiving preferential treatment and in three of the four cases were labeled as the "principal's pets" or as his or her "favorites." Whether or not the SWAS teachers felt they received special privileges or were treated more favorably by the principal, several changes occurred as a result of this perception within the school. <p>	A new we/they distinction emerged within the faculty. In most cases this new distinction did not erase existing divisions; it was in addition to them. Because in many cases the majority of the participants in SWAS programs were those with less power within the existing teaching "hierarchy" (in terms of years of experience, gender, and departmental tenure, for instance), this labeling of people as the principal's favorites suggested to many that new power structures within the faculty were being created -- in part evidenced by unequal access to resources and other benefits of CES involvement, such as travel to conferences -- and that some faculty were being excluded. <p>	Some noninvolved teachers viewed the SWAS teachers as having disproportionately more opportunities to exert power in terms of curricular and scheduling decisions, use of school (and grant) funds, and in representing the school to outsiders. In at least two cases, faculty new to the school were being asked to consider and recommend changes in domains that other teachers felt might have implications for <i>their </i>jobs. Noninvolved faculty resented the favoritism they alleged existed, most particularly when decisions concerning the school-within-a-school affected them, as occurred when release-time given to SWAS to plan and class-size requirements of SWAS pilots were believed to increase other teachers' class loads. <p>	Between 1986 and 1990 (the years of our research), equity issues continued to arise that further reinforced the new we/they distinction, and a cycle began that perpetuated itself as the program continued. This cyclical reaction caused the factions to become more and more distanced from each other.<p>	Two other aspects of this concern with favored treatment exacerbated the developing tensions. In all cases the perception of favored treatment was linked to some teachers' opinions about the principal. The SWAS programs became linked with the principal who had initiated them and support of them was tied to support for the principal more generally. <p>	At three schools, the teachers who got involved with the SWAS programs were confident that the principal would assist them in the change process. At the fourth school, the principal and the SWAS team agreed that the principal's hands-off stance toward program development signaled his faith in them and was more empowering than his active involvement in the design might have been. Also, many involved with the SWAS program felt that his active involvement might have further politicized the program. In all four cases, for the principal's opponents, attacking the favorites could be viewed as an attack on the principal as well. In effect, then, it served a dual purpose. <p>	In addition, the sense of favored treatment (especially when articulated as extra release-time, a smaller student load, etc.) led the opposing factions to argue that the SWAS faculties had it easier at the same time that the SWAS faculty and principal believed those in the SWAS were working much harder than they ever had and that they worked much harder than other teachers needed to in order to fulfill their responsibilities. The opposing interpretations each side offered for each new reaction continued to reinforce the growing separations within the school between SWAS program teachers and many of their larger-school colleagues. <p><h4>Increasing Isolation</h4>	The second observation shared by all four schools was that from the time the SWAS program began and throughout its expansion, the SWAS faculty became increasingly more isolated from their larger-school colleagues. This isolation created and fostered mistrust on the part of larger-school faculty toward the efforts of the SWAS program, particularly toward the allocation of teachers' time, the so-called special activities of the SWAS, and the pedagogical approaches that teachers were allegedly attempting within the experimental program. If these teachers had one fewer preparation, fewer extra assignments, and/or fewer students, what could they be doing with all their free time? argued the noninvolved faculty. And what did <i>student-as-worker</i>,61 <i>personaliza-tion</i>,62 and <i>less is more </i>mean? If teachers were no longer lecturing and students were expected to be more active participants in their own education, wouldn't that create chaos in those classrooms? <p>	The skepticism of noninvolved teachers, their general lack of knowledge about developments within the SWAS, and their dislike of the perceived "easier" schedule made the isolation of the SWAS teachers more "damaging," in a sense, than it might have been. In interviews, most participating SWAS teachers said the isolation was initially the result of needing to meet with other SWAS teachers during every spare minute to plan and evaluate program developments. Over time, as hostilities between the SWAS and noninvolved teachers grew, it simply became less stressful for many SWAS teachers to avoid their larger-school colleagues and spend their free time with like-minded SWAS teachers. <p>	One teacher at Silas Ridge explained the kinds of occurrences that increased the strains between SWAS and noninvolved teachers in the following way:<p><blockquote>There were many wonderful things that happened with our teams, but no one wanted to hear about them. I mean that literally. In the most casual and supportive ways, if someone with the Coalition said, "Gee, I did this neat program," people would absolutely get up out of the room and leave. They would just not listen. In fact, at one particular meeting the freshman team had . . . produced a number of historical newspapers, a wonderful project. We wanted to share that with some other classes and some teachers outside the Coalition, and I got very specific, very angry letters . . . from faculty saying that they were tired of the Coalition. They didn't want to hear anymore about the Coalition. . . . Why weren't we asking other people to show the good things that they had done? It was just awful.</blockquote>	At each site, SWAS faculty seldom explained their work to their noninvolved colleagues, both because they did not see them and because it was perceived to be a waste of time. And the noninvolved made few efforts to visit SWAS classrooms, unless by special invitation to present material to the classes, both because they were busy with their own work and not particularly interested in or affected by the SWAS and because they did not want to be labeled "sympathizers" by other noninvolved faculty.63 Clearly the difficulties engendered by a lack of communication and by mistrust and miscommunication made the overall work environment of the school more tense as the SWAS continued and expanded. <p><h4>Appearance of Success</h4>	A third feature that may have worsened these problems was the perceived need by the SWAS faculty and supportive administrators to highlight any positive developments associated with the SWAS program; that is, to make their "successes" public. Every time a new statistic showing the effectiveness of the SWAS program or an article describing another activity of the program or an honor a SWAS teacher had won was published, it seemed to heighten tensions between the SWAS faculty and the larger school faculty. <p>	It was especially difficult to show the success of the SWAS when the contrast group was the larger school, for the reaction by the noninvolved faculty then was usually, "Well, if you have the best and most motivated students, of course they will out-perform those who cannot read well and don't want to be here anyway." And awards and recognition to the SWAS were often greeted in the larger school with comments such as: "I have been a successful teacher -- highest test scores in the county by my students -- for twenty years. So why is this new approach getting all the attention?" <p>	Meanwhile, within the SWAS, the data on success were seen as validating the hours of extra work and the tensions that the teachers had been subjected to in order to get the SWAS programs off the ground and, at least initially, as potentially important data that might persuade colleagues to join them. Many felt that these data would also make it easier to recruit students into the program. The expectation was that evidence of success would help to guarantee expansion of the program to include more of the larger school. The reality appears to have been that evidence of success was dismissed almost as effectively as the ideas of the Coalition had been dismissed earlier. Whether the SWAS's evidence of success was promotional propaganda or data truly indicative of success, then, seemed to be more related to one's stance toward the program than to an objective reading of the evidence.<p><h4>Lack of Consensus on the Need for Reform</h4>	A further effect of highlighting the SWAS's successes was to create a sense on the part of the noninvolved faculty that the SWAS and the principal were manipulating the evidence to <i>appear </i>successful when there were any number of alternative interpretations for the apparent success. When school boards or interested parent groups were presented with evidence of the program's success, others would protest that 1) no one would report a lack of success, and 2) no one had ever expressed interest in the success of existing programs and departments within the school. The SWAS faculty would respond that they had obligations to report their "progress" to their various constituencies and were simply doing that in order to guarantee continuation of the program.<p>	With these differences of interpretation and contentious items impinging on the reform effort almost from the start, it is difficult to imagine how the programs were able to expand at all. Certainly, SWAS programs ran into problem after problem as the involved faculty sought to expand them. In three of the four cases, once expansion began, SWAS teachers had to be recruited from outside the school. The principals took advantage of leaves of absence and other vacancies to hire faculty willing to join the experimental programs. Despite planning and expectations that noninvolved faculty would "come around" once the program got under way, this was seldom the case. Because there had been no widespread consensus from the start that Coalition membership was desirable and that the SWAS program represented a pilot that others might plan to embrace if it proved successful, expansion of the SWAS programs at all the schools was problematic. This was yet another indication that there were myriad difficulties involved with turning the SWAS pilot into a restructuring model for the whole school. <p><h4>Structural and Space Constraints</h4>	Another expansion issue proved equally difficult. Wherever the SWAS program "bumped up against" existing programs, it had difficulties recruiting students to participate. For example, the Evans Hill Junior Interdisciplinary could not compete with the AP American history program and so lost some of the heterogeneity that had characterized the ninth- and tenth-grade interdisciplinary programs. Also, the existence of a dictated course of studies, Global Studies, in the twelfth grade meant that, to create an English and social studies interdisciplinary program, the entire senior English curriculum would have to be rethought, an enormous barrier to change given the success of Evans Hill High School students once in college and the perceived strength of the traditional Senior English curriculum. At each school expansion became more difficult when the new program was competing with already established programs, such as magnets, ESL, and vocational education. <p>	This was but one of the structural and space constraints that the SWAS programs faced as they attempted to expand. Since many programs depended on different configurations of time (such as block periods) and shifting group sizes (e.g., lectures presented to the entire SWAS could necessitate space for eighty-or-so students, but tutorial work might require many smaller spaces for the same students on a different day of the week), the SWAS was constrained by the very schedule and school structure it was suggesting was no longer appropriate. The compromises that had to be made each year to keep the program functioning at the school often seemed to restrict the program to being but another special program the school offered rather than a pilot program that fostered new ways to think about school design and change.<p>	All of these problems were shared to a large degree by each of the four schools we discussed in the case studies, and by numerous other SWAS programs that we have visited or heard discussed as part of our study of the Coalition of Essential Schools. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="impl"><h3>Implications</h3>In this section we discuss some of the implications of these problems and issues, before we look at how the Coalition has addressed the issues and suggest some points restructuring efforts may want to consider in light of our findings.64<p>	As we have noted, the SWAS format has been a common entry point into reform for Coalition schools. Yet, in many instances, these programs have foundered, proving philosophically and politically divisive. This divisiveness has had far-reaching effects that suggest some implications for schools undertaking reform efforts. <p><h4>The Inevitability of Politics</h4>	Political in-fighting or maneuvering requires time and energy, but our research suggests that it is widespread and probably inevitable. In these case studies, three patterns used to address political divisiveness may be distinguished. First, there are those, such as the team from Evans Hill High School, who try to maintain their focus on changing pedagogy, curricula, and school structures while simultaneously working to alleviate political problems (by improving communication with noninvolved faculty, addressing concerns with democratic participation, and so on). Often, these persons ended up disillusioned from having to confront and attempt to resolve myriad political issues and exhausted from trying to maintain their focus on the reform at the same time. <p>	In other instances, such as at Silas Ridge, the focus of reform gradually shifted from concerns with pedagogy, curricula, and school structures to addressing political issues that arose. In these instances, efforts to expand or deepen the reform work were sacrificed to efforts to maintain the present state of reforms in the face of criticism from noninvolved faculty. <p>	Finally, in still other cases, like Earvin and (up to this point) Lewis, the reform-minded may downplay or neglect political concerns. However, this can allow opposition to grow so powerful that the life of the reform itself is threatened. In this last case, the reform work may continue uninterrupted for a longer period of time, but the political opposition does not go away.<p>	Whatever the initial response to political problems, if the expectation is that the SWAS program will continue to expand, including more students and faculty, eventually the contentious issues will have to be addressed or the noninvolved and contentious faculty will have to be transferred to make way for more sympathetic faculty. In the cases we have discussed, the political opposition was a threat to SWAS programs in part because the teachers in the experimental programs were not expecting it and were not prepared to deal with it. <p>	The first implication of our work, then, is that faculty who embark on restructuring efforts may need to have their political consciousness raised as part of their socialization into the reform movement, in order to avoid the political naiveté that has affected three of the four SWAS programs we have discussed here and many other reform efforts we have seen or heard about throughout Coalition member schools.<p><h4>Revelation of Philosophical Differences</h4>	A second manifestation of the divisiveness generated by SWAS programs is that those not involved in the reform effort often end up defending the status quo rather than questioning it (the latter being one expressed goal of Coalition membership). As a consequence of growing philosophical differences and political tensions, issues that may not have been major points of contention early in the change process can become topics of heated debate. <p>	Faculty at our study schools have argued, for example, that there was no vote to affirm the entire school's support for the program. Noninvolved faculty have claimed that SWAS faculty are critical of their practice. Regardless of the specific issues, when noninvolved faculty feel insulted (and perhaps threatened with job loss), they act to defend the status quo, in part perhaps, as a means to assert their own professional self-worth. The implication of this is that as noninvolved faculty move from indifference toward the reform to being actively hostile toward it (and actively supportive of the status quo), the factions become more hardened in their positions and less able to negotiate to resolve the divisiveness.<p>	The cumulative effect of the divisiveness suggested by this study of SWAS programs is that the intrafaculty tensions generated by SWAS programs create a work setting that is far more tense, and possibly less productive, than the prereform environment. Quite simply, the school may become an unpleasant place to work. <p>	As many researchers have observed, overt and covert tensions seem inherent in teacher-student and teacher-administrator relations (Wallace 1932; Lortie 1975; Woods 1980). Yet, for whatever reasons, teacher-teacher relations have tended to be, at worst, congenial (e.g., Hargreaves 1980). Still, we have seen SWAS programs generate a level of intrafaculty divisiveness that can transform a peaceful work environment into a site of emotionally charged political contentiousness. <p>	One principal at a Coalition school that was not part of this study, writing to his faculty on the eve of their vote about whether to retain their membership in the Coalition, mentioned the discord within the faculty that had characterized the school's recent past. He ended with a personal appeal to the faculty to seek consensus regarding the need to change and to allow the vote to stand for itself, i.e., to put behind them the personal and political issues that had arisen at the school. He wrote:<p><blockquote>While I personally support continued participation in the Coalition, I am also aware that at this particular moment continued participation has the potential of further dividing the faculty. Participation in the Coalition is less important to me personally and professionally, than having some faculty consensus on the need to seriously and systematically evaluate our current structure, curriculum, and teaching, regardless of the vehicle. Hopefully, we will find a common ground of compromise so that the resolution of the Coalition will not produce a residual of "winners" and "losers" but would promote our continued review of the reform issues with a minimum of emphasis on the personal and political issues and a maximum of energy devoted to the curricular and instructional issues.65</blockquote>	This is not the only case where, as the tensions, anxiety, and divisiveness heightened, some faculty sought to dissolve the school's relationship with the Coalition of Essential Schools. Another effect of the divisiveness is that it makes it difficult for faculties to undertake an objective assessment of their SWAS programs. Instead, as we have seen in all of these cases, the programs are viewed from highly charged perspectives that tend to distort or obscure the effects of these reform efforts. <p>	An additional effect of the divisiveness might seem rather straightforward: it may undermine the nature of the reform itself, since so many aspects of the reform are tied to intrafaculty cooperation -- teacher teaming, interdisciplinary instruction and curricula, and program integration into the larger school structure, for example. If faculty are not getting along, it becomes very difficult to accomplish these changes.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="summ"><h3>Summary</h3>The individual schools each recognize that political divisiveness and philosophical differences have become apparent since they joined the Coalition and created their SWAS programs. In each case, the problems generated by SWAS programs have thrown into question whether Coalition philosophy can become the school's dominant philosophical ethos. The Coalition Central Staff have recognized that SWAS may not be the most effective entry point to schoolwide restructuring. As the Coalition's Central Staff and member schools came to realize the problems generated by the SWAS structure, actions were taken, both by the Central Staff and member schools, to promote greater communication across factions and to be more politically sensitive when enacting change. <p>	The first such efforts by the Central Staff came in response to the study conducted by the Coalition's Evaluation Committee.66 In a letter sent to all Coalition schools in January of 1989, Ted Sizer laid out a series of responses to the Committee's reactions and recommendations, a number of which had implications for the SWAS strategy. Sizer noted, for instance, that the Coalition's Central Staff would "focus its direct work with schools on those Coalition schools identified as having both the desire and the ability to engage fully and, ultimately, across their entire program." He went on to express concern with some schools' partial efforts to implement the nine Common Principles:<p><blockquote>[T]he success folks have had with working on just a few of the Common Principles without a plan to accommodate them all has been troublingly limited, as the Evaluation Committee has now reminded us. Our nine Principles inexorably interconnect, and while schools wisely start by emphasizing but two or three, a day of reckoning -- reflecting the fact that any truly important change in one aspect of a school ultimately and significantly affects most others -- must be planned for and anticipated. The complexity, stress and promise of the redesign process is clearer than ever to all of us now -- as so many of you well know!</blockquote>	By the end of the letter, Sizer addressed SWAS programs specifically -- both noting that serious reform required a more encompassing effort and commenting on the divisiveness SWAS structures can generate:<p><blockquote>A further finding [of the Coalition Evaluation Committee] is the need for reasonably large scale. A small school-within-a-school may provide a good entry point in a particular situation, but the ultimately necessary reallocations of resources required can rarely be effected unless the total numbers of participants in an Essential School are large enough to allow for substantial flexibility. One might wisely divide a school into small units for educational purposes -- say, clusters totaling some 100 to 150 students -- but consequential financial transfers are possible only if each such cluster is part of a larger unit. The totality provides the flexible resources required. </blockquote><blockquote>The Committee saw other concerns arising from this matter of scale, arguing that the school-within-a-school (as an end in itself rather than as a "pilot" or "scouting party" for the entire school) could end up merely as an "alternative." They also argued that its permanently isolated presence could serve to set up a corrosive "us versus them" confrontation within a faculty. We must be clear: the Coalition aims at the heart of schooling. We are not about creating more alternatives (however attractive such might be) but, rather are attempting to improve the mainstream institution. (Sizer 1989) </blockquote>	After experiencing the problems generated by SWAS structures, member schools have also taken steps to be more inclusive in their reform efforts. All four schools discussed in this paper have consciously shifted to making "reform" a schoolwide issue, rather than focusing their attention and resources on SWAS faculty. The schools have all to varying degrees sponsored their own professional development activities so as to directly involve more persons in the nature and rationale behind changes being undertaken. Also, opportunities to attempt change have been made available more broadly than just for SWAS teams (for instance, Silas Ridge and Lewis are encouraging more of the faculty to team). In effect, now, at each school the Coalition ideas are being encouraged in whatever form seem appropriate, not only (or primarily) as separate and isolated SWAS programs.<p>	A final lesson that would seem to derive from this study is that restructuring reforms cannot afford to focus purely on philosophical or pedagogical issues, or even structural concerns. Those interested in restructuring schools will need to juggle the structural issues potential reforms raise with philosophical and pedagogical issues in ways that are respectful of the group dynamics of the work place and savvy about the political and personal tensions that change can both uncover and create. <p>	In at least three of our cases, faculty in SWAS programs assumed that they would eventually receive support from their noninvolved colleagues. To date this support has not materialized. Instead, as our cases demonstrate, SWAS faculty found that in the process of attempting to change traditional practices, they became enmeshed in political, communicative, and philosophical hassles that were disruptive and that succeeded in diverting much (if not all) time and energy away from pedagogical and curricular experimentation, the original focus of their Coalition restructuring reform efforts.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><hr><center><h2>Notes </h2></center><hr> <h4>Case Study I: Silas Ridge</h4>1. The concept <i>Exhibition </i>has been popularized by the Coalition of Essential Schools. In theory, the exhibition should serve as culminating, public activity where a student <i>exhibits </i>his or her abilities developed over the course of his or her education before faculty and community members. The exhibition should be multidisciplinary and should draw on a student's personal strengths. In practice, because of various structural constraints, schools and teachers have found it easier to adapt the concept of an exhibition to specific classes rather than making this activity a multidisciplinary, public, graduation requirement. (See Appendix A, Principle #6.)<p>2. The Essential school structure was actually adapted from a program that had existed at Silas Ridge the previous two years -- a ninth-grade house plan for at-risk students. Mandated by a previous assistant superintendent, this program involved a team of teachers who worked with a common group of at-risk freshmen. <p>3. SWAS faculty and supporters note, however, that Silas Ridge had never before voted on <i>any </i>changes that had been initiated (e.g., with their honors program). They contend that the question of faculty participation became an issue after-the-fact, not while the program was being developed.<p><h4>Case Study II: Evans Hill</h4><p>4. Evans Hill School Report: 1985-1986, submitted to the School Ethnography Project by the teacher-ethnographer.<p>5. School Ethnography Preliminary Report for Evans Hill High School (Survey), 1989.<p>6. Long-term Planning Outline, 1987, Evans Hill High School, Section 2, p.14. <p>7. Evans Hill School Report, p. 1. In addition to allowing students to take additional courses, this master schedule increased the flexibility of Evans Hill's course offerings, at least initially. It might also be noted that the remarks in this quotation and in the preceding paragraph of the text might be viewed as in opposition to a key Coalition aphorism, "Less is more." "Less is more" juxtaposes with common conceptions of schooling; that is, the Coalition believes that much traditional schooling is too focused on "coverage." The Coalition maintains that this trend inevitably leads to superficial understandings. In contrast, the Coalition advo-cates that faculties seek to define what is absolutely essential within their various disciplines -- both content knowledge and applied skills -- and then stress that material, rather than trying to cover massive amounts of factual information. (See Appendix A.)<p>8. It is important to note that the teacher-ethnographer was a member of the Sizer group and prepared these reports as part of her documentation work for the School Ethnography Project. As part of her work at Evans Hill, she was asked to interview people with differing viewpoints about the Coalition. Although her perspective may reflect a positive attitude toward the Sizer group's work, she was not unaware of the differing opinions toward this effort held by other faculty members.<p>9. Evans Hill School Report, 1986:5.<p>10. Ibid., p. 5. <p>11. In this paper "SWAS teachers" refers to the teachers who taught in the interdisciplinary programs; "Sizer group" and "Sizer committee" refer to all teachers involved in Coalition work.<p>12. Evans Hill School Report, p. 6.<p>13. Ibid., p. 7.<p>14. Ibid.<p>15. As we discuss below, Dr. Smith's tenure as principal of Evans Hill was rife with political and personal struggles among factions that often differed most fundamentally in their approval of her approach to leading the school.<p>16. Evans Hill School Report, p. 7.<p>17. Ibid.<p>18. Ibid.<p>19. Long-Term Planning Outline, p. 6.<p>20. Students made masks as part of the first unit, which focused on creativity in prehistoric and early civilizations. Later they wrote an additional adventure for <i>The Odyssey </i>and prepared it for presentation as a medieval manuscript.<p>21. Like many of the Coalition schools, Evans Hill has not yet implemented an exit-level culminating exhibition such as the Coalition advocates in Common Principle #6 (see Appendix A). Evans Hill's Sizer committee has encouraged teachers to experiment with mini-exhibitions at the end of units or as part of the final exam for a course. The ninth-grade team's mini-exhibitions are often used as examples of the kind of integration of knowledge around essential questions that students should be encouraged to engage in. <p>22. Long-Term Planning Outline, p. 12.<p>23. Not all of the students from the ninth-grade interdisciplinary course remained enrolled in the program the second year. For the most part, attrition was caused by scheduling conflicts. Students at this school have many elective options, several of which are scheduled as "singleton" offerings, that is, the course is offered only once in the schedule. A tenth-grade student enrolled in Latin 4, for instance, may not be able to participate in Interdisciplinary if the only section of Latin 4 coincides with the history period of the interdisciplinary program.<p>24. No additional projects were incorporated because both teachers took maternity leaves during the year.<p>25. The seminar program ("Seminar"), implemented at Evans Hill High School in the fall of 1987, was another part of the Sizer group's efforts at reform. Originally intended to be an additional component of the interdisciplinary approach being taken with the ninth grade, the purpose shifted at the end of the first year from academic enrichment to leadership training, group dynamics and moral/ just community issues. Although the activities of the ninth-grade seminar during the 1987-88 academic year are somewhat relevant to the SWAS emphasis, we have chosen not to include them. They will be discussed in much more detail in a working paper/report about Evans Hill High School to be prepared in 1991.<p>26. While all of the teachers involved were thankful to have the additional opportunities to plan, it is important to note that many were involved with other aspects of schoolwide change that were part of the Coalition reform effort at the school, including the Student-Faculty Legislature (a new governance structure introduced by Smith) and the revised Seminar. Therefore, as fast as planning time was scheduled into their schedules, it was absorbed with planning for and coordination of these projects, too.<p>27. These are the members of the respective high school departments.<p>28. This socialization was viewed differently depending upon which faction a faculty member belonged to: on the one hand, pro-Coalition teachers were enthusiastic about adding new members and having them attend Coalition-sponsored activities. Most were also relieved, since there had been quite a bit of pressure on the original group (of about six teachers -- three actively involved in the interdisciplinary program) to attend <i>all </i>Coalition-sponsored activities, which substantially cut into their private lives. The addition of new teachers to the teams meant that attendance at conferences and workshops could be spread out. If, on the other hand, a faculty member belonged to the skeptical or outright hostile group, there was pity expressed for newcomers who were being "brainwashed by the Coalition nonsense." These factions will be discussed later.<p>29. She was also responsible for initiating other Coalition-related programs, including the seminar program and the Student-Faculty Legislature (described in earlier footnotes).<p>30. These lectures were part of the ninth-grade seminar program during the 1987-88 school year.<p>31. To the noninvolved faculty, "those" discussions were linked to issues of job security, electives, teaching style, favoritism, and manipulation by the principal, all issues that they felt had been too much a part of the daily life of the school while Smith was there.<p>32. Also ironically, they began to accept that Dr. Smith had been manipulative in her dealings with others but continued to perceive her actions as justified, even as they condemned what they perceived as Winter's manipulative efforts.<p>33. The two males who teach eleventh-grade Interdisciplinary are not as isolated from the rest of the faculty as some of the other teachers. One is the union president; the other is very involved with after-school activities and he coaches as well. They do not describe the same sense of isolation as the other teachers, nor are they identified with the Sizer group.<p>34. Of course, it is impossible to know if these alliances might have been formed in a less hostile and isolating environment, but they have been very slow to develop at Evans Hill High School. <p>35. This is interesting because the two categories (SWAS and whole-school effort) have been mutually exclusive in all other school settings that we studied. Also there was an emphasis on viewing the SWAS as a pilot that would spread to the larger school in early Coalition rhetoric. <p>36. The latter possibility was the case in one of our other study schools. We discuss the impact of this leadership style in "Dropping Out of School Reform: A Case Study of Elliston High School" (Muncey, in preparation).<p>37. Administrators are convinced that the interdisciplinary program as it is currently constituted could not be expanded to encompass entire grade levels without hiring additional faculty members, something no one will countenance during a period of increasing budget concerns and declining enrollments. Other possible ways to expand the program would require the cooperation of all members of each department, since they would increase the number of preparations English and history teachers have. This is unlikely to occur: to date all overtures in this direction have been ignored. As for expanding the SWAS program to encompass the rest of each grade level, that, too, is unlikely. Neither science nor math teachers have accepted that a sacrifice in breadth (their interpretation of "Less is more") would be beneficial for their students. <p>38. And whether it is anyone's goal to tie the programs publicly to the Coalition is also questionable, especially because of the continuing hostility toward the Coalition on the part of many Evans Hill High teachers.<p><h4>Case Study III: Earvin</h4><p>39. Although the press and local community referred to this event as a "riot," many participants in that event are quick to point out that, from their perspective, it was a "protest" intended to highlight the inequities perpetrated at Earvin by the city school system.<p>40. Some of this difference can be explained by the fact that the College Preparatory High School offers no ESL or special education programs. <p>41. Although perceptions of Earvin throughout the city tend to be negative, in interviews most Earvin students maintained that the reality was quite different. For instance, students often noted that they began their freshmen year with considerable trepidation but soon discovered that Earvin was not as chaotic or violent as public perceptions had led them to expect.<p>42. This student number reflects union guidelines. That is, the teachers' contract mandates that the maximum teaching load for any one class in the Eastown school system will be 26-to-1. <p>43. Although a number of SWAS programs have cited "improved" or "superior" attendance records as the basis of their success, it should be noted that some programs (e.g., Earvin and Lewis, the next case study) restricted student enrollments in terms of this criterion. Thus, a more accurate sign of "success" might be comparing these students' present attendance with their previous attendance, rather than making the comparison school- or citywide.<p>44. Although 45 percent is widely accepted as an appropriate figure for the Eastown drop-out rate, it would seem difficult to ascertain conclusively any drop-out rate because of the geographic mobility of much of Earvin's as well as Eastown's student population. Quite simply, if students attend multiple schools in the course of their high school educations, which school assumes responsibility for the drop-outs (assuming guidance departments can accurately track these students)? <p>45. Prior to creating Earvin's SWAS, Eastown had nine official educational alternatives for incoming freshmen, including the magnet programs, an alternative high school, English-as-a-second-language programs, special education programs, and so on. That year, Earvin's SWAS was designated the tenth alternative available to high school students.<p>46. Although these developments benefited the entire school, most classroom renovations occurred in SWAS classrooms and the workroom was used primarily by the SWAS; thus, some non-SWAS faculty contended that these changes had few benefits for them.<p>47. As part of their contract, the SWAS teachers were provided with five additional free periods each week. Initially, however, the team structured their week so that they only used two of these free periods, the other three periods serving as tutorials/study halls for SWAS students. As the year progressed, most SWAS teachers felt overwhelmed by their workload and decided to grieve their present situation to secure the additional three periods. <p>48. In brief, the Coalition maintains that a school's number-one priority should be intellectual, to help students "learn to use their minds well" (CES 1985). The critique that underlies this assertion is that American schools often attempt to do too much (by offering drug counseling, prenatal care, and driver's education, for instance), and that the status accorded some nonacademic activities -- such as athletic contests, plays, or social events -- may distort the importance of a school's fundamental intellectual purpose.<p>49. University involvement at Earvin High School has taken many different forms. It has included the Dean's Office, the Education Department, the Cognitive Science Department, and so on. Although these are all different university entities, the Earvin faculty tended to generalize and refer to them all as "the university."<p>50. The relationship between the clinical professors and the faculty of Earvin High School is explored in more detail in McQuillan (1989).<p>51. Initially, students received a grade of Incomplete whenever they did not finish their work satisfactorily. As the number of Incomplete grades continued to grow, the SWAS faculty decided that Incompletes should be a privilege, not an inalienable right. Therefore, students were eventually required to petition their teachers and substantiate why they should be allowed more time to complete their work whenever they wanted a grade of Incomplete. Now, if teachers found a student's request inappropriate, they could deny that request. <p>52. Although the initial SWAS team that instituted the Incomplete did so in order to promote consistently high expectations for student work, SWAS faculty have admitted that, over time, their standards may slip somewhat. Specifically, teachers admit that when students submit the same assignment a number of times, they are more likely to award an acceptable grade, even if the work remains below their expectations. <p>53. Although university personnel were very involved in this effort, they made an effort to embrace a wide range of faculty interests. Nonetheless, among some Earvin faculty there remained a skepticism about the university's motivations. <p><h4>Case Study IV: Lewis</h4><p>54. The Osgood Foundation is a relatively small, local foundation that has a particular interest in education issues. Although they reported on the SWAS work at Lewis, they never provided any funding to the SWAS. <p>55. Although Lewis's SWAS students have done relatively well on these exams, the SWAS faculty readily admit that their flexible schedule allows them to prepare students intensively for these exams prior to their administration, an opportunity non-SWAS students at Lewis and other city students do not have.<p>56. Although the SWAS has cited these figures as a sign of success, other faculty members contend that the SWAS manipulates these figures by first enrolling SWAS dropouts in the larger school before they are discharged.<p>57. It should be noted that these National Honor Society members are from the freshman class that scored well on the State Functional Tests, but which an independent research project found were not truly representative of Lewis students in general.<p>58. In 1989, the Coalition formalized the notion of "second-step" schools. These were member schools that had gotten over the initial hurdles they encountered in the process of school restructuring. To promote their work, the Coalition focused a portion of its time and funding toward further helping these schools in their restructuring efforts.<p>59. His national exposure comes through the Coalition of Essential Schools. He is a Thomson Fellow, which means that his school department has agreed to release him from his normal responsibilities for part of the school year to participate in conferences, symposia, and workshops where he discusses various aspects of his school's Coalition program. <p>60. One summer, when faculty assignments throughout the city were uncertain, Lewis held no such workshop because they were not certain exactly who would be on their faculty until the end of August, which was too late to organize and run a workshop.<p><h4>An Analysis</h4><p>61. <i>Student-as-worker </i>is a common Coalition aphorism. This notion is often juxtaposed with what the Coalition views as the more traditional classroom conception of schooling -- "teacher-as-deliverer-of-instructional-services." In brief, this aphorism implies that students should be active workers in the classroom, not just the teacher. See Appendix A.<p>62. <i>Personalization </i>is one common aspect of school reform advocated by the Coalition. Put simply, it means that in order for students to learn to use their minds well, teachers need to know them well -- both what they can and cannot do. Thus, schools need to "personalize" the relationship between students and faculty. In practice, the Coalition often asserts that this means that most schools need to work to reduce their student/teacher ratios. The Coalition maintains that this ratio should be no more than 80 to 1. See Appendix A.<p>63. In at least two schools, SWAS teams made alliances with interested others not on the faculty with whom they would communicate more frequently and completely about what was going on in the SWAS classrooms. These "interested others" included parents, the Coalition Central Staff, and people from the superintendent's office or the School Committee. In both cases, the existence of these supportive and interested others may have led the SWAS teams to think that more (and more powerful) support existed for their work than may actually have been there. We discuss some implications of this point (which we observed in other study schools, as well) in some detail in The School Ethnography Project Working Paper #3 (Muncey and McQuillan, 1991).<p>64. Although we point to these concerns as problems confronted by SWAS programs, we have evidence that many have occurred at whole-school efforts at change as well. See, for example, McQuillan, in prep., Muncey, in prep., and Muncey and McQuillan (1991).<p>65. Letter from Elliston High School principal Kenneth Wallace to the faculty, June 2, 1989.<p>66. The Coalition's Committee on Evaluation was composed of nationally prominent persons from the field of education and was charged with assessing the initial efforts of the Coalition.<p><h4>Appendix A</h4><p>67. A Study of High Schools generated three books: <i>Horace's Compromise </i>(1984) by Sizer; <i>The Shopping Mall High School </i>(1985) by Arthur Powell, Eleanor Farrar, and David K. Cohen; and <i>The Last Little Citadel </i>(1986) by Robert Hampel.<p>68. Nonetheless, the Coalition Central Staff often note that success for them will mean "putting ourselves out of business." That is, their goal is that schools eventually reach a point where they are able to undertake the work of the Coalition on their own.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="refe"><hr><center><h2>References</h2></center><hr>Bennett, William J. 1987. <i>James Madison High School: A Curriculum for American Students</i>.
