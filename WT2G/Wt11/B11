<h2 align=center>Illinois Business & Industry Data Center Program</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The Business and Industry Data Center Program was started in 1988 by the
U.S. Census Bureau as an expansion of the State Data Center Program.  The
BIDC Program is designed  to meet the growing need by decision makers for
effective use of economic statistics.  The Census Bureau promotes the BIDC
Program as a means to increase the public's awareness of  economic and
demographic data and to make wider use of this data.<p>

Illinois will help meet this need by providing small businesses,
independent contractors and future businesses in Illinois convenient access
to statistical data and other sources of usable information.  Our goal is
to enhance the ability of small businesses to plan, market, manage and
expand their businesses in Illinois and throughout the world.  This will be
accomplished by creating a system of regional and local affiliates capable
of providing basic information to the small business community, completing
complex analysis as needed and performing regional economic analyses.<p>

We have created five Regional Affiliates throughout the state.  These
affiliates will be responsible for collecting and disseminating information
to both the end users of the data and to the local affiliates.  They will
also provide a quarterly regional economic analysis, furnish expertise in
one or more data bases and provide assistance to local affiliates and data
users as needed.<p>

Local Affiliates have been created in each region.  Local Affiliates are
responsible for dealing directly with small businesses and other data
users, providing basic census, economic, and demographic information, other
data prepared by the Regional Affiliates or the state, and offering
technical assistance in basic data interpretation.  Issues involving more
complex analysis or interpretation will be referred to the appropriate
Regional Affiliate.<p>

DCCA's BIDC staff are available to discuss the BIDC and other research issues. For 
information contact Ed Taft at 217/785-7545 (TDD users can call 800/785-6055) or 
by e-mail: <a href="mailto:etaft@mhd084r1.state.il.us">etaft@mhd084r1.state.il.us</a>.

<H3><CENTER>Enterprise Zones</CENTER></H3>
<HR>
<P>
Enterprise Zones are among Illinois' most important tools to 
stimulate economic growth and neighborhood revitalization.  The Enterprise 
Zone program depends upon a creative partnership between state and local 
government, businesses, labor and community groups to encourage economic 
growth in the areas designated as Enterprise Zones.  Although the program 
is administered at the state level by the Department of Commerce and 
Community Affairs (DCCA), its ultimate success depends on the level of 
local commitment.<P>

There are currently 91 Enterprise Zones in Illinois, the maximum 
number that may be designated according to Illinois law.  All offer the 
same mix of state incentives designed to encourage companies to locate or 
expand within a zone.  In addition, each zone offers distinctive local 
incentives to enhance business or neighborhood development efforts.   Such 
local incentives include abatement of property taxes on new improvements, 
homesteading and shopsteading programs, waiver of business licensing and 
permit fees, streamlined building code and zoning requirements, and special 
local financing programs and resources.<P>

<H3>State Incentives</H3>

<EM>Sales Tax Exemption</EM> - A 6.25 percent state sales tax exemption is permitted 
on building materials to be used in an Enterprise Zone.  Materials must be 
permanently affixed to the property and must be purchased locally.
Enterprise Zone Machinery and Equipment Consumables/Pollution Control 
Facilities Sales Tax Exemption - A 6.25 percent state sales tax exemption 
on purchases of tangible personal property to be used in the manufacturing 
or assembly process or in the operation of a pollution control facility 
within an Enterprise Zone is available.  Eligibility is based on a business 
making an investment in an Enterprise Zone of at least $5 million that 
creates a minimum of 200 full-time-equivalent jobs, a business investing at 
least $40 million in a zone and retaining  at least 2,000 jobs, or a 
business investing at least $40 million in a zone which causes the 
retention of at least 90 percent of the jobs existing on the date it is 
certified to receive the exemption.<P>

<EM>Enterprise Zone Utility Tax Exemption </EM>- A state utility tax exemption on 
gas, electricity and the Illinois Commerce Commission's administrative 
charge is available to businesses located in Enterprise Zones.  Eligible 
businesses must make an investment of at least $5 million that creates a 
minimum of 200 full-time-equivalent jobs in Illinois, or an investment of 
$20 million that retains at least 1,000 full-time-equivalent jobs in 
Illinois.  The majority of the jobs created must be located in the 
Enterprise Zone where the investment occurs.<P>

<EM>Enterprise Zone Investment Tax Credit </EM>- A state investment tax credit of 
0.5 percent is allowed a taxpayer who invests in qualified property in a 
Zone.  Qualified property includes machinery, equipment and buildings.  The 
credit may be carried forward for up to five years.  This credit is in 
addition to the regular 0.5 percent investment tax credit which is 
available throughout the state, and up to 0.5 percent credit for increased 
employment over the previous year.<P>

<EM>Dividend Income Deduction</EM> - Individuals, corporations, trusts and estates 
are not taxed on dividend income from corporations doing substantially all 
their business in an Enterprise Zone.<P>

<EM>Jobs Tax Credit </EM>- The Enterprise Zone Jobs Tax Credit allows a business a 
$500 credit on Illinois income taxes for each job created in the Zone for 
which a certified eligible worker is hired.  The credit may be carried 
forward for up to five years.  A minimum of five workers must be hired to 
qualify for the credit.  The credit is effective for people hired on or 
after January 1, 1986.<P>

<EM>Interest Deduction</EM> - Financial institutions are not taxed on the interest 
received on loans for development within an Enterprise Zone.<P>

<EM>Contribution Deduction</EM> - Businesses may deduct double the value of a cash 
or in-kind contribution to an approved project of a designated Zone 
organization from taxable income.<P>

This federally-funded program assists smaller Illinois local
governments in financing public facilities, housing rehabilitation
projects or economic development needs.  Grants are made to units of
local government and may be loaned to businesses for projects that
will create or retain jobs in the community.  Grant funds may also be
used by the local government for improvements to public infrastructure
that directly support economic development.  The program is limited to
communities with populations under 50,000 that are not located within
one of the seven large urban counties that receive funds directly from
the federal government.  Funds are targeted toward projects that
primarily benefit low-to moderate-income people.<P>

<strong>COMING SOON!</strong> The following is an overview of an exciting development opportunity. Full details of the site and development parcels will be available on request. 

<h3 align=center>
PRIME REDEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY<br>
<em>Joliet, Illinois</em>
</h3>

Soon to be available for redevelopment opportunities are two sites contained within the
boundaries of the former Joliet Arsenal in Joliet, Illinois. Two parcels of property
contain a total of 3,000 acres. The West Site has 1,900 acres and has direct access to 
Interstate 55 and rail service. The Joliet Area Citizens Planning Commission (JACPC) has
suggested 55 parcels will soon be available for immediate development. The East Site has 1,103
acres, mainly vacant and undeveloped. There is currently no on-site rail service however, state
and federal plans include rail and road improvements during 1997. There is a rail hub adjacent
to the site and the JACPC has suggested 43 parcels will soon be available for immediate development.

property.<p>

<p>Use our <strong>Word Search</strong> feature to find information about a specific subject.<p>

Enter a word or words below and press 'Excite Search'.  All First Stop government profile types,  agency, business requirements and assistance, will be scanned for your selected words.  You will be given a list of all documents in the First Stop database that match your selection. You can view each document by selecting it from the list returned.

<center><h3>TIPS for using the WORD SEARCH function</h3></center>

Be careful spelling the word(s) you enter!  It will search for exactly what 
you specify.<p>  

The search is not case sensitive.  For example, if you type 'INCOME', the 
system will return a list of documents that have 'INCOME', 'Income' or 
'income'.<p>

The system will return a list of documents that have ALL of the words that 
you enter.  Thus, if you enter INCOME TAX, you will get a list of all 
information profiles that have BOTH 'INCOME' and 'TAX'.  They need not be 
together in a document but only profiles containing BOTH (all) words will 
be selected for you.<p>  

The search function uses the entire word, as entered, in selecting 
'matching' documents.  It does not return documents containing `partial' 
word matches.  For example, if you input 'ENVIRONMENT' for your search, you 
will not get documents that may only contain the word 'ENVIRONMENTAL' or 
vice versa.<p>  

Start by using single words rather than combinations.  You are basically 
'guessing' what words may be used in a document that covers the subject 
matter you need.  After you get a list of documents with one word relating 
to your subject, try limiting the number of matching documents by adding 
another word.  For example, if you start with 'ENVIRONMENTAL', you may get 
a long list of documents.  You can then do another search using 
'ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS' to reduce the list to only those documents more 
closely relating to your desired subject.<p>  

If you don't find what you need on your first selection, try another word 
or words that would logically have the same or similar meaning.  Using 
search functions can be an art.  Don't be discouraged when you don't 
initially find something that you request.<p> 

<em>Note: </em> The quotation marks in the examples above are for clarity only.  
Don't use them when you input your word selections.<p>

<h3>CCI News</h3>
<em>By Jeff Markland</em><p>

Comments from those in attendance indicate that the Competitive Communities Conference held April 3 and 4 in Springfield was a tremendous success.  Attended by mayors; city, county and township officials; economic development practitioners; service providers and local leaders interested in economic development issues, the conference explored the global, national and statewide issues and resources that effect development at the local level. <p> 

Dennis R. Whetstone, Director of the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), kicked off the conference by sharing with the audience his vision of what economic development is, what it isn't and what needs to be done to make the State of Illinois even more competitive.<p>

Whetstone struck an accord with those in attendance when he said, "Economic development is not synonymous with business development.  Economic development is a much broader continuum of services and activities that have to take place, that if it works, results in economic development."  He went on to define economic development with a formula for success "CD + BD x L = ED" (Community Development + Business Development x Leadership = Economic Development.)<p>

Explaining that in years past DCCA had narrowly defined it's purpose as primarily a business development agency that, by chance, also administered millions of dollars of federal grant and loan funds, Whetstone said, "Today we know to be successful a community needs to do both community and business development, and provide knowledgeable, energetic and professional leadership at the local level."<p>

Five different panels comprised of individuals with varying perspectives discussed  development polices, issues, and practices that are critical to achieving competitiveness in today's market place. <p>

The conference featured panel members from across the nation who came to Springfield to share their perspectives, knowledge and experience with conference attendees.  John Sidor of the Council of State Community Development Agencies; Daphne Clones of the Corporation For Enterprise Development; Don Walls, Walls and  Associates; Martha Lawson, National Associ- ation of Development Organizations; Thomas J. Johnson, Grant Thornton; and Don Tusher, Kelly-Springfield, are just a few of the panel members that brought their years of experience and practical know-how to share with those in attendance.<p>

During his keynote address, Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra stressed the importance of developing our infrastructure, financial resources, technologies, business climate and quality of life.  "By strengthening these foundations we will retain the businesses we currently host, encourage them to expand, and even attract new businesses to within our borders -- bringing new, high quality jobs with them."<p>

One of the five discussion panels, "The Local Experience," showcased the CCI communities of Cairo, Charleston, Oregon and Seneca.  Local leaders from these communities shared the problems  as well as the accomplishments they experienced during their first year as CCI communities. <p>
 
Ron Colson of Oregon said his community used the "dogsled model" -- "We had a lot of people interested but we didn't have a common harness to get us all pulling together in the same direction--CCI gave us that harness."  According to Carolyn Mayberry, "Cairo has been studied to death.  CCI forced us to sit down around the same table and agree on where we wanted to go.  We are now focused and working together."  Charleston Mayor Dan Cougill encouraged communities to get the nay-sayers involved. "You will be surprised at the help you get and the converts that become positive influences within your community," he said.<p>

If there was a common theme expressed throughout the conference by panel members and audience particapants alike, it was the need for accurate, responsive and timely information.  Don Tusher, Plant Manager for Kelly-Springfield, said, "Today we are giving information to our unions that five years ago we didn't give to our managers...if they have the same information we do, they will come to the same conclusions."  The CCI conference was a great opportunity for all of DCCA's development partners to share and exchange information.  We hope that next year you will be able to join us.<p>

<h3>MORE ABOUT LAND</h3>
<em>By Rich Funderburk</em><p>

This article addresses what I consider to be the most important ingredient of a local business development program:  land.  If you don't have land, you simply don't have a program.  Your community will be eliminated from any business attraction competition without receiving a visit.<p>  

A piece of land, or "site," is the physical place you have where a business or industry can locate.  A large portion of the evaluation process that a business undertakes will be spent dealing with the physical location -- that piece of land it will acquire and build its facility on.  There are many factors that are taken into consideration when building a new facility on a piece of land that is not completely developed.  <p>

The competitiveness of the site depends on how ready the site is and how well it fits the needs of the prospect.  For example, many sites get eliminated because they just do not have the proper physical characteristics to fit the project.<p>

If your community is going to have a long-term economic development program (covering a period of 15  to 20 years,) then control of land should be a part of that program.  A plan needs to be developed in steps that your community can afford.  Here are the four stages of a site development plan:<p>

The first step is to identify what land in your community is really available for sale.  (Just because you think a piece of land is available or would make a nice site, doesn't mean it is.)  The property owners need to be identified and asked if they are willing to sell and at what price.  <p>

Second, your organization or community can take an option on the property.  That way, if you have the opportunity to negotiate with a prospect, you will have control over what can and cannot be accomplished on the property.  <p>

Third, your community can purchase a piece of land that you control for future development.  I offer a note of caution here.  Before taking title to any property -- especially if it's to be purchased by the city -- make sure it is environmentally clean and there is no remediation that has to be completed (and paid for) after you take over  the property.<p>

Fourth, once you control a piece of property, you should develop a plan for complete development of the site over a long period of time.  This plan will address factors such as infrastructure improvements, roads, sewer, water, rail extensions, etc.  on the land.<p>

Every time you complete one of these steps your community becomes more marketable as a new business location because you are eliminating the unknowns in the process and providing tangibles upon which business decisions can be made.<p>

DCCA has a program called the Select Site program.  It's a very good guide to all of the factors that are evaluated about a site.  And even if you have sites that you don't think will meet all of the guidelines of the Select Site program, it's still a good guide to evaluate what you have.<p>

Developing land is expensive and time consuming.  But it is very important that you take the time to seek counsel from people who can give you advice and help you plan the process so that you make good decisions.  There are many people out there that are willing to help you, if you'll only ask.<p>

Remember, O.I.L. (organization, information, land):  they are the fundamental parts to a local business development program.  If you have these three components, your local economic development effort will have a better chance of success.  Businesses locate in communities; you need to show businesses that you want them and that your community has what they need to locate and grow.<p>

<h3>BUSINESS LOOK FOR INFORMATION<br>
<em>by: Rich Funderburk</em></h3>

For the last few issues, we've been talking about things businesses look for when choosing locations.  It is important for you to understand what drives the information needs of businesses looking for new locations or places to expand.<p>

Long before anyone ever makes contact with a community, the business will develop a needs assessment and develop information criteria to help them make a decision on whether to move, expand, or simply expand into a different labor force or market area.  That need will vary greatly depending on what the project is and the company or person using that information.<p>

For example, a business that employs 100 people will want more labor information than one that employs 10.  An insurance company will need a different kind of work force and have different information needs than a company that is going to put in a standing operation.  Each kind of business has its own needs and its own evaluation criteria.<p>

These information needs have increased by a huge percentage in the last 25 years.  Much of that increase is due to the increase in government regulations such as zoning.  EPA and OSHA to name a few.  As community leaders, this means you need to collect more information for your database, and develop rapport with agencies that create databases, regulate or administer the regulations that control these businesses.  In some cases, you might need to hire a consultant to help you.

But before you hire anyone, your community organization should understand the need for and the use of this information.  Let me stress again, the information has to be factual and up-to-date because if it's not, it's not tangible and therefore cannot be evaluated.<p>

There is also evidence that the time cycle for these evaluations is shrinking.  Businesses are making decisions quickly.  This means that the demand for information will increase and the time companies allow you to provide that information will be reduced. Having current accurate information readily available will put you in a better position to compete and not be eliminated.<p>

You will never be able to answer every question asked of you on the spot.  But you need to demonstrate that you have the ability to provide good factual information with quick turnaround.<p>

No matter what kind of business your community wants to attract, information is essential.  Start working today to develop that information base.<p>

<h3>PEACE CORPS FELLOWS, COMMUNITIES WORKING WELL TOGETHER<br>
<em>by: Tom Lawton</em></h3>

Under a unique program, seven Peace Corps Fellows from Western Illinois University (WIU) and Illinois State University (ISU) are tackling community development projects in Illinois small towns.  The fellows are Peace Corps volunteers who have returned from earlier assignments and now are serving 11 month assignments in small towns as part of the requirements to earn master's degrees for WIU or ISU.<p>

An example is Scott Johnson.  Johnson is working with the Carthage Industrial Development Corporation (CIDC) in pursuit of six goals, including bringing industry to town, developing housing and building a stronger membership base.<p>

"The Peace Corps Fellows program has been a big spark plug for our community," said Jerry Bartel of CIDC.  "Our economic and social development bases were fragmented and Scott has helped us pull them together."<p>

Another participant is Todd Crabtree.  Crabtree is working in Cumberland County through the Cumberland County Development Corporation (CCDC)/  Some of the county goals that he has been working toward include implementing an educational foundation, an ambassadors group, and a speakers bureau.  Other goals include tourism, business retention, and historic preservation. <p>

"Todd helps us make our plans happen.  He has made a lot of good connection for us and he has fit into our community really well," remarked Carol Jo Fritz form CCDC.<p>

Other 1994 Peace Corps Fellows from WIU and ISU are stationed in Cairo, Murphysboro, Grundy County and Ford County.  Lacon, Washburn and Wenona are jointly hosting a Fellow.  Both Cairo and Murphysboro are involved in the Competitive Communities Initiative.<p>

The next class of Peace Corps Fellows will be available to work in communities beginning in June 1996.  If your community is interested in hosting a Fellow, please contact John Gruidl, Illinois Institute for Rural Affairs, at Western Illinois University, phone 800/526-9943 or 309/298-2984.<p>

<h3>FOUNDATION OF THE MONTH<br>
<em>by: Jeff Markland</em></h3>

<h4>THE FOUNDATIONS FOR GROWTH</h4>
<ul type=square>
<li>Pro-competitive policies affecting local business climate
<li>A skilled and adaptive workforce.
<li>Access to capital for business growth and expansion.
<li>Good basic and advanced infrastructure.
<li>Access to technology and business modernization resources.
<li>The social infrastructure necessary for a high quality of life.
</ul>

Years ago it was common knowledge that three factors determined the desirability of property: Location, location and location.  Cheap taxes and land were the main focuses during the site selection process.  But things changed.  Soon, communities and states found themselves in bidding wars, each trying to outdo the other with costly incentives to attract businesses.<p>

Today, to some degree, technology and transportation have changed that.  Companies are looking for more than just low taxes - the overall tax structure, tax burden and expenditure policies share equal importance.<p>

Companies look to get "bang for the buck".  Taxes should not be out of line with the benefits received.  Taxes spent effectively can actually reduce operating costs; for example, good schools reduce the need for remedial training.<p>

Stability and predictability are also of importance.  Uncertainty about taxes can undermine confidence in community leadership.<p>

You want to be sure that your taxes are in line with other communities in your market area.  But you also need to make sure that businesses know how those tax dollars are spent.  A quality business will understand that appropriate expenditures are important to preserving and improving quality of life in a community.<p>

<h3>
O.N.E. TO WRITE ACTION PLAN<br>
<em>by: Don Falls</em>
</h3>
The Organization of the Northeast (O.N.E.), the neighborhood group that is sponsoring participation in CCI by Chicago's Edgewater and Uptown areas, has completed work on its self-assessment and is now working toward developing a written action plan for the two neighborhoods.<p>

O.N.E. faces some unique challenges.  These neighborhoods are among the most culturally, economically and ethnically diverse communities in our state.  Home to people with Chicago's highest and lowest incomes, the housing stock includes lakefront townhouses and condos, rehabilitated apartments, assisted housing, boarding houses, and many ethnic, religious and racial groups.  The neighborhoods provide a social and cultural mix only found in one of the great cities of the world.<p>

O.N.E. is particularly well-suited for CCI work because it is already very familiar with the issues involved in community competitiveness.  Formed almost 25 years ago with the purpose of identifying areas of mutual concern in the Uptown and Edgewater neighborhoods, each year O.N.E. completes a self-assessment that identifies the needs, issues and concerns of the neighborhoods. This information is then prioritized into an action agenda.<p>

This year, O.N.E. conducted 45 house meetings in the various areas.  Participants included youths, seniors, owners, renters and people of various economic levels.  Because the size and diversity of the area makes communicating very difficult, meetings were conducted in five different languages.<p>

O.N.E. also conducts an annual convention where the members review and discuss information and priorities.<p>

This year's convention identified the following priorities: leadership training and outreach; child care; safety, anti- drug and community policing; opportunities for youths; improved education at all levels; job training; housing; immigration issues, voter registration and citizenship campaigns.<p>

With this phase of the self-assessment complete, CCI staff will assist O.N.E.'s Jobs & Economic Development Team to develop the written action plan for the two neighborhoods.  The plan will detail the actions to be completed, who will be responsible for the projects and what resources will be needed to complete the various goals.<p>

<h3>
THE DETAILS OF ORGANIZATION<br>
<em>by: Rich Funderburk</em>
</h3>

In the last issue, I talked with you about O.I.L. - Organization, Information, and Land.  I'd like to revisit two of these subjects - organization and information - in more detail.<p>

As I said before, there are many types of local organizations. They can all work if the right people are involved, if they take the time to learn the economic development process, and if they develop a clear understanding or plan of what they want to accomplish.  Then they need to set some realistic goals and a timeframe in which to achieve these goals.  I don't mean pie-in-the-sky ideas, but things that are within the ability of your organization and your community.<p>

Many community organizations have failed through the years because they were put together by people with visions of grandeur, what I call the "hero syndrome".  They're people with good intention, but who are misdirected and uninformed.<p>

Every organization needs a good leader.  Choose one who can bring all of a community's resources to focus on a common goal and, when successful give credit to all those who made it happen.  Remember, in today's world, and the economic development business in particular, no one person can make it happen.  It takes lots of people, not only from your community, but from outside the community, to make real economic growth happen.<p>

I want to stress again that the longevity of you organization's leaders is very important.  If you look around the state, or any other state as far as that goes, you'll find that in successful organizations people have been involved for as many as 10, 20 and even 30 years in their local economic development program. Don't involve people just because they are popular.  If they're popular, and they're hard worker at helping the community, that's different.<p>

I'm a strong believer that most local organization are underfunded.  A community needs to invest more than just its time if it wants to compete for growth in today's world. <p>

Funding is something that's been done in many different ways (and something we can talk about in a later column).  But no matter what path you choose for your community, be realistic in its goals, be patient, stay dedicated, there's much to learn.  Economic development is a very complex process, with many different interests.  And don't be afraid to ask for help.  No one knows for sure you're not going to re-invent the wheel in this business.  If you need help ask for it, and don't ask us too late.<p>

<h3>NEW COMMUNITIES ANNOUNCED</h3>

Gov. Jim Edgar recently announced that 10 new participants have been chosen for the Competitive Communities Initiative (CCI).  "The goal of the CCI is to help participants lay the groundwork for economic success," the Governor said.  "The communities selected to pilot this program during the past year have given it excellent reviews.  I am pleased to see additional communities make commitment to their future."<p>

The communities chosen from this round of applications are Benton, Crystal Lake, East Moline, Grafton, Greenville, Henry, Milford, Warren County, Sparta and Yorkville.<p>

Last year, during the first selection process, CCI only selected communities assessed as being in the initial stages of development for participation in the program.  This new round of communities has demonstrated various degrees of preparedness.  "We learned a lot from working with our first round selections," said Jeff Markland of the CCI staff.  "I fully expect the program to gain strength and value as we and our communities progress."<p>

The Department of Commerce and Community Affairs Office of Local Initiatives (OLI) is responsible for administration of the CCI program.  OLI is presently working with 29 communities throughout Illinois ranging in size from a few hundred to over 150,000 people.<p>

<h3>
CCI ON THE MOVE<br>
<em>by: Jane Robert</em>
</h3>

"CCI On the Move" is the name given to the Oregon, Illinois CCI program by its 22-member steering committee.  And there's no question it's true!<p>

With the dynamic leadership of the Steering Committee, directed by Donna Mann of the Cooperative Extension Service, subcommittee members have gone to work in the past year and are making great strides to improve their community.  Through their efforts, the "New Look for Oregon" campaign was held last June which included community clean-up work as well as adding flowers to the downtown area.  For the holidays, twinkling lights are now glowing downtown.<p>

Future plans that have already been approved include funding for period lighting on the Route 64 bridge scheduled to be constructed next  year, and development of a not-for-profit 501(C)3 Finance Committee 3 whose responsibility consists of coordination and fundraising activities for all CCI projects.  City support includes the Oregon City Council's commitment to finance one-half of the holiday lighting program and some of the administrative funds for CCI activities.  Local service organizations and individuals have financed the other half of the holiday lights.<p>

Lynn Kilker, Chairman of CCI, said, "This is only the beginning of our work in Oregon.  We are excited and CCI is working here!"<p>

<hr>
<h3>
FOUNDATION OF THE MONTH<br>
<em>by: Jeff Markland</em>
</h3>In the early years of development waterways, railroads, highways and air service determined market areas.<p>

The new "transportation system" is "ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS MODERNIZATION RESOURCES".  It is as critical to today's competitive community as any other.  Three kinds of resources comprise this foundation.<p>

Current generation (or "off the shelf") product and process technologies including the latest equipment, applications and materials.<p>

Easy access to expertise on business modernization techniques, and third is access to applied research and development of product or process technologies as well as knowledge of innovation at both the local and global level.<p>

Improving this foundation requires close working relationships with the local business community, telephone companies, utilities, technology users and the local communities.  An up-to-date communications system is critical to your communities economic growth.<p>

<h3>JOB  HOLDERS  AT  RECORD  LEVEL</h3>

Employment in Illinois topped 5,840,000 during October to reach an all-time high.  The Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES) reported that during the month the number of unemployed dropped nearly 8,900 while total employment grew by 20,210.  IDES added that total employment crossed the 5.8 million mark for the first time in January and remained above that level every month since, as job expansion held steady.<p>

Personal income growth held relatively stable in the second quarter with a 5.4 percent annualized increase.  The quarterly change compares to a 5.8 percent rise in the first quarter.  It was reported by the U.S. Department of Commerce that the leading growth in Illinois during the period occurred in the volatile farm income, which was up 29.9 percent over the previous quarter.  It was followed by finance, insurance and real estate with 3.2 percent and services at 1.9 percent quarterly growth.<p>

A report titled Export Markets for Illinois Coal indicated that the state's international shipments of coal increased 10-fold during 1995 to a record 2.7 million tons.  The study noted that the principal importers were Morocco, Germany, the United Kingdom and Denmark.  The report was released by Lieutenant Governor Bob Kustra who forecasts that Illinois' annual coal exports could realistically increase by another 3 to 5 million tons in the next decade.<p>

The Illinois Association of Realtors reported that the statewide median price of an existing home rose to $128,400 in the third quarter.  This was $4,300 above the cost of a year ago for a 3.5 percent increase during the period.  Prices in the Chicago metropolitan area also trended upward to $155,400 during the quarter, rising at a slightly higher 4.2 percent rate over the past 12 months.  Statewide, the 26,170 homes sold during the quarter was 417 units below the number purchased in the third quarter of last year as mortgage rates had risen a half point during this time.<p>

A November publication by the Illinois Economic and Fiscal Commission (IEFC) related that some softening has occurred in consumer spending, exports and manufacturing in the state.  They add that building permits and first-time unemployment insurance claims suggest less vigorous growth.  The IEFC's analysis foresees modest but stable growth in the months ahead. <p>

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth decreased to 102.3 in November from 102.7 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that the state index mirrors national economic trends.  They note that the steady but slow growth suggests moderate expansion in the second half of 1996 and into 1997.<p>

<hr>
<h3>AVERAGE  ANNUAL  PAY  BY  INDUSTRY</h3>

The average annual pay of $30,099 in Illinois was 8.1 percent above the national rate of $27,845 in 1995.  Both the state and national averages rose 3.4 percent last year with Illinois maintaining its eighth place ranking among the states.<p>

Among the industry classifications, mining retained its top pay position despite a modest 1.7 percent increase last year.  Finance, insurance and real estate also maintained its second position, with the assistance of the largest annual gain of 6.7 percent.  The smallest payroll increase was in government where the average pay rose 1.4 percent in 1995.<p> 

<hr>
<h3>ILLINOIS  HIGHLIGHTS</h3>

Seven Illinois firms made Forbes magazine's 1996 roster of the 200 Best Small Companies in America.  Their area of concentration was in health care, electronics, telecommunications and energy.<p>  

INC. magazine's recent annual top-500 list of America's fastest-growing companies included 20 firms that are headquartered in the state.<p>

There were five Illinois companies listed on Fortune magazine's 1996 ranking of the fastest-growing companies.<p>

<hr>
<h3>WEFA  - NOVEMBER  U.S.  ECONOMIC  OUTLOOK - FORECAST  OVERVIEW</h3>

The WEFA Group estimates that the economic expansion will continue for at least another year.  The forecasting firm notes that growth is slowing and adds that the indicators which typically signal a recession are not doing so now.  WEFA feels that over the next six months the probability of a recession will rise as economic growth slows and the yield curve flattens.<p> 

They expect employment growth to remain moderate over the next six months, wage gains to be noninflationary and economic growth to be about 2 percent.  WEFA adds that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates in such an environment.<p>

WEFA predicts that credit expansion will continue to decelerate.  They note that monthly payments on mortgages, consumer debt and vehicle leases have reached a critical point, which reveals the average consumer to be somewhat stretched.  WEFA estimates that consumers will remain cautious, spending their income gains without increasing their debt substantially.  They expect a subdued holiday selling season.<p>

WEFA forecasts that President Clinton and Vice President Gore in their second term will focus on cutting taxes for educational expenses, revising welfare reform, cleaning up the environment, keeping the deficit down, and fixing the financing for Medicare and Social Security.  WEFA estimates that the federal government purchases of goods and services, after inflation, will decline for a couple more years before leveling off. <p>

They expect exports to grow about 6 percent over the next couple of years and import growth will continue strong.  WEFA adds that net exports are no longer expected to contribute to growth over the next few years.<p>

They expect exports to grow about 6 percent over the next couple of years and import growth will continue strong.  WEFA adds that net exports are no longer expected to contribute to growth over the next few years.<p>

They relates that housing starts fell from a 1.53 million pace in August to a 1.44 pace in September, but new home sales were at a very high 816,000 rate in September.  WEFA notes that housing starts and sales are at a very high level, but feel that residential investment will not be contributing to much economic growth.  They feel that housing starts and sales are unlikely to rise from their current lofty heights.<p>

<h3>BALANCED ECONOMIC EXPANSION</h3>

The Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES) reported recently that the state is enjoying a balanced economic expansion with job growth continuing across several major industry groups led by services (36,600), trade (27,700) and manufacturing (6,900).  IDES added that for the first time in more than two years, jobs in finance, insurance and real estate have been steadily increasing, up more than 4,000 or 1.1 percent above September 1995.<p>

New business incorporations in Illinois have risen 2.7 percent through September.  During the first nine months, there were 27,057 filings with the Secretary of State compared to 26,356 incorporations a year ago.  Despite a slowdown the past two months, new domestic filings have increased  by over 700 incorporations this year.<p>

Retail sales continued to rebound from their mid-year sluggishness as receipts in August totaled $9 billion.  This was a $315 million gain over the previous August but down $123 million from the July total.  Overall, retail sales in the state have increased 3.5 percent year-to-date. 
Consumer prices in the Chicago metropolitan area rose at a moderate 2.8 percent rate in September, matching the August rate of change.  The increase was below the comparable 3 percent national level for September.  The Chicago all-urban rate trended upward in May, with the increase in energy costs, but it has remained relatively stable over the past four months.<p>

According to the October report by F. W. Dodge, contracts for future construction in Illinois are down 3.6 percent for the year.  Their nine month total of $9 billion is below last year's pace by $335 million.  This leading economic indicator reports that nonresidential construction is down 23.1 percent for the year, while nonbuilding (infrastructure improvements) contracts are off by 3 percent.  Residential construction has partially offset the other two categories with a 16.9 percent year-to-date increase.<p>
   
The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth decreased to 102.7 in October from 103.2 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that both personal income and corporate profits were sluggish in October.  They added that the two were offset somewhat by a surge in sales tax receipts. <p>

<hr>
<h3>ILLINOIS  AGRICULTURAL  EXPORTS </h3>

With a strong 32.8 percent gain last year, feed grains (which includes corn) surged ahead of soybeans as the state's top agricultural export commodity during the 1995 federal fiscal year.  Large increases of agricultural crop purchases by Korea, Egypt, China, Spain and Germany boosted international shipments last year.  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Illinois exported nearly $3.5 billion in farm products in FFY 1995 for a 13.8 percent yearly increase.<p>

Over $1.5 billion or 44.2 percent of the state's sales to foreign nations were feed grains (primarily corn).  An additional $1.2 billion in crop shipments or 35.7 percent were soybeans and soy-products.  In combination, Illinois' exports of feed grains and soybeans accounted for 80 percent of its agricultural sales and 17.1 percent of the U.S. shipments of these products.  Overall, Illinois exported 6.4 percent of the nation's agricultural goods in FFY 1995, down from the 7 percent reported the previous period. <p>

<hr>
<h3>ILLINOIS HIGHLIGHTS</h3>

Illinois ranked second nationally in both feed grains (primarily corn) and soybean exports last year.  The state placed third overall in the international shipments of agricultural products.<p>

The U.S. Department of Commerce's first ranking of metropolitan areas by the value of their export shipments placed Chicago sixth.  Sales from the metro area totaled $17.3 billion in 1994 and primarily were manufactured products.  Non-manufactured commodities represented about 8 percent of the shipments.<p>

The National Foundation for Women Business Owners reported that Illinois ranks fifth out of the 50 states in the number of women-owned firms.  Illinois also placed fifth in employment and a similar rating for sales by women-owned firms.<p>

<h3>DRI/MCGRAW HILL -OCTOBER ECONOMIC OUTLOOK-FORECAST OVERVIEW</h3>

The forecasting firm estimates that the U.S. economy is now operating close to capacity.  DRI feels that the strong growth in the first half of the year appears to be moderating in the second half.  They add that with the unemployment rate well below most economist's measures of full employment, above-trend growth is no longer possible for any extended period.<p>

DRI relates that the recent data suggest that, with the clear exception of housing, the economy may be cooling more quickly than expected.  Their forecast of third-quarter growth has been revised downward, primarily in net exports, where the data now suggests weaker exports and stronger imports.<p>

They predict that the economy should slow to near-trend growth in the second half of 1996 and then to below-trend growth in early 1997.  DRI expects that the Federal Reserve will keep trying to fine-tune the economy.  They estimate that the Fed will hike the funds rate by year-end and raise it to 6 percent by spring.<p>

DRI notes that business investment has been the strongest contributor to the economic expansion over the last four years.  They add that except for computers and "other" office equipment, business investment slowed late last year.  DRI expects computer outlays will slow in 1997 as early signs are beginning to appear.<p>

They also note that state and local spending will be constrained by budget problems and declining federal support.  DRI adds that rising educational outlays will limit the possibilities for further tax cuts.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS'  EXPORTS  TO  MEXICO  REBOUND</h3>

Exports to Mexico have risen sharply and returned to their record 1994 level.  Through the first half of this year shipments of Illinois goods have topped $1 billion, moving Mexico back to the state's third largest export market.  The 35 percent year-to-date gain was led by the strong increase in crops and coal shipments.  Canada and Japan continue to be Illinois' top foreign markets and along with Mexico account for over one-third of the states' exports.<p>

The Illinois Department of Employment Security reported that Illinois employment remains solid with strong growth in trade and moderate expansion across other industries, including services and manufacturing.  They noted that brisk tourism activity in August pushed total employment in trade to the second-highest level on record, 1,355,000.  IDES added that the number of people filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits declined 2.1 percent from the year-ago level.<p>

Manpower Inc.'s fourth quarter 1996 Employment Outlook Survey indicated that 27 percent of the participating employers in Illinois planned to increase the size of their workforce while 8 percent anticipate a decrease.  Additionally, 61 percent expected no change.  By percentage, the DeKalb/Sycamore and Champaign area employers were the most optimistic in the state followed by the Bloomington and North Riverside areas.<p>

Retail sales have experienced some up-and-down months recently as receipts soared in May, declined in June and rebounded in July.  The $9 billion July total was the sixth largest on record, topped only by the $9.2 billion sales in May and the past three Decembers' receipts.  The weather may have aided the monthly total as the unseasonally mild summer made shopping easier.<p>

Coldwell Banker Commercial's industrial vacancy index for the Chicago area rose to 7.2 percent in the second quarter from 6.6 percent a year ago.  CB Commercial also reported that their commercial office vacancy index for the Chicago metropolitan area decreased to 14.6 percent from 15.8 percent during the same 12 month period.  The Chicago area industrial rate is below the 7.4 percent U.S. level, while the metropolitan office rate is above the national rate of 13.1 percent.<p>

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth registered 103.2 in September from 104.2 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that sales tax collections were sluggish, while corporate tax payments rose modestly and personal income tax collections were strong in September.<p>

<hr>
<h3>ILLINOIS' BUSINESS TAX COMPETITIVENESS</h3>

A study by Robert Tannenwald, Senior Economist of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston compares after-tax returns on capital investments in 22 states.  The report placed Illinois sixth for the best overall return for the five representative types of manufacturing firms selected.  The study reviews indicators of tax competitiveness which focus on the taxes that most directly affect a firm's bottom line and measures their impact on the profitability of potential business investment projects.  The analysis is not limited to taxes on corporate profits and net worth.  Property taxes and, in some cases, sales taxes and unemployment insurance taxes are also taken into account.<p>

The report finds that the business tax climate exerts only a small, highly uncertain effect on capital spending.  It adds that states may be more likely to stimulate their economy by enhancing public services valued by businesses.  It should also be noted that since the year from which the data was taken, Illinois has placed strong emphasis on reducing business costs.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Illinois Highlights</h3>

This year's list of FORTUNE magazine's "Most Admired Companies" included 11 Illinois headquartered firms in the top 100 companies.<p>

State Farm Insurance of Bloomington reports that their current employment within Illinois has reached 12,500.  Their large headquarter staff along with their network of claims offices places them 25th on the 1996 list of the Top In-State Employers.<p>


DCCA's Illinois Bureau of Tourism's award winning  "Million Miles from Monday" advertising campaign reports that telephone interest has increased 84 percent year-to-date through August.  Calls to their 1-800-2-CONNECT allow vacationers to contact travel counselors for help with their specific getaway plans. <p>   

<hr>
<h3>WEFA - SEPTEMBER - U.S. Economic Outlook - Forecast Overview</h3>

The forecasting firm expects increasingly moderate employment gains in the second half of 1996.  WEFA relates that as economic growth softens, job gains will diminish.  It's their view that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates because there are sufficient signs of economic weakness to allow the Fed to postpone any decision until the evidence of inflationary pressure is overwhelming.  They note however that the risk of the Fed raising interest rates has increased since the economy is doing fairly well and labor markets continue to tighten. <p> 

WEFA predicts that productivity growth will improve over the next year, reducing the inflationary impact of wage gains.  They add that though wage and employment gains have become more robust recently, productivity increases will compensate for the higher wage costs, keeping inflation in check.<p>

They anticipate that labor force growth will improve.  WEFA estimates that this will take some of the pressure off of the labor market, keeping wage gains only slightly above the pace of inflation.<p>

WEFA expects gasoline prices to rise by 2 to 5 cents per gallon within the next month, as the impact of the collapse of the Iraqi oil-for-humanitarian-aid program filters through to the consumer market.  They feel that this is too small of a price change to affect consumers, or the economy, significantly. <p>

They note that real consumption expenditures were down in July and likely to drag down real Gross Domestic Product growth to close to 1.5 percent.  WEFA adds that vehicle sales have fallen off pretty much as expected and this explains a great deal of the decline in consumption.<p>

WEFA forecasts that exports are expected to grow by about 7 percent to 8 percent over the next couple of years.  They report that import growth continues to be surprisingly strong and will average about 6 percent growth.<p>

<h3>FAVORABLE  LABOR  MARKET  CONDITIONS</h3>

In a recent news release, the Illinois Department of Employment Security reported that Illinois' total employment exceeded 5.8 million for the first time in January and has maintained that record; the state's unemployment level has been below 5.5 percent for 21 straight months; and Illinois has been at or below the U.S. unemployment level for nearly three years.  They added that payroll expansion over the past year was paced by gains in trade (25,950), services (31,050) and manufacturing (10,500).<p>

Initial jobless claims in the state have continued at a higher rate however. In comparative months, new filings have risen for over a year with only a June decrease. Year-to-date jobless claims are ahead of last year's pace by 30,383 filings or 7.6 percent.<p>

Exports continued their positive growth,  but the pace has moderated from the strong double-digit expansion of the past three years.  Through the first six months of this year, shipments have reached $15.4 billion for an increase of 5.9 percent.  Both manufactured and nonmanufactured goods have posted increases, with the latter recording the largest percentage gain.  The strong demand for grain products and coal has boosted international shipments of nonagriculture products to 48.7 percent above last year's first half level.<p>

According to the Illinois Association of Realtors, the 1996 second quarter statewide median sales price of an existing home rose to $127,600.  This was higher than a year ago by $8,900 or 7.5 percent.  During the quarter, the number of homes sold totaled 27,160, nearly 3,000 more than last year's second quarter.  By locale, average prices ranged from $362,800 in the Barrington area to $153,100 in the Chicago metro market and $34,300 in the Kewanee area.<p>

The number of business failures in the state rose while the amount of losses decreased during the first seven months.  Dun & Bradstreet reported that 1,235 firms in Illinois ceased operations with financial losses to creditors so far this year, compared to 1,072 during the first seven months of 1995.  The size of the liabilities dropped sharply however, declining to $317 million from $455 million last year for a for a 30.3 percent year-to-date descent.<p>

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth registered 104.2 in August from 104.9 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that both retail sales and corporate profits in Illinois were lower last month than for August a year ago in real (inflation-adjusted) terms, while personal income rose.<p>

<hr>
<h3>LARGEST  EMPLOYERS  IN  ILLINOIS</h3>

The listing of the top employers within the state was derived from a variety of sources.  Both private and public data bases were utilized with the primary information provided by the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation.  Totals were cross checked where possible with data from Crain's Chicago Business, the Chicago Tribune and the Illinois Department of Employment Security.  The employment estimates are rounded to hundreds and also reflect the total of organizations with multiple locations in Illinois.  A top 15 listing of the largest employers in each county has also been prepared.<p>
  
<hr>
<h3>DRI/McGraw Hill - August - U.S. Economic Outlook - Forecast Overview</h3>

The forecasting firm relates that housing has remained surprisingly strong, despite the rise in mortgage rates.  DRI adds that the recent drop in new home sales suggests that the higher interest rates may be beginning to bite, but sales are still above year-ago levels.  They expect sales and housing starts to drop later this year.<p>

DRI finds that business investment slowed sharply in the second quarter.  They specify that a slowdown in computer sales was a major factor but note that other categories of business investment also softened.  DRI forecasts that computer sales will bounce back later this year.<p>

They relate that employment growth slowed in July but mention that the 193,000 new jobs are still above trend.  DRI feels that the rise in the unemployment rate to 5.4 percent was a correction from the excessive June drop and brings the rate back into the range it occupied for the previous 20 months.<p>

DRI reports that inflation remains calm.  They note that the acceleration in wages is offset by the slow growth of fringe benefit costs.  DRI adds that productivity has been weak during this business cycle.<p>

They relate that export growth weakened in the second quarter, while imports continued to surge.  DRI notes that the higher dollar has had little impact on trade but could keep exports sluggish later this year.  They add that the strong import growth and widening trade gap are caused by the strength of the U.S. economy relative to our trading partners.<p>

<h3>PERSONAL INCOME AND GSP POST QUARTERLY INCREASES</h3>

First quarter personal income in Illinois rose at a 5.9 percent annualized rate for its twelfth consecutive quarterly increase.  In current dollars this was a $4.3 billion gain over the previous quarter and a $13.5 billion improvement over a year ago.  Earnings in retail trade led the advance with a 10.6 percent annualized gain followed by construction with 7.9 percent and services at 6.2 percent.<p>

In a comparable report, Illinois' first quarter Gross State Product rose at a 3.1 percent annualized rate.  The chain-weighted constant dollar increase followed a relatively flat quarter and continued the sawtooth pattern of last year.  <p>

The Illinois Department of Employment Security reported that Illinois' labor force expanded to 6,158,917 in June to reach a new high.  Employment also continued at a high level topping 5.8 million for the sixth straight month.  IDES added that the unemployment rate has remained stable in the low range of 5.1 percent to 5.3 percent, reflecting the continued strength of the Illinois economy.<p>

Retail sales topped $9.27 billion in May for the largest non-December monthly total on record.  Despite the lofty level, receipts are up a modest 3.6 percent year-to-date.  Nationally, retail sales have increased 6.8 percent during the period.<p>

Construction activity in Illinois is up slightly for the year according to F. W. Dodge's report on contracts for future construction.  Through the first six months of the year, contracts are positive by 0.9 percent.  The mainstay has been residential construction which is above last year's pace by 17.4 percent.  Nonbuilding contracts (infrastructure improvements) also were up by 2.5 percent with nonresidential construction off 18.4 percent.<p>

New business incorporations in the state declined in June after three months of growth.  Domestic filings were off by 188 from the previous June, but the 18,931 year-to-date total  is ahead of last year's pace by 772 incorporations or 4.3 percent.<p>

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth rose slightly to 104.9 in July from 104.8 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that the Illinois economy grew moderately last month, reflecting the go-slow expansion of the national economy after four years of growth.  They added that both income and corporate profits in Illinois were strong in July but noted that they were somewhat offset by weak retail sales, as measured by sales-tax collections. <p>


<hr>
<h3>ILLINOIS  EXCELS  IN  MANUFACTURING - PART II</h3>

The previous edition of the Illinois Economic Bulletin listed the 35 industrial categories in which the state was the national leader.  This issue presents the 44 classifications in which Illinois placed second in value of shipments. It is notable that the amount of commercial printing is larger than the items rated number one.  The listing is in standard industrial classification order (not shown due to the limited space).<p>


<hr>
<h3>ILLINOIS  HIGHLIGHT</h3>

The 1996 Olympic theme song "Reach" recorded by Gloria Estefan was written by Chicago song writer Diane Warren, reportedly in one day.<p>


<hr>
<h3>WEFA - JULY - U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK - FORECAST OVERVIEW</h3>

WEFA predicts that employment growth will moderate in the second half of 1996 as housing activity weakens, vehicle sales slump, exports to Europe dampen and nonresidential construction falls.<p>

They forecast that the Fed will continue to hold the funds rate at 5.25 percent for the time being.  WEFA notes that employment growth has spooked the bond market, but expect that inflation is unlikely to accelerate.  They add that as further evidence of moderate inflation unfolds and signs of slower growth appear, bond prices will rise, lowering yields of long-term bonds.<p>

WEFA anticipates that consumer price inflation will remain close to 2.5 percent per year.  They estimate that as economic growth moderates, inflationary pressures will ease keeping inflation stable.<p>

They predict that export growth will remain close to 8 percent for the rest of the year and into 1997.  WEFA anticipates that import growth will moderate, but only slightly.  They add that it now looks unlikely that exports will boom sufficiently to add much to real GDP growth in the second half of 1996 and 1997.<p>

WEFA forecasts a tough and prolonged negotiation between the unions and management in the automobile industry this summer and fall.  They feel that the probability of a strike is high.<p>

<h3>NONFARM EMPLOYMENT SETS RECORD IN MAY</h3>

Nonagricultural jobs reached a new level in May, topping 5.7 million for the first time.  The preliminary monthly count was 96,600 above last year's May total with 43 percent of the growth occurring in services.  Business services alone added 14,400 jobs (6,900 in personnel supply) with health services expanding by 6,900.  Employment in retail trade grew by 19,500, of which 8,800 jobs were in eating and drinking places.  Manufacturing also added 11,100 jobs over the year, with government employment increasing by 9,300.<p>
        
Retail sales totaled $8.5 billion in April to set a new high for the month.  Data from the U.S. Department of Commerce indicates that March's receipts topped last year's total by $178 million.  The unusual weather pattern this year has produced a sawtooth type movement in retail sales in the state, but year-to-date receipts are above last year by 3.4 percent after sales averaged 3 percent in 1995.<p>

The U.S. Department of Commerce also recently released metropolitan area economic projections which predict that the Chicago area will have the nation's largest increase in jobs by the year 2005.  Issued by Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, the forecast estimates that the Chicago metropolitan area will add 763,00 jobs between 1993 and 2005.  They also project that the area's population will grow by 716,000 during this period to 8,328,000 residents.<p>    

CB Commercial Real Estate Group reported that their industrial vacancy index for Chicago registered 6.3 percent in the first quarter, up from 6.1 percent the previous quarter, but down from the 8 percent of a year ago.  Their commercial office vacancy index for the Chicago metropolitan area also declined to 14.8 percent from 15.2 percent in the fourth quarter as both indexes moved to within one percent of the national averages.<p>    

According to the Illinois Association of Realtors, the median sale price of an existing single family home rose 6.8 percent in the first quarter over the cost of a year ago.  The statewide average reached $120,300 with the quarterly amount for the Chicago metro area increasing to $146,500.  The association added that there was a 1.3 percent gain in the number of units sold year-to-date.  They also noted that interest rates were edging up, but related that their national office predicts that rates would begin to stabilize, resulting in strong sales in 1996.  <p>

The U.S. Bankruptcy Courts reported that filings by Illinois businesses were up 5.1 percent in the first quarter.  Their three district courts in the state posted 434 quarterly cases compared to 413 last year and 471 two years ago.  While the business filings in Illinois rose at a moderate pace, non-business cases were more pronounced.  With a change in the bankruptcy code last year, non-business filings in the state increased to 12,219 in the first quarter from 9,411 a year ago.<p>

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth registered 104.8 in June down from 105.1 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that the state's economy will continue to grow moderately without pushing up inflation.  They also related that both personal income and corporate profits in Illinois were strong in June, but they were offset by anemic sales of retail goods.<p>  

<hr>
<h3>ILLINOIS  EXCELS  IN  MANUFACTURING</h3>

From cookies and candy to construction machinery and basic nuts and bolts, the state is the national production leader in 35 industrial categories.  In Illinois, manufacturing accounts for about 19.2 percent of its Gross State Product with an estimated value of $66 billion.  Its historical strength provides an important component to the state's diverse economy.<p>

<hr>
<h3>DRI/MCGRAW-HILL - JUNE  U.S.  ECONOMIC  OUTLOOK - FORECAST  OVERVIEW</h3>

DRI/McGraw-Hill states that the 1995 economic stall has ended.  They estimate that the economy is now in a growth  mode and has already reached full employment.  DRI forecasts that inflation is edging up, and feel that the Fed needs to respond with higher interest rates.<p> 
  
They expect housing starts in the second quarter to be strong.  DRI notes that consumer confidence is high and mortgage rates are still moderate.  They think that this year could match the 1994 peak in housing starts.<p>

The forecasting firm predicts that state and local governments will remain under serious budget constraints because of lower grants in aid and increased growth of the school age population.  They anticipate mild increases in state and local spending but note that the pressure for lower taxes will restrain spending growth.<p>

DRI predicts that foreign trade is likely to improve in 1996, in part because of the recovery in the Mexican and Japanese economies.  They note that the recessions in these two countries were major factors in restraining export growth in 1995.  DRI adds  that the European economies look less robust, but also seem likely to have a better 1996 than 1995.<p>

<h3>NEW BUSINESS INCORPORATIONS SET MONTHLY RECORD</h3>

Entrepreneurial optimism abounded in April with a record setting 3,770 domestic business filings.  The large monthly total topped the previous high set in December, 1992 by 280 incorporations.  April's surge added to March's substantial filings, increasing the year-to-date total to 7.6 percent above a year ago.  In the first four months, new business incorporations have risen by 910 filings over last year's growth.<p>

Following a lackluster March, the U.S. Department of Commerce reported that residential building in the state rebounded in April.  Their numbers indicate that  housing starts rose to a near record 5,418 units authorized for construction during the month.  A relatively drier April  allowed building activity to progress more rapidly with year-to-date permit issuance above last year's level by 12.2 percent.<p> 
  
The Chicago all urban consumer price index rose 2.2 percent in April from last year's level as overall costs moderated.  The major upward push in prices occurred in energy, led by natural gas and followed by motor fuel cost increases.  Offsetting the rise were subdued medical care costs and a decline in apparel and upkeep.  Without energy costs,  the index would have risen only 1.6 percent in April.<p>

The Department of Employment Security reported that after setting a new record in January, total employment in the state remained above 5.8 million for the fourth consecutive month.  IDES added that the unemployment rate at 5.1 percent in April experienced little change since the previous month and has remained below the U.S. level for 30 straight months.<p>

Employment in manufacturing was up by 12,800 in April over the previous year with growth occurring primarily in durable goods.  Approximately 9,500 jobs were added in the production of industrial machinery with the manufacture of electronic equipment expanding by 3,300 workers.  Nationally, there has been a sharp decline in manufacturing employment over the past year.<p>

An economic forecasting firm, Regional Financial Associates, related that the Chicago-metro area trails only the San Jose and Boston areas in the number of high-tech manufacturing jobs with nearly 163,000.  RFA added that the Chicago area is enjoying steadily increasing high-tech employment led by the Motorola and U.S. Robotics (modems) expansions.<p>  

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth registered 105.1 in May from 106.1 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that evidence grows the Illinois economy is slowing to a more moderate pace after two years of rapid expansion.<p>

<h3>ILLINOISANS  INCREASE  PERSONAL INCOME IN 1995</h3>

Per capita personal income rose $1,156 last year reaching an average of $24,763 for each state resident in 1995.  The 4.9 percent increase moved the state to eighth place from ninth the previous year.  Illinois was the only state in the Midwest to appear in the top 10, with eastern states heading the listing.<p>  

Illinois also placed highly in total personal income with its $293 billion overall amount, ranking fifth among the states.  The 5.6 percent growth in 1995 was slightly below the 6 percent national increase, as farm income declined last year.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS HIGHPOINTS</h3>

  At an estimated $350 billion in 1995, Illinois' gross state product ( GSP ) is fourth among the states.  Compared to other nations' gross national products ( GNP ), Illinois' GSP is larger than all but 12 worldwide. <p> 

  Illinois placed fifth with $32.6 billion in exports last year, and its 23.6 percent annual increase was the largest among the top 10 exporting states.<p>

  Researchers at the University of Illinois recently announced that they have developed a new computer chip which runs faster, and last up to 50 times longer.  The chip making process replaces regular hydrogen with deuterium, resulting in a chip which can handle more electricity, while adding only a small amount to the cost.<p>    

<hr>
<h3>WEFA - MAY U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK - FORECAST OVERVIEW</h3>

  WEFA predicts that the economy's surprisingly strong performance will be sustained for an additional quarter.  They forecast that by the second half of the year, growth will slow to the 2 percent range.  WEFA anticipates that the Federal Reserve will respond by the end of the year with an additional reduction in the Fed Funds rate, because inflation will remain under control.<p>
    
  The forecasting firm notes that the pickup in oil and grain prices cannot create inflation without sufficiently tight labor markets. They add that the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment cost index indicates that wage inflation remains moderate.<p>

  WEFA reports that business investment in equipment will decelerate from its very fast pace since capacity is less imperative at this time.  They anticipate that investment in structures will grow modestly, as businesses build industrial plant and commercial structures in response to low vacancy rates.<p>    

  They predict that the impact of 1995's drop in mortgage rates on the housing market is over.  They add that for the rest of 1996, mortgage rates are likely to drift downward, sustaining housing starts at close to 1.4 million units.<p>

  WEFA relates that despite a poor trade performance in the first quarter, U.S. exports remain competitive.  They forecast that the recovery in Mexico and Japan will allow U.S. exports to maintain high expansion rates, even without strong growth in Europe.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS' ECONOMIC GROWTH OUTPACES THE NATIONAL RATE</h3>

The value of the goods and services produced in the state during 1995 totaled $350 billion for a $16.4 billion gain over the previous year.  In chain-weighted constant dollars the Illinois GSP rose to $325 billion for a 2.4 percent annual increase.  Last year's advance topped the 2.0 percent national GNP rate, marking the third time out of the past four years that the state's economy has exceeded the U.S. growth level.<p>   

The U.S. Department of Commerce reported that total personal income in Illinois rose 5.6 percent in 1995.  On a per capita basis, income reached $24,763 from $23,607 the previous year moving the state to eighth in the nation from ninth in 1994.  By major category, income growth was led by a 8.7 percent increase in services along with a 6.8 percent advance in transportation, communications and public utilities.  The overall growth was partially muted by a noticeable reduction in farm income last year.<p>         

The Illinois Department of Agriculture in its April 1 release estimated that the corn crop acreage will increase 14 percent this year to 11.6 million acres.  They cite the current high prices, low supply and anticipated reduction in the Government Feed Grain Program set-aside acreage to zero.  IDA estimates that soybean planting intentions are 9.75 million acres and equal to last year's record level.  They noted that the supply of all major grain in the state is presently down from the stock of a year earlier.<p>  

Exports in February increased 5.6 percent over last year for a gain of nearly $130 million.  The $2.46 billion monthly total was the sixth largest ever despite record cold weather in early February.  The shipment of nonmanufactured commodities (grain, coal, etc.) aided the growth and accounted for $43 million of the monthly increase.  Last year, overall exports exceeded the previous year by 24.5 percent with manufactured products accounting for 90.7 percent of the state's international shipments.<p> 

According to the March report by F.W. Dodge, contracts for future construction in Illinois are up 8.7 percent for the year.  Their three month total of $2,370 million for the state is comparable to the record pace of two years ago.  Nonbuilding (infrastructure improvements) contracts led the quarterly increase with a 16.8 percent gain, followed by residential with 8.3 percent growth and nonresidential building which rose 1.4 percent.<p>          

After a sluggish start in January, retail sales rebounded in February registering $7.8 billion.  The robust monthly increase was $612 million above the previous February for a 8.6 percent gain.  This boosted the year-to-date total to 5.5 percent above the first two months of a year ago continuing the upward trend of the past two years.<p>   

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth registered 106.1 in April from a revised 106.3 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that the personal income and retail sales sectors of the Illinois economy were relatively strong in April while corporate profits were down from their recent high rate of growth.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS HIGHPOINTS</h3>

  Once again Illinois cities placed high in the National Association of Home Builders fourth quarter 1995 list of affordable housing markets.  Among 192 metropolitan areas Champaign-Urbana ranked 6th, Springfield 13th, Peoria 24th, Rockford 26th and Chicago 129th.<p>

  In 1995, Illinois' 1.13 billion-bushel corn yield ranked second nationally, with its 373 million-bushel soybean crop also placing second and its 68 million bushels of winter wheat output ranked eighth. <p>

  Three Illinois events were selected by the American Bus Association for inclusion in the 1996 Top 100 Events in North America: the Oldsmobile Balloon Classic, Danville, June 7-9; Big River Rendezvous, Moline and Rock Island, October 10-13; and Splendor & Majesty, Rockford, December 6-8.<p>


<hr>
<h3>DRI/McGRAW-HILL -- APRIL U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK - FORECAST OVERVIEW</h3>

  DRI/McGraw-Hill estimates that the economy is heating up.  They predict that the first quarter will be weak, and that spring and summer look stronger than previously expected.  They add that the unemployment rate, at 5.6 percent, is as low as the Federal Reserve is likely to permit, suggesting that the loosening is over for the year.  DRI projects that after a second-quarter rebound, economic growth should stabilize near its trend level of 2.1 percent.  They predict that the Fed will have to tighten by mid-1997. <p>

  The forecasting firm notes that consumer spending, led by automotive sales, has rebounded.  They anticipate that spending will be slower in 1996 than in the past two years, but will keep up with incomes and the Gross Domestic Product.<p>        

  DRI expects housing sales to drop back in response to the recent jump in mortgage rates.  They add that office and motel construction are finally rebounding, while retail and industrial space have accelerated.  They forecast that this trend will continue through 1996.<p>

  They relate that inventories were accumulated even more slowly than estimated in the fourth quarter.  DRI estimates that the level of inventory is still too high, but the General Motors strike reduced much of the excess in the first quarter.  They add that overall, inventories are expected to be less of a drag on the economy in 1996 than in 1995.<p>   

  DRI notes that inflation remains low, in large part because of the sharp slowdown in the growth of fringe benefit costs.  They expect consumer price inflation to accelerate slightly but to remain below 3 percent.<p>

<h3>RECORD RETAIL SALES IN STATE LAST YEAR</h3>

The U.S. Department of Commerce reported that retail receipts in the state exceeded $104.5 billion in 1995 to top the previous year by 4.7 percent.  A preliminary $11 billion December boosted last year's record level as the rate of growth held relatively stable throughout the year.  Sales were particularly expansive in Chicago where they increased 7.4 percent, reaching $15 billion in 1995.<p>

Despite a colder than normal winter, residential building permits in the state are off to their best start in six years.  Through February there were 4,903 construction authorizations issued compared to 4,545 permits a year ago.  The 7.9 percent year-to-date increase continues the slow upward building trend that began last summer when interest rates were reduced.  <p>

The U.S. Department of Labor reported that the Chicago All Urban Consumer Price Index for February rose a modest 1.9 percent from the rate of a year ago.  The news release indicated that medical care costs led the 12 month increase, rising a subdued 2.8 percent.  It was followed by housing expenses and transportation costs that both increased 2.6 percent.  Partially offsetting these categories was apparel and upkeep which declined 2.9 percent during the period.<p>

According to the Illinois Department of Employment Security the state posted record employment for the second consecutive month, reaching 5,829,743 in February.  IDES added that the number of people unemployed in the state dropped 15,483 over the month, from 330,359 to 314,876.  They noted that Illinois' economy demonstrated vigorous growth, adding 121,300 non-farm payroll jobs compared to February 1995 for a 2.2 percent increase.<p>       

In another labor market indicator, initial jobless claims have increased by 28,982 year-to-date.  IDES's data indicates that the upward rate of growth has tapered off and is similar to the 1993 level. During January there were 94,493 first-time filings and 64,020 initial claims in February, which is 22.4 percent above last year's rate.<p>

A recent report by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts listed 1,624 business bankruptcy cases in the state last year.  This was 127 less than the 1994 filings for a 7.3 percent decrease.  Business bankruptcies in Illinois have trended downward the past four years as the overall economy has improved.  Nonbusiness filings also were declining until last year when they increased 13.8 percent, totaling 41,147 in 1995.<p>  

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth registered 106.1 in March from 107.1 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that after a diminished economic performance in March, the Illinois economy may experience slightly slower growth.  They noted that any reading above 100 indicates future growth of the state's economy.  They added that the current reading suggests a continuation of expansion, although probably at a more moderate rate.<p>

<h3>CHICAGO METRO AREA # 1 IN 1995 NEW/EXPANDED FACILITIES</h3>

Site Selection magazine reported that "Chicago's on a tear, racking up the highest count of new facilities and expansions during 1995 than any other U.S. metro area," in their annual tally of corporate projects.  The city was described as "the runaway winner among all U.S. metros" with 265 new and expanded facilities last year.  Chicago attracted 101 new manufacturing plants in 1995 lead by the Chicago Recycling Corporation's $250 million facility.  Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Illinois also added to the growth with its new $200 million headquarters.<p>

The large Chicago metro total boosted Illinois' ranking to fifth among the states with 451 new corporate facilities and expansions last year.  It also placed fourth with 142 new manufacturing plants in the state during 1995.  The magazine noted the significance of Illinois' new tort reform measures in attracting businesses.  It also included reference to the state's skilled workforce, central location, highly developed infrastructure (world's busiest airport, etc.) and advanced information technologies.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS HIGHPOINTS</h3>
<ul type=square>
<li>O'Hare International Airport in Chicago retained its top world ranking last year by providing service to 67.2 million passengers.  Nearby Lambert Field in St. Louis with 25.7 million travelers placed second internationally for major airport growth with an increase of 10.1 percent.<p>  
<li>Several Illinois universities received a top rating by U.S. News & World Report in their annual educational institutions rankings.  Within the classification of reputation rank by academics" Northwestern University and the University of Chicago received a number one rating (tying for the highest position with several other schools) for their Graduate Schools of Business.  The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign attained top rankings for its graduate programs in Advertising, Civil Engineering and Library Science.<p>  
<li>A recent edition of Technology Industry Growth Forecaster indicated that Chicago, Oak Brook and St. Charles were among the top 30 cities nationally for telecommunications equipment and services jobs.<p>

<h3>WEFA - MARCH U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK - FORECAST OVERVIEW</h3>
<ul type=square>
<li>WEFA expects real Gross Domestic Product growth will pick up speed in future quarters   after a two-quarter slowdown.  They estimate that GDP growth will average a little over 2 percent per year from 1995 through 1998.  WEFA adds that most areas of the economy are   weak, with the exceptions of services, business investment and exports.<p>
<li>They project that service employment, demand and wage growth will help steady economic  gains in the future.  WEFA also expects construction employment will rise due to increases in public and nonresidential construction activity.<p>
<li>WEFA forecasts that wages in most service sectors will continue growing more rapidly than manufacturing wages.  They note that international competition will keep costs, including labor costs, down in the manufacturing sector.  WEFA feels that the rising demand for services will continue to push up wages in the services industries.<p>
<li>They predict that business investment in equipment and structures will continue growing more rapidly than the overall economy.  They anticipate equipment spending will expand at a 5 percent pace in 1996 with investments in nonresidential structures increasing about 4 percent.<p>
<li>WEFA estimates that the federal deficit will fall modestly in 1996 as government purchases are down due to the continuing resolutions and the lack of a budget agreement.  They project that government health care costs will rise at a 7 percent to 8 percent rate over the next 10 years.  WEFA also predicts that federal revenue growth will keep pace with income growth.<p>
<li>They forecast that the impact of lower mortgage rates on the housing market is mostly over.  WEFA predicts that a modest decline in mortgage rates and an improvement in employment growth in 1996 will stabilize housing starts at a 1.40 million unit annual rate.<p>
<li>WEFA expects the nation's exports to record robust gains in 1996, led by competitive sectors such as capital goods and industrial supplies.  They anticipate that net exports will add a 0.4 percentage point to the GNP growth in 1996, after subtracting a 0.1 percentage point in 1995.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS EXPORTS TOP PREVIOUS YEAR'S TOTAL</h3>

Illinois' exports continued their strong growth with over $2.6 billion in direct shipments during November.  The monthly total was the third largest on record, led by manufactured goods that posted their 12th consecutive $2 billion plus month. In just ten months the state's international shipments exceeded the 1994 total and are ahead by 26.4 percent on a year-to-date comparison. The favorable exchange rate and competitive products aided in maintaining the high level of exports. The annual growth rate of shipments from Illinois is nearly double the national rate of increase.<p>

In late February, the U.S. Department of Commerce reported that Illinois' third quarter personal income grew at a 4.8 percent annualized rate for its tenth consecutive quarterly increase.  In current dollars this was a $17.1 billion gain from a year ago and a 6.1 percent increase during this period.  Among the major industrial categories, services led the 12 month advance with an increase of 8.2 percent followed by the wholesale trade with 6.4 percent and finance, insurance and real estate at 5.2 percent.  At the other end of growth, mining posted a 1.2 percent gain as all industrial classifications registered quarterly increases.<p>

The Illinois Department of Employment Security reported that their non-farm payroll survey in January indicated a 140,000 job increase over the monthly level of a year ago. IDES added that the classifications with large gains included 20,400 in business services (which contains personnel supply), 19,000 in manufacturing (4,000 in electronics and 2,900 in fabricated metals), 18,200 in retail trade (13,000 in eating and drinking establishments), 10,800 in engineering and management, 9,900 in wholesale trade, 8,800 in health services, and 7,500 in trucking and warehousing.<p>

After a record year in 1994, contracts for future construction decreased 3.7 percent last year.  The $11.6 billion in 1995 was the state's second highest total, after the previous year's $12 billion.  Last year's amount will likely be revised slightly upward as contracts are expanded and building estimates are exceeded.  The interest rate sensitive construction industry began the year very sluggishly and improved as the rates declined.  The nonbuilding (infrastructure improvements) category dropped the most at 13 percent followed by residential with a 11.3 percent decrease.  Nonresidential construction was positive with a strong 14 percent gain as available industrial space became more in demand.<p>

The Illinois Association of Realtors reported that the median sale price of an existing single-family home in the state last year was $120,500.  This is up more than $5,000 over the 1994 price of $115,300 for a 4.5 percent increase.  Residential prices in the Chicago metropolitan area rose to $146,200 in 1995, topping the previous year by 2.1 percent.  The number of existing home sales in Illinois decreased by 1.1 percent however, after a sluggish start in the first two quarters.  Sales rebounded in the second half of 1995 as lower mortgage rates boosted purchases.<p>
  
The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth registered 107.1 in February from 106.5 the previous month.  Its compilers noted that all three components of the Index - personal income, corporate profits and retail sales - showed significant growth in February over results for February 1995.<p>

<h3>AFRICAN AMERICAN-OWNED AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES IN ILLINOIS</h3>

The U.S. Department of Commerce recently released two summary reports that provided highlights of forthcoming expanded releases titled 1992 Black-Owned Businesses and 1992 Women-Owned Businesses.  The data in both reports were collected  from a large sample of all non-farm businesses filing tax forms that showed receipts of $500 or more in 1992.   Both releases indicated that the Illinois firms were close to or exceeded the national averages as to the percentage growth in the number of firms and their sales and receipts increases.<p>

The 1992 Black-Owned Businesses release indicates that African American firms in Illinois have increased 49.6 percent since 1987 compared to a 46.4 percent rate for the nation.  During this  period, all U.S. businesses grew at a 26 percent rate and increased their revenue by 67 percent.   African American firms in Illinois improved their sales and receipts by 61.2 percent, while nationally the rate was 62.9 percent for black-owned businesses.<p>

Women-owned businesses were described in the report as being substantial and growing contributors to the nation's economy as they represent one-third of all U.S. firms.  In Illinois, their number has risen by 41.5 percent compared to a 43.1 percent gain for the nation's women-owned businesses.  Sales and receipts in particular have grown rapidly with a five year gain of 139.8 percent in Illinois and a 131 percent increase nationally.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS HIGHPOINTS</h3>

  The Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are the world's two largest futures exchanges.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange is the world's largest stock options exchange.  Together, they handle over one-third of the world's futures and options trades.<p>

  As the U.S. government expands its on-line procurement system, which presently purchases standardized items, it is using Illinois' Great Lakes Naval Base as a national test site for the electronic purchase of repair and maintenance services. 
  The number of farms in Illinois stabilized at 77,000 last year while continuing to average 365 acres in size.  This is the second time in 50 years that a decrease in the number of farms has not occurred.<p>

<h3>DRI/McGraw-Hill - - FEBRUARY U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK - FORECAST OVERVIEW</h3>

  DRI is projecting that the 1996 U.S. Gross Domestic Product will be near 2 percent based upon the new chain-weighted methodology.  They forecast stronger GDP growth in 1997 and 1998 and add that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut the funds rate at least two more times until the economy accelerates this summer.<p>

  They also report that consumer spending slowed sharply during the Christmas season.  DRI adds that high debt levels may be inducing consumers to pull back on spending, and the bad weather is certainly encouraging them to stay home.  They expect more caution on the part of consumers but no major retrenchment.<p>

  DRI relates that inventories jumped in the fourth quarter because of weak retail sales and high car production.  They anticipate a slow and steady destocking in 1996.<p>

  They add that residential construction has not continued its autumn rebound, despite lower mortgage rates.  DRI notes that even in parts of the country not afflicted by blizzards, home sales have been disappointing.  They expect sales to remain stable, but feel that the hoped-for rebound seems less likely.<p>

   DRI reports that nonresidential construction remains strong.  They mention that office construction has stopped declining, while retail and industrial space has accelerated.  They forecast that this trend will continue through 1996. <p>

  They also mention that federal spending will drop off, even without an overall budget agreement.  DRI expects the government will muddle through fiscal 1996 with no reconciliation bill but no further shutdowns.  They add that departments will operate on continuing resolutions until their individual budgets are passed, which will imply lower discretionary spending.<p>

  DRI relates that inflation remains low.  They note that this past year will be the fifth consecutive year of below 3 percent inflation in the consumer price index.  They add that it's the first time there has been five back-to-back years below 3 percent in 30 years.<p>

  They report that employment dropped sharply in January.  DRI feels that the decline was a fluke caused by the blizzard and the federal shutdown, which may have distorted the employment survey.<p>

<HR>
<H3>STRONG ECONOMIC YEAR FOR STATE IN 1995</H3>

Available information indicates that last year provided substantial economic growth in Illinois.  The recent federal government shutdowns have slowed the flow of data, but early reports confirm that 1995 was a prosperous year.  The following provides brief summaries of the employment gains and notes business growth in the state.<P>  

The Illinois Department of Employment Security reported that the state's 5.2 percent average unemployment rate in 1995 was the lowest in 21 years.  Additionally, its 5.7 percent seasonally adjusted December unemployment rate was lower than any of the five more populous states.  IDES also noted that the 12-month average of 5,780,000 employed persons last year was the highest number on record in Illinois.<P>
 
Illinois' exports continued their robust growth in the third quarter with nearly $8 billion in international shipments.  Electronic and electric equipment such as communication devices, generators and controls led the advance with a 45.6 percent year-to-date increase. The only  classification to decrease was oil and gas extraction with the export of these commodities to Mexico and Canada declining.  Several Asian countries posted strong growth with China (Mainland) and Korea each accounting for over $1 billion of the state's shipments.<P>

Despite sluggish November and December new business filings, the 34,495 domestic incorporations in 1995 set a record.  For the year, total filings were up by 208 for a slight 0.6 percent annual gain.  This was the smallest increase since the -0.7 percent decline in 1991 but the fourth consecutive yearly advance.   <P>

Noted regional economist Diane Swonk of First Chicago NBD Corporation reports that the five state Great Lakes region (which includes Illinois) is starting the year on a much better footing than other areas of the country.  She relates that comparatively, real wages are growing (albeit modestly); debt is less of a problem; consumers are more confident; and, homes are still appreciating.  She adds that these trends are likely to continue in 1996.<P>

According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the percent of total past due loans in Illinois was up slightly to 4.20 percent in the third quarter from 3.88 percent a year ago.  Those in foreclosure had decreased however, declining to 0.70 percent from 0.80 percent a year ago. Nationally the comparable third quarter mortgage delinquency rate was 4.38 percent.<P>

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth registered 106.5 in January from 107 the previous month.  Its compilers noted that the decline in the Index does not indicate a significant downturn in the Illinois economy.  Rather, they add, it indicates a modest slowing of the state's growth rate, similar to what has been registered by many forecasts of the U.S. economy.<P>

<H3>1995 EMPLOYMENT IN MAJOR ILLINOIS INDUSTRIES</H3>

Restaurants and fast-food establishments continue to provide employment for a large number of workers in the state.  These eating places also added a sizeable number of jobs last year with an additional 11,100 workers.  Other large classifications with noticeable gains were help (personnel) supply services with 10,800 and elementary and secondary schools with 10,200.  The fast movers, percentage-wise, were: miscellaneous business services, gaining 15.6 percent; personnel supply with a 13.3 percent growth; and department stores which added 5.8 percent more workers.<P>   

While the number of overall jobs rose last year, several large industries posted decreases due to mergers, cost-cutting and technological advances in the marketplace.  National commercial banks and trusts employment declined by 2,500, with hospitals shedding 1,600 jobs and telephone communications reducing their payrolls by 800. <P>

<H3>ILLINOIS HIGHPOINTS</H3>

 A recent edition of The Kiplinger Washington Letter forecasts that Illinois was one of the 10 best states for job seekers.  It also cited a need for more factory workers around the Great Lakes area and noted that experienced computer experts are in demand just about everywhere. <P>

 Ameritech and Motorola have been jointly testing their Integrated Services Digital Network in Champaign County.  The system uses a modem-like device that allows public subscribers to send and receive computer data (including Internet access), video or voice messages over a standard telephone line about nine times faster than conventional modems.<P>  

 Chicago and the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs were joint recipients of a $450,000 grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Commerce to 10 entities nationwide.  The grant will fund export development assistance to small-medium size firms that vary from new-to-export to export-ready companies. <P>

<HR>
<H3>THE WEFA GROUP - JANUARY U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK - FORECAST OVERVIEW</H3>

 WEFA expects growth to be modest in the first quarter of 1996.  They predict that the longer the budget impasse continues, the more likely growth will be closer to 1 percent rather than their current forecast of about 2 percent.<P>

 They estimate that the 30-year Treasury bond will remain close to 6 percent in 1996 and the Federal Reserve will continue cutting the Fed funds rate.  They expect the funds rate to be cut from its present level of 5.5 percent to 4.75 percent by mid-year.<P> 

 WEFA anticipates that recessionary pressures will ease as the Federal Reserve lowers    short-term interest rates and output improves after the resolution of the budget impasse.  They note that their Recession Barometer tends to rise above 1.0 about 12 months prior to the onset of a downturn.  They report that it currently reads 0.85 indicating that the probability of a recession is only about 25 percent in 1996. <P>

 WEFA adds that over the past 12 presidential elections, real disposable income growth above 3 percent (WEFA forecasts 0.7 percent for 1996) has resulted in a win by the incumbent party.  They also note that a Gallup Presidential Job Approval rating above 50 percent usually results in a win by the incumbent party, unless the economy is very weak, as it was in 1960. <P>

 They expect export growth to continue to be robust in 1996 as the weak dollar and high quality of U.S. goods bolster demand for American products in foreign markets.  WEFA notes that shipments to the weak Mexican market are being offset by exports to Japan and Germany.  They also predict that import growth will slow down as U.S. growth decelerates.<P>

<a name="Introduction"><hr></a>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

In this issue of The Grant Manager we will be discussing a number of topics pertinent to administration of your CDAP grants.  Every day, our grants managers respond to questions from potential grant applicants as well as experienced grantees.  Constant communication is one of the important aspects of good grant administration.  Grantees and grant administrators should always be aware that the CDAP staff are here to assist and will make every attempt to ensure your ideas are discussed and your questions answered.<p>

Most of the information included in this issue comes from communication grants managers have had with grantees.  The Question and Answer section has been expanded to cover a variety of questions which might arise during the administration of your grant.  To some of you "veterans" a few of the questions may seem simple and unnecessary.  But to many of the new grantees even the smallest problem can be overwhelming.  We hope you find this information useful.<p>

For those of you who are receiving The Grant Manager for the first time, this newsletter is being prepared to assist grantees, administrators, consultants and others who administer CDAP grants.  This is your newsletter and we welcome your questions and comments.  We want to keep an open dialogue of information and knowledge between you and the CDAP staff.  Readers who would like to submit questions for the "Q & A" section or have topics they would like to see discussed in future articles, should submit their written topics or questions to their CDAP Grants Manager.  We will make every attempt to include your information or answer your questions in future newsletters.<p>

The Grant Manager is published twice a year by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, 620 East Adams Street, Springfield, Illinois 62701.  Telephone 217/785-6142.  Fax 217/782-1206.  TDD 800/785-6055.  Internet http://www.ilcommerce.com<p>

Topics to be covered and questions should be submitted in writing and are subject to editing.<p>

<a name="Federal Prevailing Wage Requirements"><hr></a>
<h3>FEDERAL PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS</h3>

When CDAP funds are used in whole, or in part, for construction, federal prevailing wages must be paid.  The Davis-Bacon Prevailing Wage Act requires that all laborers and mechanics employed on any federally-assisted construction project must be paid wages that are prevailing in their labor market for the corresponding classes of workers as determined by the U.S. Secretary of Labor.  Sometimes CDAP grantees confuse federal prevailing wages with Illinois prevailing wages, which are provided by the Illinois Department of Labor.  They are not the same. The only way to receive the correct wage scales for your CDAP construction project is to submit a CDAP WAGE RATE DETERMINATION REQUEST form to DCCA.  A copy of this form can be found in Chapter 2, Section 3 of the CDAP Grants Management Handbook (June 1995).  Questions regarding prevailing wages should be directed to Bill Rhodes at 217/785-6132, TDD 800/785-6055.<p>


<a name="Questions & Answers"><hr></a>
<h3>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h3>

Often you may feel there are no answers available to questions that develop in administering your grant.  The answer may not be found in the Grants Management Handbook because the question or problem is a "unique" situation that requires more definition or clarification.  This section of The Grant Manager will be devoted to questions from you, the grantees, and answers from the CDAP staff.  We will also include common concerns encountered by grants managers during their site visits.  In each newsletter we will answer your questions and share your comments with other grantees who may have experienced similar problems.<p>


<h4>ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS</h4>

Q.   What is the purpose of the Environmental Status Checklist? <p>

A.    The Environmental Status Checklist (ESC) takes the place of the former finding letters that were approximately two pages long and explained the environmental finding of your project.  In an effort to streamline the environmental process, we developed this form as a type of checklist to help administrators and local officials send the correct information with their environmental packets.  The grantee should place a checkmark next to the finding (exempt, categorically excluded, or environmental assessment) and then fill in the regulations from the Federal Register used to support the environmental finding.  Next, the grantee should look under the space provided for the regulation for a checklist of other items that should be sent in cooperation with the environmental status checklist.  This form should be signed and dated by the chief elected official AFTER the local comment period has expired if a publication was deemed necessary for the project.<p>


<h4>PUBLIC FACILITIES</h4>

Q.   If the resident occupying the household is renting, should you submit the household income of the resident living in the household or the owner of the property?<p>

A.  You should provide the renter's household income.<p>

Q.  Where can a community get funds for a fire truck?<p>

A.  The Illinois Rural Bond Bank at 217/524-2663, or Rural Development at 217/398-5412 (formerly FmHA) through the Community Loan Program, might be able to help with loan funds.<p>


<h4>ADMINISTRATION</h4>

Q.  Is increased fidelity bonding an eligible expense for CDAP funded projects?<p>

A.  Yes.  It must be charged to administrative costs.<p>


<h4>FINANCIAL CLOSE-OUT PACKAGE</h4>

Q.   When completing the "Analysis of Benefit to Low and Moderate Income Persons" page in the close-out package, should we also include the administration costs as well as the construction costs?<p>

A.   Yes.  Column "A" should identify each activity including administration.  Column "E" should identify the costs allocated for each activity including administration.  The total of all (which is the total amount of the grant) should reflect figures in Column "E".<p>


<h4>HOUSING/ADMINISTRATION</h4>

Q.   What rehabilitation standards are required under the CDAP housing grant?<p>

A.   Your application submitted for funding should have stated any local building codes which have been adopted.  If not, the Illinois State Plumbing Code, National Electrical Code (NEC) and HUD Housing Quality Standards (HQS) must be met at a minimum.  DCCA sponsored housing conferences have suggested the Council of American Building Officials (CABO) One and Two Family Dwelling Code, but this is not required.<p>

Q.   Can funds from two separate grants be used to rehabilitate a single home or housing unit (split funding)? <p>

A.  No.  All funds drawn on a grant must be expended during the grant period and prior to submittal of  the financial close-out.  Any funds not expended cannot be "carried over" to be used with another year's grant funding.  These funds must be returned to DCCA and reported as such in the financial close-out and Grantee Evaluation Report (GER).<p>


<h4>LABOR STANDARDS</h4>

Q.  How is a bona-fide self-employed contractor to be determined/documented?<p>

A.  A bona-fide self-employed contractor is a contractor who has no other employees and whose business can be documented by at least one of the following:<p>

     1)   A Federal Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (FEIN).<p>

     2)   A certificate of registration or license issued by the state.<p>

     3)   A listing in the business advertising section of the telephone directory.<p>

     4)   A business advertisement published in a newspaper of  general circulation in the area of the business' address.<p>

     5)   A legal notice of an assumed business name published in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of  the business' address.<p>

Q.  What constitutes Force Account Labor?<p>

A.   Force account labor is work performed on a project by the regular employees (mechanics and/or laborers) of a unit of local general government as a part of the employee's normal work duties.<p>

Q.   Can a private company use force account labor and not pay federal prevailing wages?<p>

A.   No.   Only a unit of  local government using force account labor does not pay federal prevailing wages.  All others must pay federal prevailing wages.<p>

Q.  When monitoring federal prevailing wages, if the contractor's computerized payrolls do not show fringe benefits, can we accept the "Statement of Compliance" form if checked (4a) where fringe benefits are paid to approved plans, funds or programs?<p>

A.  Yes.<p>

Q.  How often must employee interviews be completed?<p>

A.  The grantee must conduct employee interviews with a member of each craft at least once per month.  Interviews must be conducted to assure that the payroll information is consistent with the wage rate determination and that the employees are working in their proper job classifications.<p>

Q.  If there is no contract awarded on a project, when should the wage decision be requested?<p>

A.  If no contract is awarded on a project (for instance when the grantee acts as its own contractor), the wage decision published and in effect 10 days prior to the start of construction will apply.<p>

Q.  Does the Davis-Bacon Act Contract for Prevailing Wages remain in effect for the life of the contract?<p>

A.  Yes.  Unless substantial changes are made in the terms of the contract.<p>


<h4>FLOOD PROCESS</h4>

Q.  Is Historic Preservation field work associated with structures in the buy-out program considered an eligible grant cost?<p>

A.  Yes.  FEMA pays 90 percent and DCCA pays 10 percent out of the Demolition Line Item.<p>

Q.  Can a grantee incur costs for appraisals prior to receiving a release of funds letter?<p>

A.  Yes.  Appraisals-related activities are exempt pursuant to 24 CFR Part 58.34 (a).  The grantee may incur costs and request reimbursement for these activities prior to release of funds.  However, acquisitions of property may not occur until the grant complies with all environmental requirements of 24 CFR Part 58. <p>


<h4>EEO PROCESS</h4>

Q.   On the quarterly contract and subcontract report, should Column "B" (amount of contract) reflect only the CDAP amount of the contract?<p>

A.   Yes.  Column "B" should reflect CDAP dollars only in the contract amount.  The grant total of the contract could be reflected near the bottom of the page highlighted with an asterisk.  This form will be revised in the near future to include columns indicating the total amount of the contract and CDAP amount of the contract.<p>


Q.  If a grantee only knows the total amount of the subcontract and does not know how much is DCCA-funded, how would you calculate the amount for reporting the quarterly contract and subcontract activity report figures?<p>

A.  You would calculate the percentage at the same rate as the injection of CDAP funds in the general contract.<p>


Q.  Is it required that the above activity report be submitted to DCCA quarterly?<p>

A.  Yes.  When a contract has been awarded you are required to forward a copy of the activity report within that respective quarter.  Timeliness is important as these statistics are submitted to HUD.  Also, this activity will be monitored during future site visits.<p>


<h4>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</h4>

Q.  Should a grantee/company use the HUD Section 8 Income Guidelines from the application year of the grant for the entire grant period when verifying job creation/retention?<p>

A.  No.  A copy of the current year income guidelines to verify job creation/retention for that respective year should be requested from the grantee's grants manager. <p>

Q.  Is the grantee responsible for reviewing economic development CDAP funds that are loaned to a company?<p>

A.  Yes.  The grantee should review these expenditures prior to submission to DCCA for reimbursement/payment.  It is the grantee's responsibility to have available at the site visit all documentation from the company verifying CDAP economic development funds.  The grantee should also have available documentation of leverage funds from a company for review.<p>

Q.  What activities can funds be used for under the economic development component?<p>

A.  Generally, CDAP funds are granted to communities to be loaned to for-profit or not-for-profit private entities who must document the need for grant and/or loan assistance.  The borrower may use the funds for land acquisition, construction, reconstruction, installation or rehabilitation of commercial or industrial buildings, structures and other real property, equipment and improvements, and working capital.  Working capital is defined as inventory, employee salaries, general operation expenses and advertising/marketing.  In addition, communities may use CDAP funds for public facilities and improvements in support of economic development.  CDAP funds may not be used for debt refinancing.<p>


<a name="Public Hearing"><hr></a>
<h3>PUBLIC HEARING - PROGRAMMATIC CLOSE-OUT</h3>

As a condition of the programmatic close-out, all CDAP grants awarded after November 1992 must conduct a public hearing to review program performance and obtain citizen views regarding program activities and performance.  The Notice of Public Hearing must be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation at least seven calendar days (excluding the date of publication) prior to the public hearing.  Your documentation to DCCA should include a copy of the publication/certification, minutes of the meeting certified by the chief elected official or another authorized official, and the attendance sheet which identifies private citizens and local officials.  Once your project has been completed and all CDAP funds drawn, you can proceed with the second public hearing.  It is not necessary to wait until you receive your close-out package from DCCA to conduct the public hearing.  Grants managers will not process programmatic close-out packages unless this information is included.  If you have any questions concerning this process, please contact your grants manager.<p>


<a name="Completing GER"><hr></a>
<h3>COMPLETING GER FOR REMOVAL OF ARCHITECTURAL BARRIERS GRANTS</h3>

When completing the Grantee Evaluation Report (GER) for CDAP Removal of Architectural Barriers grants, remember to use Census PCH-5-15 tables 7 and 8 to calculate the total number of persons served (column b).  The number of low-to-moderate persons served (column c) should be the same as column b.  The percent of persons served who are LMI (column d) should be 100 percent.  Column e should be the amount of the grant.  Column f should be the same as column e.  On the page for benefit to minorities, handicapped, and female heads of households, the total number of persons served should be the same as column b on the preceding page.  Data for compiling numbers of minorities is not available.  If you need any assistance in completing this information, please contact your grants manager.<p>


<a name="CDAP Loan Pricing"><hr></a>
<h3>CDAP LOAN PRICING POLICY</h3>

Under the Community Development Assistance Program Economic Development component, DCCA can grant funds to local governments, which in turn, loan these funds to private businesses to create and retain jobs.  As part of DCCA's review of CDAP Economic Development applications, the federal regulations require the department to "price" each loan.  At the time of the award, DCCA establishes the term, interest rate and conditions for the loan.  The term and rate set by the department may differ from the rate and term requested by the applicant.<p>

DCCA has established three percent as the minimum rate for CDAP loans.  However, the interest rate established by DCCA, after completion of the financial analysis, may be higher.  Many factors are included in DCCA's pricing evaluation, including, but not limited to, profitability, cash flow and collateral coverage.<p>

CDAP Economic Development funds are a valuable and popular source of  subordinate, fixed, below-market financing.  However, it is important that, up front, businesses are told that the interest ultimately approved by DCCA may be higher than the minimum three percent.<p>


<a name="Bid Negotiations"><hr></a>
<h3>BID NEGOTIATIONS</h3>

It is not unusual for CDAP projects which involve construction to exceed the funding originally budgeted for the activities.  Since DCCA obligates 100 percent of the funds allocated for each CDAP program component, additional CDAP funds cannot be made available.  Therefore, it is extremely important upon grant award that the grantee review the Grant Award Document, Scope of Work, and Activity Budget.  If it is determined at that time that insufficient funds are budgeted for the project, the grantee should contact DCCA to modify the Scope of Work.  This should be done prior to executing and returning the Grant Award Document.<p>

Leverage funds, if available, can always be used to supplement project cost "overruns".  If local funds are not available, other sources of leverage may include:  1) The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA); 2) Rural Development; 3) Illinois Rural Bond Bank (IRBB); 4) Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA); and 5) private financial institutions (banks).<p>

Should a situation arise where the total costs are within the total budget, but a particular activity line exceeds the budgeted amount, it may be possible (through a grant modification) to allow an increase in the amount budgeted for that activity line by reducing the amount budgeted for another.<p>

Construction contracts for activities which have been advertised for bids where the bids received exceed the amount budgeted should never be awarded to any contractor unless funds are assured, or the contracting agency is ready and willing to accept any and all legal consequences.  Once bids are received, a bid cannot be negotiated.  The bids must be rejected and the proposal readvertised.  All bidders must be given an equal opportunity to bid on the project (activity) described in the bid specification.  The regulations do contain provisions stating that, under certain special circumstances and conditions, bids may be negotiated, provided those special provisions are met.<p>

If it is anticipated that the bids for a specific activity will exceed the funds allocated for that activity, it is strongly urged that the bid specifications contain provisions for deductible alternatives whenever feasible.  If properly done, it may be possible to reduce the cost of the activity without readvertising and rebidding.  This method allows all prospective bidders equal opportunity to bid on the same activity and also allows the contracting agency the opportunity to select the lowest bid, or in some cases, the lowest "combination of bids."  It also reduces the possibility of an unsuccessful bidder suggesting that a bid was negotiated.<p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

Welcome to The Grant Manager.  This is the first issue of a newsletter designed to assist Illinois communities in administering their Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) grants.  We'll be presenting articles on current issues, providing a question and answer section to discuss problems grantees face, and offering a listing of upcoming events.  The Grant Manager will be published at least twice a year.  We hope you will enjoy receiving the newsletter and that it provides you with useful information concerning the Illinois Community Development Assistance Program.<p>

This newsletter is being prepared to assist grantees, administrators, consultants and others who administer CDAP grants.  This is your newsletter and we welcome your questions and comments.  We want to keep an open dialogue of information and knowledge between you and the CDAP staff.  Readers who would like to submit questions for the "Q & A" section or have topics they would like to see discussed in future articles, should submit their written topics or questions to their CDAP Grants Manager.  We will make every attempt to include your information or answer your questions in future newsletters.<p>

We hope many of you attended the 1996 CDAP Application Workshop in February, gaining knowledge about the upcoming program and obtaining copies of the 1996 Application Guidebooks.  If you were unable to attend and would like to receive 1996 Application Guidebooks, please write to Kay Wallwork, Illinois Department of Commerce & Community Affairs, 620 East Adams, Springfield, Illinois 62701, or telephone 217/785-7546; TDD 217/785-6055.<p>

Included in this newsletter is a map and listing of all CDAP staff throughout the state.  This has been included to introduce you to the CDAP staff and their areas of responsibility.  Each edition of The Grant Manager will have a different editorial board to cover a variety of topics.  This edition's editorial board includes:  Jay Bales, Barb Booth, Mike Craig, Pam Jefferies, Sarah Krumrey, and Shirley Watkins.<p>

<a name="Program Changes"><hr></a>
<h3>COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 1996 PROGRAM YEAR CHANGES</h3>

Several areas of the Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) will experience significant changes beginning with the 1996 Program Year.<p>

<h4>"Accelerated" Funding Cycles</h4>

The 1996 Program Year will begin April 1, 1996 -- two months earlier than the 1995 Program Year -- and all competitive application deadlines will be "moved up" accordingly (See Table I.)  In 1997, it is proposed that the program year would begin January 1st.  Of particular note is the manner in which the Competitive Public Facilities Construction and Design Engineering components will be accelerated for the 1997 Program Year.  As in past years, Competitive Public Facilities Construction and Design Engineering (P/F & D/E) applications for 1996 will be due in July.  In late October, an initial award will be made from those applications, using '96 funds.  And, again in January 1997, a second grant award will be made from the same application "pool", using '97 funds.<p>

For the 1998 Program Year, the P/F & D/E applications will be submitted in October 1997, and grants will be announced in January of 1998.  It is proposed that subsequent years will adhere to this revised schedule of an October submission with January award.<p>

This "acceleration" of the P/F & D/E funding cycle will accomplish several things.  First, spending rates -- of major importance to the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) -- will increase.  Secondly, Illinois will benefit by moving the beginning of its CDAP Program Year to earlier in the calendar year.  Reaching that goal in this particular manner should be of benefit to eligible applicants and their grantwriters:  an extra application submission deadline will not have to be "fit into" the regular rounds; and communities that have frequently been unsuccessful in receiving CDAP grants may receive an award, because, in essence, the awards will be made "farther down the list."<p>

In addition, grantees should benefit from receiving their grant awards in January, giving them sufficient time to complete special grant conditions but not a lot of "waiting time" before construction can begin in the spring.<p>

<h4>Documentation of Threat to Health and Safety of Residents</h4>

For the first time in several years, independent verification of threat to health and safety will not be a requirement of the CDAP Public Facilities Construction and Design Engineering component.<p>

This past year, the CDAP staff have continued to work closely with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, and it has become apparent that a letter from IEPA documenting threat to health and safety has become an obsolete requirement.<p>

However, potential applicants are strongly cautioned that the removal of the independent verification requirement in no way lessens the program's emphasis on addressing severe health/safety problems.  There are many ways in which applicants can document a threat to public health and safety, using readily available resources at the local level, which include but are not limited to:<p>
<ul>
<li>     water quality test results
<li>     boil orders
<li>     repair bills
<li>     historical (most recent two years) main break data
<li>     pressure test results
<li>     engineering reports or studies
<li>     complaint letters or data
<li>     historical correspondence regarding sewer treatment plan effluent violations
</ul>

These examples of supporting documentation obviously focus on existing municipal/public systems which are in need of renovation, upgrade, and/or repair.  But what about projects involving new systems which will serve residents on private wells or septic systems?  The following suggestions are offered to strengthen your documentation of a threat to health and safety in those circumstances:<p>
<ul>
<li>      A letter from the local health department which details the problems in the specific target area is recommended.<p>
<li>      Letters or surveys from residents documenting conditions in the target area are suggested to augment the health department letter.
</ul>

Focusing on rural water extension projects, CDAP staff are very aware that private well systems are prone to two distinct problems:  quality and quantity.  In some instances, a target area may even be experiencing both water quality problems and quantity shortfalls.  Both issues are recognized as threats to health and safety under the Public Facilities Construction/Design Engineering component.  Of course, the actual rating that a project receives is dependent upon the level of severity and the extent to which it is documented in the application.<p>

<h4>Low-to-Moderate Income Hook-Ups</h4>

Beginning with the 1996 Program Year, CDAP funds must be used to hook up residential structures which are owned and occupied by eligible low-and-moderate income persons.  A "hook-up" is defined as a privately owned and maintained line on privately owned property between a service lead/connection and a residential structure.  Applicants are advised to plan ahead and include these costs, if applicable, in their CDAP application budgets.<p>

<p>Independent Financial Audits


Under the Competitive Public Facilities Construction and Design Engineering components, a unit of local government's most recent financial audit is required to be submitted along with its application.  A clarification has been added to the 1996 P/F & D/E guidebook, which explains that, when the local government is applying on behalf of a special district (i.e., water or sanitary district), that entity's financial audit should be submitted.<p>

The above areas represent changes that are of significance for the 1996 Program Year.  As always, if you have any questions regarding CDAP in general or regarding the above changes, please feel free to contact the CDAP Grants Manager for your area as shown on the map.<p>

<a name="CDAP Funded Contracts"><hr></a>
<h3>CDAP FUNDED CONTRACTS - REQUESTS FOR PAYROLL INFORMATION</h3>

Periodically, CDAP grantees receive a request for the weekly payrolls of CDAP construction projects from outside parties.  The request should be made to the grantee through the Freedom of Information Act.  HUD Handbook 1344.1 (Federal Labor Standards Compliance in Housing and Community Development Programs) states:  "Requests by Outside Parties for Payrolls.  In order to protect the personal privacy interests of employees, copies of weekly payrolls containing the individual's salary, work hours, claimed exemptions and tax status, address and social security number shall not be released to outside parties and may be withheld under Exemption 6 of the Freedom of Information Act unless any identifiers are first deleted.  When payrolls are in the possession of State or local government, then the applicable State law will govern the release of payroll information."  The grantee's legal counsel must determine what information must be disclosed.<p>  

Should you require any additional information in this regard, please contact your CDAP Grants Manager.<p>

<a name="Implementing Section 3 Report Req"><hr></a>
<h3>IMPLEMENTING SECTION 3 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</h3>

This is the first of several forms of communication to CDAP grantees to notify you of the Section 3 revisions and DCCA's plan for implementation at the beginning of the 1996 program year (April 1, 1996).  This article will give you a brief overview of the revised regulations.  More detailed instructions and reporting forms will be distributed to affected grantees later this year.<p>

Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 was created to stimulate jobs and business opportunities in areas receiving HUD assistance.  For several years, the CDAP grant agreements have contained the "Section 3 Clause," placing a number of requirements on grantees and contractors to ensure their compliance with Section 3 regulations.  On June 30, 1994, Section 3 was overhauled, which substantially strengthened it and established clear priorities for targeting opportunities among Section 3 residents and businesses.<p>

Section 3 contains thresholds wherein Section 3 regulations apply.  Grantees receiving a grant in excess of $200,000 are covered by Section 3.  Contractors who receive a contract in excess of $100,000 from grantees who receive a grant in excess of $200,000 are also covered by Section 3.  If the grantee threshold is met but the contractor threshold is not, then the Section 3 regulations apply only to the grantee.<p>

Each grantee will be responsible for:<p>
<ul>
<li>     Notifying Section 3 residents and business concerns about training, employment and contracting opportunities generated by Section 3 covered assistance.
<li>     Notifying potential contractors for covered projects of Section 3 requirements.
<li>     Incorporating the Section 3 clause in all solicitations and contracts.
<li>     Facilitating the training and employment of Section 3 residents.
<li>     Facilitating the award of contracts to Section 3 business concerns.
<li>     Obtaining the compliance of contractors and subcontractors with Section 3 requirements.
<li>     Refraining from entering into any contract with any contractor where the recipient has notice or knowledge that the contractor has been found in violation of the Section 3 regulations.
<li>     Documenting actions taken to comply with Section 3, the results of actions taken and impediments, if any.
<li>     Submitting required reports.
</ul>

One of the key points to keep in mind is the dollar threshold.  Many of the projects funded with CDAP dollars cost considerably more and funding is received from several sources.  For example, if a community is installing water lines to an unserved area and receives funding from CDAP in excess of $200,000, the entire project is covered.  The community may be receiving $200,000 from CDAP, $200,000 from RECDS and $10,000 in local funds, for a total project cost of $410,000.  Any contract let in excess of $100,000 regardless of the funding source is considered covered under Section 3.<p>

A Section 3 resident is described as a public housing resident or an individual who resides in the metropolitan area or nonmetropolitan county in which the Section 3 covered assistance is expended and who is a low-income or very low-income person.  A Section 3 business is described as a business in which 51 percent or more is owned by Section 3 residents, has permanent full-time employees at least 30 percent of whom are currently Section 3 residents or within three years of the date of first employment with the business concern were Section 3 residents, or has a commitment to subcontract in excess of 25 percent of the dollar award of all subcontracts to be awarded to such businesses described above.<p>

DCCA will require grantees to report their Section 3 covered activities.  Grantees with individual grants in excess of $200,000 will be required to report on their efforts undertaken to comply with Section 3.  Each grant is considered a "project."  Therefore, if a grantee has a $300,000 CDAP Public Facilities grant and a $400,000 CDAP Housing Rehabilitation grant, the grantee will be required to submit two reports--one for each grant.<p>

DCCA will implement the Section 3 reporting requirements with the 1996 program year.  Keep in mind, though, that CDAP grants awarded in prior program years contained the Section 3 clause.  Therefore, if the grant threshold is met, then the prior year grants are also covered.  It will not be necessary to retroactively manufacture data.  Grantees will be required to report activities for all grants meeting the Section 3 threshold for activities which occur during the reporting period.<p>

Section 3 is meant to provide economic opportunities for low and very low income persons in the areas where the HUD assistance is being expended.  We believe this to be a worthwhile program and we don't anticipate any major problems in implementing the regulations in the Illinois Community Development Assistance Program.  We also recognize that the guidelines can be confusing at times and with future communication we will attempt to make compliance as painless as possible.<p>

<a name="Questions & Answers"><hr></a>
<h3>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h3>

Often you may feel there are no answers available to questions that develop in administering your grant.  The answer may not be found in the Grants Management Handbook because the question or problem is a "unique" situation that requires more definition or clarification.  This section of The Grant Manager will be devoted to questions from you, the grantees, and answers from the CDAP staff.  We will also include common concerns encountered by Grants Managers during their site visits.  In each newsletter we will answer your questions and share your comments with other grantees who may have experienced similar problems.<p>

<h4>Planning/Design:</h4>
<ul>
Q.  After the environmental review has been met, can the grantee enter into an agreement and spend only leverage funds pending the Release of Funds letter from DCCA?<p>
A.  No.  You cannot enter into an agreement AFTER the environmental review has been met and BEFORE the date of the Release of Funds letter to the grantee.  The contract would commit CDAP dollars as well as leverage funds.  You would be committing funds not yet released.<p>
</ul>

<h4>Public Facilities:</h4>
<ul>
Q.  Can administration costs be incurred while waiting for a grant modification to include administration as a project activity?<p>

A.  No.  You cannot incur administration costs while waiting for a grant modification.  The grant modification must be approved before costs are incurred.<p>

Q.  Is income verification required for all household residents receiving hook-ups if the line item indicates 60% leverage and 40% CDAP funds?<p>

A.  No.  Income verification would be required for the 40% of households utilizing CDAP funds for the household hook-ups.<p>
</ul>

<h4>Housing/Application Process:</h4>
<ul>
Q. Does the housing fact sheet of the application pertain only to those homes that express an interest in the project if funded?<p>

A.  No.  The housing fact sheet requests information on all homes within the targeted project area.<p>

Q.  Does a survey of the entire targeted project area need to be conducted?<p>

A.  Yes.  To demonstrate project need and project benefit, the application should provide information on all homes within the targeted area.  Sample survey forms shall be submitted with the application equal to the number of homes to be rehabilitated.<p>
</ul>

<h4>Housing/Administration Process:</h4>
<ul>
Q.  Does the required 25% leverage need to be incorporated into each individual home to be rehabilitated?<p>

A.  No.  The rehabilitation line item of the grant budget shall be leveraged by 25%.  It is recommended that, if possible, each home rehabilitated have leverage funds expended as part of the project cost.<p>

Q.  Can funds be transferred from one line item to another within the grant budget?<p>

A.  Yes, with the exception of increasing the administrative or inspection line items of the budget which have a limit of 7% and 8% respectively.  Always review the Scope of Work and Budget sections of your grant agreement for accuracy before executing the agreement.<p>
</ul>

<a name="Farm Income Definition Revision"><hr></a>
<h3>FARM INCOME DEFINITION REVISION</h3>

After much consideration, the DCCA staff have determined that there is a need to redefine the method of computing farm income for CDAP program eligibility.  Page 3-5-9 of the CDAP Grants Management Handbook contains the definition of annual income which has been changed to read as follows:  "Annual Income is the gross amount of income anticipated to be received by the family during the twelve months following the effective date of examination, excluding farm income."  Previous year tax returns are acceptable as a basis for computing current income for farm households only as defined in paragraph 3 of the "Income Inclusions" section on page 3-5-9, which reads:  "3)  Farm income defined as net money income (gross receipts minus operating expenses) received from the operation of a farm by a person on their own account, as an owner, renter or sharecropper.  Operating expenses include depreciation, interest on debt as well as other normal operating expenses."<p>

<a name="Activities in a Floodplain"><hr></a>
<h3>ACTIVITIES IN A FLOODPLAIN</h3>

The Great Flood of 1993 resulted in numerous projects in floodplain areas.  If a project involves activities in a floodplain, grantees must conduct a federally mandated eight-step review procedure.<p>

Executive Order 11988--Floodplain Management Guidelines--is applicable to all grantees whose projects occur in the 100 year floodplain.  The order requires grantees to conduct an eight-step review procedure.  This is a decision-making process to consider any practicable alternatives to locating the project in the base floodplain.  Instructions for the eight-step floodplain review procedures can be found in Chapter 2, Section I, pages 2-1-18 and 19 of your CDAP Grants Management Handbook.  The eight-step process is part of the environmental review.<p>

Steps 2 and 7 of the review procedure involve notices to the public and allowing time for meaningful input.  These publications are the "Early Public Review for Construction in a Floodplain" and "Findings and Public Explanation for Construction in a Floodplain."  To satisfy special grant conditions, the grantee will publish the "early public review" notice early in the process.  A total of 15 full days, excluding day of publication, will be allowed for public comment for the early notice.  The "findings and public explanation" publication will be published once the public comment period has elapsed on the early publication.  The public comment period for this, the second publication, will be a full seven days excluding the day of publication.<p>

When the eight-step floodplain review procedure has been completed and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requirements have been satisfied the grantee can publish the Notice to the Public of No Significant Impact on the Environment and Notice to the Public for Request for Release of Funds (combined notice) or the Notice of Intent to Request a Release of Funds, whichever is appropriate.  The eight steps and publications may be forwarded to DCCA once the public comment period has elapsed for the second public notice.<p>

If you have any questions regarding this information, contact Mike Craig for all flood assistance grants, or Amy Zachary for all other CDAP grants proposing an action in a floodplain.<p>

<a name="Projects Funded with 1996 Program Funds"><hr></a>
<h3>PROJECTS FUNDED WITH 1996 PROGRAM YEAR FUNDS WILL REQUIRE HOOK-UPS</h3>

After April 1, 1996, all CDAP-funded public facilities projects funded for new or expanding water or sewer systems will require hook-ups for all qualified owner occupied low-to-moderate income households (hook-ups for rental units are not mandated, but may be done.)<p>

You should also be aware that according to HUD regulations, local governments may not impose a "special assessment" (assessing a fee or charge levied or filed as a lien against a parcel of real estate as a direct result of benefit derived from the installation of a public improvement) against properties which are owned and occupied by persons defined by the most current HUD Section 8 income guidelines for the appropriate county as being low-to-moderate income persons. The term "special assessment" does not relate to periodic water or sewer user fee charges imposed for the use of public improvements.<p>

The most common type of special assessment is a "tap-on" fee which is a one-time charge made as a condition of access to an improvement, normally a sanitary sewage collection or water distribution system.  If an entity determines that a tap-on fee will be charged, the income generated by the collection of such fees will flow into that entity, i.e. water district, community, etc.; and generally be available for project construction costs and may be used as local leverage.  Please keep in mind that tap-on fees are generally required to be paid by all households.  CDAP funds may be used to pay for the tap-on fees for owner-occupied low-to-moderate income households, or the unit of local government may elect to waive those fees.<p>

In some instances, low-to-moderate income households are required to pay a tap-on fee (reimbursable deposit)  prior to CDAP award to satisfy requirements imposed by the Rural Economic and Community Development Service.  In this case, the low-to-moderate income household or the grantee can be reimbursed with CDAP funds provided the proper documentation and income verification is made prior to disbursement of the funds (and the funds were used to assist in financing construction). <p>

In addition to budgeting for the tap-on fee, you must budget CDAP or leverage funds to pay for the hook-ups for all owner occupied low-to-moderate income households.  To prevent confusion, it's very important for the applicant to understand the terms commonly used in conjunction with a CDAP funded project.  A "service lead/connection" is a line extending the main system to the utility's right-of-way line, normally owned and maintained by the utility.  A "hook-up" is a privately owned and maintained line on privately owned property between a service lead/connection and a structure.<p>

The grantee must use CDAP funds or leverage funds to pay for the actual cost of running the private water or sewer lines up to the house for each owner occupied low-to-moderate income household.  If the cost exceeds $500 for water and $750 for sewer, the homeowner must provide the difference.  The final connection to the house is also the responsibility of the homeowner.<p>

Hook-ups are considered a direct benefit activity and, therefore, the grantee must document the income eligibility of each household receiving this assistance.  Please refer to the Direct Benefit Section of the "CDAP Grants Management Handbook"  for additional guidance on verification of income for low-to-moderate income households.<p>

<a name="Announcing Upcoming Fair Housing Workshop"><hr></a>
<h3>ANNOUNCING UPCOMING FAIR HOUSING WORKSHOP</h3>

Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  This law also requires administration of federal programs in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing.  As recipients of CDAP grants, communities are obligated to pursue fair housing activities.  To help CDAP grant recipients achieve this goal, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), the Illinois Department of Human Rights (DHR),  and the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) are co-sponsoring a conference on fair housing.  The conference will detail federal rules which mandate this activity and provide insight as to how communities can pursue this goal.<p>

The conference is scheduled to be held on Tuesday, April 30, 1996, from 9:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m., at the Holiday Inn in Decatur.  A brochure with more information on the conference along with registration instructions will be forwarded to you as we get closer to the date.  Should you have any questions on this conference, contact Jay Bales at DCCA at 217/785-6181.<p>

<h3>Workshops help Illinois small businesses export</h3>
<ul type=square>
<li>One in eight jobs in Illinois is dependent on exporting; one in four in the manufacturing sector. As of 1995, it is estimated that more than 625,300 Illinoisans are employed by jobs sustained by direct and indirect exports.<p>
<li>Every dollar of Illinois exports generates $.04 of state tax revenue.<p>
<li>Export related jobs are globally competitive and proving to be the key to the creation and retention of higher paying and permanent jobs in Illinois. Wages for workers in the manufacturing and service exporting sectors, where Illinois products are the most competitive, exceed the U.S. average by 24 percent.<p>
</ul>


With these figures in mind, Illinois International Trade Centers and NAFTA Opportunity Centers recently hosted a series of workshops throughout the state to help Illinois small businesses export their products to Mexico.<p>

Workshop topics included the use of agent/distributor contracts, labeling and standards, documentation requirements, tips for success. Small businesses who have already been exporting to Mexico, such as Frantz Manufacturing Company in Sterling, spoke about their successes and difficulties.<p>

The keynote speaker at the workshops was Alfonso Cortina, director of the Economist's Conference in Mexico City. At the peak of Mexico's financial crises, he organized a successful roundtable that included the Mexican president and principal ministers.<p>

Cortina said that Mexico is gradually undergoing a transformation of deregulation and private investment that will allow for even greater opportunities for U.S. exports.<p>

With a population of 88 million and a gross domestic product of $377 billion, Mexico is one of our closest and largest trading partners. In 1994, the first year after passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Illinois exports to Mexico increased by almost 38 percent to over $2 billion.<p>

Despite a decline in exports in 1995 after the peso devaluation, Illinois exports are once again on the rise. As of the first quarter of 1996, Illinois exports to Mexico rose nearly 12 percent over numbers from one year earlier.<p>

By 2003 virtually all tariffs on U.S. goods into Mexico will be zero, thus giving U.S. goods a significant competitive advantage over non-North American goods.<p>

"The only sucking sound we've heard since NAFTA passed  is American businesses drinking margaritas after their first sale to Mexico," said Ben Singer, international trade specialist with the U.S. Department of Commerce's NAFTA office.<p>

The workshops were presented as part of the Illinois Export Partnership for Big Emerging Markets and Sectors Project. Funding is provided by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs' International Business Division through the U.S. Department of Commerce's Market Development Cooperator Program. Future workshops will cover exporting to Eastern Europe and China.<p>

<h3>Mandatory electonic tax filing affects many small businesses</h3>
<h4>By Mollie Cole</h4>

<em><strong>EDITOR'S NOTE:</strong></em> Effective July 1, 1997, the Internal Revenue Service will require all businesses depositing more than $50,000 in employment taxes (based on 1995 contributions) to do so electronically.  The start date is January 1, 1999 for those who deposit more than $20,000 in 1997.  The Federal Tax Deposit Coupon will be extinct for businesses required to file electronically. The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) is working with the Illinois Small Business 100, a group of leading small business owners across the state, to examine its impact and see if there are any ways to ease these regulatory burdens.<p>

In 1993 Congress mandated that the Internal Revenue Service use the 1994-1999 period to phase in the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS).  Businesses depositing payroll taxes at or above specified thresholds in certain years will be required to participate in EFTPS.  Once enrolled in the program, businesses shall be required to electronically file all payroll taxes each year regardless of whether or not they ever fall below the initial thresholds.  This eliminates any future use of the Federal Tax Deposit Coupon for these businesses, effective upon the start dates.  Below is the phase-in schedule:<p>

<pre>
<strong>Payroll Tax Deposits     Determination Year     EFTPS Participation
(minimum)                                       Start Date (mandated)  </strong>

$50,000                       1995                   July 1, 1997
$50,000                       1996                   January 1, 1998
$20,000                       1997                   January 1, 1999
</pre>

There are two methods to transfer the funds to the IRS.  The ACH Credit method requires the business to instruct its bank to send payment directly to the US Treasury's account at the Federal Reserve Bank.  The ACH Debit method requires the business to authorize a treasury financial agent to withdraw funds from the business' bank account and route them to the Treasury's account.  Under the credit-based method, the business is responsible for the payment until the Federal Reserve Bank credits the Treasury's account; under the debit-based method, the treasury financial agent is responsible for the payment.  Businesses must apply for enrollment in this program prior to participation.  Application must be submitted no later than two months prior to the businesses assigned start date.<p>

DCCA's Small Business Division estimates that nearly 370,000 Illinois small businesses will be impacted by this federally mandated regulation:  166,200 beginning this July, and an additional 203,000+ by January 1999, the end of the phase-in period.  A significant number (12 percent) of affected businesses are located in manufacturing and seven percent have been in business less than five years.<p>

The majority of businesses, especially those whose participation is required by this July, have already been notified by the IRS of the new policy.  Many businesses reported that they learned of EFTPS through their accountant or bank.  Our Regulatory Alert questionnaire to the Illinois Small Business 100 served as the initial notification for quite a few.<p>

Despite fairly widespread awareness of EFTPS, most businesses are unsure of how this will ultimately affect them and have numerous questions as to what types of adjustments will need to made to be in full compliance.  Many businesses expressed expectations that their local chambers of commerce, financial institutions, and DCCA will provide information and assistance through workshops and instructional materials to help them through this IRS phase-in and implementation.  DCCA's Advocacy Team recognizes this as an excellent opportunity for financial institutions, local chambers of commerce, and DCCA to reach out to the small business community and provide much needed, much sought information and assistance.<p>

Securing status as a treasury financial agent would enable financial institutions to provide their customers with a direct vehicle to utilize the debit-based method of payment.  According to the September 1996 issue of The CPA Letter, only NationsBank and First National Bank of Chicago currently have contracts with the Treasury Department to function in this capacity and can provide this service.  Further, financial institutions offering this service can work with their customers to help identify the best payment method and wade through compliance procedure. <p>

Local chambers of commerce can easily access their relationships with financial institutions and other resources to bring information and assistance to their members through existing schedules of meetings and events.<p>

DCCA's Regulatory Assistance and First Stop offices can work together to develop a technical bulletin that explains the regulations and the steps toward compliance.  DCCA's Small Business Division and Advocacy Team will continue its work through information distribution and the tracking of assistance initiatives throughout the state for resource referral.<p>

<h4>Regulatory Alert Findings</h4>

On September 26, 1996, Regulatory Alert questionnaires dealing with Electronic Filing of Federal Employment Taxes were faxed to the Illinois Small Business 100 (ISB100), with a response deadline of October 2, 1996.  Seventy-nine businesses responded.<p>

Of the 79 responding, more than 63 percent were aware of the upcoming policy. Of those who were aware, most (52 percent) had received the information from the IRS, followed by their accountants, financial institutions and trade/association publications.<p>

Forty-seven out of 79 respondents believe that compliance with EFTPS will require adjustments in bookkeeping methods and will be more costly than current methods. At this time, more than 77 percent of business owners either designate an employee to deposit federal taxes or perform the task themselves.  Over one-third of the respondents expressed concern that implementation would create improper access to company financial accounts and increases in banking service and maintenance fees.<p>

Nearly 52 percent of the respondents reported having questions about the new procedures. An equal amount determined that a technical bulletin, outlining EFTPS policy and procedure would be most useful to their business operations. Almost thirty-seven percent stated that a workshop sponsored by DCCA, a local chamber of commerce or business association/trade organization would enhance their understanding.<p>

<h4>Action Steps</h4>

The ISB100 response to the first Regulatory Alert offers several challenges to the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs.  As a state agency, our impact on a federal regulatory agency is minimal. However, there are several steps we can take to einsure that the Illinois small business community is fully aware of the impact this IRS mandate will have on their future operations.  As of this date: <p>

<ul type=square>
<li>DCCA will meet with staff at Illinois Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve Bank (Chicago District Office) to request their assistance in addressing your pressing need for current up-to-date information on their ability to electronically process federal payroll taxes.<p>
<li>An easy-to-understand technical bulletin is in development.  The technical bulletin should be available to you by November 5, 1996 on hard copy and located on the DCCA Website at www.ilcommerce.com by November 19, 1996.<p>
<li>Staff are aware of the demand for workshops on the issue of Electronic Filing of Federal Payroll Taxes.  In the next 30 days, staff  will contact appropriate chambers, business associations and trade organizations to determine the feasibility of regional co-sponsored workshops.<p>
</ul>

The Treasury Department is seeking comment on all aspects of the proposed rule, due on or before November 29, 1996, especially on how the rule changes may affect banks' participation in the electronic filing program and their relationship with their customers.<p>

If you would like a copy of the proposed rule, it can be accessed via the Internet at <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/finman">http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/finman</a>, in the 9/30/96  Federal Register (pp. 51185-51194).<p>

<h3>SBDC helps family-owned store survive</h3>
<h4>By Stephen Baise</h4>

In an attempt to bolster the financial viability of their family run business, which as of late has been plagued by disappointing earnings, Bob and Cathy Wiedenhoff explored one of their only remaining sources of help, the Small Business Development Center located at Kaskaskia Community College in Centralia.<p>

Their business, Coast to Coast Hardware, is a franchise type business located in Greenville and has been in operation since 1981. Until recently they had no reason or need for the no services provided by the approximately 40 Small Business Development Centers throughout the state. That was before a major discount competitor moved into the local market, one which had previously been serviced by downtown resident merchants such as the Wiedenhoffs.<p>

Equipped with both fortitude and determination to succeed they decided to seek the guidance and support of Wayne Robke, a professional business and finance specialist at the Small Business Development Center at Kaskaskia College. In conjunction with center director Richard McCullum, the two attempted to alleviate the fiscal dilemma faced by the family by completely analyzing their business operations.<p>

Robke helped develop an updated operation plan. In doing so, he pointed out various avenues to increase profitability by increasing gross profit and decreasing operating cost, such as inventory, labor, advertising, and other overhead expenditures.<p>

Upon further consultation with the Bradford Bank of Greenville and the Coast to Coast franchiser's chief financial officer, Robke explained in great detail the financial considerations that must be approved by all in order that the participating parties benefit from the continuation of this business.<p>

Thanks to the collaboration of the SBDC, the bank, the franchisor and the business principals, the Wiedenhoffs have demonstrated with promising results that entrepreneurs can effectively utilize the many workable resources SBDCs offer.<p>

"We wished we had called two years ago," Bob Wiedenhoff said. "The SBDC has given us the confidence that with our renewed energy and the assistance of others that we regain our past successes and fifteen years of our lives have not been in vain." <p>

<h3>Minority business conference held</h3>
<h4>By Manuel Suarez</h4>

"Minority Business: America's Competitive Advantage" was the theme of Minority Enterprise Development (MED) Week.. <p>

The conference featured a panel discussion where valuable resources and information was disseminated to about 300 participants followed by an award ceremony and reception.<p>

Co-sponsored by the Office of Minority Business Development of the Illinois Small Business Division of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency, the U.S. Small Business Administration and other economic development organizations, the conference was held at the First National Bank of Chicago.<p>

Honorary chairs for this year event were John F. Timmer, Senior Vice President, First Chicago Bank and Ronald Temple, Chancellor, City Colleges of Chicago.<p>

"This is the period when the Illinois agencies and organizations serving minority and women-owned businesses highlight the success of African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans for their contribution to Illinois's economy," said Brian Slaughter, director of the Office of Minority Business Development for Chicago's City Colleges.<p>

MED Week, which began in 1983 by proclamation of President Reagan, is observed in recognition of the contributions and achievements of the country's minority entrepreneurs. <p>

"I am glad to see so many minority businesses at this event. MED Week provides and opportunity for minority entrepreneurs to develop new business leads, increase market potentials through participation in business forums and networking opportunities," said Andrew Ramir, government consultant for Morales, Ramir and Associates.<p>

<h3>DCCA to co-host ISO 14000 conference </h3>
<h4>By Annette Lingleo</h4>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs' Small Business Environmental Assistance Program will cosponsor a conference to bring together ISO 14000 leaders in the United States for an important discussion of the business, environmental, and regulatory ramifications of the ISO 14000 standards. The conference will be held on November 19 and 20 at the James R. Thompson Center in Chicago.<p>

The ISO 14000 series of standards are voluntary international standards for the establishment of a common world wide approach to management systems that will lead to the protection of the earth's environment while spurring international trade and commerce.<p>

The discussion will focus particularly on the ISO Environmental Management Standards and what they might mean for businesses in the Midwest. It is possible that ISO 14000 may become a condition of some customer/supplier transactions, especially in Europe, Asia, and with the U.S. government. There is also a high probability that the ISO 14000 standards will become a factor in multilateral trade agreements in establishing whether governments are making an attempt to improve the environmental situation within their countries.<p>

The conference is designed to provide an open and active dialogue between speakers and the audience. For more information about the conference, contact ANSI/GETF ISO 14000 Integrated Solutions (IIS) at 703/750-6401 or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 312/886-0180.<p>

<h3>First-Stop Center expands to ease regulations</h3>
<h4>By Mark Grant</h4>

The First-Stop Business Information Center, a statewide source of regulatory help for business in Illinois, is expanding its role as an advocate for business in government. Already recognized as the first place for a business to call when navigating the maze of state required permits and regulations, First-Stop is expanding its role as a watchdog on proposed legislation and regulations which impact Illinois businesses by including the staff and functions of the Regulatory Flexibility Unit.<p> 

Businesses stated they wanted one place they could call to find out what regulations applied to them and to help them cut through the red tape they often encounter. With that mission in mind, the First-Stop Business Information Center was started one year ago within the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<p>

In the first year, nearly 5,000 individuals have received help with questions or problems with state regulations and starting a business. Response from callers has been very complimentary to the assistance provided. As one caller put it, "I called your 800 number to seek assistance.... the First-Stop specialist was extremely helpful and courteous, and he showed genuine concern and willingness to help," while another caller, "respects and appreciates the level of service and professionalism (they) received from First-Stop."<p>

And now First-Stop is providing another level of help. With the addition of the Regulatory Flexibility Unit, which monitors proposed legislation and regulations, First-Stop helps businesses stay ahead of the regulatory curve. The objectives are to keep the business community as well informed as possible and to act as a business advocate in the legislative and regulatory arena. The Regulatory Flexibility Program, instituted in 1984 and backbone of the Unit, gives First Stop the ability to comment on proposed rules for their impact on small business and make recommendations on how rules can be tiered or even eliminated to alleviate the burden on smaller entities.<p>

Reports summarizing legislative activity are developed on a regular basis during legislative sessions and synopses of proposed rules as published in the Illinois Register every week are available to any interested parties. To receive one or both of these documents, call First-Stop toll-free at 800/252-2923 and ask to speak with Linda Brand. The same information is available on the Web at www.ilcommerce.com. Follow the First-Stop links to Proposed Regulations and Legislation. <p>

Businesses that have concerns can send comments back to First-Stop by phone, fax, letter or through the Internet. First-Stop will follow through with the appropriate legislative and rule making bodies.<p>

<h3>Awards recognize gov't contract help</h3>
<h4>By Lois Van Meter</h4>

Directors of Illinois Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTAC) were recognized for their efforts in the contracting arena at their quarterly meeting held in Bloomington. Directors are honored for their personal contribution in helping their clients secure government contracts.<p>

Those winning awards for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996 are:<p>

Doug Harlan of the University of Illinois' Cooperative Extension Service of Decatur and Dave Talbot of North Business and Industrial Council (NORBIC) of Chicago were each honored with a "million dollar baby," for their first million dollars in contract assistance.<p>

Awards were given for over a million dollars in contract assistance to John DiGiacomo, Rock Valley College, Rockford; Pat Williams, College of Lake County, Grayslake; and Susan Gorman, Illinois Central College, Peoria.<p>

Directors recognized with $5 million contract assistance awards were Tom Halfman, South Suburban College, South Holland; and Ed Van Leer, John Wood Community College, Quincy.<p>

Those receiving awards for $10 million in contract assistance were Harlan and Duffy Toler, College of DuPage, Glen Ellyn.<p>

Receiving awards for $25 million dollars of contract assistance this year are Montrey Balmer, Moraine Valley Community College, Palos Hills; and Elizabeth Scully, Women's Business Development Center, Chicago.<p>

Rich Fyke of John A Logan College of Carterville was honored for helping his client secure over $100 million dollars in government contracts. This is the single highest achievement to date for the PTAC program.<p>

Also receiving $50 million milestone awards were DiGiacomo, Balmer and Pamela See of College of Lake County.<p>

<h3>Husband-wife team helps DuPage small businesses</h3>

Like many married couples, Shannon Rielly and Duffy Toler drive each other to work. But for Rielly and Toler, the morning ride takes both of them to the same place: College of DuPage's (COD) Business and Professional Institute in Glen Ellyn.<p>

Rielly has been the director of COD's International Trade Center (ITC) for two and a half years. Toler has been director of the college's Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) for the past two years and was previously the assistant at the PTAC. They met while working together at COD and were married last year following a wedding proposal on a Washington D.C. vacation.<p>

The couple's strong ties to the state's small business program were humorously illustrated in their wedding program which contained the Illinois Small Business Development Network logo and government-mandated disclaimer language required of all government publications.<p>

Rielly's accomplishments include being named Illinois ITC Director of the Year for the past two years. Toler received $100 Million Milestone Award last year from DCCA, which recognized his efforts in helping secure government contracts for small businesses. He also was honored for reaching the $10 million mark for this fiscal year.<p>

Rielly counsels small and medium-sized businesses interested in exporting their product or service. Specifically, she works with companies to formulate international business plans tailored to their goals and resources, conducts market research to determine target markets, educates companies about export mechanics and identifies overseas contacts.<p>

Toler provides one-on-one counseling for companies interested in doing business with government agencies. He assists companies in identifying the government market for their product or service, provides research to allow companies to formulate a marketing strategy, assists in the completion of bid documents and provides contract management consultation.<p>

Toler says that their professional success "is thanks to a high level of cooperation between our centers," and, adds Rielly, "a healthy level of competition."<p>

<h3>EDGAR MEETS WITH SMALL BUSINESS LEADERS</h3>

Governor Jim Edgar was on hand as the Illinois Small Business
100 (ISB100) held its first meeting to discuss issues important
to small business owners.<p>

The ISB100, which consists of 100 entrepreneurs throughout the
state, will serve in an advocacy role for the state's 617,000
small business owners. Members were nominated by trade
associations, professional organizations, Illinois Small
Business Development Network centers, the U.S. Small Business
Administration and others.<p>

"Through the Illinois Small Business 100, my administration is
forging an even stronger relationship with small business - one
that is designed to foster a better understanding of the ongoing
issues and challenges facing this important segment of the
economy," Edgar said. "We will work together to promote business
growth and expansion in a low-tax, common sense climate that
does not choke economic growth."<p>

The group will communicate electronically via fax and the
Internet to provide nearly instant feedback to the latest issues
affecting small businesses.<p>

"Small businesses are the backbone of the state's economy,"
Edgar said. "They play vital roles as job creators, employing
millions of Illinois citizens, and they provide tremendous
opportunities for those from every corner of Illinois who have
the determination to work hard and succeed. We are seeing some
of the most dramatic growth in small businesses owned by women
and minorities."<p>

Edgar also presented the first Governor's Award for Small
Business Achievement to Turano Bakeries of Berwyn. The Turano
family started the business in the 1960s as a small Chicago
neighborhood bakery. Today Turano is a nationally known company,
servicing accounts that include fast food outlets and
supermarket chains. Edgar cited them as an example of how a
small business can grow through hard work.<p>

Turano's Berwyn facility was the site of Edgar's formal
announcement of the creation of the ISB100. Prior to the
announcement Edgar toured the facility and purchased bread from
their bakery shop.<p>

<h3>MEXICAN VISIT HELPS ILLINOIS SMALL BUSINESSES</h3>

<em>Editor's Note: </em>Rebecca Lake, International Trade Center director
at North Business and Industrial Council (NORBIC) in Chicago,
recently traveled to Mexico City to assist several Illinois
small businesses.<p>

By Rebecca Lake<p>

I heard it at a breakfast meeting over huevos rancheros and a
glass of orange juice: it is the best of times, it is the worst
of times. While I had listened to this phrase uttered many times
before, never had it described a situation so perfectly. The
conclusions I had drawn from my two week visit in Mexico about
economic and social life fit nicely into those 12 words. On a
trip sponsored by the NAFTA Opportunity Center (NOC) at NORBIC,
I had the opportunity to support Illinois trade with Mexico,
while discovering firsthand how Mexico City was dealing with the
worst of times, following 1994's peso devaluation and resulting
economic crisis.<p>

Much of my time in Mexico City was spent working at the State of
Illinois booth at Mexican Manufacturing Week `96, Mexico's
premier trade show for manufacturers. Helping represent the 11
Illinois companies that participated in the catalogue show, I
spoke with numerous distributors and potential buyers from
throughout Latin and South America. Some of these companies were
one-man operations, looking to represent anybody that will give
them a chance. Many, however, were established companies eager
to incorporate U.S. products into their lines. After just a few
discussions, it became clear that companies in Mexico and beyond
associated not just U.S., but specifically Illinois products
with quality.<p>

Another major part of my trip consisted of on-site market
research for some of the NOC's clients. I visited local retail
outlets throughout Mexico City, including the popular department
store, Sanborne's, the big grocery store chains, even Sam's
Club. Most of the stores were filled with consumers, similar to
a Saturday afternoon at a Sam's Club in Chicago. Store shelves
were stocked with everything from ice cream to Ralph Lauren
bedding, leading me to the conclusion that even though Mexicans
are feeling the pinch from a hurting economy, they are still
welcoming U.S. products into their homes and dessert menus. <p>

Unfortunately, once outside the busy stores, I again witnessed
the countless people doing whatever they could to get by.
Washing windshields for a peso (about fifteen cents) was one
popular means, performing acrobats in front of cars stopped at
stoplights, another. The image that I recall most vividly is of
men, lined up along a fence on a busy city square, holding
shabby pieces of cardboard stating the trades that they were
skilled in. They'd stand there all day if they had to, looking
for work. <p>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs'
Mexico Office served as homebase for me during my time in Mexico
City. If ever there was a group of dedicated, productive, and
giving people, it is the staff in this office. Armed with a
desk, computer, and phone, I was able to work without
interruption to gather as much information as possible to bring
back as resources for Illinois companies. Using the Mexico
office's conference rooms, I met with Mexican companies looking
to do business with Illinois. Currently, we're in the process of
matching them with potential business partners here at home. It
certainly is the best of times for Illinois companies who are
taking advantage of opportunities within this emerging market.<p>

Specifically, the Illinois companies that research was carried
out for included a Des Plaines-based processor of quality
seafood, a Chicago manufacturer of industrial and graphic arts
rollers, a Batavia-based company that manufactures financial
equipment, a manufacturer of electronic equipment in Chicago,
and a Lake Bluff-based processor of dietary supplements. <p>

Another highlight of this trip included a meeting with the
Economist Magazine's Conference Director, Alfonso Cortina. He
will serve as the keynote speaker in the NAFTA Opportunity
Center at NORBIC's upcoming seminar, "Doing Business in Mexico -
from Devaluation to Re-evaluation." A dynamic speaker with a
thorough knowledge of Mexico's economic and political life,
Cortina will analyze implications of the current and future
Mexican economy for Illinois exporters. For more information on
this informative seminar, or to register, call 312/588-5137.<p>

I'm anxious to hear if Mr. Cortina's perceptions of where his
country is and where it's going are in line with mine. In my
meeting with him, it was my impression that he sees an expanding
economy for Mexico, but like in all market economies, there are
growing pains to deal with. It seems to me that the Mexican
people are accepting these challenges, and moving on the best
way they know how.<p>

<h3>HAZARDOUS WASTE INFO AVAILABLE</h3>

By Tom Kamykowski<p>

The Illinois Hazardous Waste Research and Information Center
(HWRIC) will combine research with information collection and
analysis to provide small businesses with direct technical
assistance and educational materials on matters of waste
management and pollution prevention.<p>

Since 1986, HWRIC, a non-regulatory, non-profit agency, has been
helping industry reduce waste at the source. The Illinois Toxic
Pollution Prevention Act expanded HWRIC's mandate "to promote
toxic pollution prevention as the preferred means for achieving
compliance with environmental laws and regulations."<p>

Pollution prevention programs not only help reduce waste, but
often also reduce raw material, labor and disposal costs. These
cost savings can help Illinois' business and industry become
more competitive.<p>

For some companies, reporting of pollution prevention progress
is required under the federal Pollution Prevention Act of 1990.
Each facility required to file an annual toxic chemical release
report must include a toxic chemical source reduction and
recycling report on each chemical.<p>

<h3>EVEN SMALL FIRMS CAN BID ON GOV'T CONTRACTS</h3>

This is not your normal success story. This success story does
not include the award of a multi-million dollar government
contract, or even a $100,000 contract. Instead, it is about a
small construction/roofing business that, thanks to a little
help, submitted its first bid on a government contract.<p>

Shingles Plus submitted bids for several roofing projects with
the Champaign County Housing Authority. Just by just submitting
a bid, this small business has become a success in the ever
changing world of government contracting.<p>

Shingles Plus became a client of the University of Illinois'
Cooperative Extension Service's Procurement Technical Assistance
Center (PTAC) last year. Since then, time has been spent
applying for Capital Development Board certification, securing
bonding, and filling out the numerous pieces of paper required
to bid on both state and federal government contracts. Before
Shingles Plus became a PTAC client, they had not bid on any
government contracts. "We were on the outside looking in," says
Mandy Bogdan, Shingles Plus' main company contact.<p>

The PTAC provided Shingles Plus with all of the necessary forms
to become certified with the Illinois Capital Development Board.
Shingles Plus also received assistance in finding bidding
opportunities with many local and federal government agencies in
Illinois.<p>

"The company is small and relatively new. So, I restricted their
bid match profile to Illinois only. I told them that this would
reduce the number of opportunities available. But the company
was very patient. So, when the perfect match was finally found,
they jumped on it with both feet," said Doug Harlan, PTAC
Director.<p>

Once the bidding opportunity was identified, the PTAC provided
assistance in interpreting the solicitation packet, obtaining
required forms, and general encouragement.<p>

Shingles Plus being awarded the contract is immaterial to this
success story. They have successfully entered a new market, one
in which they were not previously involved. The Housing
Authority will continue to keep them on their active contractors
list. This, coupled with the invaluable experience of bidding on
their first government contract, is bound to produce contract
awards in the near future.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS OVERCOME OBSTACLES</h3>

National trends reveal that women own an increasingly large
proportion of small businesses in the United States. Currently,
women own about 30 percent of all private businesses and are
opening new businesses at twice the rate of their male
counterparts. It is estimated that at current rates of growth,
women could own 50 percent of all businesses by the first decade
of the next century. These figures reflect the hard work and
determination exhibited by women business owners during the past
decade. However, one must be cautious because these positive
national trends obscure the obstacles that continue to hinder
female entrepreneurial success, particularly in Illinois.<p>

A recent survey conducted by John Gruidl and Chris Merrett at
the Illinois Institute for Rural Affairs notes that Illinois
ranks forty-fifth out of fifty states in the proportion of women
who own their own businesses. Women who owned businesses had
higher business failure rates than their male counterparts.
Female business owners simply face more obstacles than their
male competition on the road to business success. <p>

Results from the survey of 712 business owners in downstate
Illinois revealed that female entrepreneurs start businesses
with fewer years of work experience, with less education in
business, with fewer business contacts, and with less startup
capital. Furthermore, female-run businesses tend to be in
sectors such as retail trade and consumer services that
traditionally generate lower profits than sectors dominated by
men such as manufacturing and construction.<p>

The survey also revealed that women continue to be optimistic
about business opportunities in Illinois despite the barriers
blocking their progress. This optimism can be traced in part to
innovative projects such as the mentor program run by Small
Business Development Centers. According to survey results,
business contacts and access to credit after the initial startup
phase are crucial to ongoing business success. Mentor programs
pair experienced female business owners with inexperienced
female entrepreneurs to help them sustain early successes. These
experienced female entrepreneurs can provide access to knowledge
and credit that may be otherwise unattainable.<p>

Overall, the future for businesses run by women seems to be
improving. Research shows that while a gender gap persists in
entrepreneurial success, women are narrowing that gap because of
their optimism, determination and burgeoning support networks.<p>

This research is part of a larger ongoing project conducted by
the Illinois Institute for Rural Affairs to examine the role of
women in rural economic development. Gruidl and Merrett are
currently examining female entrepreneurs in non-metropolitan
counties of Illinois and the Midwest. Early results show that
rural female entrepreneurs experience higher business failure
rates than urban females, or males in either rural or urban
counties. In other words, geographic location can compound the
barriers to female entrepreneurial success. Final results are
expected to be released this fall.<p>

<h3>ENTREPRENEURIAL CAMP HELD FOR YOUNG WOMEN</h3>

By Susan E. Nicol<p>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs'
Office of Women's Business Development, in partnership with
DePaul University's Department of Management, successfully
brought Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago to Illinois this past summer.<p>

For over three years, Camp Entrepreneur has operated as an
award-winning residential camp at Seton Hill College in
Pennsylvania, and has provided comprehensive exposure to the
principles of business ownership to its 100+ young women
graduates. Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago was designed as a week-long
commuter day camp for young women in Cook County entering their
junior or senior year in high school interested in owning their
own businesses.<p>

During the week, the campers participated in hands-on seminars
presented by local business professionals who volunteered to
work with the students in areas such as marketing, financing,
management and effective decision making skills, business
communications and technologies, utilization of resources, and
creating a professional image.<p>

One of the week's highlights included a full day devoted to site
visits to Chicago area businesses that are owned and operated by
women. The campers benefited from the presentations and
following discussions as a diverse group of women business
owners shared their experiences, offering information and
experiences they will reflect upon for the rest of their lives.
Another highlight was the campers' development of their own
business plans, which were presented to a panel of business
experts on graduation day. Drawing upon newly acquired
inspiration, the plans reflected the cumulative knowledge and
skills gained throughout the week and true entrepreneurial
approaches. The panelists were unqualifiably impressed! <p>

Historically, young women have not been exposed to
entrepreneurship as a viable career option, nor have they been
introduced to business skills. Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago
graduated sixteen future leaders who are now positioned to
recognize their ability to run their own businesses, and are
equipped with the tools necessary to visualize their own futures
and to create their own opportunities.<p>

With rave reviews from this year's graduates, sponsors, staff,
and Chicagoland's premier media, the Office of Women's Business
Development and DePaul University are already talking about next
year.<p>

<H3>DCCA to provide census data to small businesses</H3>

<H4>By Ed Taft</H4>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) is establishing a new Business and Industry Data Center (BIDC) Program to provide census data and other usable information to small businesses. Started in 1988 by the U.S. Census Bureau as an extension of its existing State Data Center Program, the BIDC Program will meet the growing need by decision makers for effective use of economic statistics. The Census Bureau intends to use the BIDC Program as a means to increase the public's awareness of economic and demographic data and to make wider use of this data.<P>

DCCA will help meet this need by providing small businesses, independent contractors and future businesses in Illinois convenient access to statistical data and other sources of practical information. Our goal is to enhance the ability of small businesses to plan, market, manage and expand their businesses in Illinois and throughout the world. The BIDC will create a system of regional and local affiliates capable of providing basic information to the small business community, besides completing complex analysis as needed and performing regional economic analyses.<P>

Five Regional Affiliates (RA) will be responsible for collecting and disseminating information to both the end users of the data and to the local affiliates. The RA also will provide a regional economic analysis on a regular basis, furnish expertise in one or more data bases and provide assistance to local affiliates and data users as needed. <P>

Within each region three to five Local Affiliates will be created. Local Affiliates will be responsible for dealing directly with small businesses and other data users; will provide basic census economic and demographic information and other data prepared by the Regional Affiliates or the state; and will offer technical assistance in basic data interpretation. As of press time, centers have been selected and negotiations are proceeding.<P>

The Regional Affiliate will respond to requests that involve more complex analysis or interpretation. For more information on BIDC or to contact your Regional/Local Affiliate, call 217/785-7545.<P>

Ed Taft is the program coordinator of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs' Business and Industry Data Center.<P>

<H3>Dividends:  another success story</H3>

<H4>By Boyd Palmer</H4>

When co-owners Terry Havens and Charles Ross Lohr needed an infusion of capital for their fledgling product development company, Phoenix Paper Products Inc. based in Lostant, Illinois, the Illinois Valley Community College Small Business Development Center (IVCC SBDC) came through by facilitating additional avenues for financial opportunity in the form of private and public financing. And that, the partners agree, made all the difference for success.<P>

The SBDC provides an option for small businesses such as Phoenix Paper Products to access resources that will allow for it to adjust to our rapidly changing economy. Through the management and technical assistance of the SBDC a company can find a way to make their business run more efficiently.<P>

The birth of this venture occurred as a result of the merger of engineering skills of both Haven and Lohr who met by chance while serving on the Wenona city council. An engineer who attended the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, Haven was most recently a partner in C&H Construction Co., a millwright and general contracting company specializing in bulk handling of equipment and facilities. Lohr, who formerly worked for an area company, developed and fabricated machinery, along with methods of introducing shredded newspaper into compression chamber systems using no hydrocarbons or any other source of lubricators which might harm the ecosystem. As a result, both individuals have been recognized in their respective fields by obtaining patents on ideas relating to their environmental concerns.<P>

Consequently Phoenix Paper Products has developed and is in the process of marketing a unique line of environmentally friendly products made specifically from post-consumer newsprint. Currently a majority of the company's future output will be directed and marketed as a substitute for sphagnum peat moss which at the moment is a non-renewable resource imported from the Canadian wetlands. It is expected in time to increase in price as a result of environmental overcultivation. Other disadvantages concerning the use of peat moss are that it's cumbersome to handle, may contain harmful microbes and mining is weather dependent.<P>

Designated product markets for the company include mushroom casings, peat moss replacement for horticulture purpose and cat litter which will be used as both commercial and industrial absorbents.<P>

Thanks to collaboration of the SBDC, First Midwest Bank and the Upper Illinois River Valley Community Development Corporation, the Phoenix Paper Products group have shown with promising results that entrepreneurs can and will effectively utilize the many workable resources provided to Illinois business.<P>

"Organizations such as the Small Business Development Center, staffed with knowledgeable personnel, are critical to the survival and growth of small business," Haven said.<P>

<H3>10 Reasons for Small Business Failures</H3>

<EM>Editor's Note: Portions of this article recently appeared in the Springfield Business Journal.</EM>

<H4>By Freida L. Schreck</H4>

Wanting your own business is part of the American dream that can rapidly turn into an American nightmare when the business fails.<P>

Statistics on business failure are staggering. Some numbers suggest that three out of five businesses fail in the first year. Numbers are important to statisticians. However small business owners aren't as concerned with numbers as they are with reasons. They want to know why business failure rates are so high as well as what can be done to avoid becoming a statistic. I don't have all the answers to the question but I can share with you ten of the most common problems encountered by directors of the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network.<P>

<H4>1. Lack of a business plan</H4>
The primary reason for failure is lack of a business plan. Builders don't start construction without a plan, nor do most people take a vacation without determining a destination, time frame, how much money they are going to need and travel arrangements. A business is going to take a large amount of an owner's time and money, and thus should be given more consideration than a trip to the grocery store.<P>

<H4>2. Lack of market research</H4>
Marketing is a much misunderstood part of a business plan. Conducting market research will assist in determining whether the need for a product or service is perceived or real. Just because family and friends think we have a great idea of a great product does not mean that our potential customer base will too. A marketing survey is the tool that can help an owner understand who the client is and what their needs really are.<P>

<H4>3. Underestimating competition</H4>
Competition is not necessarily bad; it can be healthy for business, some people say that there is "no one out there with anything like mine." Further research usually leads them to the realization that they do not understand what competition means or who the competition is. How can knowing the competition help you be successful? Searching out strengths and weaknesses, pricing, location, product line and customer service policies can provide the information needed to produce your marketing strategy.<P>

<H4>4. Lack of insurance</H4>
It is not uncommon for a business to start on a shoestring. If a line item in the projected budget can be eliminated or postponed it will be. One such line item is insurance. What happens to a business if there is fire, flood or some other disaster? The owner may have the knowledge and skills to continue but how can they replace equipment, furniture, office supplies and computer equipment? Was the cash flow strong enough to allow for a cash reserve? Are there existing loans that would make it difficult to obtain another? If the business is destroyed how much will be lost because of the interruption? A competent insurance agency tailor coverage to meet the needs of a business at a reasonable cost.<P>

<H4>5. Lack of customer service</H4>
We have all heard "the customer is always right." There may be times when we disagree; However customer service is an important key to success. Someone related an incident to me that confirmed my belief that if you can't treat customers with politeness you will lose them. A man came into a small shop to purchase items in excess of $150. When he approached the cash register, he explained that he didn't have the odd pennies necessary and the owner if she would take the even amount. The owner responded, "If you don't have the money, put something back." He did - all of it. I'm sure the story didn't end when the man left the shop. You can be assured that he told all of his friends how rude the owner of the shop was and encouraged them not to shop there. The shop closed within six months of opening.<P>

<H4>6. Lack of experience and knowledge of the industry</H4>
A person may be a great cook and want to start a restaurant but have no idea what it takes to operate one. They don't address some basic concerns such as how much food needs to be prepared each day, what is the cost of food items, how to prepare food items so that the items on an order are ready at the same time, how much to budget for expenses and how much money is needed to start. When giving loans the U.S. Small Business Administration requires three years of experience in the industry. If the owner doesn't meet this requirement, a qualified manager must be hired.<P>

<H4>7. Lack of operating capital</H4>
I can't count the number of times people have told me, "I think I only need $2,000 to start." They try to start on a shoestring and don't realize that lack of capital is the single most common death trap for start-ups. What does adequate operating capital consist of? There are several theories:
Figure start-up costs, then double them.<P>
Start-up costs plus six months protected expenses.<P>
Start-up costs plus one year's projected expenses.<P>

These theories are all adequate but finding out how much capital is needed takes research and planning. Completion of a list of start-up costs is a starting point but must have a projected monthly cash flow statement to accompany it. The monthly cash flow will assist in recognizing what your break even point is and what your monthly expenses may be.<P>

<H4>8. Lack of proper site/location</H4>
"Location - location - location." This statement is often referred to in text books covering business plan development as the most important factor in success or failure of a business. There are many times to consider before selecting the proper site. Consider traffic counts, other business failures in the same location, area demographics and cost of utilities and rental space. Just because it's cheap doesn't make it the ideal spot for a business.<P>

<H4>9. Changes in government regulations</H4>
With today's concerns about the environment and other issues, some businesses are caught in the crossfire because they didn't expect to be mandated to make major modification to meet changing rules and regulations. The modifications can cause severe financial strain.<P>

<H4>10. Lack of fear of failure</H4>
Healthy fear of failure can be a good trait for a small business owner to have. Entrepreneurs are supposed to be "risk takers" but that doesn't mean that they need to think that they are immune to failure. Be cautious and realize that even Fortune 500 companies have failed.<P>

<H3>BALMER ELECTED ISBDA CHAIR </H3>

<H4>By Mark Petrilli</H4>

Montrey Balmer, director of the Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) at Moraine Valley Community College in Palos Hills, was recently chosen as chairperson of the Illinois Small Business Development Association (ISBDA) at the organization's annual meeting in Peoria.<P>

ISBDA is a statewide association organized to support and promote the services provided by the programs that make up the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network (ISBDCN) and other not-for-profit organizations which provide small business assistance. Balmer has served on the coordinating council for ISBDA and is also one of the founding members of the association. <P>

"Montrey is one of the most dedicated and committed members we have," said outgoing ISBDA chair, Denise Mikulski, director of the Small Business Development Center at Joliet Junior College. "She is a pleasure to work with and is largely responsible for the success of our meetings," referring to Balmer's work at organizing the agenda and coordinating the training for the ISBDA spring and fall meetings.<P>

Since becoming director of the Moraine Valley PTAC in 1989, Balmer has counseled over 500 businesses seeking government contracts, assisting them is securing over $40 million in contract awards. Assistance provided to these firms has ranged from general procurement counseling and training to detailed one-on-one counseling in such areas as government marketing, bid preparation, contract administration and electronic data interchange (EDI). <P>

In addition to ISBDA, Balmer has actively participated in many other professional organizations including the National Contract Management Association, the American Defense Preparedness Association and the Association of Government Marketing Assistance Specialists (AGMAS). In 1991 she was recognized by AGMAS as a Certified Contracting Assistance Specialist.<P>

Realizing the importance of keeping up with developments in her field, Balmer has extensive continuing training and education in government procurement in areas such as the federal acquisition process, contract management and electronic commerce.<P>

"Montrey is always willing to support and share information with the other centers," said Lois VanMeter, statewide manager of the Illinois Procurement Technical Assistance Center program. "She is one of the most efficient, effective and capable directors in the state if not the country."<P>

Balmer's unselfishness has not gone unrecognized by her peers. She is a recipient of the Outstanding Communications Award and has been honored as Outstanding Director for her work in the PTAC program.<P>

During her term as chairperson of ISBDA Balmer wants to continue to develop the association's spring and fall meetings as excellent opportunities for the members of the ISBDCN to come together and share information and experiences.<P>

"We also need to continue providing high quality training programs which effectively meet the needs of our membership," Balmer said.<P>

Another area which Balmer would like to emphasize during the coming year is increasing the awareness of the services available through ISBDCN. She wants to continue working closely with the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs to increase the access of the Network by the business community and continue developing the ISBDCN as a vital part of the agency's strategy to serve small businesses in Illinois.<P>

Balmer also believes that ISBDA should take a more pro-active role in keeping legislative and community leaders informed about ISBDCN and its benefits to small business.<P>

For more information about ISBDA and the PTAC delivery system, contact Montrey Balmer at 708/974-5469; TDD Relay, 800/526-0844.<P>

<H3>Edgar expands environmental amnesty</H3>

Governor Jim Edgar announced he is expanding a successful initiative to bring businesses into compliance with environmental laws by encouraging them to cooperate with state regulators.<P>

"Through our innovative 'Clean Break' program, we are protecting both the environment and bottom line by stressing cooperation as a very effective alternative to confrontation," Edgar said.<P>

"In less than a year, we have demonstrated through a pilot program in Winnebago and Boone counties that we can achieve positive results by offering amnesty from heavy fines to those small businesses that truly want to be good citizens," Edgar said.<P>

More than 60 businesses have agreed to come into compliance with environmental laws since Edgar launched "Clean Break" in April 1995. By taking advantage of the program, they spared themselves more than $600,000 in potential penalties for violating environmental regulations.<P>

The expansion announced by Edgar will cover about 4,000 printing operations and 15,000 automobile maintenance businesses statewide. Those businesses are faced for the first time with clean-air permitting requirements, and associations representing them have expressed an interest in participating in the "Clean Break" program.<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, Edgar's senior adviser on economic development, said, "Through this initiative, we have brought common sense back into the regulatory process. It's good for the environment and it's good for employers because it saves them from high legal fees and protracted bureaucratic battles."<P>

The amnesty program allows businesses with no more than 200 employees to anonymously learn from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) what steps must be taken to comply with environmental regulations. After a preliminary assessment, the small businesses may enter into an agreement that establishes a schedule for them to reach compliance and provides them with amnesty from enforcement action. The IEPA also provides the technical assistance needed for the firms to fulfill their commitment. <P>

Dennis Whetstone, director of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) said, "We were delighted to play a role in a project of such sweeping significance and one that is so important to the business community." <P>

To participate in the Clean Break project, any eligible small business may contact IEPA's Small Business Office at 217/524-2743; TDD, 217/782-9143 or DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance Helpline at 800/252-3998; TDD, 800/785-6055.<P>


<H3>EPA limits underground tank liability</H3>

Henry and Gladys Johnson own a small gas station. When the Johnsons decided to upgrade their three underground storage tanks with corrosion protection and spill and overfill prevention to meet U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements, they wanted to get started well in advance of the 1998 deadline. The Johnsons believed that making the upgrades now could prevent leaks later and help them avoid paying possibly higher costs during the 1998 rush. They decided to apply for a loan to begin work on the upgrades right away, and they turned to their local bank.<P>

Armed with their recent tax returns, the Johnsons met with the loan officer of the bank. At the end of their meeting, however, the Johnsons left disappointed. The loan officer "regretted" that the bank could not loan the Johnsons the money they needed. He explained that the Johnsons would need to use the gas station itself as collateral for the loan and, by doing that, the bank could eventually become an "owner" of the station. What if the Johnsons were unable to repay the loan and the tanks should happen to leak? The bank would foreclose on their gas station. The bank would be held responsible for any cleanup costs that might result. Since the bank could not afford that liability -- the so-called "lender liability" -- it would not make the loan.<P>

To help station owners like the Johnsons and to relieve some of the pressure that banks and other lending institutions feel to avoid any risk of liability, EPA has published a new regulation. The new lender liability rule limits the liability of banks and other lenders who hold security interests in property on which petroleum underground storage tanks (USTs) are located. <P>

"We hope that with this rule in place, banks will be more willing to make money available to UST owners and operators who need it to make improvements to their tanks in order to meet environmental regulations," says Lisa Lund, Acting Director of EPA's Office of Underground Storage Tanks. <P>

According to Lund, EPA is particularly concerned about the ability of small UST owners and operators -- the "Mom & Pop" businesses -- to meet the federal UST upgrading and replacement requirements. In the past, lenders have been extremely reluctant to make loans to small businesses such as gas stations for fear of becoming liable for cleanup costs in situations where the business goes bankrupt and the lender takes possession of the property through foreclosure.<P>

Until now, lenders have been very uncertain about the extent of their liability for UST-related problems. Subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) contains a "security interest exemption" that explicitly exempts lenders from liability for clean up of releases from petroleum USTs. However, many lenders don't know about this exemption, and many others don't know exactly what it covers. <P>

More confusion has resulted from court cases regarding Superfund lender liability. In 1994, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated (annulled) EPA's Superfund lender liability rule, which attempted to clarify the security interest exemption in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). The court's decision and EPA's Superfund rule were limited to actions taken under CERCLA. Because it involves actions taken under RCRA, the UST lender liability rule is not affected. However confusion on the part of the public between the two lender liability rules is understandable.<P>

Under the UST lender liability rule, a bank or other lender that issues a loan on an UST or on a property on which the UST is located where the lender holds the property as collateral does not have to meet the federal UST requirements either before or after foreclosure, if the lender meets the following conditions:<P>
Does not engage in petroleum production, refining and marketing<BR>
Does not manage or operate the UST<BR>
Does not store petroleum in the UST after foreclosure<BR>

The rule lists certain actions, including foreclosure, that lenders can take to manage and protect their collateral and still not be held responsible for meeting the federal UST regulations under RCRA Subtitle I. For example, a lender can perform environmental inspections or audits, arrange for cleanup of leaking tanks or close USTs temporarily or permanently without incurring liability under the federal regulations.<P>

In addition, lenders will be able to regularly monitor or investigate the borrower's collateral, business condition and financial health; require that the property be maintained in an environmentally sound manner; and advise the borrower to clean up the property if it is contaminated.<P>

Under this new rule, a lender can foreclose on and sell its UST collateral without incurring Subtitle I liability if there is a current operator at the site who can be held liable for compliance. Otherwise, the lender must empty the UST(s) within 60 days after foreclosure and either temporarily or permanently close the UST(s).<P>

The rule also describes activities that the lender cannot undertake without becoming responsible for UST cleanup costs. For example, a lender who chooses to operate its USTs is not eligible for the regulatory exemption. The lender could be required to clean up any contamination if the tank leaked and may be responsible for meeting the UST technical standards and financial responsibility requirements of Subtitle I.<P>

For additional information on the UST lender liability rule or for a copy of the Federal Register notice, contact EPA's RCRA/Superfund Hotline at 800/424-9346 or the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs' Small Business Environmental Assistance Program at 800/252-3998; TDD, 800/785-6055.<P>


<H3>Regulations Hurt Small Businesses More Than Others</H3>

Despite progress to reduce regulatory burdens on small businesses, the costs of regulation, paperwork and tax compliance continue to fall disproportionately on small firms with fewer than 500 employees, according to a new study prepared by the U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA) Office of Advocacy.<P>

The study, "The Changing Burden of Regulation, Paperwork and Tax Compliance on Small Business," reveals among its major findings that the small business regulatory burden is 1.5 times that of large businesses.<P>

"Small businesses bear 63 percent of the total regulatory burden while accounting for approximately 50 percent of employment and sales," according to Jere W. Glover, the SBA's chief counsel for advocacy. "What becomes obvious from analyzing this study is that small businesses -- the very engine powering the American economy today -- are being unfairly burdened by regulations."<P>

Glover said that the heavier regulatory load carried by small business acts as a drag on a powerful economic engine. "If the economy is going to put the pedal to the metal, so to speak, then something more must be done to release the brake that regulation is imposing on small business."<P>

The study also shows that such an inequitable allocation of regulatory costs is not good public policy and that, to help remedy this, public policymakers need to strengthen the Regulatory Flexibility Act to provide for judicial review for small firms.<P>

The Office of Advocacy research analyzes a number of other studies, especially one by Thomas Hopkins of the Rochester Institute of Technology that attempts to determine the total cost of regulation and to allocate those costs to business and industry by size. The Advocacy study takes the total cost of regulation, allocates it by size and industry and compares the cost per employee in large businesses with the cost per employee in small businesses.<P>

Advocacy's chief counsel presented some of the key findings of the study:<P>

In the Hopkins study, the average cost of regulation per employee in firms with fewer than 20 employees is $5,532; in firms with 20-499 employees, $5,298; and $2,979 in firms with more than 500 employees.<P>
According to the Hopkins study, such disparities mean that the regulatory cost per employee for the smallest firms is 1.86 times than for the largest companies.<P>
While small businesses account for approximately 50 percent of employment as well as about 50 percent of gross domestic product, small firm entrepreneurs bear 63 percent of the regulatory burden on all businesses.<P>
Of these regulatory burdens, the most significant to small firms are tax-and payroll-related paperwork. This paperwork burden is especially regressive in that it falls much more heavily on the small business person.<P>

The results of the Advocacy study were released this past fall at a joint hearing of the U.S. Senate and House Small Business Committees.<P>



<H3>New program helps Illinois manufacturers COMPETE</H3>

Coalition for Manufacturing Performance through Technology (COMPETE) is Illinois' effort to build a statewide system of Manufacturing Extension Centers (MEC). The mission of MECs is to assist small and mid-sized manufacturers with manufacturing technology advancement and modernization services to the point of continuous improvement of business practices within the firm.<P>

A network of geographically-based MECs and specialized centers deliver manufacturing and modernization services such as performance benchmarking, modernization assessments, and engineering and technical consulting.<P>

MECs provide access to appropriate technologies, technical information and specialized technology resources in computer information systems, electronic communications, environmental compliance and pollution prevention.<P>

MECs link to other organizations providing workforce training; business marketing, and management and financial packaging.<P>

Companies can benefit from services through increased sales, reduced expenses, and productivity and quality improvements.<P>

The regional MECs are staffed with engineers and professionals who have practical experience in the manufacturing workplace. These specialists work with a company to make confidential recommendations for improvements. They have access to a wide range of industry experts and the resources of universities, community colleges and private consultants to implement the work plans and improvement projects which the company determines are needed.<P>

MECs are partially funded through the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, as part of the Illinois Technology Challenge Grant program and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.<P>

For more information about the Manufacturing Extension Center in your area call the center nearest you or call the COMPETE Office at 312/814-8759; TDD, 800/419-0667 to learn how your company can benefit from technology, business and workforce development services.<P>

<H3>Governor's Export Awards</H3>

<H4>By Patty Makropoulos</H4>

Acknowledging exports as a vital component of the Illinois economy is an
important factor for continued economic growth. The Governor's Export
Awards were created by legislation to recognize and encourage small and
medium-sized Illinois exporters and organizations that work to promote
export awareness for Illinois products and to highlight the significance of
Illinois in the world marketplace.<P>

Exports are an essential element to Illinois' economic base. In 1994
Illinois exports grew to $26.4 billion representing a 20.2 percent growth
over the previous year. Illinois ranks fifth in the nation among the top
ten exporting states marking the second consecutive year that Illinois has
improved its export ranking. One in eight jobs in Illinois is dependent
upon exports; in the manufacturing sector one in four jobs is a direct
result of exports.<P>

Currently in its third year the awards program is administered by the
Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) as part of the
agency's overall strategy to promote business expansion into global
markets. In 1994 small and midsize enterprises were responsible for more
than one-third of total merchandise exports. These companies play a crucial
role in driving the next generation of U.S. jobs. Companies that are
competing to overcome the "export gap" should apply for this prestigious
award.<P>

Businesses and organizations are recognized for outstanding achievement in
global competition in the following three categories:<P>

1. New to Export - honoring companies that have successfully exported
Illinois products for one to five years<P>
2. Continuing Exporting Excellence - honoring companies that have
successfully exported for more than five years<P>
3. Export Awareness and Development - honoring not-for-profit organizations
involved in the promotion of Illinois exporting and raising export
awareness.<P>

Representatives from DCCA, the Illinois Department of Agriculture, and
Illinois-based trade organizations and firms experienced in international
business comprise the Governor's Export Award Review Committee.<P>

Applications are judged on a total of factors: export sales as a percentage
of total company sales, growth of export sales, number of employees
involved in export sales and distinct factors indicating progressive
international marketing strategies. Deadline for application is March 29.<P>

The Governor's Export Awards will be presented at the Crossing
International Borders Annual Conference on May 16 at the Chicago Hilton and
Towers. The event is sponsored by DCCA's International Business Division
and Arthur Andersen.<P>

For information on obtaining a Governor's Export Award application or for
information regarding the Crossing International Borders Conference call
312/814-2325; TDD, 800/419-0667.<P>

<H3>Environmental Business No Nova</H3>

<H4>By Mark Enstrom</H4>

In November of 1992, at the Illinois Energy Conference in Chicago, I had
the pleasure of meeting Soyini Walton, an energy and environmental
consultant just starting out in her own new business. She had the
educational background, technical expertise, work experience, the desire to
be a success in her future enterprise -- and lots of questions. Where could
she get assistance for marketing, planning, financing and help with the
many other issues and problems she would face? I encouraged her to contact
the Women's Business Development Center (WBDC) in Chicago for assistance.
She made that call. Today, with help from the WBDC, Asset Environmental
Services is a successful, growing business with four employees. In 1995,
one of her personal goals was accomplished as she was presented the "Rising
Star Entrepreneur Award" at the Entrepreneurial Women's Conference in
Chicago.<P>

This story is far from over. You see, a rising star is constantly in
motion, moving higher and faster as time goes by. Congratulations Asset
Environmental Services!<P>

Here is Walton's acceptance speech:<P>

"A rising star - Rises up on the horizon - Reaches it zenith and "glows"
brightly ------and then, it can fall from the horizon and FLASH out of
sight just as quickly as it rose OR...It can settle in among the rest of
the stars and remain a part of the starscape for years and years. I choose
to do the latter, to be one of the stars of the business community for
years to come. In choosing to be a successful business owner, I am learning
one thing: That success is a state of mind. One of my biggest challenges is
to maintain the "success" attitude on a daily basis. And as hard as I work
my business, I work just as hard to achieve the balance so necessary to
maintain a positive state of mine. Yes, success does mean making lots of
money but it also means personal satisfaction, economic stability,
community involvement and being able to offer other people a job.<P>

Success is setting goals and achieving them. When Carol Dougal, Co-director
of the WBDC, ceremoniously handed me a check for $3,500 two years ago, as
one of the first recipients of the microloan program, I said to Carol, "My
goal is to achieve the Rising Star Award," and Carol said to me in her very
direct and challenging way "Oh Honey - I want you to go for the
Entrepreneur of the Year Award" -- encouraging me to set higher goals.<P>

So I stand here today, the proud recipient of the Rising Star Award even
though I have not hit that one million dollars in revenues which I was
convinced was a requirement. And now Carol, I'm ready to work on the next
goal.<P>

As I continue on this journey, this rise up above the horizon, I invite you
to watch me as I grow my energy and environmental engineering business. For
those of you who are my clients, I pledge to help you grow or sustain your
business. And I appreciate the opportunity to serve you. For those of you
who are my mentors, please continue to work with me and to share your
insight and information.<P>

I thank (WBDC Co-director) Hedy Ratner and Carol for working against the
odds to bring the WBDC into being and for maintaining it as an excellent
resource center.<P>

I want to thank my Mama and Daddy, Doris and Russell Ricks, my husband,
Chaga, and my brothers and sisters and extended family. Thanks to all of
you for your support."<P>

Mark Enstrom is the Manager of the Illinois Department of Commerce and
Community Affairs' Small Business Environmental Assistance Program.<P>


<H3>Network Notes</H3>

Amy Shank, director of the Small Business Incubator at the Quincy Business
Technology Center, was named Incubator Director of the Year by the Illinois
Small Business Development Association. NetWorks apologizes for omitting
her name from the previous edition's list of award winners.<P>

There are several new Small Business Development Center (SBDC) directors.
Welcome to Joyce Wade at the Women's Business Development Center in
Chicago, Carmen Jimenez at the Latin American Chamber of Commerce in
Chicago and Charles Slowe at College of Lake County in Grayslake. Wade
replaces Paula Carlin who is now a vice president at Harris Bank and Trust.
Jimenez replaces Arturo Venecia who is now an assistant vice president for
community development at Bank of America. Slowe replaces Art Cobb who is
now the owner of a Heavenly Ham franchise.<P>

Congratulations to Pam See, director of the Procurement Technical
Assistance Center (PTAC) at College of Lake County, and her husband on the
recent birth of their first child. It's a girl!<P>

Timothy Budd, Associate Dean for the Center for Economic Development at
College of Lake County, recently passed away. Budd oversaw the college's
SBDC and PTAC.<P>

<strong>

International Trade Centers (ITC) provide assistance to the new-to-export small businesses in Illinois. Two ITCs also serve as NAFTA Opportunity Centers (NOC), available thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NOCs are specialized resource centers available to current and potential exporters and business assistance providers. NOCs provide information and assistance on export opportunities in Mexico and Canada now.<p>

ITC/NOC services include:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>international market resource data to evaluate key overseas opportunities<p>
<li>identification of potential foreign buyers, agents and/or distributors through trade leads<p>
<li>information and training programs on export procedures, distribution, methods of payment and foreign business practices<p>
<li>an extensive collection of international trade reference materials<p>
<li>access to the Illinois Department of Commerce & Community Affairs' International Business Division<p>
</ul>

The strength of the ITCs and NOCs is the link between the rest of the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network and the Illinois Department of Commerce & Community Affairs' International Business Division. This link allows firms to receive a variety of export programs and services through a three-level export infrastructure comprised of local, state and overseas resources.<p>

<h3 align=center>Coal and Illinois</h3>

Coal was discovered over three hundred years ago in the land that is now recognized as the State of Illinois.  It was first used by railroads to power their steam engines.  Years later many other uses for coal were discovered, and coal mining became big business for the State of Illinois.  Not only did coal mining provide jobs for thousand of residents throughout the State, it also fueled local economies and created spin-off jobs related to the coal industry.  At its peak in the 1920s, the Illinois mining industry employed nearly 100,000 miners.<p>

Today, Illinois ranks fifth among coal-producing states.  Ninety percent of Illinois coal that is mined is purchased by electric utilities.  Although many feel that coal mining and power from coal is rapidly becoming a thing of the past, Illinois is leading the country in proving that coal is, and will continue to be, a viable fuel source demanded well into the 21st century.<p>

The Illinois coal industry will be the first to admit that there have always been some problems associated with burning coal.<p>

The main problem has been the high sulfur content of Illinois coal and the possible danger this chemical can cause to the environment if released into the atmosphere.  With the combined support of the State of Illinois, the U.S.. Department of Energy, Illinois research institutions, the Illinois coal industry and Illinois coal-burning utilities, scientists and engineers have been working on this problem for many years.  That is why Illinois leads the way in new clean coal technologies that remove chemicals from coal such as sulfur, making sure that emissions from power plants that use coal as an energy source will not be harmful to the environment.  They also have been creating new uses for coal by-products to lessen the waste that is created when cleaning or scrubbing coal to remove sulfur and other chemicals.  By scrubbing Illinois coal, we save Illinois jobs, because coal-fired power plants currently generate about half of the electricity used in Illinois.<p>

Without coal and the energy that has been produced from coal over the past several hundred years life would be much different than what you and I know it today.  Just imagine what it would be like to live in a world that did not have electricity, heat or many of the conventional appliances that we used every day.  Coal has made our lives easier since its discovery.  Although many coal mines in Illinois have closed over the past 20 years and other sources of fuel exist today, coal remains as one of our most abundant natural resources, and with help from the Illinois coal industry and others, it will remain a prime source of energy in the years to come.<p>

Illinois Coal Fact Sheet<br>
Coal in Illinois
</h3>
<ul type=square>
<li>Coal was first discovered in Illinois more than 300 years ago.
<li>Mining began in Illinois more than 200 years ago.
<li>Roughly 54 million tons of Illinois coal are mined annually.
<li>Coal underlies 37,000 square miles of Illinois -- about 65 percent of the state's  surface.
<li>Most of the col is bituminous with high energy values (Btu) between 10,000 and 14,000 Btu/lb.
<li>Illinois' coal reserves contain more Btu than the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
<li>Recoverable coal reserves in Illinois (30 billion tons) account for almost one-eighth of the total U.S. coal reserves and one-quarter of the nation's bituminous coal reserves.
<li>Illinois ranks fifth among coal producing states.
<li>It takes less than one pound of Illinois coal to produce one kilowatt-hour of electricity.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3 align=center>Coal Markets</h3>
<ul type=square>
<li>$1.5 billion of Illinois coal mined is purchased by the electric utility industry.
<li>About 90 percent of Illinois coal mined is purchased by the electric utility industry.
<li>Over two-thirds of Illinois coal is sold to out-of-state utilities.
<li>The top seven utility users of Illinois coal are: PSI Energy, Illinois Power, Tennessee Valley Authority, Union Electric, Central Illinois Public Service, Northern Indiana Public   Service, and Georgia Power.  All purchase more than 2.5 million tons of Illinois coal annually. 
<li>States in addition to Illinois that use large quantities of our coal include Indiana, Missouri, Florida, Tennessee and Georgia.
<li>Coal-fired power plants generate about half of the electricity used in Illinois.
<li>Decatur-based Illinois Power burns more Illinois coal than any other Illinois user.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3 align=center>Workforce</h3>
<ul type=square>
<li>Illinois coal is mined in 18 counties.
<li>In 1994, 32 Illinois mines employed about 6,700 miners and generated roughly 33,000 spin-off jobs.
<li>Coal mining accounts for as much as 16 percent of employment and 23 percent of personal      income in individual counties.
<li>The typical coal miner earns $39,000 per year. 
<li>In 1981, Illinois recorded the first fatality-free year in mining history.
<li>6,700 Illinois miners produce as much coal today as 16,000 miner produced in 1970, 28,000 miner produced in 1950, and 61,000 miners produced in 1928.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3 align=center>Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990</h3>
<ul type=square>
<li>The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments have profound implications for the coal industry in Illinois.
<li>The mandates of the Amendments have triggered fuel switching from Illinois' high-sulfur coal to low-sulfur western coal.
<li>One-fifth of Illinois' 1990 coal production and sales could be lost by the end of 1995 and   as much as one-third could be lost by the year 2000.
<li>In addition, between 3 and 5 non-mine jobs could be lost for each mine job lost.
<li>Some Illinois counties will lose a significant portion of their total employment.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3 align=center>Clean Coal Technologies</h3>
<ul type=square>
<li>Illinois' commitment of $138 million towards Clean Coal Technologies (CCTs) has attracted    4200 million in federal funds and $462 million in private and public cost-sharing, supporting 18 clean coal projects within the state.
<li>More than 3 million tons of Illinois' coal production worth $75 million have been sustained   annually as a result of this commitment to CCTs.
<li>Roughly 2,600 mining and non-mining jobs are protected by CCT coal use.
<li>CCT projects mandated by the Illinois state legislature will protect an additional four to five million tons of Illinois coal per year by the year 2000.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3 align=center>Benefits of Scrubbing Illinois Coal</h3>
<ul type=square>
<li>Scrubbing reduces the emissions of SO2 by 90 to 95 percent and can achieve a greater reduction in emissions than with fuel switching.
<li>Burning unscrubbbed western coal produces emissions at a rate of approximately 1 lb. to 1.2   lbs of SO2 for every million Btu of fuel input.
<li>Burning scrubbed Illinois coal could reduce those emissions to somewhere between .3 lbs. and .6 lbs. of So2/miilion Btu.
<li>Scrubbing reduces emissions of other hazardous air pollutants.
<li>Scrubbing Illinois coal saves Illinois jobs.

<h3 align=center>Mining Coal</h3>
<hr>
<h4>What is Coal Mining?</h4>

Mining is the process of getting the coal out of the ground.<p>

<h4>How is coal mined?</h4>

Coal is mined by surface mining or underground mining.<p>

Surface mining is used when a coal seam is located close to the surface.  Heavy equipment is used to clear the land of trees and shrubs.  The topsoil is then removed and saved to be used later.  Holes are drilled into the rock and explosives are placed in these holes.  The explosion breaks up the dirt and rock called overburden.  The overburden is then removed by giant earth-moving machines called draglines.  When the coal is uncovered smaller shovels scoop up the coal and load it into trucks.  Once the coal is mined the overburden and topsoil are replaced.  Then the site is returned to the way it was before mining.<p>



<h4>What kind of mines are in Illinois?</h4>

Most coal mines in Illinois are underground mines.<p>

Underground mining is used when the coal lies in the deeper layers of Earth.  There are three types of underground mines: slope, drift and shaft.  When the coal seam is fairly close to the surface yet too deep to use surface mining, a slope mine can be built, with the mine entrance being a tunnel which slants down from the surface to the coal seam.  A drift mine is a mine in which the entry is directly into a horizontal coal seam exposed at or near the surface.  The most common type is the shaft mine.  These mines may be 400 to 1,000 feet deep.  Miners remove the coal by drilling a hole, or shaft, in the ground until they reach the layer of coal. Once they reach the coal, they dig tunnels in the coal seam.  These tunnels are used for traveling throughout the mine, moving coal from place to place and allowing air to circulate within the mine.<p>


<h4>What kind of underground mining is used in Illinois?</h4>


In Illinois, two types of underground mining are used: room and pillar mining and longwall mining.<p>

Room and pillar mining leaves pillars, or blocks, of coal behind.  Continuous-mining machines are used to remove the coal.  As the machine breaks the coal, large arms gather the coal on a conveyor belt.  The conveyor belt then carries the coal away form the seam. and it is loaded into shuttle cars.  The mining machine is then moved to the next area to be mined.  This method of mining leaves almost half of the coal in the mine.<p>

Longwall mining also uses a continuous-mining machine.  During this type of mining, the machine moves and supports the roof of the mine at the same time.  It has large steel props that help support the roof during mining.  The large spinning drum breaks off the coal and gathers it on a conveyor belt.  Once the coal is removed, the roof is allowed to collapse as the machine moves.  This method allows more coal to be mined since pillars are not left for support.<p>

<hr>
<h4>Who are the people that dig coal from the earth?</h4>


These people are called miners.<p>

Since safety is very important to mining, miners wear and carry several items to help keep them safe.  A hard hat with a battery-powered light is worn for better vision underground.  A self-rescuer, or gas mask, is carried to filter out harmful gas.  To protect their legs, miners wear ankle straps to keep their pants form being caught in machinery.  Safety glasses are worn for eye protection.  Steel-toed shoes are worn to protect their feet form falling rocks, coal and other heavy objects.<p>

Underground mines use special air systems to force fresh air into the mine because of all the dust particles and natural gases that are found underground.  The air is tested and checked regularly for high levels of gas.  Mines are also well lit so the miners can find their way around the mine and operate the equipment safely.<p>

<h3 align=center>Uses of Coal</h3>
<hr>
<h4>How is coal used?</h4>


We use coal in many different ways.  One of the most important ways we use coal is to make electricity.  Power plants burn coal to produce energy in the form of heat for changing water to steam.  The steam turns the blades of a turbine which spins a generator to produce electricity.  About half of the electricity int he United States comes form burning coal.  We use electricity every day in many ways.  Some examples of ways that we use electricity are heating, cooling and lighting our home and cooking and refrigerating our food.  By-products of coal are also used by companies to make items such as steel, cosmetics and tar.<p>

<h3 align=center>Land Reclamation</h3>
<hr>
<p>
<h4>What is land reclamation?</h4>

Reclamation is returning the land to the way it was before mining.<p>

After the coal has been removed by surface mining the reclamation process begins.  The overburden is returned to the same place from which the coal was taken.  A bulldozer smoothes the land.  The topsoil is replaced and the area is replanted.<p>

Some examples of reclamation projects include using the land for ball diamond, parks, campground, wildlife preserves, lakes, trails, golf courses, pasture and farmland.  Driving past these places, you often would not be able to tell the reclaimed land from land that had never been mined.<p>

<h3 align=center>New Technologies</h3>
<hr>
<h4>How does coal effect the environment?</h4>

Over the past several years, scientists, coal companies and others have become concerned about the air we breathe.  They want to make sure that the harmful chemicals that are released into the air when coal is burned do not harm the environment.  Therefore, technologies wee developed to remove these chemicals from coal before, during and after it is burned.  These technologies are called clean coal technologies.  Today scientists are continuing to find ways that will enable coal to be burned cleaner.  As a result, we will have a cleaner and healthier environment.<p>

Dear Members of the General Assembly:<p>

The enclosed information fulfills the statutory directive that the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs report annually to the members of the Illinois General Assembly on the status of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Program.<p>

The purpose of the Enterprise Zone Program is to stimulate economic growth and neighborhood revitalization at the local level through state and local tax incentives, regulatory relief and improved government services.<p>

Since the Enterprise Zone Act was passed by the General Assembly in 1982, the department has designated 91 enterprise zones throughout the state. During Fiscal Year 1995, investments of over $1.5 billion in these designated enterprise zones resulted in the creation of 8,971 jobs and the retention of 13,081 jobs.<p>

Although other factors are undoubtedly involved, enterprise zone designation is a highly important determinant of a business' decision to locate or expand in Illinois. Indeed, we believe that the Enterprise Zone Program is one of the state's most successful economic development tools.<p>

I trust that you will find this 1995 Enterprise Zone Annual Report informative and useful.<p>


Sincerely,<p>


Dennis R. Whetstone<br>
Director<p>

ILLINOIS ENTERPRISE ZONE PROGRAM<br>
Fiscal Year 1995 Annual Report
</h3>
<hr>
<p>
The Illinois Enterprise Zone Act was signed into law December 7, 1982. The purpose of the Act is to stimulate economic growth and neighborhood revitalization at the local level. This is accomplished through state and local tax incentives, regulatory relief and improved government services.<p>

In accordance with the Act, the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) was authorized to designate 88 enterprise zones statewide from 1983 to 1990. As of July 1, 1993, the department has designated all 88 of these authorized zones. Three additional enterprise zones have been certified under the auspices of the Quad Cities Regional Economic Development Authority Act, the Southwestern Illinois Economic Development Authority Act and the Upper Illinois River Valley Development Authority Act.<p>

The following report identifies the guidelines, accomplishments and statistical information of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Program.<p>


<hr>
<h3 align=center>Enterprise Zone Benefits - The Use of Incentives</h3>
<hr>
<h3>STATE INCENTIVES</h3>
<dl><dd>
The Illinois Enterprise Zone Program offers numerous state incentives to encourage companies to locate or expand in enterprise zones. Currently, the following incentives are available:<p>

<h3>Tax Exemptions</h3>

<strong><em>Sales Tax Exemption</em></strong> - A 6.25 percent state sales tax exemption is permitted on building materials to be used in an enterprise zone. The materials must be purchased from a place of business which is located in the municipality or county which has established the enterprise zone.<p>

<strong><em>Enterprise Zone Machinery and Equipment/Pollution Control Facilities Sales Tax Exemption</em></strong> - A 6.25 percent state sales tax exemption is available on purchases of tangible personal property to be used or consumed in the manufacturing or assembly process or in the operation of a pollution control facility within an enterprise zone. Eligibility for this exemption is contingent upon a business making a $5 million investment which causes the creation of 200 full-time equivalent jobs in Illinois or an investment of $40 million for the retention of 2,000 full-time jobs in Illinois, or an investment of $40 million which causes the retention of 90 percent of the existing jobs. The majority of the jobs created or retained must be located in the enterprise zone in which the investment occurs. A business must make application to and be certified by DCCA for this exemption. DCCA also has the authority to determine the length of the exemption. This exemption shall not to be allowed beyond the term of the certified Enterprise Zone.<p> 

The exemption is applicable to the following:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>Hand tools used to maintain, repair or operate machinery and equipment;<p>
<li>Abrasives, acids, polishing compounds or lubricants used or consumed in the manufacturing or assembly process;<p>
<li>Coolants, adhesives, solvents or cleaning compounds used to maintain, repair or operate machinery and equipment;<p>
<li>Manufacturing fuels;<p>
<li>Protective clothing and safety equipment; and<p>
<li>Fuels, chemicals and catalysts used in the operation of pollution control facilities.<p>
</ul>

<strong><em>Enterprise Zone Utility Tax Exemption</em></strong> - A state utility tax exemption on gas, electricity and the Illinois Commerce Commission's administrative charge is available to businesses located in enterprise zones. Eligibility for this exemption is contingent upon a business making a $5 million investment which causes the creation of 200 full-time equivalent jobs in Illinois or an investment of $20 million for the retention of 1,000 full-time jobs in Illinois. The majority of the jobs created or retained must be located in the enterprise zone in which the investment occurs.<p>

A business must make application to and be certified by DCCA for the state utility tax exemption. DCCA also has the authority to determine the term of the exemption, not to exceed twenty years, and the percentage of the exemption. Local units of government may further exempt their public utility taxes on gas, electricity and water for eligible businesses.<p>

<h3>Tax Credits</h3>

<strong><em>Enterprise Zone Investment Tax Credit</em></strong> - A state investment tax credit of .5 percent is allowed a taxpayer who invests in qualified property in a zone. Qualified property includes machinery, equipment and buildings. The credit may be carried forward for up to five years. This credit is in addition to the regular .5 percent investment tax credit which is available throughout the state as well as a .5 percent credit for businesses that increase their employment in Illinois by one percent over the preceding year.<p>

<strong><em>Jobs Tax Credit</em></strong> - The Enterprise Zone Jobs Tax Credit allows a business a $500 credit on Illinois income taxes for each job created in the zone for which a certified dislocated worker or economically disadvantaged individual is hired. The credit may be carried forward for up to five years. A minimum of five eligible employees must be hired to qualify for the credit.<p>

<h3>Income Tax Deductions</h3>

<strong><em>Dividend Income Deduction</em></strong> - Individuals, corporations, trusts and estates are not taxed on dividend income from corporations doing substantially all their business in a zone.<p>

<strong><em>Interest Deduction</em></strong> - Financial institutions are not taxed on the interest received on loans for development within an enterprise zone.<p>

<strong><em>Contribution Deduction</em></strong> - Businesses may deduct, from taxable income, double the value of a cash or in-kind contribution to an approved project of a designated zone organization.<p>
</dd></dl>

<hr>
<h3>LOCAL INCENTIVES</h3>
<dl><dd>
Local governments may provide a variety of local incentives to further encourage economic growth and investment in enterprise zones. The incentives offered are determined by the local governments. The following list is not inclusive but serves as an example of the most common local enterprise zone incentives offered:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>Abatement of property taxes on new improvements;<p>
<li>Homesteading and shopsteading programs;<p>
<li>Waiver of business licensing and permit fees;<p>
<li>Streamlined building code and zoning requirements; and<p>
<li>Special local financing programs and other resources.<p>
</ul>

The Enterprise Zone Program is a state and local partnership.  It emphasizes a creative coalition of state and local government, business, labor and community groups to encourage economic growth in the enterprise zones.<p>

The success of the zone depends, in large part, on local commitment.  Supervisory responsibility for administration of the program rests with DCCA, but determination of specific economic development objectives, selection of incentives and day-to-day administration of the enterprise zone is the ultimate responsibility of the participating community.<p>

The economic activity described in this report is based on data submitted to DCCA by local enterprise zone administrators.  These data are collected on a quarterly basis.  The data only reflect economic activity that occurred after the issuance of a building permit or certificate of eligibility obtained from the local zone administrator.  Investments not requiring a building permit or certificate of eligiblity are not reported in this publication.  DCCA aggregated the data to reflect annual economic activity occurring in each zone for FY94.  Multiple investments by an individual firm occurring throughout a fiscal year may, in some cases, retain the same jobs.<p>

Enterprise Zone Tax Questions & Answers<br>
March, 1996
</h3>

The Illinois Enterprise Zone Act took effect December 7, 1982.  An enterprise zone is a specific area designated by the State of Illinois in cooperation with a local government to receive various tax incentives and other benefits to stimulate economic activity and neighborhood revitalization.<p>

The Enterprise Zone Program is administered at the state level by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs.  For general information on the program, contact the Department at 312/814-2319 in Chicago, or at 217/785-6142 in Springfield.  The hearing impaired may call at 312/419-0667 in Chicago or at 217/785-6055 in Springfield.<p>

Enterprise zones range from a half square mile to fifteen square miles.<p>

<h3>INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT</h3>

<strong>What is the enterprise zone investment tax credit? </strong><p>

The Illinois Income Tax Act 35 ILCS 5/201 (State Bar Edition, as amended) allows a .5 percent credit against the state income tax for investments in qualified property which is placed in service in an enterprise zone. <p> 

<strong>Who are qualifying taxpayers? </strong><p>

The credit may be taken by corporations, trusts, estates, individuals, partners and Subchapter S shareholders who make investments in qualified property and who otherwise meet the terms and conditions established by statute.<p>

<strong>What is qualified property? </strong><p>

"Qualified property" is property which:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>is tangible; whether new or used, including buildings and structuralcomponents of buildings;
<li>is acquired by purchase as defined in Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 179(d);
<li>is depreciable pursuant to IRC Section 167;
<li>has a useful life of four or more years as of the date placed in service in an enterprise zone;
<li>is used in the enterprise zone by that taxpayer;
<li>has not been previously used in Illinois in such a manner and by such a person as would qualify for the credit; and,
<li>is an improvement or addition made on or after the date the zone was designated to the extent that the improvement or addition is of a capital nature, which increases the adjusted basis of the property previously placed in service in an enterprise zone and otherwise meets the requirements of qualified property.
</ul>

<strong>What are examples of "qualified property"?</strong><p>

Examples include buildings, structural components of buildings, elevators, materials tanks, boilers, and major computer installations.  Examples of non-qualifying property are land, inventories, small personal computers, trademarks, typewriters, and other small, non-depreciable, or intangible assets.<p>

<strong>What does "placed in service" mean? </strong><p>

Qualified property is "placed in service" on the earlier of 1) the date the property is placed in a condition of readiness and availability for use, or 2) the date on which the depreciation period of that property begins.  To qualify for the enterprise zone investment tax credit, the property must be placed in service on or after the date the zone is certified by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, and on or before the last day of the firm's taxable year.<p>

<strong>What is "depreciable" property? </strong> <p>

Property must be depreciable pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 167.  Depreciable property is used in the taxpayer's trade or business or held for the production of income (but not inventory) which is subject to wear and tear, exhaustion or obsolescence.<p>

There are some types of assets that may not be depreciable, even though they are used in the taxpayer's business or trade or are held for the production of income.  Good will and land are examples.  Other examples of tangible property which are not depreciable are inventories, natural resources and currency.<p>

<strong>Does "used" property qualify for the enterprise zone investment tax credit?</strong><p>  

Used property does not qualify if it was previously used in Illinois in such a manner and by such a person as would qualify for either the statewide investment tax credit or the enterprise zone investment tax credit.<p>

<em>Example:</em>	A corporation purchases a used pick-up truck for use in its manufacturing business in an enterprise zone from an Illinois resident who used the truck for personal purposes in Illinois.  If the truck meets the other requirements for the investment tax credit, it will not be disqualified because it was previously used in Illinois for a purpose which did not qualify for the credit.  However, had the corporation purchased the truck from an Illinois taxpayer in whose hands the truck qualified for the credit, the truck would not be qualified for the investment tax credit, even though the party from whom the truck was acquired had never received an investment tax credit for it.<p>

<strong>What is the "basis" value of property? </strong><p> 

The "basis" value of property, for the purposes of this credit, is defined the same way it is defined for purposes of federal depreciation calculations.  Essentially, the basis is the cost of the property, as well as related capital costs.<p>

<strong>Does the enterprise zone investment tax credit carry forward?</strong><p>  

Yes.  The credit is allowed for the tax year in which the property is placed in service, or, if the amount of the credit exceeds the tax liability for that year, the excess may be carried forward and applied to the tax liability of the five taxable years following the excess credit year.  The credit must be applied to the earliest year for which there is a liability.  If there is credit from more than one tax year that is available to offset a liability, the credit accruing first in time is applied first.<p>

<a name="Sales Tax Deduction"><hr></a>
<h3>SALES TAX DEDUCTION</h3>

<strong>What is the sales tax deduction?</strong><p>

The "Retailers' Occupation Tax Act" 35 ILCS 120/5k (State Bar Edition, as amended) provides that:  "Each retailer whose place of business is within a county or municipality which has established an enterprise zone pursuant to the "Illinois Enterprise Zone Act" and who makes a sale of building materials to be incorporated into real estate in such enterprise zone by remodeling, rehabilitation or new construction, may deduct receipts from such sales when calculating the tax imposed by this Act."<p>

<strong>What is the retailer's role?</strong><p>

A retailer who is located within the municipality or unincorporated area of a county which has an established enterprise zone and who makes a sale of building materials to be incorporated into that enterprise zone may offer a point of sale exemption of the sales tax and deduct the receipts from those sales on the retailer's sales tax return.  The retailer does not charge sales tax on these sales.<p>

<strong>Who is an eligible retailer?</strong><p>

Any retailer whose place of business is within the corporate limits of the municipality or within the unincorporated area of the county that authorized the enterprise zone is eligible to deduct receipts from such sales when calculating the tax imposed by the "Retailers' Occupation Tax Act" (ROTA).<p>

<strong>How does the enterprise zone sales tax deduction effect the Regional Transit Authority Retailers' Occupation Tax (RTA ROT), the Metro-East ROT, the County Water Commission Tax and the County Supplemental Tax?</strong><p>

Once the gross receipts from sales of building materials are excluded from the Illinois Retailers' Occupation Tax base by virtue of exempted building materials, these receipts are also excluded from the RTA and the Metro-East ROT base.<p>

<strong>What is the purchaser's role?</strong><p>

The purchaser must give the retailer a signed Purchaser's Statement providing the address of the property located within the enterprise zone and attesting that the materials purchased will be incorporated into that property only.<p>

<strong>Do all retailers offer a point of sale exemption?</strong><p>

No.  Retailers are not required by law to participate.  The purchaser must ask the retailer for cooperation on this incentive.  Retailers have, however, demonstrated good  cooperation throughout the history of this program, as this incentive permits them to give customers a "break" without cost to themselves.<p>

<strong>What qualifies as "building materials" eligible for the sales tax deduction?  </strong><p>

Building materials that are eligible for the enterprise zone sales tax deduction include items that are permanently affixed to real property such as lumber, mortar, glued-down carpets, paint, wallpaper and similar affixed items. <p> 

<a name="EZ Machinery & Equipment Sales Tax"><hr></a>
<h3>EZ MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT SALES TAX EXEMPTION</h3>

<strong>What is the EZ Manufacturing Machinery and Equipment (M, M & E) Sales Tax Exemption?</strong><p>

The Revenue Act 35 ILCS 120/1d-1f (State Bar Edition, as amended) allows a business enterprise that is certified by DCCA, as making a $5 million  investment that either: creates a minimum of 200 full-time equivalent jobs in Illinois; or retains a minimum of 2,000 full-time jobs in Illinois; or which retains 90% of the existing jobs, a 6.25 percent state sales tax exemption on all tangible personal property which is used or consumed within an enterprise zone in the process of manufacturing or assembly of tangible personal property for wholesale or retail sale or lease.  This exemption includes repair and replacement parts for machinery and equipment used primarily in the process of manufacturing or assembling tangible personal property for wholesale or retail sale or lease, and equipment, manufacturing fuels, material and supplies for the maintenance, repair or operation of manufacturing, or assembling machinery or equipment.<p>

<strong>How does a business become eligible for the M, M & E Sales Tax Exemption?</strong><p>  

To be eligible for this incentive, DCCA must certify that the business has made an investment of at least $5 million in an enterprise zone and has created a minimum of 200 full-time equivalent jobs in Illinois or has made an investment of at least $40 million in an enterprise zone and has retained a minimum of 2,000 full-time jobs in Illinois or has made an investment of $40 million in an enterprise zone and retained 90 percent of the jobs in place on date of certification.  A business must submit an application to DCCA documenting the eligible investment and that the job creation or job retention criteria will be met.<p>

<strong>What is an eligible investment?</strong><p>  

For purposes of this incentive, eligible investment may be either:  1) investments in qualified property as defined in the Enterprise Zone Investment Tax Credit (described on Page 2 of this publication); or, 2) non-capital and non-routine investments and associated service costs made for the basic construction, renovation or improvement of qualified property including productive capacity, efficiency, product quality or competitive position.  Regular maintenance and routine expenditures are not included.<p>

<strong>Are eligible sales limited to the units) of government sponsoring the zone?</strong><p>

No.  Items eligible for the 6.25 percent state sales tax exemption may be purchased anywhere in Illinois.<p>

<strong>What tangible personal property is eligible for the M, M & E sales tax exemption?  </strong><p>

To be eligible for this exemption the tangible personal property must be directly used or consumed in the process of manufacturing or assembling tangible personal property for wholesale or retail sale or lease.  Examples of this include:  repair and replacement parts; hand tools; materials and supplies such as abrasives, acids or lubricants; protective clothing and safety equipment; and, any fuel used for machinery and equipment.<p>

<strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong>  The above examples are only exempt to the extent they are used with machinery and equipment that qualifies for the statewide Manufacturing Machinery and Equipment Sales Tax Exemption.

<a name="Uitlity Tax Exemption"><hr></a>
<h3>UTILITY TAX EXEMPTION</h3>

<strong>What is the Utility Tax Exemption?  </strong><p>

The Public Utilities Act 220 ILCS 5/9-222.1 (State Bar Edition, as amended) allows a business enterprise that is certified by DCCA, as making an investment in a zone that either creates a minimum of 200 full-time equivalent jobs in Illinois or retains a minimum of 1,000 full-time jobs in Illinois, a 5 percent state tax exemption on gas, electricity and the Illinois Commerce Commission .1 percent administrative charge.  Local units of government may also exempt their taxes on gas, electricity and water.<p>

<strong>How does a business become eligible for the Utility Tax Exemption?</strong><p>

To be eligible for this incentive, DCCA must certify that the business makes an investment of at least $5 million in an enterprise zone and has created a minimum of 200 full-time equivalent jobs in Illinois or makes an investment of at least $20 million in an enterprise zone and has retained a minimum of 1,000 full-time jobs in Illinois.  A business must submit an application to DCCA documenting the eligible investment and that the job creation or job retention criteria has been met.<p>

<strong>What is an eligible investment?</strong><p>

For purposes of this incentive, eligible investment may be either:  1) investments in qualified property as defined in the Enterprise Zone Investment Tax Credit (described on Page 2 of this publication); or, 2) non-capital and non-routine investments and associated service costs made for the basic construction, renovation or improvement of qualified property including productive capacity, efficiency, product quality or competitive position.  Regular maintenance and routine expenditures are not included.<p>

<a name="Jobs Tax Credit"><hr></a>
<h3>JOBS TAX CREDIT</h3>

<strong>What is the enterprise zone jobs tax credit?  </strong><p>

The enterprise zone jobs tax credit 35 ILCS 5/201 (State Bar Edition, as amended) offers employers a tax credit on their Illinois income taxes for hiring individuals who are certified as economically disadvantaged or as dislocated workers.<p>

<strong>How much is the tax credit?</strong><p>

An employer who conducts a trade or business in an enterprise zone is allowed a credit of $500 per eligible employee hired to work in a zone during the taxable year.  Any unused portion of the credit may be carried forward five years.  The credit must be applied to the earliest year for which there is a tax liability.<p>

<strong>How do employers qualify for the jobs tax credit?</strong><p>

To qualify for the credit:  a minimum of five eligible employees must be hired in a zone during the taxable year; and, the taxpayer's total employees must increase by five beyond the total employed in the zone at the end of the previous tax year for which a jobs tax credit was taken.<p>

<strong>What individuals qualify as eligible employees for the Jobs Tax Credit?</strong><p>

An employee must be:  1) certified by a Substate Grantee (SSG) or Service Delivery Area Administrative Entity (SDA) as "eligible for services" under Titles II or III of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA); 2) employed in an enterprise zone where the employee either works in the zone or the zone is the base of operations for the services performed; and, 3) employed at least 180 consecutive days for 30 or more hours per week.<p>

<strong>How do employers obtain jobs tax credit eligible individuals?</strong><p>

An employer should list job openings with the local SSG or SDA, note that the business is within an enterprise zone, and specify that the business seeks to hire workers certified as eligible for services under Titles II or III of JTPA.  If employers have job applicants who have not been referred by the SSG or SDA, they can offer to determine if they are eligible.  Eligible individuals will be issued a Jobs Tax Credit Certification Voucher to present to prospective employers.  When a person is hired, the employer keeps the voucher for tax records.  That is all the paperwork required.<p>


<a name="Property Tax Incentives"><hr></a>
<h3>PROPERTY TAX INCENTIVES</h3>

There are two types of property tax incentives related to the Enterprise Zone Program:  tax abatement and assessment reduction.  Assessment reduction is available in Cook County only.<p>

<strong>What is the enterprise zone property tax abatement incentive?  </strong><p>

The Revenue Act 35 ILCS 200/18-170 (State Bar Edition, as amended) provides that any taxing district may order the county clerk to abate (that is, to give up) any portion of its taxes on real property, or on any particular class thereof, located within a zone and upon which new improvements have been constructed or upon which existing improvements have been renovated or rehabilitated.<p>

<strong>Are taxes reduced on the current value of the property (or on existing improvements)?</strong><p>

No.  The abatement applies only to taxes on the increase in assessed value attributable to the new construction, renovation, or rehabilitation.  Taxes based on the assessed value of land and existing improvements continue to be extended and collected.<p>

<strong>If property tax abatement is authorized, are new improvements made to property located within a zone assessed?  </strong><p>

Yes.  By law, every time property is improved, it is reassessed.<p>

<strong>What is the Cook County assessment reduction incentive?  </strong><p>

Cook County offers special property tax incentives for property anywhere in the county.  However, property in enterprise zones receives special consideration under the Class 6b - Industrial Program.  Industrial property in Cook County is generally assessed at 36 percent of market value.  Under the special incentives, improvements to enterprise zone property are assessed at 16 percent of market value for 8 years.  The tax rate remains the same, but a company's tax liability drops because the rate is being multiplied by a much smaller property value.  This program also applies to the purchase of existing buildings in enterprise zones, provided that the buildings have been vacant for 24 continuous months.<p>

<strong>Why is this available only in Cook County?  </strong><p>

All other counties assess all property at 33 percent of market value.  Cook is the only county that classifies property at different assessment rates.<p>

<strong>What is the process for obtaining these incentives?  </strong><p>

For tax abatement, contact local zone administrators to find out if abatements are available in their zone.  Most of the property tax abatements and the Cook County program require taxpayers to apply or give some formal notice before beginning construction.  Contact the local zone administrator, and, if applicable, Cook County as early as possible to assure that eligibility is not denied due to tardy notice.<p>

<strong>How do these incentives affect the multiplier?</strong><p>  

They don't.  The multiplier or equalization factor is the application of a percentage increase or decrease, generated by the Illinois Department of Revenue, in order to adjust assessment levels in various counties to the same percentage of full value.  Multipliers are not effected by the enterprise zone property tax abatement provision or by county assessment reductions.<p>

<strong>Does the abatement of taxes on improvements in an enterprise zone affect the tax rate?  </strong><p>

Yes, however in most cases the effect will be marginal.  Tax rates depend on the levy (amount of tax revenue the local government is raising) and the size of the tax base (total equalized assessed valuation of the district less homestead exemptions, plus the value of any State assessed property).  Under normal circumstances, the tax rate for a district is calculated by dividing the district's tax levy by its tax base.  The greater the tax base, the lower the rate needed to generate the amount of the levy.<p>  

Under the Enterprise Zone Program, the value of abated property is subtracted from the tax base prior to the calculation of the tax rate.  In most cases, the tax base is large enough and the enterprise zone abatements are low enough that the overall effect is negligible.<p>

<strong>How does the enterprise zone property tax abatement provision in 18-170 of the Revenue Act differ from the property tax provision in 18-165?</strong><p>

The enterprise zone provision is broader and more flexible.  The enterprise zone property tax abatement:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>may be offered on all classes of real property, including commercial, residential and industrial (18-165 abatements are limited to commercial and industrial improvements).<p>
<li>may be offered for any number of years, up to the termination date of zone certification (18-165 abatements cannot exceed 10 years).<p>
<li>may be offered by a taxing district in any amount (the abatement offered under18-165 limits the aggregated amounts of an abatement offered by all taxing districts to $3,000,000).<p>
</ul>

<strong>Can property tax be abated in a tax increment financing district (TIF)? </strong><p>

Tax increment financing is a financing technique that cities may use to pay for public improvements such as land assemblage, building demolition, utilities, streets, and sidewalks.  Property owners in the project area do pay their full share of taxes.  Taxes generated by the increase in assessed valuation -- the tax increment -- go into a special allocation fund used to pay the bonds which financed the public improvement costs.  This financing method is not a tool to speculatively prepare for development -- tax increment financing requires an advance commitment by a developer to a project.<p>

Property tax abatement is, however, a tool that is used for development.  It is not a financing technique.  The Revenue Act provides that any taxing district, upon a majority vote of its governing authority, may order the county clerk to abate any portion of its taxes on improvements made to real property located in a zone.  The increase in assessed valuation due to new construction, rehabilitation or renovation is not taxed for the term of the abatement as set by local ordinance.<p>

A TIF district may be included in the legal description of the zone and consequently be eligible to receive other tax incentives and benefits, but the property tax abatement provision must exclude the TIF district from the area eligible for abatement.<p>

<strong>Am I automatically entitled to a 100 percent abatement? </strong><p> 

No.  Eligibility criteria and abatement formulas are established by local ordinance and vary with the zone.  Contact the zone administrator to determine the amount of abatement offered, the number of years of abatement, and the classes of real property eligible for abatement.<p>

<a name="Income Tax Deduction"><hr></a>
<h3>INCOME TAX DEDUCTION FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS</h3>

The Illinois Income Tax Act 35 ILCS 5/203 (State Bar Edition, as amended) provides that financial institutions in Illinois, such as banks and savings and loans, are eligible for a special deduction from their Illinois corporate income tax return.  Such institutions may deduct from their taxable income an amount equal to the interest received from a loan for development in an enterprise zone.  This is limited to the interest earned on loans or portions of loans secured by property which is eligible for the enterprise zone investment tax credit, described on Page 2 of this publication.  Please refer to the section on the investment tax credit for a definition of eligible property.<p>

<a name="Dividend Deduction"><hr></a>
<h3>DIVIDEND DEDUCTION</h3>

<strong>What is the dividend deduction?  </strong><p>

The Illinois Income Tax Act 35 ILCS 5/203 (State Bar Edition, as amended) provides that taxpayers may deduct from their taxable income an amount equal to those dividends which were paid to them by a corporation which conducts substantially all of its operations in an enterprise zone or zones.<p>

<strong>Can dividends from companies like Commonwealth Edison be deducted?  </strong><p>

No.  The firm must conduct substantially all of its operations within a zone or zones, and firms with locations throughout the state (such as Commonwealth Edison, GTE, Pioneer, AT&T, Sears, Occidental Petroleum, etc.) do not fit this definition.<p>

<strong>Who is an eligible taxpayer?  </strong><p>

Individuals, corporations, partnerships, trusts and estates are eligible to take the dividend deduction on their Illinois income tax returns.<p>

<strong>Which dividends may be subtracted?  </strong><p>

Only dividends paid on or after the date of zone certification or before the last day of your taxable year may be deducted.<p>

<strong>Is there a list of companies doing substantially all their business in enterprise zones?</strong><p>

No.  Corporations must be contacted directly to verify their eligibility.<p>

<a name="Corporate Contribution Deduction"><hr></a>
<h3>CORPORATE CONTRIBUTION DEDUCTION</h3>

<strong>What is the corporate contribution deduction?</strong><p>

The Illinois Income Tax Act 35 ILCS 5/203 (State Bar Edition, as amended) provides that corporations may make donations to designated zone organizations for projects approved by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, and claim an income tax deduction at double the value of the contribution, to the extent that 1) the contribution qualifies as a charitable contribution under Section 170, Subsection (c) of the Internal Revenue Code; and 2) the Department approves the amount and type of contribution which may be claimed as a deduction.<p>

<strong>What is a designated zone organization?</strong><p>

Only an organization that meets the eligibility criteria set forth in the Enterprise Zone Act, including approval from the local government and the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, is a designated zone organization.  For a list of these groups, contact local zone administrators or call the Department at 217/785-6142.<p>

<strong>Who is an eligible taxpayer? </strong><p>

Only corporations may deduct twice the amount of a cash or in-kind contribution made to a designated zone organization project.<p>

<strong>What is an approved contribution?</strong><p>

In order to deduct twice the amount of a contribution, the contribution must be approved by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs and must be made to an approved designated zone organization.<p>

<a name="Tax Incentive Administration"><hr></a>
<h3>TAX INCENTIVE ADMINISTRATION</h3>

<strong>Are tax incentives and other benefits offered on a case-by-case basis?  </strong><p>

No.  "Case-by-Case" is contrary to the intent of the Enterprise Zone Act.  Tax incentives must be offered uniformly and equitably by class.  The local ordinance authorizing tax incentives, such as property tax abatement, extends the incentives automatically through eligibility criteria, such as class of property (i.e., residential, commercial and industrial) and formulas (i.e., percentages and number of years available).<p>

<a name="Additional Information"><hr></a>
<h3>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</h3>

<strong>What other incentives are available?</strong><p>

Please refer to the Enterprise Zone Description Handbook for specific descriptions of state and local incentives in any particular zone.  These incentives may include financing assistance, write-down of land costs, waiver of building fees, relaxation of local codes, and other benefits.  If you would like additional information on how the Department can help small businesses, call our Business Hotline at 800/252-2923.<p>

<strong>Where can income tax forms be obtained?  </strong><p>

Income tax forms are available from the Illinois Department of Revenue (DOR) at P.O. Box 3545, Springfield, Illinois  62708, or at 100 West Randolph, Chicago, Illinois  60601.

Dear Small Businessperson:<P>

As Governor of Illinois, I am convinced that is is important for the State 
to address small business' concerns and problems in an effective manner.  
The economic and environmental well-being of small business is essential to 
the well-being of Illinois.  We must protect the environment and at the
same time facilitate a business climate where small businesses flourish and 
prosper.<P>

I am presenting in this report the recommendations of the Governor's Small 
Business Environmental Task Force.  This document represents a
collaborative effort of numerous small business representatives, local 
chambers of commerce, trade associations, attorneys, the Illinois 
Environmental Protection Agency, and the Illinois Department of Commerce 
and Community Affairs to address the concerns that small businesses have in 
complying with environmental laws and regulations.
<P>
Already, implementation is beginning on key recommendations contained in 
this report.  The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, in cooperation 
with the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs and key business 
associations, is actively developing informational materials that will 
clearly guide specific business through the maze of environmental laws and 
regulations.  Informational videos that will demonstrate cleanup and other
environmental activities are in the production stage.  And legislation is 
under consideration that would provide tax incentives for small businesses 
that take action to address their environmental problems.
<P>
I would like to thank you, the members of the business community.  We
asked you to be candid with us and to make recommendations to us on how to
help you meet your environmental responsibilities.  You responded 
enthusiastically, giving hours of your time and expertise.<P>
<P>
I am delighted that this task force is taking the next step, working with 
my administration to implement the recommendations that have been set 
forth.  I look forward to the continuation of this cooperative effort as 
through this new found partnership we ensure a healthy environment and a 
Healey economy.
<P>
                                        Sincerely,
<P>
                                        Jim Edgar<BR>
                                        Governor<P>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>
     In July of 1993 the Governor's Small Business Environmental Task Force 
was launched.  This collaborative effort between the Illinois Environmental 
Protection Agency (Agency) and the Illinois Department of Commerce and 
Community Affairs (DCCA) was established to reach out to one of the most 
critical and one of the most vulnerable links in the economic chain: small 
business.  <P>
     Complementing the efforts of the Task Force were two extensive Agency 
outreach initiatives.  These initiatives were aimed at getting input from 
the broader small business community in Illinois.  To reach this business 
sector, the Agency worked with local chambers of commerce across the state 
and held nearly two dozen meetings.  The meetings gave Agency staff the 

opportunity to hear first hand from many small businesses.  Additionally, 
the Agency is cooperation with DCCA, conducted a survey of nearly 5,000
small businesses in Illinois.  <P>
     Through that survey, small business owners across the state told the 
Agency about the problems they have in understanding and complying with 
Illinois' environmental requirements.  Those expanded outreach efforts 
served to further crystallize the understanding that small business is the 
backbone of the State's economy.  More than 300,000 small businesses in 
Illinois provide jobs to Illinoisans and supply goods and services to 
citizens in this state, across the country, and around the globe.  But 
while these small businesses are a critical link in economic chain, they 
also are critical link in the environmental chain.  Like larger businesses, 
they have an impact on the environment and face many complex environmental 
laws and regulations in operating their businesses.  Understanding those 
laws and regulations is often a daunting challenge, to which many small 
business owners do not have the staff or money to dedicate.<P>
     Just as the economic well-being of the state is dependent on small 
business, the environmental well-being of the state also depends on small 
business.  The issues examined by the Task Force and the recommendations 
they have produced recognize the "real world" concerns of small business 
and propose broad steps to address those concerns.  Implementation of the 
recommendations will open the doors of communication between small business 
and state agencies.  Implementation also will enable strong measures to be 
taken to assist small businesses in their compliance efforts.  The 
recommendations recognize that, to accomplish their joint goals, small 
businesses and state government must work together in partnership wherever 
possible.
<P>

<a name="Goals"><hr></a>
<H3>Goals of the Task Force</H3>
     To respond to small businesses concerns, a number of goals were 
established for the Task Force.  These goals reflect the commitment that 
Governor Jim Edgar, IEPA, and DCCA have made to address the problems of
small businesses, and to ensure both the economic and environmental 
well-being of our state:

<ul type=square>
     <li>Identify and articulate the issues, concerns, and problems that small 
businesses encounter with environmental laws and regulations, so that they 
can be addressed effectively.
<P>
<li>     Develop creative ways of using both the public and private sectors to 
assist small businesses to better address their environmental concerns and 
problems.<p>
<li>     Improve communication and understanding between small businesses and 
state government agencies.<p>
<li>     Develop a variety of plans and methods to enable small business to 
better understand environmental issues and requirements.<p>
<li>     Streamline and coordinate the environmental requirements, so that the 
environment can be well protected in the least burdensome manner to small 
businesses.<p>
</ul>

<a name="Organization"><hr></a>
<H3>Organization of the Task Force</H3>

     The Task Force began its work in July of 1993, with an ambitious 
schedule for studying the issues, reaching out to small businesses, 
developing recommendations, and delivering a report to the directors of the 
IEPA and DCCA by December of 1993.<p>
     At its initial meeting, the Task Force created four workgroups.  The 
workgroups were composed of small businesspeople, associations, and 
attorneys.  They were developed to address specific areas of concern:  
compliance, education, permits and technology.  Subsequently, in response 
to a suggestion made at a local small business meeting, a fifth workgroup, 
the financial workgroup, was formed to address financial concerns faced by 
small businesses in meeting environmental compliance costs.  Each of the 
workgroups had a defined scope of work and was composed principally of 
member so the Task Force.<p>
     These workgroups embarked on an intensive two-month effort to develop 
recommendations for consideration by the full Task Force.  Recommendations 
of the initial workgroups to the Task Force were largely completed by the 
end of September, 1993 and submitted to the Task Force for review.  The 
Task Force then considered the recommendations at a series of meetings, 
reaching a consensus on a set of Task Force recommendations and determining 
the future role of the Task Force in November, 1993.  Thereafter, the Task 
Force developed this final report.<p>
<dl>
     <dt><STRONG>Education Workgroup: </STRONG> <dd>The Education Workgroup focused on educational 
and information efforts that could assist small businesses, looking at what 
documents or methods could be developed to help small businesses better 
understand what is needed to plan and to operate their businesses in 
compliance with the environmental laws and regulations in Illinois.<P>

    <dt> <STRONG>Compliance Workgroup: </STRONG><dd> The Compliance Workgroup focused on the 
concerns that small businesses have in understanding and meeting the
environmental compliance requirements in the state, including problems in 
the compliance process itself.<P>
     <dt><STRONG>Permit Workgroup:  </STRONG><dd>The Permit Workgroup identified and examined the 
various permitting requirements that apply to small businesses and examined 
such issues as how a small business can determine what permits are needed, 
how the application process works, small business/agency interactions 
during the application process, and the problems small businesses have in 
understanding permit requirements.  This included an examination of how the 
permitting process, including the application process, could be streamlined 
to help small businesses.<P>
    <dt><STRONG> Technology Workgroup:  </STRONG><dd>The Technology Workgroup focused on identifying
computer and other "high tech' alternatives that could help small 
businesses in understanding environmental requirements, filing permit
applications, submitting reports, doing recordkeeping, and other 
environmental activities.  The Workgroup also considered the use of videos 
and other technologies to assist small businesses.
<P>
    <dt> <STRONG>Financial Workgroup:  </STRONG><dd>The Financial Workgroup focused on informational 
needs that small businesses have in determining how to obtain financing to
meet the costs of environmental compliance and on whether there is a need
for any additional programs to aid small businesses in meeting those costs.<p></dl>
     Each of the workgrups discussed and developed recommendations.  There 
was a great deal of participation and interest by Task Force members in 
each of these workgroups, as can be seen in the recommendations contained 
in this report.
<P>

<a name="General Findings"><hr></a>
<H3>General Findings of the Task Force</H3>
<P>
     In additional to the specific recommendations that are included in 
this report, the Task Force identified a few general points that must be 
addressed in dealing with small business problems.  These can be grouped 
into a few categories.<P>
     First, the Task Force identified a widespread and pervasive "fear 
factor" among small businesses.  The Task Force heard a common refrain 
again and again:  Many small businesses fear the environmental regulations 
themselves, the implementation of those regulations, or both.<P>
     A number of bases for this fear exist.  The paramount fear is that the 
cost of complying with the regulations will put the company out of 
business.  However, other fears are important as well, including a few by 
small businesses that they cannot determine whether they need a permit or 
multiple permits from the Agency.  They cannot understand the multitude of 
regulations that may apply to them.  There also is a fear that the Agency 
will be rigid and insistent on literal compliance in all instances.  
Related concerns include the costs associated with having to hire an 
environmental consultant or an attorney.<P>
     As a result of the "fear factor", many small businesses try to avoid 
the environmental regulatory system and interaction with the Agency and may 
even avoid making an attempt to identify what regulations might apply or 
whether they need a permit.  Members of the Task Force find this is a 
serious problem that must be addressed.  As a result, many of the 
recommendations focus on those concerns.<P>
     The second key area is understanding what must be done in order to 
comply with the applicable regulations.  This concern is nearly as 
pervasive as the first and many recommendations addressing this issue have 
been developed by each of the workgroups.<P>
     The Task Force also emphasized the need for widespread publicity in 
order to help overcome the "fear factor" and to make small businesses in 
Illinois aware of the many Task Force recommendations that will be useful 
to them.  The Task Force believes it is especially important that small 
businesses are aware of the Agency's willingness to address their concerns.  
This will contribute a necessary step to the communication and openness 
that will be required to make the small business initiative effective.
<P>

<a name="Educations"><hr></a>
<H3>Education Recommendations</H3>
<P>
     The Task Force believes that much of the noncompliance that may be 
found in small businesses today does not result from a desire by those 
businesses to circumvent their obligations, but rather from a lack of 
understanding or information on the part of businesses as to the 
regulations that apply to them.  In essence, this education process may be 
similar to that which occurred with the advent of environmental regulation 
some years ago when larger entities were subject to regulation for the 
first time.  It is believed that an education process is a two-way street 

requiring efforts by both the regulated community and the regulators.
<P>
     The clear consensus of the Task Force is that is is important that the 
Agency, in partnership with private parties and associations, aggressively 
work to provide educational resources to small business owners.  Once these
resources are developed, a catalog of available materials should be
provided to interested parties.  These resources would allow small 
businesses to be educated about what is available for purposes of ensuring
their business is in compliance with applicable Illinois environmental
regulations.<P>
     The Task Force has divided its recommendations into four categories:  
publications, avenues of communication, education, and general principles.  
In this section, a priority level is given to each category.<P>
     The Task Force also determined that a fundamental problem in the
current system with respect to regulation of small businesses is a lock of 
satisfactory means for disseminating information to small businesses.  To 
address the problem, the Task Force agreed that representatives of 
associations and chamber of commerce would, in many cases, provide the best
method for reaching out to small businesses.  Therefore, it was decided by 
the Task Force that the agency should actively seek out partnerships with
these associations to better enable it to reach various business entities.<P>
     The Task Force believes that the educational efforts recommended can 
contribute significantly to overcoming this "fear factor" that is
widespread among small businesses.
<P>

<CENTER> <STRONG> 1. Publications</STRONG></CENTER><dl>
<dt>Recommendation 1<BR>
     <dd>Comprehensive informational documents should be prepared and written 
in lay terms for each major group in the Standard Industrial Code.  These 
would serve as guides to explain the environmental requirements applicable 
to small businesses in each such category.<P>
<dt>Explanation:<BR>
     <dd>Because some small businesses do not have the resources to dedicate 
individuals solely to following environmental regulations, it is critical 
that information be provided to help them understand their obligations.  
     After much discussion, the Task Force determined the use of SIC Codes
would be an effective way to develop appropriate categories.  Such codes 
are somewhat standardized and because of their common usage would be a
readily available means of identifying the various industries to small 
business owners.  The guide should include information on permit
requirements, methods to determine which rules may apply, as well as 
compliance, pollution prevention, and other information that may be 
determined to be relevant.  These documents should be developed with input 
from affected businesses, as well as relevant trade associations.  This is
a high priority.
<P>
<dt>Recommendation 2<BR>
     <dd>General publications should be developed to provide information on 
environmental matters that may affect them.<p>
<dt>Explanation:<BR>
<dd>     In addition to specific documents for a given industry, the Task Force
recognized that similar general information also will be needed to assist 
small businesses, particularly with respect to industries not covered by 
the more specific documents discussed in Recommendation 1.  In addition, 
since many small businesses are dealing with regulations for the first

time, the publications should discuss laws and regulations, as well as 
explanations on how to participate in the regulatory process.  Guides also 
should be developed on how to interact with the Agency, particularly with 
respect to inspections and enforcement.<p>
     Again, these documents should be developed with input from small 
business operators and others in the private sector with relevant 
experience. 
<P>
This recommendations is a high priority.<p></dl>

<CENTER> <STRONG>II.Education</STRONG></CENTER><dl><BR>
<dt>Recommendation 1<BR>
     <dd>The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois 
Department of Commerce and Community Affairs should develop a system 
whereby seminars geared to small businesses are presented throughout the
state.<p>
<dt>Explanation:<BR>
     <dd>Publications of environmental regulations are insufficient in 
presenting the total picture.  Therefore, it would be appropriate to 
provide small businesses with the opportunity to attend seminars on 
relevant topics.  Since resources will limit the Agency's ability to 
implement some recommendations, it is believed that the private sector 
should help fill this role.  Associations and/or chambers of commerce could
sponsor seminars with the cooperation of the Agency, environmental 
attorneys, and consulting firms.  This recommendation is a high priority.
<p>
<dt>Recommendation 2<BR>
     <dd>Mentoring programs or similar techniques should be developed to 

facilitate sharing and assistance by large businesses to aid smaller 
businesses in understanding environmental obligations.<P>
<dt>Explanation:<BR>
     <dd>The Task Force was advised that some large businesses with educational 
capabilities are interested in assisting small businesses.  However, the
Task Force recognize that the different perspectives of small, medium, and 
large businesses may inhibit the success of a mentoring program.  
Therefore, the Task Force recommends that in the event medium or large 
businesses are willing to provide training, a pilot program should be 
developed to determine interest in such opportunities.  A clearinghouse of 
volunteers to answer questions might also be developed.  This recommendation
would be pursued as a pilot program.  This recommendation is a not a high 
priority.
<P>
<dt>Recommendation 3<BR>
  <dd>   Video libraries and computer diskettes containing educational and 
informational materials should be developed.<p>
<dt>Explanation:<BR>
     <dd>Small business operators may be unable to attend a class, and some 
informational brochures may be more technical than can be easily
comprehended.  It is suggested that a library of media other than written 
materials be developed and catalogued.  For example, remediation operations 
or inspections could be videotaped for playback for small businesses 

concerned about those situations.  Seminars could be videotaped for use by 
small businesses at a later date.  Computer programs could be developed to 
assist in completion of permit applications and other forms.  The Task
Force sees this as a long-term, rather than an immediate goal.  The Agency 
should be alert to opportunities to archive its activities for cataloging. 
This recommendation is not a high priority.<p>
</dl>
<CENTER><STRONG>III. Communication Avenue</STRONG></CENTER><dl>
<dt>Recommendation 1<BR>
     <dd>Partnerships should be developed between trade associations, chambers 
of commerce, and state agencies to help communicate useful information to 
businesses affected by environmental regulations.<P>
<DT>Explanation:<BR>
<DD>     Representatives of the chamber and associations on the Task Force
unanimously agreed to act as conduits for the dissemination of information 
from the Agency in newsletters, publications, and meetings.  Since 
association newsletters and trade journals are widely ready by small 
business owners, the Agency should undertake an aggressive campaign to have 
articles and/or information available to these publications for their 
inclusion.  Recognizing that meetings are a regular aspect of associations,
the Agency should develop a speakers bureau of its personnel who would be 
available for presentations to such meetings.<P>
This recommendation is a high priority.<P>

<DT>Recommendation 2<BR>
<DD>     A program should be implemented to seek small businesses' input in the 
development and adoption of environmental regulations.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     Rulemaking may have great impact on a small business.  However, small 
businesses typically do not have a full-time staff to monitor such 
developments.  Therefore, it is imperative that the Agency aggressively 
undertake to include small businesses, either individually or represented 
through associations, in the development of these regulations.  Without 
these efforts, small businesses will continue to be adversely affected
without an adequate opportunity to provide input into the rules that 
ultimately impact them.  Some efforts also must be made in the Agency to 
advise potentially affected businesses of regulations that will be 
developed.  This may include the development of a semi-annual regulatory 
agenda such as that published by the United States Environmental Protection 
Agency, or by early notification of trade groups once it is apparent that a 
regulation will be developed at some time in the future.  This
recommendation is a high priority.
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 3<BR>
<DD>     The Agency should develop a strategy to disseminate information to the 
popular press such as business journals and local newspapers regarding 
programs affecting small business.<P>
<DT>Explanation:<BR>
<DD>     The Task Force believes that this would be a low cost, efficient means
of reaching businesses not otherwise involved in associations or trade
groups.  It is important that business journals, particularly in the
Chicago and St. Louis areas, be reached because most businesses read such

publications.  Therefore, information from the Agency on small business 
environmental programs would reach a greater population.  This 
recommendation is a high priority.<P>

<DT>Recommendation 4<BR>
<DD>     An environmental newsletter geared towards small businesses should be 
published by the Agency.<P>
<DT>Explanation:<BR>
<DD>     This newsletter should include information on regulations, deadlines,
technical information such as pollution, and other matters of interest to 

small businesses.  This newsletter would be mailed to chambers of commerce,
business associations,a and other individuals.  If some of the other avenues 
are developed adequately, the importance of this document may be lessened. 
This recommendation is not a high priority.<P></DL>

<CENTER><STRONG> IV. General Principles</STRONG></CENTER>
<DL>
<DT>Recommendation 1<BR>
<DD>     Pollution prevention information should be integrated into all efforts 
produced pursuant to the Education Recommendations.<P>
<DT>Explanation:<BR>
<DD>     The pollution prevention office of the Agency should actively seek to
provide assistance to small businesses in adapting their processes and
materials to prevent pollution, thus eliminating the need to comply with 
various regulations.  If a pollution prevention technique exists to remove
a business from regulation, that may be the most cost efficient method of 
complying.  This recommendation is a high priority.
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 2<BR>
<DD>     The Agency should review its programs, policies and practices to 
ensure that they encourage and facilitate compliance by small businesses in 
the most cooperative and expeditious manner possible.
<DT>Explanation:<BR>
<DD>     Prior recommendations recognize that small businesses have an
obligation to learn the requirements applicable to their operations.  
Similarly, the Agency has an obligation to conduct its operation in a 
manner that encourages and maximizes compliance by small businesses in 
order to meet its mission of providing the best possible environment for 
the citizens of the State of Illinois.  This can best be achieved in a 
cooperative, non-adversarial manner whenever possible.  This recommendation 
is a high priority.
<P></DL>
<CENTER><STRONG> Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER>
     Some effective means are already in place to help reach small 
businesses, e.g., through associations and chambers of commerce.  Those 
entities may act as go-betweens to help alleviate the "fear factor", which 
many small businesses may be experiencing.  An improved environment can be 
achieved if businesses are better informed of their environmental 
responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="Compliance"><hr></a>
<H3>Compliance Recommendations</H3>
<P>
     The general consensus among the Task Force is that a large number of 
small businesses are out of compliance in Illinois.  Many small businesses 

are afraid of the Agency because the environmental requirements and the 
regulatory system in general are perceived as a threat to the business'
continued existence.  Further, the Task Force believes that this perception 
of small businesses is to some degree true, and that the current regulatory 
system, particularly as related to enforcement, acts as a disincentive for 
many small businesses to come into compliance.  This stems from a
combination of factors, some of which other recommendations address:
uncertainty over the applicability of permit and control requirements, lack 
of knowledge of the enforcement process, uncertainty over the amount of 
penalties likely for violations, and related factors.<p>
     Consequently, the Task Force structured its compliance recommendations 
to achieve two major objectives.  The first objective is to bring as many
small businesses into environmental regulation as possible, in a 
non-threatening manner where possible, and to bring those businesses into
compliance, thereby reducing future threats to the environment as well as 
to business.  For this reason, the Task Force recommends that the Agency 
develop and implement an amnesty program.  It is believed that such a
program has the potential to bring a substantial number of small business 
that might not otherwise be reached into compliance on a voluntary basis.<P>
     The second major objective is to keep small businesses in regulation 
and in compliance without threatening their existence.  The recommendations
following the amnesty recommendation are designed to achieve the second
objective.  All of the following recommendations in some way are designed 
to make the environmental regulatory system a little more accommodating for 
small businesses.<P>
  <DL>  
<DT>Recommendation 1<BR>
     <DD>In cooperation with small businesses and working with the Office of
the Attorney General and the Pollution Control Board, the Agency and DCCA 
should seek to develop a small business amnesty program that will provide a 
one-time opportunity for small businesses to opt into a no-penalty
compliance program, taking into account the federal and practical
limitations of such a program and nay legal and environmental constraints.<P>
<DT>Explanation:<BR>
<DD>     The Task Force believes there are a substantial number of small 
businesses that are currently operating in noncompliance with one or more
regulatory requirements.  Some of the businesses have some knowledge of 

environmental requirements but are unsure if the requirements are 
applicable to them and are afraid to find out.  Some are unaware of 
environmental requirements in general.  Some know they are operating in
violation, but are afraid if they attempt to come into compliance they will 
subject themselves to large monetary penalties and thereby jeopardize their 
business.  It is believed that the Agency is unaware of the identity of 
many of these businesses.<P>
     A carefully structured and well organized amnesty program would bring
a large number of small businesses into the regulatory program, which
should lead to a substantial increase in compliance both during the amnesty 
period and in the future.  For these reasons, the Task Force recommends
that the Agency implement an amnesty program.<P>
     While agreeing to recommend an amnesty program is relatively easy, 
reaching a consensus on the nature of such a program is much more
difficult.  The Task Force agrees that the ultimate goal of any amnesty
program is increased compliance.  Increased compliance as a goal argues for 

an amnesty program that is as broad as possible.  However, there are other 
factors that must be considered:  the salability of the program; both state 
and federal equity factors, such as should intentional violations be 
treated the same as non-intentional violations be treated the same as 
non-intentional; and whether serious health-threatening violations or 
criminal violations should be treated the same as inconsequential 
violations.<P>
     These issues prompted a sustained, thought-provoking discussion among 
Task Force members.  In the end, the Task Force agreed upon a general 
recommendation for an amnesty program.  This decision was made to allow all 
interested groups to have the opportunity to provide input into the 
development of the program.<P>
     The tax amnesty program implemented some years ago by the Illinois 
Department of Revenue was discussed as a model for the program.  It was 
very successful and was carried out with the acknowledgement that an 
amnesty program is "inequitable" on its face.  The key issue is whether an 
environmental amnesty program would achieve enough positive results to 
outweigh the inequities, which might result from certain applications.  The 
Task Force agreed that models such as the tax amnesty program should be 
reviewed in designing and supporting an environmental amnesty program.<P>
     The Task Force strongly believes that the success of the program would 
be directly related to efforts to publicize the program, with adequate lead 
time needed to enable the business community to respond.  In addition, the 
educational efforts contained in the Education Recommendations may be a 
necessary prerequisite to a successful amnesty program.  This 
recommendation may need to be adopted by a legislative amendment.<P>
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 2
     <DD>The Task Force recommends that the Agency, in cooperation with small 
businesses, develop a simplified enforcement process for small businesses 
and minor infractions.  The Task Force recommends that authority be given, 
through concurrence by the Office of the Attorney General, to the Director 
of the Agency to settle noncompliance matters, (including any penalty or 
other transfer of value) by agreement among the parties, and without the 
use of administrative citations or referral to the Office of the Attorney 
General.  Such authority would not preclude any parties from involving the 
Office of the Attorney General, if it is so desired.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The current enforcement process is very complicated and resource 
intensive, both for the business involved and the State.  The Task Force 
recommends that an enforcement process for small businesses be developed 
that is simpler and less expensive.  In particular, the Task Force 
recommends that the Agency be given authority to informally reach 
compliance agreements, including payment of any penalty or other transfer 
of value, avoiding the current formal enforcement process completely.  Such 
an approach could result in an enforceable contractual agreement, which 
would accomplish the same objectives as the current process at greatly 
reduced cost and with increased efficiency.<P>
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 3
<DD>     The Task Force recommends that the Agency develop a written penalty 
guidance applicable to small businesses.  Such a guidance should recognize 
that frequently financial resources for small businesses are severely 
limited.  The guidance also should provide:<P>
<UL type=square>
<LI>September  6, 1994    An incentive for self-reporting, such as a 50% reduction 
in penalty.
<LI>September  6, 1994    A credit mechanism for money spent for overcompliance.
<LI>September  6, 1994    A credit mechanism for implementation of pollution 
prevention measures.
<LI>September  6, 1994    An escalation factor for those that could have 
participated in an amnesty program but did not do so.
<LI>September  6, 1994    A recognition factor for payment or contributions to 
other government, community, or local public service organizations that contribute to 
local, community or state improvement. [See also Recommendation 6]

     The penalty guidance should be limited to use in negotiated 
settlements.</UL>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The existing enforcement process is keyed to the maximum penalties, as 
provided for in the Illinois Environmental Protection Act, of $50,000 per 
violation and $10,000 each day the violation continues.  As a practical 
matter the maximum penalty is almost never assessed.  However, the maximum 
numbers are a major contributor to the fear factor, which causes many small 
businesses to avoid environmental requirements to the extent possible.  
Many small businesses to avoid environmental requirements to the extent 
possible. Many small businesses would be bankrupted by an assessment of a 
penalty that could be handled by a larger business.  For this reason, the 
Task Force recommends a penalty policy specifically applicable to small 
businesses, which takes into account the limited resources of many small 
businesses.  The Task Force further recommends that the policy contain 
several credit factors that would credit the good faith of a company in 
self-reporting, in spending resources for compliance above and beyond that 
required by the regulations, and for implementing pollution prevention 
measures.  The Task Force also recommends a recognition factor that would 
both recognize payments or contributions to local public service 
organizations, government, community, or state organizations for the 
betterment of the community where the environmental problems occurred.<P>
     On the opposite side of the coin, the Task Force recommends an 
escalation factor for those companies that could have participated in an 
amnesty program but did not do so.  The Task Force believes that the 
penalty should be higher where there is bad faith or clear negligence by a 
business in not addressing violations that could have been resolved within 
the amnesty program at an earlier date.  In addition, the Task Force 
believes the threat of an escalation factor is important to the success of 
an amnesty program.<P>
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 4
<DD>     The Task Force recommends that the Agency and DCCa develop a program 
for identifying consultants who will offer small business consulting 
services.  Such a list should be made available to small businesses to 
assist them in obtaining compliance assistance.  The Task Force further 
recommends that the Agency and DCCA develop a guide that will assist small 
businesses in selecting consultants and in managing projects in which 
consultants are involved.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     Many small businesses find it very difficult to locate qualified and 
competent consultants, to afford, monitor and understand the activities of 
a consultant, and to determine whether their work has been or is 
acceptable.  Thus, to the extent possible, the Task Force recommends that 
the Agency and DCCA assist by providing a list of consultants that will 
provide services to small businesses.  In addition, the Task Force 
recommends that a guide be developed that would assist a small business in 
selecting a consultant and in managing a project, e.g., dividing a project 
into manageable segments.<P>
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 5
<DD>     The Task Force recommends the Illinois Environmental Protection Act be 
amended to allow the 35 day time frame for permit appeals by extended by a 
maximum of 90 days by mutual agreement of the applicant and the Agency to 
provide more time to negotiate solutions to problems that may be posed by a 
permit.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     When a company receives a permit from the Agency, it often contains a 
condition that the company finds unacceptable.  The company then has two 
options: to appeal or to attempt to negotiate with the Agency to remove or 
modify the condition in a manner that is acceptable.  However, if the 
company wishes to protects its right to appeal, it must file a petition 
with the Pollution Control Board within 35 days.<P>
    Frequently, a company will be negotiating with the Agency in an 
effort to find a mutually agreeable solution, and the company is forced to 
file its petition for appeal in order to protect its right to appeal.  This 
is time-consuming and expensive.  The Task Force's recommendation would 
allow the parties - the applicant and the Agency - to mutual agreement to 
extend the deadline for filing an appeal by up to a maximum of 90 days to 
allow more time to negotiate a mutually satisfactory result, and thereby 
avoid the time, effort and expense of an appeal.<P>
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 6
<DD>     The Task Force recommends that a program be developed to provide 
recognition of those businesses doing positive things for the environment, 
especially actions beyond those required by law.  This program should 
provide incentives for businesses to take positive environmental actions.  
At a minimum, it should include recognition either by publicity or a letter 
from the Agency that businesses could use with their customers.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The Agency's programs are primarily designed to recognize and penalize 
non-compliance (enforcement) or to assure compliance (permits).  This 
contributes to an anti-business image of the Agency.  A strong program of 
positive reinforcement for those companies that do comply, and particularly 
for those companies that do more than the minimum required by the 
regulations, would provide recognition of those efforts and improve the 
Agency's image.  A letter of commendation or a certificate complemented 
with a news release would be appreciated by businesses.  Such recognition 
could be displayed within the company and might even be of assistance in 
promoting the business.<P></DL>

<a name="Permit Recommendations"><hr></a>
<H3>Permit Recommendations</h3>
<dl>
<DT>Introduction
     <DD>The Task Force spent considerable time discussing difficulties that 
small businesses have in determining whether they need none or more of the 
permits issued by the Agency.  The Task Force agreed that is is a threshold 
issue that needs to be dealt with in order to assist small businesses with 
the permit process.  The Task Force concluded that a series of publications 
of general use explaining how to deal with the Agency during the permitting 
process.  This publication would address many of the concerns that were 
expressed by small businesses, including:  how to complete an application, 
how to get assistance in the application process when necessary, how to 
deal with the Agency once an application has been submitted, and how to 
resolve any differences that might arise during that process or after the 
issuance of a permit.
<P>
     The Task Force also discussed a number of specific areas it believes 
would provide regulatory relief without compromising the protection of the 
environment.  From this, a number of recommendations were developed such as 
the expansion of the general permit approach, evaluation of permit 
exemptions, and the simplification of permit application forms and 
procedures.  There also was a discussion of how the permit document could 
be changed to help small businesses understand the requirements that apply 
to them.<P>
     The order of the recommendations that follows is not a prioritization 
of the recommendations.  The Workgroup considered eight of the nine 
recommendations to be high priority items.
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 1
<DD>     The Agency should investigate the feasibility of developing an 
operating permit renewal system that provides small business applicants 
with an application form that includes the base information already in the 
Agency files.  The form also would request current or new information 
necessary for processing of the application and request verification of the 
base information.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     There is a widespread belief among members of the Task Force that 
simplification of the permit application process is important.  In order to 
address this concern in the permit renewal application area, the Task Force 
recommends that a system be developed similar to that recently used by the 
Agency's Bureau of Air for the annual emission report.  The Task Force 
believes that if the Agency could supply applicants with a printout of 
information already available to the Agency, this also could serve as an 
application and greatly facilitate the process for small businesses.  This 
form should highlight key pieces of information in order to encourage an 
applicant not to simply rubber stamp previous information as correct.  The 
form also would request any new information required since the previous 
application.
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 2
<DD>     Where appropriate, interactive computerized permit systems should be 
developed or some other form of electronic communication, where disks would 
be sent by the Agency to permit applicants and returned to the Agency as 
permit applications.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The Task Force discussed different methods for facilitating the 
permitting process for small business.  While all small businesses do not 
have computers available to them, the sense of the Task Force is that the 
vast majority of small businesses at least own a personal computer.  
Therefore, the Task Force agreed that the development of an interactive 
computer permit system would assist many small businesses initially, and 
many more small businesses over time.  This recommendation encourages 
development of simple, user-friendly computer disks, which could be mailed 
to small businesses with a notice of renewal, completed by small businesses 

on their personal computers and mailed back to the Agency.  The Task Force 
believes that the issues of how to get a legal, authorized signature to 
accompany the application could be handled simply to cover letter with the 
proper authorization contained in the letter, perhaps on a form prepared by 
the Agency.
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 3
<DD>     The Agency should attempt to expand the "general" permit approach, such 
as that used for stormwater permits, into new areas where the permitted 
businesses are similar enough to allow standardized terms and conditions.  
These general permits should allow businesses to voluntarily opt into such 
a permit in order to foster prompt and efficient processing of permit 
applications and consistent treatment of similar businesses.  The scope of 
each general permit should be limited to a particular suitable type of 
permit.  Multi-media general permits should be avoided except for specific 
interrelated permits such as permits for air strippers at LUST sites, as is 
currently done for groundwater remediation permits.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The Task Force believes a general permit approach, such as that used 
by the Agency's Bureau of Water for stormwater permits, could be very 
helpful to small businesses in areas where businesses are similar and would 
allow such standardization.  It is recommended that each Bureau within the 
Agency review all areas where a significant number of similar sources might 
exist and try to develop general permits in those areas.  There was a 
special interest in providing such general permits in areas where other 
actions or programs could be delayed by the need for a permit from another 
Bureau.  The Task Force believes that the use of general permits by a 
business should remain a voluntary option wherever possible.
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 4
<DD>     A cooperative effort of the public and private sectors a should be 
developed to provide information, education, and assistance to small 
businesses on how to adjust or modify their business activities in order to 
reduce permit requirements applicable to their businesses.  This effort 
should include information on pollution prevention and other related 
methods.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The Task Force agreed that efforts to simplify permitting requirements 
for small businesses should include a concerted effort to assist small 
businesses in modifying their activities, or voluntarily limiting their 
activities in a manner that would eliminate the need for certain types of 
permits where they are not essential.  The effort of the Agency's Bureau of 
Air to provide federally enforceable state operating permits in lieu of the 
Clean Air Act permit is the type of option that could greatly assist small 
businesses if similar efforts could be made in other permit areas.  This 
may require the cooperation of the Agency and various associations in order 
to disseminate information about the availability of such programs and 
methods to determine whether a specific small business could make use of 
such a program.  The Task Force agrees that inclusion of such methods as 
pollution prevention and process modification could be very helpful in 
those areas as long as the Agency ensures that small businesses receive the 
information.
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 5
<DD>     The Agency should develop a steamlined and efficient system that would 
allow applicants to obtain information via telephone inquiry on the status 
of a pending permit application.  An attempt should be made to computerize 
such a system and allow electronic access by applicants to the application 
status information.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The Task Force believes that easy access by a small business to 
information on the status of its permit application is very important.  
This stems from the fact that knowing when an operating permit will be 
acted upon can be critical to a small business.
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 6
<DD>     A cooperative effort should be undertaken, where appropriate, to 
simplify permit application forms and procedures required of small 
businesses.  A through simplification of permit application forms should be 
undertaken for sources in different industrial categories and coordinated 
with the development of informational guides for industrial categories.  
This should be undertaken with awareness that some similar terms used in 
one permit program may have different meanings pursuant to federal and 
state law when used in another permit program.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The Task Force agrees that the permit application process is at times 
difficult and expensive for small businesses.  Therefore, a very high 
priority has been placed on simplification of the permit application forms 
with a particular goal of providing forms that a small business could 
complete without great expense.  The Task Force recognizes that this is a 
large undertaking.  Therefore, the Task Force believes that this review 
should be coordinated with the Education Recommendations to develop 
information guides for various industrial categories to assist small 
businesses in understanding both permitting and compliance requirements.  
The Task Force believes that caution must be taken in this simplification 
process to avoid confusion, which might result between different permit 
systems, many of which are predetermined by federal law.
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 7
<DD>     In cooperation with small businesses, the Agency should prepare a 
publication, or series of publications, on how to deal with the Agency 
during the permit process.  The publications should cover a range of 
issues, from how to determine whether a permit is needed to implementation 
of the requirements within an issued permit.  A separate publication on how 
to determine whether a business needs an air, land, or water permit should 
be developed.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     This recommendation grew from the sense of the Task Force that many 
small businesses know very little about the permit requirements or the 
permit processes of the Agency.  Since these are critical requirements for 
small businesses and essential to helping small businesses achieve 
environmental compliance, an effort to produce the appropriate 
informational publications is critical.<P>
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 8
<DD>     In cooperation with small businesses, the expansion of permit 
exemptions for small businesses should be carefully evaluated by the 
Agency, in order to eliminate permit requirements where there is no clear 
existing need.  For air pollution permits, this evaluation should be 
coordinated with the federal development of air toxic rules for sources 
that may be affected by those rules.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     This recommendation reflects the view of the Task Force that permit 
requirements for small businesses should be eliminated unless clearly 
necessary.  This is based on the assumption that some of the permit 
requirements applicable to small business may no longer be necessary.  
Expansion of the permit exemptions would provide considerable regulatory 
relief for small business.  The Task Force is aware that certain developing 
federal and state requirements, particularly the development of the air 
toxic program under the Clean Air Act, might prevent some exemptions.  
Therefore, the Task Force believes that any review of permit exemptions 
should take federal requirements into account in their development.<P>
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 9
<DD>     In cooperation with small businesses, the Agency should evaluate the 
format and structure of permits to determine whether changes can be made to 
make the permit document itself more understandable and useful to small 
businesses.  Changes to make permits into compliance information documents 
(similar to the federal air and water operating permit programs) should be 
created without making the documents too cumbersome.  Time lines for 
reporting and compliance activities should be included.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The Task Force endorsed the general idea of developing permit 
documents that, when issued, would provide small businesses with a single 
source of information reflecting all the requirements that small businesses 
must meet in order to be in compliance with environmental regulations in a 
particular area.  It is believed that this would greatly enhance the 
ability of small businesses to know whether they are in compliance and 
allay fear that there are other requirements unknown to a small business, 
which they also must meet.  The Task Force believes this effort should be 
undertaken with sensitivity to make the documents as clear as possible.  In 
particular, the Task Force believes that creating permit documents that 
organize reporting and record keeping requirements and provide compliance 
time lines would be very helpful to small businesses.<P>
</DL>

<a name="Technology Recommendations"><hr></a>
<H3>Technology Recommendations</H3>
<dl>
<DT>Introduction
<P>
<DD>     The Task Force evaluated a number of technological systems to 
determine if they could help small businesses understand and meet 
environmental requirements.  In particular, the Task Force focused on 
computer systems that would be helpful to small businesses.  In doing so, 
the Task Force evaluated computer bulletin board technology, interactive 
permits, electronic filing, and computerized record keeping and reporting.<P>
     In general, the Task Force believes the technologies under 
consideration are supportive of the recommendations and should, therefore, 
generally be developed in concert with the implementation of the other 
recommendations, particularly the Education and Permit Recommendations.<P>
     The Task Force agreed that use of these technologies should begin as 
pilot projects.  This would ensure that ensure that resources would not be 
<P>
wasted developing an extensive system that would not be useful small 
businesses.  For example, the Task Force recommends a pilot project be 
initiated to develop an interactive computer system for permit applications 
in an appropriate area.  The Task Force also believes that a video library 
could prove helpful to small businesses, but should be used to increase the 
availability of the information being developed pursuant to the Education 
Recommendations.<P>
     The Task Force believes the use of the many computer technologies 
available should begin with a bulletin board system.  The system should be 
set up so that it can be expanded to accommodate a variety of other uses 
such as computerized record keeping, computerized reporting, interactive 
permits, and further down the road, electronic filing of permit 
applications and reports.
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 1
<DD>     In cooperation with small businesses, a computer bulletin board should 
be developed and made accessible to small businesses by modem for the 
purpose of providing informational assistance to small business on 
environmental matters.  The bulletin board should originally be set up on 

small scale, but in a manner that will later expansion into a variety 
of other uses, including more sophisticated uses.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The Task Force believes that a computer bulletin board would be useful 
and flexible source of information to small businesses, especially if it 
were set up so that any small business that has a personal computer with a 
modem could access the bulletin board.  The Task Force believes strongly 
that this would be an important initial step in the development of 
computerized methods to assist small businesses.  Time also should be taken 
to develop a good system that could be expanded to accommodate other 
recommendations.  It also is believed that the interrelationship with the 
U.S. EPA bulletin board system should be explored and that the system 
should be set up in a user-friendly, simplified manner, so that a small 
business person without computer experience could use this system.
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 2
<DD>     In cooperation with small businesses, the Agency should develop 
interactive computer permit systems aimed at simplifying the permit 
application and review process.  It is essential that such systems be 
designed to cut down the review time for permit applications.  A pilot 
project in an appropriate permit area should be selected and implemented 
first to ensure that broader systems are developed and implemented 
effectively.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     As mentioned, the Task Force believes that an interactive computer 
permit system would be helpful to small businesses, but it should be 
developed through a pilot project.  Thereafter, it could be expanded to 
other areas based on that experience and responses to the pilot project.
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 3
<DD>     In cooperation with small businesses, the development of computerized 
record keeping systems should be evaluated and developed where useful to 
assist small businesses in meeting environmental record keeping 
requirements.  This effort should be coordinated with the efforts to 
simplify permits, to develop permits as compliance documents, and to 
develop industry-specific information for small businesses.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The Task Force spent considerable time discussing how software might 
be developed that could provide a computerized recordkeeping system for 
simplifying the recordkeeping requirements of small businesses.  Some 
commercial software already in existence combines such a record keeping 
system with a computerized reporting system.  There was concern about 
whether such commercial systems would be affordable to small business and 
whether the Agency should instead develop systems that would interact 
efficiently with the Agency information bases.  The Task Force believes 
that such systems might be valuable, if they can be developed in an 
effective and affordable manner.  And development of any such system should 
be coordinated with development of permits as compliance documents.
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 4
<DD>     In cooperation with small businesses, the development of computerized 
reporting systems should be evaluated and developed to assist small 
businesses in meeting environmental reporting requirements, particularly 
permit and reporting requirements.  This effort should be coordinated with 
efforts to simplify permits and reporting requirements, to develop permits 

as compliance documents, and to develop industry-specific information for 
small businesses.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The Task Force believes that a computerized reporting system that 
includes the reporting requirements contained in permits would be very 
helpful to small businesses.  Generally, the same issues and concerns 
existed for computerized reporting systems as described for computerized 
record keeping.<P>

<DT>Recommendation 5
<DD>     The development of electronic filing systems should be pursued as a 
long-term effort following the creation of other simplified computer 
systems, which could be converted to electronic filing systems.  The issues 
of security from competitor access and legal signature should be resolved 
to make electronic filing effective.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     Generally the Task Force believes electronic filing is worth exploring 
but it should be undertaken after implementation of the other computerized 
systems recommended.  In particular, the Task Force believes that 
interactive permits would be more valuable than electronic filing, without 
raising some of the same difficult issues involved in electronic filing.
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 6
<DD>     The development of a video library of environmental information should 
be pursued as a long-term effort following the development of 
recommendations made elsewhere in this report.  In general, seminars on 
environmental topics are considered to be more useful and higher priority.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
     <DD>Generally, the Task Force believes that development of a video library 
would be helpful to small businesses but that it is less important than 
development of the information recommended elsewhere in this report.  The 
Task Force discussed how such videos could be made available to small 
businesses and suggested they be disseminated through associations, local 
chambers of commerce, or DCCA's small business assistance centers.
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 7
<DD>     The development of effective delivery systems to get information to 
small businesses is essential to the success of the Small Business 
Initiative.  The cooperation of trade associations, local chambers of 
commerce, and similar groups in this effort is particularly important.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The Task Force discussed the use of various technologies to assist 
small businesses as part of the broader need to develop and enhance the 
delivery of useful information to small businesses.  The Task Force agreed 
that the cooperation of groups representing small businesses is essential 
to these goals, including the use of the recommended technologies.<P></DL>


<a name="Financial Recommendations"><hr></a>
<H3>Financial Recommendations</H3>
<CENTER><STRONG> Introduction</STRONG></CENTER>
     The Financial Recommendations have been developed in response to a 
suggestion that it is necessary to look at the financial issues of small 
businesses facing environmental costs in order for the task force to look 
at the complete set of concerns facing small businesses.<P>
     The Task Force looked at two specific financial areas regarding small 

businesses and environmental regulation.  First, it looked at informational 
needs and problems encountered by small businesses in being aware of, or in 
dealing with, financing to meet the costs of environmental compliance.  The 
Task Force also examined whether any additional public programs are needed 
to aid small businesses in meeting the costs of complying with 
environmental programs.<P>
<DL>
<DT>Recommendation 1
<DD>     Information should be developed to communicate and explain existing 
financing programs that are available to assist small businesses in meeting 
environmental compliance costs.  This should include programs to address 
pollution control costs available through federal, state, and local sources 
including the Small Business Administration's pollution control loans, FMHA 
loans, community development block grants, community development assistance 
programs, and other public sources available.  This information should be 
provided to small businesses and lending institutions serving small 
businesses.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     One of the principal issues discussed by the Task Force was whether 
small businesses have difficulty obtaining information about financing 
alternatives available to them to meet the costs of complying with 
environmental regulations.  Generally, the Task Force agreed that most 
small businesses had established relationships with lending institutions 
and did not typically have difficulty obtaining financing due to lack of 
access to information about the practices or procedures of lending 
institutions.<P>
     However, general descriptive information about the range of private 
and public financing options would be helpful to many businesses.  In 
particular, the pollution control loans available from the federal Small 
Business Administration (SBA) do not appear to be very well known or 
utilized.  A particular effort to make useful and understandable 
information about these SBA loans available to small businesses, their 
representatives, and lending institutions might greatly assist small 
businesses in obtaining additional help in meeting the costs of complying 
with environmental regulations.
<P>
<DT>Recommendation 2
<DD>     In providing information to assist small businesses, the state should 
encourage small businesses to consult their lender prior to contracting 
with a consultant to avoid potentially duplicative costs.  It is important 
that small businesses be informed that many lending institutions will only 
accept information from consultants they know are satisfactory.<P>
     Small businesses should be advised that, in selecting environmental 
consultant, it is important to lending institutions that the consultant 
have liability insurance, usually to the amount of one million dollars, and 
that the insurance should not have a pollution exemption.<P>
     In addition, the Agency should provide information regarding a 
consultant's responsibilities to report environmental problems it 
identifies in its work.  Small businesses believe that the consultants are 
required by law to report the business to the Agency.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The Workgroup agreed that a significant problem for small businesses 
arises if the selection of an environmental consultant is not undertaken 
cooperatively with lending institutions.  The recommendation reflects the 

specific concerns that the small businesses person should be aware of prior 
to choosing an environmental consultant and emphasizes the role lending 
institutions play regarding consultants.<P>

<DT>Recommendation 3
<DD>     In preparing the guides for industry categories as recommended in the 
Education Section, information should be included discussing the typical 
potential environmental risks and problems that a business in a specific 
category should consider, address, or evaluate.  Included in this should be 
any guidelines for addressing the typical risks for certain types of 
industries.  It is believed that such information will be valuable both for 
the small business and for any lending institution financing an 
environmental compliance project.  It should take the form of a discussion 
of known or likely problems that arise in a given industry, including such 
things as remedial actions or leaking underground tanks.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The Task Force discussed and considered the value of the informational 
guides by industry category contained in the Education Recommendations.  
The Task Force agreed that these would be of value not only to small 
businesses but also to lending institutions making loans to small 
businesses for environmental compliance activities.  The Task Force 
concluded that the information guides should include industry-specific 
discussions of environmental risks that might exist at a small business and 
that should be examined by a small business and lending institutions.  
Where possible, the discussion of environmental risk should include 
guidelines for dealing with such risks.<P>

<DT>Recommendation 4
<DD>     Information should be developed that will aid businesses and lending 
institutions in evaluating site compliance and clean-up activities.  This 
information should be provided to small businesses and lending institutions 
serving small businesses.  It should include an explanation of the new 
legislation affecting leaking underground storage tanks.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The Task Force discussed the need for greater knowlede and certainty 
regarding the nature and extend of environmental problems at a small 
business.  This would aid small businesses in understanding and dealing 
with environmental problems and would aid lending institutions serving 
small businesses in making loan decisions.<P>
     This problem most often occurs where a clean-up or remediation problem 
exists at a small business.  There was discussion of how the new 
legislative amendments contained in House Bill 300, which affects leaking 
underground storage tanks, would provide improved certainty in these areas 
and address the concern of the Task Force.  The Task Force concluded it is 
very important that information on these changes be distributed to both 
small businesses and lending institutions.<P>

<DT>Recommendation 5
<DD>     Governmental financing assistance programs should be investigated to 
determine whether any additional programs could assist small businesses in 
meeting the compliance costs for environmental requirements in tow major 
areas, i.e., remediation costs and compliance costs for high risk 
businesses that will have difficulty in obtaining financing for 
environemntal costs.  It is recognized that considerable thought and effort 

would need to go into the development of criteria for identifying 
financially high risk businesses and making them the beneficiary of 
financial assistance.  This is a high priority item to help avoid 
situations where a category of sources would have difficulty complying with 
environmental laws, due to their inability to obtain the financing needed 

to meet the costs of the compliance.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The Task Force had lengthy discussions on how lending institutions 
make decisions about loans to small businesses for environmental compliance 
costs, including both remediation costs and funding for pollution control 
equipment.  The Task Force concluded that many environmental projects can 
be adequately handled within the normal loan framework used by lending 
institutions.  However, lending institutions do tend to categorize types of 
businesses according to possible environmental risks, and larger lending 
institutions identify environmental high risk industry groups.  As with 
other high risks areas, these businesses then have a more difficult time 
obtaining a loan, including a loanf or measures or activities to address 
those risks.  Many sites where remediation or clean-up may be necessary 
fall into this high risk category for loan purposes, as do many businesses 
with unassessed environmental risks.  The reasons for the high risk 
classification are th uncertainty that exists as to the extend of 
remediation that may be necessary, the costs associated with the 
remediation,and the inability to use land that may be polluted as security 
on a loan.<P>
     The Task Force expressed concern about whether public funding would be 
available to support any new programs in these areas.  For that reason, the 
Recommendation states that new programs be investigated to determine 
whether they could be developed.<P>
     The Task Force concluded that a significant policy concern exists 
where a small business has high risk rnvironmental problems but cannot 
obtain financing needed to address those environmental problems due to the 
very fact they are high risk problems.  Should lending institutions assume 
these risks?  Can small businesses address them without access to loans?  
And can these risks simply be left without any responsible person to 
address them?  The Task Force concluded that these might be approrpriate 
areas for additional public financing programs to address these issues.<P>

<DT>Recommendation 6
<DD>     Incentives should be developed in federal and state tax laws to 
encourage small businesses to install pollution control equipment and to 
undertake other activies in achieving environmental compliance.  Incentives 
that should be considered include accelerated depreciation of pollution 
control equipment and a pollution control tax credit.<P>
<DT>Explanation:
<DD>     The Task Force concluded that incentives should be developed within 
federal and state tax laws to support the purpose reflected in federal and 
state environmental laws.  Since the state tax incentive would only provide 
a portion of the relief that small business needs, the Task Force believes 
federal tax incentives also should be sought.  The prospect of future 
environmental regulations requiring additional controls or equipment 
increases the importance of accelerated depreciation.  The Task Force 
believes that this is a recommendation that could help small businesses.<P>

In Cooperation with the Governor's Small Business Environmental<br>
Task Force
</strong></center><p>


This publication is produced in cooperation with the Governors Small
Business Environmental Task Force, the Illinois Department of Commerce and
Community Affairs (DCCA) and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency
(IEPA).  It is created in response to a recommendation made by the Task
Force to explain existing financing programs that can be used to assist
small businesses in meeting environmental compliance costs.  Specifically
requested were programs available through federal, state, local and other
public sources.<p>

Many sources for financing environmental compliance and pollution
prevention projects exist.  However, few are specifically targeted for that
sole purpose.<p>

It is the intent of this publication to identify the various sources of
financing that exist.  The financing tools (or programs) that exist are
constantly changing.  Therefore, we recommend that you contact the sources
of financing for the current financing programs available to help you
implement your environmental project.<p>


<h3>First Steps to Financial Assistance</h3>

Usually the best source of financial assistance is your local lender.  They
may know about other available programs.  Other organizations to contact
include:<p>
<ol>

<li> local economic development commission<br>
<li> local chamber of commerce<br>
<li> local municipal economic development department<p></ol>

Exploring the availability of local financing resources should be your
first option.<p>


<h3>Information to Take to your Lender</h3>
<ol>
<li> Statement of purpose for the loan<br>
<li> History of your business<br>
<li> Financial information for the last three years, balance sheet, income
     statements for existing businesses<br>
<li> Projections of income, expense and cash flow<br>
<li> Schedule of term debts for existing businesses<br>
<li> Aging of accounts receivable and payable for existing business<br>
<li> Lease details if applicable<br>
<li> Amount of investment in the business by the owner<br>
<li> Signed personal financial statements<br>
<li> Personal resumes<br>
</ul>

<strong>
ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS<br>
PARTICIPATION LOAN PROGRAMS</strong>
<p>

The Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) has designed the
Participation Loan Programs to encourage lenders to make loans that they
would not otherwise make for a variety of reasons.  For the purposes of
this program, a lender is an Illinois bank, Development Corporation, or
other lending institution.  By providing financial assistance through local
lenders, the borrower does not need to submit a separate application to the
Department for a loan.  All loan servicing, except some necessary reports,
is handled by the local lender.<p>

Participation loans are purchased when the project being considered has the
potential to create or retain substantial employment  for the people of the
State of Illinois.  The loan can be used for new plant start up,
modernization, expansion or to improve the competitiveness of the borrower.<p>

For current information on this and other state and local programs, contact
the nearest Small Business Development Center (SBDC).  To identify the SBDC
in your area, please call the DCCA Business Assistance Hotline at 800/252-
2923.<p>

<strong>
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (CDAP)
</strong>
<p>
DCCA makes grants to local governments, who can in turn make funds
available to local businesses.  The program is targeted to benefit low and
moderate income persons by creating or retaining job opportunities and
improving the quality of their living environment.  Applicants must certify
that 51% of the jobs created and/or retained from the CDAP-funded project
will benefit low to moderate-income persons. Units of local government,
such as cities, villages, townships and counties, may apply for funding.
Municipalities must be 50,000 or less in population and must not be located
in an urban county that receives "entitlement" funds.<p>

For more information, contact your local municipality; local economic
development office or the nearest Small Business Development Center (SBDC).
To identify the SBDC in your area, please call the DCCA Business Assistance
Hotline at 800/252-2923.<p>

<center><h3>Role of the Environmental Consultant</h3></center>

You may be aware that environmental requirements are applicable to your
company or that some environmental problem already exists. Where do you
turn for help?<p>

First, take environmental matters seriously. In recent years the
financial and legal consequences of environmental problems have expanded
dramatically.<p>

Second, recognize that you may need both technical and legal assistance.
As the environmental requirements have expanded and become more detailed,
consultants and attorneys have become specialized to address them. You
probably need to go beyond general practitioners in these areas.<p>

Third, carefully define the issue. This will require an environmental
professional who not only specializes in the environmental area, but also
has a broad understanding of both the technical issues and regulatory
process.<p>

Fourth, you may need specialized environmental services. They might
include:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>air/water/soil testing
<li>detailed design and construction services
<li>laboratory
<li>legal
<li>professional engineering
</p>
</ul>
For example, the construction contractor may do the actual hands-on work,
such as hazardous waste clean-ups or tank removal. However, some
environmental consultants provide clean-up work, either with in-house
capability or by subcontracting to other parties.<p>

The nature of the environmental project dictates the academic training,
qualifications and credentials required of the provider of the services.
A summary of various types of environmental professionals and of
recommended or required credentials is provided in <a href=#b>Appendix B</a>.<p>

<a name="Selection"><hr></a>
<center><h3>Selection Methods of the Environmental Consultant</h3></center>

An environmental consultant will oversee your environmental project and
ensure that it is completed in a manner which will not only satisfy you
but also meet all applicable state and federal regulations.<p>

Your environmental consultant also will be responsible for developing a
project plan and hiring or assisting in hiring any subcontractors which
may be needed. Contacting your lender early in the search process will
ensure that your efforts are coordinated with your source of financing.<p>

Suggested steps to follow in selecting an environmental consultant:<p>
<ol>
<li> Business defines project (e.g. hazardous waste, storage tank,
asbestos)
<li> Business determines role of consultant (e.g. assessment, survey,
plan, design, construction oversight)
<li> Contact firms, request statements of qualifications (e.g. lists in
yellow pages, DCCA, engineering associations)
<li> Short list up to six firms based upon review of qualifications and
request proposals from these firms (you may want firms to visit site)
<li> Interview firms following review of proposals
<li> Rank the top three firms in order of preference
<li>Develop Scope of Work and negotiate fee with top ranked firm only
<li> If agreement reached, finalize contract
<li> If no agreement, drop number one firm and begin negotiations with
second ranked firm and so on until agreement is reached.
</ol><p>
Things to consider in evaluating an environmental consultant:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>professional reputation
<li>   references
<li>   licenses, registrations, certifications
<li>   professional association activities
<li>   professional awards
<li>   insurance/amount and type
<li>   Quality Control/Quality Assurance procedures
   experience in dealing with your particular problem and
   successful completion of similar projects in your state
<li>     identity and qualifications of project manager
<li>     approach to project
<li>     subconsultants
<li>     ability to meet or exceed schedule
<li>     location of firm
<li>     financial stability
<li>     ability to communicate
<li>     creativity
</ul>

<strong><center>Attorney Selection</center></strong>

You may consider hiring an attorney familiar with the particular
environmental laws and regulations affecting your project. Given the
complexity of environmental laws today, it is wise to retain the services
of an attorney who concentrates his or her practice in the environmental
field. Other resources for finding an environmental attorney include:
referral from your current legal counsel, the Environmental Services
Directory published by DCCA and the Directory of Environmental Attorneys,
published annually by Prentice Hall Law & Business.<p>

Criteria to consider when selecting environmental counsel:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>Capability to provide the legal support and resources required
    to successfully complete your project.
<li>The attorney's experience in handling your particular problem.
<li>The attorney's relationship with the government.
<li>The attorney's familiarity with regulatory agencies with
    jurisdiction over your project.
<li>The identity of the attorney who will be working on your    matter.
<li>The attorney's experience with environmental consultants and
    contractors.
<li>The attorney's experience with businesses similar to yours.
<li>Potential conflicts.
</ul>

<strong><center>The Team Approach</center></strong>

A "team" approach is essential to the successful completion of any
environmental project. This team could consist of you, your environmental
consultant, subcontractors such as construction contractors, and
environmental legal counsel. For your project team to be effective,
however, it is imperative that the environmental professionals you
consider hiring are appropriate for both you and the task at hand.<p>

<a name="Contract"><hr></a>
<center><h3>The Contract</h3></center>

After you and your consultant have defined your project,  a contract
should be prepared that reflects the parties' understanding of the terms
and conditions of the services to be provided. For small scale projects,
the agreement may simply consist of a letter referencing an attached
Scope of Work and the consultant's general contract terms and
conditions or it may consist of a purchase order with an attached Scope
of Work. For more complex projects, the agreement may be several pages
long and provide for a number of contingencies that may arise. Regardless
of the form, you should be sure that the following provisions are
considered:<p>
<dl>
<dt>Scope of Work
<dd>Defines the work that you and the consultant have agreed upon and should
be as detailed as possible. Sometimes contracts include a general
description of the Scope of Work and reference an attached Scope of Work
or set of drawings and specifications that provide the details of the
work. For cases where you cannot precisely define the Scope of Work,
provide as much detail as is known about the project and a description of
the consultant's project approach. The contract should provide a
mechanism for owner participation in modifying the Scope of Work, such as
a change order, during the project.<p>

<dt>Compliance with Applicable Laws
<dd>The consultant and all contractors should perform their services in
accordance with all applicable laws and regulations to ensure that work
required by law, but not specifically identified in the Scope of Work, is
included.<p>

<dt>Confidentiality
<dd>To prevent the unauthorized disclosure of the information given to the
consultant or information generated by the consultant, include a
confidentiality provision in the professional services agreement.<p>

<dt>Cost and Payment Terms
<dd>The cost and payment terms, together with the Scope of Work, describe the
essence of the bargain between you and the consultant. The cost provision
should clearly spell out the amount the consultant will be paid.<p>

The cost provision should clearly state on what basis the consultant is
being paid and how the consultant is paid. Payment may be in one lump sum
or progress payments made over the term of the contract. The contract
should define project completion. Termination provisions also should be
included stating under what circumstances the contract can be terminated.<p>

<dt>Insurance
<dd>Consultants should be able to provide comprehensive general liability,
professional liability (also known as "errors and omissions"),
comprehensive automobile liability, and workers' compensation and
employer liability insurance. In addition, consultants and contractors
who specialize in hazardous waste or asbestos can often provide insurance
coverage against certain environmental liabilities.<p>
</dl>
<b><center>Limits on Liability</center></b>

<strong>Consultants</strong><br>
The ways in which consultants may limit their liability include the
following:<p>
<ul type=square>
   <li>To the amount of the contract fee (meaning profit, not total
   dollars to be paid by you under the contract).

<li>     To the amount paid to the consultant (not limited to profit).

<li>     To amounts that will be covered by the insurance the
     consultant agrees to carry as listed in the agreement.

<li>     To a fixed dollar amount.
</ul>
Limitations on liability should be carefully reviewed. Although some
consultants may not be willing to perform the work without some
limitation on liability, you should carefully consider limitations in the
agreement.<p>

<strong>Your Limitations</strong><br>
In addition to requiring insurance in sufficient limits, you can attempt
to limit your liability by insisting that the consultant indemnify you
for the consultant's activities. Many contracts also provide for owner
indemnification of the consultant under certain situations.<p>

For additional contract information, see the "Standard Form of Agreement
Between Owner and Engineer for Professional Services" prepared by the
National Society of Professional Engineers, American Consulting Engineers
Council, and American Society of Civil Engineers. For more information,
contact the Consulting Engineers Council of Illinois at 625 South
College, P.O. Box 1604, Springfield, Illinois 62705. The phone number is
217/528-7814.<p>

When in doubt, have an attorney review the contract.<p>

<center><h3><a name="Issues">Environmental Issues and Lenders</a></h3></center>

You are contemplating the purchase of a new business location. You wish
to expand your facility. You want to borrow money for business purposes.
You have just discovered that an environmental problem exists and you
will need to borrow funds to handle it. In all of these situations it is
important to initiate discussions with your lender as soon as possible.<p>

Lenders will have their own requirements regarding environmental issues.
Contacting the lender early may save money by incorporating those
requirements into your plans before work has commenced. Some lenders have
an approved list of consultants that they use. Using a consultant that is
acceptable to the lender may also save the cost of having your
consultant's report reviewed by a consultant acceptable to the lender.<p>

Even if you do not borrow additional money, you may need to inform your
lender of environmental concerns. Most loan documents have environmental
clauses that require lender notification upon discovery of an
environmental situation. Even if not required by your loan documents, you
may wish to do so in the interest of open communication with your
lender.<p>

<h3>
IEPA<br>
Feb. 1995
</h3>
</center>
<p>
<center><h3>Good Housekeeping Practices</h3></center>

<h3>Why are Good Housekeeping Practices Important?</h3>

The potential danger of a hazardous waste does not go away when it's put
into a container. Many chemical leaks and work-related injuries are due to
improper or unsafe container management.<p>

Accidents happen. Hazardous waste spills, fires and explosions can result
in serious injuries, significant property damage, and expensive clean-up
costs. It is your responsibility to minimize these accidents by following
the basic good housekeeping practices in this guide.<p>

<h3>What is a proper Waste Container?</h3>

Store hazardous and non-hazardous special wastes in containers that are in
good condition and compatible with the waste being stored (i.e., strong
acids should not be stored in unlined steel drums).<p>

Keep incompatible wastes in separate areas to reduce the risk of a
potentially dangerous reaction and accident. Incompatible wastes should not
be placed in the same container. Mixing a spent acid (i.e., sulfuric acid)
with a spent caustic material (i.e., sodium hydroxide) could result in
dangerously high temperatures or a violet chemical reaction.<p>

Keep storage containers closed except when adding or removing waste. This
will help reduce the evaporation of some volatile gases and minimize the
chance of spills, fires or explosions.<p>

<h3>How do I Design a Proper Storage Area?</h3>

Store containers on pallets so leaks can be detected early and the
containers can be moved easily during an emergency.<p>

Waste storage areas should have a diked, crack-free concrete floor or pad
so if containers leak, the waste does not contaminate underlying or
adjacent soils, sewers, or bodies of waters.<p>

There should be sufficient aisle space (at least 30 inches) between the
containers to allow for easy container inspection and easy movement of
emergency and spill control equipment.<p>

Protect the containers from the weather by storing the containers under a
roof. This will reduce corrosion, infiltration of water through the bung
holes, and the effects of weathering on labels and signs.<p>


<h3>Why Should I label Containers?</h3>

Label containers clearly so you know their contents at all times. For
example, write the words "HAZARDOUS WASTE" on the label if that is what you
are accumulating. Include as easily understood description of the waste and
the hazards associated with he waste (i.e., "ignitable" or "toxic").<p>

Record the date you begin accumulating hazardous waste and mark the date on
the container when it is full. These steps will help you determine how much
hazardous waste you generate in a calendar month. The amount of waste you
generate determines what requirements you must meet.<p>

When you transfer a waste (i.e., hazardous or non-hazardous special waste)
to another container, make sure you put a label on the new container and
remove the label from the old one (unless you will use it to hold the same
type of wastes immediately after).<p>


<h3>How Are Containers To Be Emptied and Disposed?</h3>

All waste containers may go to a solid waste landfill or a scrap metal
dealer if you remove all the waste and residue from the container. Remove
all wastes by triple rinsing the container with a solvent capable of
dissolving any residue in the container.<p>


<em>IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO COMPLETELY EMPTY A WASTE CONTAINER, YOU MUST SEND THE
CONTAINER(S) TO EITHER A SPECIAL WASTE LANDFILL OR A HAZARDOUS WASTE
LANDFILL.</em><p>


To send a hazardous waste container to a special waste landfill you must:<p>
<ol>
<li> Remove all residue possible, leaving less than one inch of residue in
     the container or;<p>

<li> Leave less than three percent of residue from the total capacity of
     the container (e.g.: three percent of a 55-gallon drum is 1.7
     gallons).<p></ol>

These containers can then be sent to a special waste landfill.<p>

However, containers which stored hazardous waste and still contain stubborn
waste residue must be sent to a hazardous waste landfill.<p>

For more information about what types of wastes you may have at your
business, please refer to IEPA Fact Sheet: "How to Determine What Types of
Waste you Generate and What Are Your Responsibilities".<p>


<h3>When Should I Conduct A Self-Inspection?</h3>

Inspect the containers every week. If a container begins to corrode or
leak, immediately clean up the waste and transfer to another container.<p>


<h3>How Should I Prepare for Emergencies?</h3>

Severe accidents can be minimized if you are prepared. Make arrangements
with local authorities (police, fire departments, etc.) to familiarize them
with the types of materials stored and the layout of the facility.<p>

Designate an "emergency coordinator."  This coordinator might be the owner,
foreman, or main person in charge on each shift and should be "on call" at
all times.<p>

Post the name and number of the emergency coordinator, the location of fire
extinguishers, spill control material, the fire alarm, and the telephone
number of the fire department and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency
(IEMA) next to the telephone.<p>

The owner or operator of the facility should ensure all employees are
familiar with proper waste handling and emergency procedures (i.e., what
materials are hazardous, where the telephone is, where the spill control
materials are, how to use the fire extinguisher, etc.).<p>


<h3>What If An Accidental Spill or Leak Occurs?</h3>

Clean up any chemical spills or leaks immediately so that you do not
contaminate surface waters, groundwater's, soils, or sewer systems.<p>

Call the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) at their 24-hour
emergency phone number (800/782-7860) to report any chemical spills or
leaks.<p>

<hr>
<center><h3>Things To Remember</h3></center>

Do not discard any waste into an open dump, raving, gully, surface
impoundment, or ditch. Your waste must go to a permitted landfill. Ask your
hauler to supply proof of proper disposal of your trash.<p>

Do not rinse or drain hazardous and non-hazardous special wastes into the
sanitary or storm sewer, creek, ditch, septic system, or underground tank.
Chemicals poured, spilled, or leaked into sewer systems can form explosive
vapors in sewers or basements or disrupt municipal wastewater treatment
plant operations. Discharges underground may poison private or public water
supplies, while discharges to surface waters may kill fish, livestock, or
other wildlife.<p>

Hazardous and non-hazardous special wastes cannot be discarded into the
dumpster, roll-off box, or trash cans that are used for general refuse. The
wastes may catch fire or injure your waste hauler or workers at the
landfill.<p>

Don't store hazardous wastes on site more than 90 days without consulting:

<h3 align=center>Does Your Business Need A Water Pollution Control Permit?</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

This document is intended to provide a guide or road map to assist persons in determining whether their business requires a water pollution control permit from the Bureau of Water. Figuring out whether or not a permit is needed has been confusing and frustrating to many small businesses. This document explains how to make this determination. However, it does not provide a definitive answer for every person or business, since there can be complex matters requiring interpretation and assistance.<p>

There are three kinds of water pollution control permits. Discharge permits (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, NPDES) are required by the Federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Illinois Environmental Protection Act.  State construction permits are generally required by the Illinois Environmental Protection Act for water pollution control hardware. In addition, state operating permits are generally required by the Illinois Environmental Protection Act for facilities not required to have an NPDES permit.<p>

All three of these permits are issued by the Bureau of Water. You should be aware that your business may also need a permit from the Bureau of Air (an air permit) or the Bureau of Land (a land permit) or both. One or both of those permits may be required whether or not you need a water permit.<p>

The Bureau of Water's Permit Section is ready and willing to assist you with your water permit questions in any way possible. If you have a question or would like assistance, please contact the Permit Section at 217/782-0610 and ask for the Engineer on Call.<p>

<h3>
Discharge Permits<br>
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
</h3>
                                    
The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit regulates wastewater. There are two types of discharges controlled by NPDES permits - process and storm water. An NPDES permit may be required at one business for either type of wastewater or for both. You should determine whether you need an NPDES permit either for process wastewater or for storm water. You are required to obtain these permits prior to any discharge. The requirements for each one are discussed separately in Parts 1 and 2 below.<p>

<h4>Part 1:  Does your business discharge wastewater (other than storm water) so as to require an NPDES permit?</h4>

To answer this question, you should go through the three steps below. The first two steps help you
determine whether you need an NPDES permit.  The last step contains an exemption to the NPDES permit requirement you should consider as well.<p>

<ul>
<em>Step 1:  Does  your business discharge a wastewater? You should first ask if your business has a wastewater discharge.</em><p>

The definition of  wastewater is very broad and will include almost any discharge of water that is generated from any process industry, manufacturing, trade, or business. The definition also includes any solid, liquid or gaseous waste; and all other substances whose discharge would cause water pollution or a violation of the effluent or water quality standards of the State. Toilet and hand washing waste is also defined as a wastewater.

If your business does not have a wastewater discharge as described above, you are not required to obtain an NPDES permit.<p>

If your business does have a wastewater discharge as described above, you should go on to the next step.<p>

<em>Step 2:  If your business has wastewater, does your business discharge it to the surface of the earth or to water on the surface of the earth?</em><p>

This provision is very broad so that you can assume that any discharge that goes to surface water or the ground on your property, or that leaves your property, is included. However, wastewater that is applied to agricultural land for crop or soil benefit is not regulated by the NPDES program. The permits required for this type of activity are discussed later in this document.<p>

<em>Step 3:  Does your business have ONLY toilet and hand washing wastewater?</em><p>

If the only wastewater your business discharges is toilet and hand washing wastewater and the discharge of toilet and hand washing wastewater is less than 1500 gallons per day, you are not required to obtain an NPDES permit. However, the Illinois Department of Public Health does regulate these discharges.<p>

If the discharge from your business of toilet and hand washing wastewater is greater than 1500 gallons per day, you are required to obtain an NPDES permit.<p>
</ul>

<h4>Part 2:  Does your business have a storm water discharge so as to require an NPDES permit?</h4>

You need to go through the two steps below to determine whether your business needs an NPDES permit for its storm water discharge. You will usually need to know the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code for your business to do this.

<ul>
<em>Step 1:  Does your business have a SIC code for which NPDES storm water permits are required?</em><p>

Storm water may also be considered a wastewater depending on the type of business in which you are engaged. The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code or type of operation your business is engaged in will determine whether or not the storm water that discharges from your property will be considered a wastewater. A listing of categories for which storm water permits are required is contained in Appendix 1.<p>

If your business has a SIC Code or operation that is listed in Categories 1-10 in Appendix 1, then you are required to obtain an NPDES permit, even if you do not have objects at your business exposed to storm water.<p>

If your business has a SIC Code that is listed in category 11 of Appendix 1 then you may be required to obtain an NPDES permit. A category 11 industry in required to obtain an NPDES permit if material  handling equipment or activities, raw materials, intermediate products, final products, waste materials, by-products, or industry machinery are exposed to storm water. If you have a business in a category 11 industry and you do not have these objects at your business exposed to storm water, then you are not required to obtain an NPDES permit.<p>

If your business has a SIC Code or operation that is not listed in Appendix 1, then you are not required to obtain an NPDES storm water permit, unless you are violating water quality standards of the State.<p>

<em>Step 2:    If your business has wastewater, does your business discharge it to the surface of the earth or to water on the surface of the earth?</em><p>

This provision is very broad so that you can assume that any discharge that goes to surface waters or the ground on your property, or that leaves your property, is included.<p>
</ul>

<h4>Important Additional Information Concerning NPDES Permits</h4>

You should be aware that a general NPDES storm water permit is available from the Bureau of Water's Permit Section if you meet the criteria described in the general permit. A general permit is a standardized permit with pre-determined conditions for similar discharges. You can review a general permit and decide ahead of time whether to apply for it rather than for an individualized permit. A one-page application is available for most general storm water NPDES permits. The simplified permit is usually issued within 2 weeks of receipt of the application.<p>

An NPDES permit issued by the Bureau of Water has a maximum life of 5 years.<p>

If you are required to obtain an NPDES permit from the Bureau of Water, you are required to make a timely application 180 days prior to a new discharge or expiration of the existing NPDES permit if you wish to renew the permit.<p>

<hr>
<h3>State Construction Permits</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

A water pollution control construction permit is required by state law for businesses with the potential to cause water pollution. This construction permit is required prior to constructing or modifying a facility. You can determine whether you need to obtain a construction permit by going through Steps 1 and 2 below.<p>

<h4>Step 1:  Will there be construction at your facility, or modification of your facility, such that a construction permit is required?</h4>

State construction permits are required if your business is constructing or modifying anything within one of the four categories listed below.<p>

Construction is defined as the commencement of on-site fabrication, erection, or installation.<p>

The definition of modification is rather long and can be found in Appendix 2. You should look carefully at this definition because it includes such things as an increase in the amount of wastewater discharge even if the increase is not due to any other physical change in the facility.<p>

 The definition of wastewater is discussed in Part 1, Step 1 of the section dealing with NPDES permits.<p>

If you are planning on constructing or modifying at your business, you should determine whether what you intend to construct or modify falls within one of the four categories listed below.<p>

If what you intend to construct or modify falls within one of the four categories listed below, you are required to obtain a construction permit from the Bureau of Water prior to the construction or modification.<p>

If what you intend to construct or modify does not fall within one of the four categories listed below, you are not required to obtain a construction permit from the Bureau of Water.<p>

<em>Category l: TREATMENT WORKS</em><p>

A treatment works is a device used for collecting, pumping, treating, or disposing of wastewaters, or for the recovery of byproducts from such wastewater.<p>

A treatment works usually discharges wastewater to the surface of the earth or to water on the surface of the earth.  However, a treatment works may also recycle wastewater for other uses and not have a discharge.<p>

<em>Category 2: PRETREATMENT WORKS</em><p>

A pretreatment works is a device used for collecting, pumping treating or disposing of wastewater, or for the recovery of byproducts from such wastewater, before the wastewater in discharged into a publicly owned sanitary sewer system.  The sanitary sewer system conveys the wastewater to a publicly owned treatment plant for further treatment.<p>

In addition to the exemption listed in Step 2 of this section, pretreatment works have an additional exemption which is fairly complicated and may require interpretation.  This additional exemption in listed in Appendix 3. If you need assistance interpreting or understanding this exemption, you can obtain assistance from the Bureau of Water's Permit Section at 217/782-0610 or you may obtain assistance from an environmental professional of your choice.<p>

<em>Category 3: WASTEWATER SOURCE</em><p>

Wastewater source is any discharge of wastewater, usually to a publicly-owned sanitary sewer system.  Wastewater discharges to agricultural land for crop or soil benefit are also considered wastewater sources. Some examples of wastewater sources would be:<p>

1.   A new business in an existing building with existing sewers that connect to a publicly-owned sanitary sewer. Your new business will be generating a wastewater which you will discharge through the existing sewer. This discharge would be considered a wastewater source.<p>

2.   Land application and/or spray irrigation of wastewater (including wastewater sludges) to agricultural lands.<p>

<em>Category 4: SEWER</em><p>

A sewer is defined as a stationary means of transport intended to transport wastewater from your business to a publicly-owned sanitary sewer system.<p>

The portion of the sewer which requires a construction permit is that portion which runs from the boundary of your building to the point of connection to the publicly-owned sanitary sewer system.<p>

<h4>Step 2:   Do you fall under the exemption for treatment works, pretreatment works, sewers, and wastewater sources?</h4>

This exemption can apply only to businesses who generate toilet and hand washing waste.<p>

If you generate any wastewater that is not toilet and hand washing waste, this exemption does not apply to your business, and you must obtain a permit.<p>

The exemption is as follows:<p>

Construction permits are not required for any treatment works, pretreatment works, sewer or wastewater source designed and intended to serve a single building and eventually treat or discharge less than 1500 gallons per day of strictly toilet and hand washing waste (other wise known as domestic waste).<p>

If you fit under this exemption, then you are not required to obtain a state construction permit from the Bureau of Water.<p>


<hr>
<h3>State Operating Permits</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

State operating permits are required for the use or operation of most treatment works, pretreatment works, sewers or wastewater sources for which a construction permit is required. You should go through the two steps below to determine whether you need a state operating permit from the Bureau of Water.<p> 

<h4>Step 1:   Does my business need a state construction permit?</h4>

In the section called State Construction Permits, you determined if your business required a state construction permit.<p>

If you were required to obtain a state construction permit (other than for a sewer) you will be required to obtain a state operating permit, unless you fit under the exemptions listed in Step 2 below. Operating permits for sewers are generally issued with the construction permit.<p>

If you have existing treatment works, pretreatment works, or wastewater sources, you are required to have a state operating permit unless you fit under one of the exemptions listed in Step 2 below.<p>

If you do not need a state construction permit for your business, you do not need a state operating permit for your business unless you intend to use land application and/or spray irrigation of wastewater (including wastewater sludges) on agricultural land.<p>

<h4>Important Additional Information</h4>

An operating permit issued by the Bureau of Water has a maximum life of 5 years.<p>

If you are required to obtain an operating permit from the Bureau of Water, you are required to renew that permit by its expiration date for continued operation of the permitted facility.<p>

If you meet the criteria for needing an operating permit, you are required to obtain the operating permit even if you did not obtain a construction permit.<p>

<h4>Step 2:   Is my business exempted from the requirement for a state operating permit?</h4>

A state operating permit is not required for the following even if a state construction permit was required.<p>

A treatment works whose discharge is covered by an NPDES permit.<p>

A pretreatment works or wastewater source whose discharge to the publicly-owned treatment plant (usually owned by a municipality) has been authorized by a receiving publicly-owned treatment plant that has an approved pretreatment program.<p>

You should identify the publicly-owned treatment plant to which the discharge from your business flows. Once this is done, you should contact the Bureau of Water's Permit Section at 217/782-0610 to identify publicly-owned treatment plants that have approved pretreatment programs.  This will tell you if the publicly-owned treatment plant to which your discharge flows has an approved pretreatment program.<p>

If the wastewater discharge from your business flows to a publicly-owned treatment plant with an approved pretreatment program, then a State operating permit is not required.<p>

If the wastewater discharge from your business does not flow to a publicly-owned treatment plant with an approved pretreatment program, then a State operating permit is required.<p>

For certain pretreatment works or wastewater sources, there are some additional, somewhat technical, exemptions. The rule containing these exemptions is in Appendix 3 to this document. If you need assistance interpreting or understanding this exemption, you can obtain assistance from the Bureau of Water's Permit Section at 217/782-0610 or you may obtain assistance from an environmental professional of your choice.<p>

<h3 align=center>Does Your Business Need A Land Pollution Control Permit?</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

This document is intended to provide you with a guide to determining whether your business needs a permit from the Bureau of Land (a Land permit). It will not provide answers to all your questions about environmental regulations, but will help you determine your permit responsibilities.<p>

This document takes you through a series of questions that you need to answer to determine whether you need a Land permit. It will also identify how you can get help with these questions should you need assistance. Many of these questions and their answers are complex and, as you apply them to your business, will often raise questions of interpretation for which you may need assistance from the Agency or from an environmental professional of your choice.<p>

Certain key words are in bold type within this document. If you understand the meanings of these words, it will make asking questions and understanding the answers easier for you. A word printed in bold type is defined in the regulations. It has a special meaning to regulatory professionals. The words in bold type are defined in the Attachment to this document.<p>

Your business may also need a permit from the Bureau of Air (an Air permit) or the Bureau of Water (a Water permit) or both. One or both of those permits may be required regardless whether a Land permit is required.<p>

<hr>
<em><strong>1.   What activities may require a land permit?</strong></em><p>

You must obtain a permit to conduct some regulated activities. The need for a permit is dependent upon the type of waste, what you do with a waste and location of the activities. A land permit is generally required to manage waste. If you do not treat, store or dispose of some kind of waste you will not need a land permit.<p>

The kind of land permit that you need will be determined by the kind of waste that you manage and how you manage it. These management activities are discussed below.<p>

There are a variety of waste activities that are regulated to control contamination by wastes. Because some regulated activities require a permit, you need to understand what these activities are to determine if your business needs a land permit. If your company or business activities make waste, you are a waste generator. The regulations explain how you must handle the waste while it is on your property. Waste generation is a regulated activity but does not need a permit unless you conduct one of the activities described below. These are the activities that may trigger the need for a permit.<p>

Waste storage. If you store waste on your property you must comply with all the storage requirements in the regulations. Several different sets of regulations may apply to this activity depending on who generates the waste, the classification of the waste, and how long the waste is stored at your facility.<p>

Waste transportation is also regulated. If you transport the waste on a public road, you must obey the transporter rules.<p>

Waste treatment. Any activity which changes the rule is regulated as waste treatment. Treatment includes, among other things, mixing the waste with other wastes or materials, burning, grinding or separating the waste.<p>

Waste disposal is the most highly regulated waste management activity. Disposal includes, among other things, dumping waste on the ground, storing it in piles on the ground, in a landfill, or in lagoons and storing waste indefinitely even when it is held in tanks, buildings or containers.<p>

If you conduct one of these activities, please read further to determine if your activities require a permit.<p>


<hr>
<em><strong>2.   What is a waste?</strong></em><p>

A waste is anything that is being discarded or can no longer be used for its original purpose. Something may be a waste if it no longer has a dollar value or if it is used carelessly, spilled, burned, buried or poured down the drain. All waste is referred to as solid waste. In fact, in the regulations, solid waste and waste mean the same thing. The term solid waste as used in the regulations can be misleading in another way because it includes not only solid materials but also liquids and gasses. If you want to re-use something, it may not be a waste. The Agency's Industrial Material Exchange Section would be happy to assist you in finding someone to re-use materials for which you no longer have a use. They can be contacted at 217/782-0450.<p>


<hr>
<em><strong>3.   What is waste management?</strong></em><p>

Managing a waste refers to any kind of waste storage, treatment or disposal activity. You will hear the term manage used with great frequency in the land regulations and in almost any discussion of waste. Examples of waste management include burning a waste, burying a waste, or storing a byproduct or sludge.<p>

Waste management is regulated in many different ways, including through the requirement to obtain a permit, which is the subject of this document. However, you should be aware that many other requirements in addition to a permit requirement may apply. These other requirements include regulation of waste transportation, design and operating requirements for waste treatment, storage, disposal, and reporting requirements on waste generation.<p>


<hr>
<em><strong>4.   What type of waste do I manage?</strong></em><p>

Wastes are grouped into different categories by the regulations. You must determine which categories of waste you are managing to determine the kind of permit you will need.<p>

Solid waste is divided into two categories: nonspecial waste and special waste.<p>

<em>NONSPECIAL WASTE:</em>   Nonspecial wastes are generally not as harmful to people or the environment, so they are not regulated as special waste. Nonspecial wastes include garbage and commercial waste. These types of wastes are generally associated with offices, homes and restaurants, but also include clean packaging, landscape waste, clean machinery components and construction or demolition debris.<p>

<em>SPECIAL WASTE:</em>  Special waste includes potential infectious medical waste (PIMW), industrial process waste, pollution control waste, and hazardous waste. Because the mismanagement of these wastes may cause serious health or environmental problems, special waste may be regulated under one or more sets of regulations in addition to the regulations for nonspecial waste. Special permitting requirements may also apply.<p>

Potentially Infectious Medical Waste (PIMW)  includes most medical waste generated by health care professionals or medical research that may be infectious to humans. It does not include medical waste generated at your home.<p>

Industrial process waste includes waste generated by industry or commercial services such as gas stations or painting contractors. Industrial process waste does not include clean packaging materials, office or food waste.<p>

Pollution control waste is generated by the treatment or cleanup of other wastes. Treatment residues from wastewater treatment, air scrubbing and spill cleanups are all pollution control waste.<p>

Hazardous waste is the most highly regulated category of waste. Some wastes are hazardous because of their ignitable, corrosive, reactive or toxic properties. These are called characteristically hazardous wastes. In other instances, USEPA has decided that the waste produced by certain industrial activities will always be a hazardous waste. These are called listed hazardous wastes.<p>

<em><strong>5.   Do you accept waste from someone else?</strong></em><p>

If you accept any waste from someone else for treatment, transfer, storage, or disposal, including a facility of your own located at a different address, you must get a permit from the Bureau of Land.<p>

The type of permit that you must obtain depends upon the kinds of waste that you accept from someone else. Even if you do not accept waste from someone else, a permit may be required for certain hazardous waste management activities. The type of permit you may need is discussed next in this document.<p>

<hr>
<em><strong>6. What type of permit do I need?</strong></em><p>

Solid waste permits are required for the nonspecial waste storage, treatment and disposal facilities that accept waste from someone or somewhere else.<p>

Special waste permits are required for facilities that receive or store, treat or dispose of nonhazardous special waste and for hazardous RCRA exempt waste storage or treatment facilities. ( RCRA  is a common way of referring to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.)<p>

The same system is used for permitting both solid and special waste management units. For both solid waste and special waste: development (DE) permits are required to construct new units; operating (OP) permits are then required before receiving waste at a new unit; and supplemental permits are required to modify an existing permitted activity.<p>

Usually, a DE permit is issued prior to construction. An OP permit is issued for operation of the business if the new unit was properly constructed. In some cases, the DE and OP permits are issued jointly.<p>

Hazardous waste permits are required for hazardous waste storage, treatment or disposal facilities. A new hazardous waste management facility must obtain a Part B RCRA Permit prior to construction or to receiving waste. This is a single permit for the facility. Unlike the permits for nonhazardous waste, separate development and operating permits are not required.<p>

<hr>
<em><strong>7.   How do I determine if I need a hazardous waste management permit?</strong></em><p>

To determine whether or not you need a hazardous ra-te management permit, you must determine:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>The type of waste<p>
	The time limits for unpermitted storage may vary by hazardous waste type.<p>
<li>The amount of hazardous waste you generate per calendar month<p>
There are time limits on the storage of hazardous waste generated on site based upon these amounts.<p>
<li>The process that generated the waste <p> 
Some processes produce listed hazardous waste even when analysis indicates the waste would not be very harmful.<p>
</ul>

There are many instances where hazardous waste management activities may be exempt from the permitting requirements. However, remember that even if you are exempt from the hazardous waste permit requirements, if you receive waste from someone else or from a different location, you must get a permit.<p>

For further information or assistance in these determinations, you may contact the Bureau of Land Permit Section at 217/524-3300. They will be happy to assist you.<p>

<hr>
<em><strong>8.   Are there any special requirements affecting permits of which I should be aware?</strong></em><p>

Before the IEPA can review your permit application, you must provide proof that you have complied with the local siting requirements. All new pollution control facilities must obtain siting approval from a specified unit of local government. The procedures for obtaining local siting approval and the operations which are exempt from these requirements are found in the Illinois Environmental Protection Act.<p>

As indicated earlier, all facility operators that accept waste from another location must first get a permit.<p>

<hr>
<em><strong>9.   Is a land permit needed for the transportation of wastes?</strong></em><p>

The Agency recommends that you always use a licensed special waste hauler to transport your waste. Some waste transportation operations must be licensed by the Agency  You must have a license to transport special waste unless you are a small quantity generator transporting your own waste from your own site to a permitted storage, treatment, or disposal facility.<p>

If you are not a small quantity generator, you must either obtain a special waste hauler license or have a licensed special waste hauler transport the waste for you.<p>

<em>SUPPLEMENT TO #9:</em>

You can on haul your own waste without a special waste haulers license or without a manifest if you generate 100 kg. or less of special waste including hazardous waste and less than 1 kg. of acutely hazardous waste in a calender month. You may also qualify for an exemption from manifesting if you generate between 100 kg. and 1000 kg. of hazardous waste in a calender month and the waste is reclaimed under a contractual agreement.  The exemption for small quantity generators hauling their own waste referred to in Question #9 of this document and the exemption from manifesting for small quantity generators referred to in Question #9 of this document are not applicable to a small quantity generator as defined in Appendix 1.<p>

You must also use a manifest as the shipping paper which accompanies your waste, unless you are a small quantity generator.<p>

No license is needed to transport nonspecial waste such as garbage.<p>

You should be aware that the transportation of hazardous material is regulated by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT). You may contact them at 217/782-4974 for further information.<p>

<hr>
<em><strong>10.  In addition to the permit requirements, are there any other kinds of regulations of which I should be aware?</strong></em><p>

There is a hierarchy of wastes dependent upon their potential to harm people or the environment.<p>

Generators and receivers of the wastes must comply with all the regulations specific to their category plus those applicable to less dangerous wastes.<p>

Nonspecial wastes are regulated under the solid waste rules found in 35 Ill. Adm. Code 807 through 815. Portions of these regulations also pertain to all special waste.<p>

Hazardous wastes are also regulated under the federal rules resulting from the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). These RCRA rules have been made a part of the state's rules and can be found in 35 Ill. Adm. Code 700 through 739. These hazardous waste  rules are very complicated and contain many specific inclusions, exclusions and exemptions. A guidance document on understanding the hazardous waste rules is available from the Bureau of Land at 217/782-6762. This guidance document includes a helpful discussion of how you can determine the classification of your waste.<p>

<hr>
<em><strong>11. Whom should I contact for further information?</strong></em><p>

If the previous information indicates that you may need a permit, you should contact the Bureau of Land's Permit Section at 217/524-3300. Different types of permits are issued by different units.<p>

To help you get to the appropriate person to answer your questions, we have identified the units that review each type of application or permit previously discussed.<p>

Women-Owned Business in Illinois
</h3>


<h3>ILLINOIS RANKS FIFTH IN THE NATION AS HOME TO WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES</h3>

<pre>
  the number of women-owned firms                 336,000+
  employment of women-owned firms                 949,000
  sales and receipts of women-owned firms        $119.6 Billion

</pre>

<strong>Number of Firms:</strong>  Between 1987 and 1996, the number of women-owned firms nearly doubled.  1996 estimates by the National Foundation of Women Business Owners rank Illinois fifth in the nation with nearly 337,000 women-owned firms, a 90 percent increase from 1987.<p>

<strong>Industry Distribution:</strong>  Although 82.3 percent remain concentrated in services, retail trade, and FIRE (finance, insurance, and real estate), Illinois women-owned businesses are diversifying:  percent representation in all but two industries showed an increase from 1987.  Services and retail trade declined.  Chicago boasts more women-owned firms in the construction industry than any other major metropolitan area in the country. <p>

<strong>Employment:</strong>  Employment levels sky-rocketed 112 percent, with women-owned businesses employing 315,615 in 1992  -- up from 149,164 in 1987.  Payroll grew from just over two billion to almost six billion, a 175.8 percent increase.<p>
 
<strong>Sales and Receipts:</strong>  Employer firms still enjoy higher sales. While non-employer firms saw a significant 65.5 percent increase from 1987 to 1992, the sales and receipts of employer firms demonstrated a 154.3 percent gain.  Industry sector matters:  firms located in manufacturing enjoyed the highest sales levels, averaging nearly $1.075 million per company compared to $41,645 per company located in services.  Illinois women-owned businesses overall witnessed an extraordinary 252 percent increase in sales between 1987 and 1992.<p>  

<strong>International Trade:</strong>  Seven percent of Illinois' women-owned firms report international sales.  Nationally, the average is 3 percent.  Export activity has primarily occured in the Canadian and European markets, followed by the Pacific Rim, Mexico, and South America.<p>

Fact Sheet<br>
Hispanic-Owned Business in Illinois
</h3>

ILLINOIS IS THE HOME OF 24 OF THE 500 LARGEST HISPANIC-OWNED BUSINESSES IN THE COUNTRY WITH ANNUAL SALES OF $258.53 MILLION.<p>

In the Chicago area Hispanic-owned businesses have continued to show steady growth. The number of Hispanic businesses has grown by over 300 percent from 1972 to 1995. Most are located in the Chicago neighborhoods of Logan Square, Little Village, Pilsen, West Town, South Chicago, Uptown, Humboldt Park and Avondale. There are also areas of concentration of Hispanic-owned businesses in other Illinois cities such as Aurora, Waukegan, Joliet, Elgin, Peoria, Rock Island and Rockford.<p>

The top three industries of Hispanic-owned businesses are services, retail trade and construction. Growth was most brisk in transportation, construction, finance and services with a spectacular growth of small diversified businesses. Growth receipts also quintupled from $51 million to $268 million over the same period. This tremendous increase makes the Chicago market the fourth largest in the U.S. after Los Angeles, New York and Miami. During 1994 these 24 companies created 3,230 jobs and generated $258.53 million to the Illinois economy.<p>

As of 1987 census, there are approximately 12,000 + Hispanic firms registered in the state and their steady growth is anticipated in the coming years. As a newcomer to the economic mainstream, Hispanic firms face many problems and obstacles that require special business assistance. Recognizing the special problems associated with this emerging group, the Hispanic Business Advocate was established in the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs' (DCCA) Office of Minority Business Development to serve as a liaison between minority business owners, organizations and the state to assist minority entrepreneurs who are starting or expanding their businesses in Illinois.<p>

The Illinois Hispanic Business Advocate, works closely with other components of DCCA's business service network including Small Business Development Centers, Procurement Technical Assistance Centers, International Trade Centers, NAFTA Opportunity Centers, the Office of Women's Business Development, Small Business Environmental Assistance and the First Stop Business Information Center to develop materials, approaches, policies and contacts which explain existing minority owned business assistance programs and direct these to targeted business groups and entrepreneurs.<p>

The basic goal of all labor-management committees is to improve communication between labor and management, resulting in improved labor-management relations.  Although the structure, goals and objectives of the individual committees may vary depending on the economic conditions of their particular geographic area, all provide a forum in which labor and management can increase communication and work cooperatively toward the betterment of the area.<p>

<ul type=square>
<li>A local Area Labor-Management Committee (ALMC)  serves a municipal, county or regional population and consists of a core advisory body composed of representatives from business, labor, government and/or the public.  The ALMC generally has a permanent office, paid professional staff and full or part-time clerical staff.<p>

<li>An Industry Labor-Management Committee generally consists of associations or coalitions of employers and labor organizations which are involved in the same industry.  Industry committees have been formed in the building and construction, retail food, coal, masonry, men's clothing and rail-road industries.
</ul>

With the growth of the area committee, many industry committees have been incorporated as special subcommittees of an area committee.<p>

<HR>

The Illinois Labor-Management Grant Program was established to promote labor-management relations and provide assistance in the development of local labor-management committees.<p>

General revenue funds are appropriated annually to the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) for the Illinois Labor-Management Grant Program to provide grants and other resources to establish and support area labor-management committees and other projects which enhance labor-management relations i the state, its regions, industries and worksites.  The Department, with the advice of the Labor-Management Cooperation Committee, awards grants or matching grants in four areas: (1) to existing local labor-management committees; (2) to developing local labor-management committees; (3) to develop and conduct specialized education and training programs of direct benefit to representatives of labor and management; and (4) for research and development projects related to labor-management issues.  The needs for education and training programs and research and development projects are determined and prioritized annually by the Department with the advice of the Illinois Labor-Management Cooperation Committee.<p>


Types of Local Labor-Management Committees include:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>Industry Labor-Management Committees generally consisting of associations or coalitions of employers and labor organizations involved in the same industry;<p>
<li>Worksite or Plant Labor-Management Committees comprised of labor and management representatives with activities limited to a particular worksite or facility; and<p>
<li>Area Labor-Management Committees (ALMCs) consisting of a core advisory body composed of representatives from business, labor, government and/or the public, serving a municipal, county or regional population.<p>
</ul>

The Illinois Labor-Management Cooperation Committee makes the determination as to the allocation of funding to the specific grant categories and reviews all grant applications received by DCCA, providing recommendations to DCCA's Director for awarding of grants.<p>

During Program Year 1994 and 1995, the State Committee established priority focus areas for area labor-management committees (ALMCs) including:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li>Facilitate the adoption of worksite labor-management programs by Illinois   private and public sector employers and labor unions;<p>
<li>Increase ALMC programs and services directed toward small and   medium-sized manufacturing firms and public sector employers;<p>
<li>Provide important educational opportunities on major issues affecting the   labor and  management environment (i.e., workshops, seminars and training   sessions);<p>
<li>Develop and conduct programs in conjunction with local school districts to educate  students at all levels on the collective bargaining process and   importance of a labor-management cooperation in the workplace; and<p>
<li>Facilitate the negotiation of special construction project agreements between union building trades and contractor association, promoting the common goals of quality, craftsmanship, teamwork and cooperation within the union construction industry. In FY 1994 and FY 1995, DCCA awarded 23 labor-management grants to support cooperative labor-management programs in Illinois including: 19 existing local LMC grants; three developing local LMC grants; and one research and development project grant.<p>
</ul>

Typical programs and services provided by local committees funded under the Labor-Management Grant Program include: communication facilitation between labor and management assistance in maintaining the competitiveness of union contractors; program promoting job retention and skill training; information and assistance for displaced workers; assistance and participation in various economic development activities; educational workshops; specialized training programs; and technical assistance services to employer/employee organizations.<p>

A proven method to enhance the labor-management environment at the workplace is through implementation of cooperative program addressing issues such as worker safety, product and service quality, working conditions and overall labor relations.<p>

<hr>

<center><img src="/dcca/graph/lmwp3.gif" alt="Most Common types of Cooperative Programs" width=97 height=55></center>
<ul>
<li>Worksite Labor-Management Committees are flexible committees usually comprised of an equal number of labor and management members.  A committee contains both labor and management representatives and meets periodically to identify and discuss opportunities to improve production methods and resolve problems affecting both parties.<p>
<li>A worksite committee is a vehicle to increase communication.  It can provide an effective response to challenges facing the plant or worksite.<p>
<li>Employee Involvement Programs  seek to engage all employees in an effort with management to achieve goals such as product improvement, cost-cutting or some other goal.<p>
<li>Quality Circles involve 6-12 employees in regular meetings to discuss how to improve production techniques and the work environment.<p>
</ul>

A substantial proportion of Illinois firms utilize cooperative labor-management programs as part of the routine conduct of business.<p>

A LABOR-MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP/COOPERATIVE WORKPLACE PROGRAM ENABLES LABOR AND MANAGEMENT TO WORK AS PARTNERS OR EQUALS IN RESOLVING PROBLEMS/ISSUES AND DEFINING THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF THE ORGANIZATION.<p>

<strong>What's in it for Labor?</strong><p>

1. Involvement in decision making.<p>
2. Improvement in communication and overall relationship.<p>
3. Access to organization information.<p>

<strong>What's in it for Management?</strong><p>

1. Productivity gains through efficient use of resources.<p>
2. Improved communication and unified access to all unions.<p>
3. Improved quality, decentralization and support in decision making.<p>

<hr>
<img src="/dcca/graph/lmwp4.gif" alt="Tips for Survival" width=100 height=61 align=right>
<ul>
<li>The leadership of both sides must want this procedure to be effective.
<li>Both parties must be genuinely open to working on a wide range of   problems.
<li>Channels of communication should always be kept open.
<li>Both parties must report back to their respective group the problems   considered at meeting and how issues ate to be resolved.
<li>The parties jointly own the partnership and are responsible for making it   work.
<li>Success requires a willingness to listen to the opposite side.
<li>Parties must concentrate on the problems at hand instead of past   differences.
</ul>

<hr>
<img src="/dcca/graph/lmwp5.gif" alt="Labor-Management Partnerships" width=104 height=61 align=left vpsacw=5 hspace=10>

A means of increasing both communication and understanding between labor and management is to establish labor-management partnerships.<p> 

These partnerships, composed of key leaders chosen by both labor and management, first discuss the concepts and expectations of a joint labor and management partnership.<p>

The establishment of a labor-management committee is an important step in implementing a workplace program.  The focus of these programs often is on quality of work life, human resource utilization, safety, productivity and quality improvement.<p>

Structurally, these efforts vary significantly.  Some are operated by a steering group with satellite participation teams, and some are confined to the shop floor.<p>

Participants in joint labor-management efforts report that when labor and management tackle problems together, not only are they more successful in solving their problems, but the solutions are more widely and readily accepted by all.<p>

It is important that the parties realize that this is only the first step, and they should dedicate themselves to working hard to make this  procedure work.<p>

Ethanol Demonstration Program<br>
Ethanol Powered Heavy Truck Fleet Program
</h3>
<hr>
<h3>About the Program</h3>

Recognizing the need to improve air quality in our cities, the State of Illinois has become a leader in the testing of ethanol as a viable alternative transportation fuel.  In October 1988, the President signed the Alternative Motor Fuel Act of 1988 (AMFA), the purpose of which is to encourage  the use and production of alternative fuel light-duty vehicles, urban transit buses and heavy-duty trucks.  Also, in 1990, the Clean Air Act (CAA) was signed into law imposing new emissions standards for transportation vehicles.  In response to these Acts, the State of Illinois, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, has developed a test and demonstration program involving the nation's first ethanol-fueled heavy-duty, over the road truck fleet to meet the 1994 emission standards.  The fleet is made up of four ethanol trucks which are owned and operated by Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur.  In addition, ADM is operating one conventional diesel, identical to the other trucks, as a control vehicle for the study.  The trucks will initially be driven only on short runs, returning to Decatur every night.  Eventually, however, they will be used for interstate driving to Iowa and Missouri, and will be refueled at ADM terminals in those states.  The heavy trucks are expected to receive high hours of usage and high mileage-it is estimated that they will be driven up to 150,000 miles per year, mostly over interstate highways.  This amount of use will provide valuable information on the performance and reliability of ethanol engines in commercial fleets.<p>

<hr>
<img src="../../graph/enr/engine.jpg" width=259 height=176 hspace=10 vspace=10 align=right>
<h3>The Vehicles</h3>

The trucks being used for this demonstration are 1992 White GMC model WIM64T dual-tandem tractors.  They contain Detroit Diesel Corporation 6V-92 engines designed to run on ethanol fuel.  The 6V-92 is a vee-configuration, 6 cylinder engine rated at 300 horsepower.  They are "dedicated" engines, which means they can only run on E-95 fuel.  E-95 is composed of 95% anhydrous ethanol with a 5% denaturant required by law.  (This is the same ethanol blended 10% with unleaded gasoline.)  The trucks also contain several specialized features not found in a conventional diesel engine.  These include an advanced electronic control system, modified fuel injectors, redesigned glow plugs (to enhance engine startup), and a catalytic converter.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Vehicle Testing Program</h3>

One of the primary purposes of this project is to evaluate ethanol's role in meeting the emissions standards of the Clean Air Act.  Under the Clean Air Act, new regulations, effective in 1994, have been established for emissions from heavy-duty truck engines.  Laboratory emissions test, performed by Detroit Diesel Corporation, on the DDC 6V-92 ethanol engines show results that are lower than the levels required by the 1994 regulations.  Through this project, it is hoped that emissions levels measured from heavy truck engines operating under normal conditions will confirm the laboratory results.<p>

The ADM trucks will undergo extensive testing throughout the three-year period.  A transportable emissions testing laboratory from he University of West Virginia will be used to measure the total hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and aldehydes emitted by the trucks.  In addition, a DDEC II electronic monitoring system will be plugged into the computer of the truck to provide a computerized readout of the total hours driven and miles per gallon.  Driver of the trucks will also be asked to report about the trucks' driveability, reliability, performance, and any problems they may experience iwht the vehicles.  Finally, at the end of the program, the Detroit Diesel Corporation will perform a complete engine teardown and wear analysis of the truck engine to further evaluate the effects of ethanol as a motor fuel.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Ethanol Fuel</h3>

The Unites States currently imports about 50% of the petroleum we use for fuel every day.  Ethanol is a clean burning, renewable American fuel made from of corn.  Corn is a crop grown in abundance in the Midwest-Illinois alone harvests over 1.3 billion bushels each year.  Each bushel of corn produces about 2.5 gallons of ethanol, but only the starch from the corn is used to make the ethanol, leaving a high protein livestock feed and other valuable co-products.  In addition to ethanol, a bushel of corn yields 1.5 pounds of corn oil, 12.4 pounds of 21% protein feed, 3 pounds of 60% gluten meal, and 17 pounds of carbon dioxide (used for carbonating beverages).  Illinois produces about 500 million gallons of ethanol annually, more than any other state in the nation; therefore, it makes sense for us to use our own "homegrown" fuel.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Benefits of Ethanol to Illinois</h3>

<ul type=square>
<li>Environmental<p>

Unlike the fossil fuels it is replacing, ethanol does not add carbon to the atmosphere, and so does not contribute to the greenhouse effect.  Growing corn used carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for photosynthesis and emits oxygen to the atmosphere.  Using corn-derived ethanol as a transportation fuel, then, simply recycles the carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere where it started.  Furthermore, ethanol is an oxygenate-an octane enhancer which contains oxygen content of the fuel, causing gasoline blended with 10% ethanol to burn cleaner and emit an average of 20% less carbon monoxide than does unblended gasoline.<p>


<li>Economic<p>

The ethanol industry currently has over $1 billion in capital invested in Illinois and provides over 800 industry jobs as well as 4,000 additional jobs in industry related services throughout the state.  It has been estimated that 2,200 jobs are created for each 100 million bushels of corn used to produce ethanol.  Illinois farmers also benefit form the ethanol industry because it services as a market for surplus corn and helps support grain prices.<p>

Illinois uses more ethanol to substitute for gasoline than any other state in the nation.  Consumer acceptance of gasoline blended with 10% ethanol is steadily growing, and over 30% of all gasoline currently sold in Illinois contains 10% ethanol.<p>

In addition to the heavy-duty ethanol truck fleet, Illinois is also sponsoring demonstrations of ethanol-fueled mass transit buses in Peoria and a fleet of 12 ethanol-fueled cars operating in Chicago and Springfield.  Other projects are also being planned, all of which will help to evaluate the role of ethanol as a viable alternative transportation fuel for the future.<p>

In testing these ethanol vehicles, Illinois is taking a strong stand in support of cleaner environment and promoting domestic sources of energy.<p>

Peoria Bus Demonstration Project

<img src="../../graph/enr/bus.jpg" width=256 height=173 align=right>
<h3>About the Program</h3>

The State of Illinois is dedicated to improving air quality in our urban areas, and has begun several efforts to make this possible.  These efforts include the testing of ethanol as an alternative to gasoline and diesel in meeting transportation fuel needs of the future.  One of these projects is being conducted by the Greater Peoria Mass Transit District (GPMTD).  The project consists of 14 ethanol-powered buses which will be operating throughout Peoria and represents the first and largest project test and demonstration of dedicated ethanol engines in urban transit buses in the country.<p>

in October 1988, the Alternative Motors Fuels Act (AMFA) was signed into law in order to encourage the sue and production of alternative fuel light-duty vehicles, urban transit buses, and heavy-duty trucks.  Also, in 1990, the Clean Air Act (CAA) was passed establishing new emissions standards for all transportation vehicles in this country.  The Peoria Ethanol Bus Project si designed a s a response to AMFA and CAA by being on the first program in American to test the effectiveness of factory produced ethanol engines in meeting emissions standards of the future.<p>

<img src="../../graph/enr/vehicles.jpg" width=253 height=154 vspace=10 hspace=10 align=left>
<h3>The Vehicles</h3>

The Peoria bus fleet is operating 14 dedicated ethanol engines developed by the Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC).  The ethanol engines used in this project are modified versions of conventional DDC 6v-92 diesel engines, which are electronically-controlled, six cylinder, vee-configuration engines that can produce up to 350 horsepower.  The changes to the engines include modifications to the electronic control systems, fuel injectors and glow plugs (to make starting easier).  Three identical buses with diesel 6V-92 engines are also being operated as control vehicles for the program.  The 6V-92 ethanol engines used in the Peoria buses are rated at 253 horsepower, identical to the horsepower produced by the diesel engines.  The buses were manufactured by Transportation Manufacturing Corporation (TMC) in Roswell, New Mexico.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Vehicles Testing Program</h3>

 One of the main objectives of this program is to evaluate ethanol's role as an alternative fuel in meeting the vehicle emissions standards of the future.  Therefore, the buses will undergo complete emissions testing to determine whether the ethanol engines meet the emissions requirements of the Clean Air Act.  The U.S. DOE/University of West Virginia Portable Heavy-Duty Chassis Dynamometer facility will perform most of the emissions tests for the program.  Emissions form the ethanol engines and a control diesel engine will be monitored for carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, total hydrocarbon, and aldehyde levels.  A second objective is to evaluate the performance and reliability of the ethanol engines.  An engine teardown for wear analysis will be performed at the end of the program.  Bradley University will conduct survey of the drivers, riders and the general public before and after implementation of the program.  The third objective is to evaluate the costs and benefits associated with operating urban transit buses on ethanol fuel.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Ethanol Fuel</h3>

The United States currently imports about 50% of the petroleum we use for fuel every day.  Ethanol is a clean burning, renewable American fuel made from corn.  Corn is a crop grown in abundance in the Midwest-Illinois alone harvest over 1.3 billion bushels each year.  Each bushel of corn produces about 2.5 gallons of ethanol, but only the starch from the is used to make the ethanol, leaving a high protein livestock feed and other valuable co-products.  In addition to ethanol, a bushel of corn yields 1.5 pounds of corn oil, 12.4 pounds of 21% protein feed, 3 pounds of 60% gluten meal, and 17 pounds of carbon dioxide (used for carbonating beverages). Illinois produces about 500 million gallons of ethanol annually, more than any other state in the nation; therefore, it makes sense for us to use our own "homegrown" fuel.<p>

<h3>Benefits of Ethanol to Illinois</h3>

<ul type=square>
<li>Environment<p>

Unlike the fossil fuels it is replacing, ethanol does not add carbon to the atmosphere, a and so does not contribute to the greenhouse effect.  Growing corn uses carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for photosynthesis and emits oxygen to the atmosphere.  Using corn-derived ethanol as a transportation fuel, then, simply recycles the carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere where it started.  Furthermore, ethanol is an oxygenate-an octane enhancer which contains oxygen.  The extra oxygen present adds to the overall oxygen content of the fuel, causing gasoline blended with 10% ethanol to burn cleaner and emit an average of 20% less carbon monoxide than does unblended gasoline.<p>

<li>Economic<p>

The ethanol industry currently has over $1 billion in capital invested in Illinois and provides over 800 industry jobs as well as 4,000 additional jobs in industry related services throughout the state.  It has been estimated that 2,200 jobs are created for each 100 million bushes of corn used to produce ethanol.  Illinois farmers also benefit form the ethanol industry because it serves as a market for surplus corn and helps support grain prices.

<h3>ILLINOIS IS SERIOUS ABOUT INTERNATIONAL TRADE</h3>

South African International Trade Exposition, SAITEX `96 (Made in USA `96)<br>
Johannesburg, South Africa<br>
October 22-26, 1996<p>

South Africa is one of the world's dozen or so "Big Emerging Markets" U.S./Illinois firms are turning to. For years, apartheid kept U.S. companies out of South Africa, but political reform and the promise of political stability are quickly turning the once-taboo nation into a hot market.<p>

The United States now ranks as South Africa's leading trading partner. More than 300 U.S. companies have made significant investments in South Africa since the lifting of the U.S. sanctions. The two nations launched a commission to foster improved business relations in March of  1994. In 1995, Illinois exports to South Africa grew 44.3% over the previous year. This growth earned South Africa's place as one of the top 25 countries receiving Illinois exports.<p>

After experiencing a successful promotion in South Africa's 1995 Made in USA exposition, Illinois' DCCA International Business Division elected to return in 1996 with an even larger group of Illinois companies. A contingent of 48 Illinois firms will receive exposure to the South African market at this event. This is the largest U.S. export trade promotion event in South Africa where more export leads are generated in five days than most companies see in a year.<p>


SAITEX `96 (Made in USA 96) success is largely due to a U.S. Department of Commerce grant provided to DCCA's International Business Division, which in effect helped defray partial booth costs for participating Illinois companies. This program is presented as part of the "Illinois Export Partnership for Big Emerging Markets and Sectors Project" and has proved to be a very cost effective means for penetrating one of the world's "Big Emerging Markets".<p>

<hr>
<h3>ILLINOIS TRADE FORECAST - OUTLOOK 1997</h3>

Illinois' export growth continues to outpace the nation as a whole. In 1995, Illinois exports increased to $32.6 billion, representing a 23.6 percent increase over the previous year, and placing Illinois ahead of the national growth rate of 13.8 percent. This growth is expected to continue for a variety of reasons, most important being Illinois' ability to supply products to the world's most active and growing economies in key country development sectors. These sectors encompass core materials-industrial and capital goods that are essential to building the infrastructure of the world's developing nations. One trend is clear: Companies that make the leap into export are growing faster than others.<p>

Exports from Illinois surged 23.6 percent in 1995 to $32.6 billion. Illinois export figures have a proven track record for being competitive and Illinois export growth was double the national average in 1995. The type of products and services that Illinois is sending abroad provides the key to Illinois' future export growth. More than 70 percent of Illinois' exports are in high-technology sectors such as electronics, computers, and transportation equipment. Illinois' export growth in 1995 in electronics (41.7 percent) and industrial equipment (15 percent) remained strong and is predicted to grow throughout 1996. In fact, Illinois' growth in the electronics and other high tech sectors nearly doubled that of the national average in 1995. As the global market continues to modernize, Illinois' competitive advantage in those and other high-tech industries will continue to be tapped, increasing the number of value-added jobs in the state. Simply defined: Illinois' success in exporting comes from producing high-quality products, mainly capital goods, for the highly competitive world marketplace.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Exports are a Vital Component of our State's Economy</h3>
<ul>
<li>	One in eight jobs in Illinois is dependent on exporting; one in four in the manufacturing sector. As of 1995, it is estimated that more than 625,300 Illinois residents are employed by jobs sustained by direct and indirect exports.
<li>Every dollar of Illinois exports generates $.04 of state tax revenue.
<li>Export related jobs are globally competitive and proving to be the key to the creation and retention of higher paying and permanent jobs in Illinois. Wages for workers in the manufacturing and service exporting sectors, where Illinois products are the most competitive, exceed the U.S. average by 24 percent.
<li>Illinois ranked 5th in the nation among the top ten exporting states in 1995; this is the second consecutive year that Illinois has improved its ranking. Illinois export growth is evidenced by double digit export increases in 1993, 1994, and 1995: 24.6 percent, 20.2 percent and 23.6 percent respectively. 
<li>Illinois exports reached an all-time high of $32.6 billion in 1995, an increase of 23.6 percent over 1994 and nearly double the 13.8 percent increase of all U.S. exports for the same period 
<li>Exporting companies pay employees more than plants that produce only for domestic consumption.
<li>Worker productivity at exporting companies is 30 to 50 percent higher than that of non exporters.
<li>Innovation is stronger at exporting companies. Exporters adopt new technologies far more frequently than non exporters and report more significant benefits from doing so. This tendency is especially strong in fabricated metal products, machinery, computers and transportation equipment-key industrial sectors in Illinois
<li>Exporting companies tend to be larger than others, on average four times as large in employment and six times as large in sales.
<li>Sales per employee tend to be 50 percent greater in exporting companies than in non exporting companies.
<li>Value added per employee is up to 33 percent greater in exporting plants than in non exporters.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Illinois' Global Future:  The Underlying Structure</h3>

Some of the factors that account for a positive global outlook for Illinois and those relating to Illinois' continued status as an export driven economy are the fact that:<p>

1)	Illinois exports less of its gross product than the U.S. as a whole, indicating that opportunities for increased exports will continue to exist over the long haul.<p>

2)	The world market is four times larger than the U.S. market, and is predicted to grow as much as 40 percent faster than the U.S. market through the year 2000. The industrial centers and targeted industries within Big Emerging Markets (markets that will account for the overwhelming incremental growth in world imports over the next decade) are predicted to grow even faster.  Illinois already has a strong track record in many of the world's most explosive markets, indicating even greater economies of scale are expected from Illinois firms exporting to those rapidly growing economies.<p>

3)	Illinois produces what the world's most rapidly growing economies need- industrial machinery, telecommunications equipment, electronics, financial services, and products related to the needs of basic economic development. In other words, the products and services need to build a strong infrastructure and economy.<p>

The following are some market trends to watch throughout 1996 and 1997:<p>

Big Emerging Markets: What Are They and Where are They?<p>

Big Emerging Markets or BEMs are the markets that will double their share of world imports (and imports of Illinois products), rising 38 percent by 2010. No other category of market shows such dramatic growth potential.<p>

The BEM markets provide overwhelming opportunities for Illinois exports. While the markets of Europe and Japan continue to be among the top 10 trading partners for Illinois firms, current trends demonstrate slower growth in these traditional markets than in the BEMs. Most of the BEMs now rank among Illinois' top 10 trading partners, and are at least among the top 25 world markets for Illinois products.<p>

The BEMs are unlike Illinois' more traditional trading partners, such as Japan, Great Britain or Germany. There are frequently still trade barriers to entering those markets, and full respect for commercial systems are often still developing or lacking altogether. The nature of competition we face in these market is dramatically different from prior experience and they have economies that are growing twice as fast as the rest of the world.<p>


<h4>The Big Emerging Markets</h4>

The Chinese Economic Area (China,Hong Kong and Taiwan)<br>
South Korea<br>
The Association of' Southeast Asian Nations or ASEAN<br>
India<br>
Mexico<br>
South Africa<br>
Brazil<br>
Poland<br>
Argentina<br>
Turkey<br>

<hr>
<h3>Look for Growth In Major Trading Blocks such as ASEAN</h3>

There are six countries whose combined GDP is likely to reach $1.1 trillion in little over a decade. And by that time, U.S. exports to the region where these countries are found will probably equal or exceed exports to China or Japan. The ASEAN region-consisting of Brunei, Indonesia Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam-has become one of the most dynamic economic areas of the world. The reasons: rapid growth, expanding purchasing power and falling trade barriers.<p>

Growth, and the problems it creates, is generating extraordinary opportunities through out Southeast Asia. Increased demand for and expenditure on quality housing, environmental concerns and health care-generating new markets for technologies are emerging along with regional economic success. Breakneck growth is straining every kind of infrastructure, creating what is perhaps the best single market for Illinois goods and services.<p>

<h3>Export Tips</h3>
<h4>EXPORTERS BEWARE</h4>

The following contribution is provided by LaSalle's Foreign Exchange Department.<p>

As the world moves toward a true global economy, U.S. exporters need to rethink their U.S. dollar invoicing strategy.<p>

When exporters strictly invoice in U.S. dollars they may think that they do not have foreign exchange risks. This is not true.<p>

By invoicing in U.S. dollars, U.S. exporters do not bear actual conversion risk but are susceptible to movements in exchange rates. As the U.S. dollar increases in value vis a vis foreign currencies, U.S. goods become more expensive abroad.<p>

The following is an example of what can happen: Let's assume the U.S. dollar/deutsche mark exchange rate is 1.54-this means that the German customer will need to give up 1.54 deutsche marks to purchase one dollar. If the exchange rate goes up to 1.60, the German customer needs to pay 1.60 marks to receive the same one dollar. The cost of doing business with a U.S. exporter just increased by almost 4%. If the German customer can find another supplier with the same or similar product that is willing to price goods in deutsche marks, the U.S. supplier will most likely lose the business.<p>

The majority of U.S. exporters still invoice in U.S. dollars. In order to maintain a competitive position in the global market, you should come aware of the advantages and disadvantages of local currency invoicing.<p>

To learn more about local currency invoicing and how to manage foreign exchange exposure, please contact Camille Rudge, Vice President and Foreign Exchange Manager, at (312) 904-2827.<p>

<h3>Rethinking Our Approach to International Trade: Big Emerging Markets</h3>

During the last decade, Americans have been forced to rethink their approach to international trade. This is because many markets that were formally closed to importing and exporting are now viable markets and "open for business" on an international level.<p>

Big Emerging Markets or "BEMs" are the markets that will account for the overwhelming incremental growth in world imports over the next 20 years.<p>

Looking toward the next century, the engines of economic growth will be found in fewer than a dozen regions of the world. The "BEMs" are:  in Asia-the Chinese Economic Area (China, Hong Kong and Taiwan), South Korea, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN), initially Indonesia, then expanded to include all the ASEAN economies (Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, and Viet Nam), and India; in Africa - South Africa; in Europe - Poland and Turkey; and in Latin America - Mexico, Brazil and Argentina.<p>

The BEMs are unlike our more tradition trading partners, such as Japan, Great Britain or Germany. There are frequently still barriers to entering these markets, including high tariffs, quotas and protectionist regulatory restrictions. Commercial systems, including full respect for intellectual property rights, are often still developing or lacking altogether. In some of the BEMs, impartial legal systems also are missing. The nature of competition we face in these markets is dramatically different from prior experience.<p>

Still, the BEMs continue to provide overwhelming opportunity for exporters. While the markets of Europe and Japan continue to be top ten trading partners for Illinois firms, current trends demonstrate slower growth in these markets than a good deal of the rest of the world.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Why are Big Emerging Markets so Important to Illinois?</h3>

Illinois exports to many of the Big Emerging Markets have already shown extraordinary growth. For instance, between 1992 and 1993, Illinois exports to China increased 239 percent. China is now Illinois' sixth largest trading partner. In 1995, Illinois exports to Thailand, South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong grew an average of 83 percent. Exports to Indonesia and Malaysia grew a whopping 101 percent and 140 percent last year. In fact, exports to almost all of the ASEAN nations exhibited double digit growth.<p>

Illinois exports to Turkey increased 85 percent; exports to Poland increased 36 percent and exports to many countries in Africa increased their imports from Illinois as much as 100 percent.<p>

There is no doubt that these Big Emerging Markets are Illinois' fastest growing markets. BEMs will provide the greatest amount of export opportunity in the near future. Companies that develop an export action plan in accordance with these markets will remain competitive in the long term. A BEM strategy should be part of any company's export strategy and will help Illinois firms to maximize their competitive advantage over the long haul. Now is the time to be considering and scrutinizing these critical regions of the world.<p>

<h3>The Economic Stakes</h3>

by Margaret MacLean, Managing Director, International Business Division<p>

Earlier this year, every newspaper in America ran daily stories chronicling the state of America negotiations with Chinese officials concerning illegal trade in pirated compact discs and computer software. Why? Because the issue is central both to the future well-being of hundreds of thousands of American workers and to our prospects in a market of 1.2 billion consumers with a voracious appetite for information products.<p>

Economic stakes in the BEMs are enormous. The ten BEMs as a group are importing about as much merchandise form the U.S. as Japan and the European Union combined. In fact, during the period 1990-2010, the BEMs could account for at least $1 trillion incremental U.S. exports.<p>

<h3>Export Tips</h3>

<h4>What is an ATA Carnet?</h4>

ATA Carnet, "The Merchandise Passport" is an internationally recognized customs document that allows exporters to avoid duties and taxes on temporary imports, thereby reducing the cost of doing business internationally.

ATA Carnet benefits include:<p> 
<ul>
<li>NOT paying duties and taxes (VAT is a minimum of 15% in Europe).<p>

<li>NOT purchasing a temporary import bond.<p>

<li>NOT registering the goods upon departure from the United States.<p>

<li>USE ON MORE THAN ONE TRIP:  ATA Carnets are valid for up to one year and may be used for  multiple exits from and entries into
the United States and foreign countries.<p>

<li>COVERAGE OF MOST BUSINESS RELATED ITEMS:  Display booths, which are subject to duty, may  travel on Carnet.<p>

<li>PRE-DETERMINED COSTS:  Charges associated with the Carnet are paid before departure.<p>

<li>ACCEPTANCE IN OVER 50 COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES: Thailand has recently joined the system  and China is expected to begin accepting Carnets later this year.<p>
</ul>

Companies interested in applying for an ATA Carnet should contact the United States Council for International Business at 212/354-4480.<p>

<h3>SEPTEMBER 1995 MEDICAL EQUIPMENT ASIA MISSION SUMMARY</h3>

The Department of Commerce and Community Affairs International Business Division represented 12 companies in New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, Korea and Japan in September 1995. A variety of small and mid-size manufacturers participated which provided a range of products and technologies to promote on site at each country stop. Laboratory optics, x-ray equipment, biohazard waste, emergency care, surgical tools, and products for the handicapped exemplify the diversity of the exhibition. The mission, referred to as Medical Equipment Asia, generated 546 sales leads for the group of Illinois firms and was a success for all involved.<p>

Prior to departing on the Mission, invitations were sent to major hospital groups and pre-screened companies in the medical/scientific fields from the active database files of the International Business Division's Hong Kong and North Asia/Tokyo offices. This promotional campaign initiated enormous interest among the medical communities at each stop. Some companies have already identified serious distributors for their products and several companies are following up on immediate sales opportunities. All of the Illinois companies realize that there is a market in Asia for their products. The mission provided the directive and contacts necessary to begin entry into Asia's most dynamic markets. In addition, mission participants were educated on the process of doing business in the Pacific Rim and collected valuable data for long term market strategies. With a little patience, perseverance and preparation all of them will be able to determine a road to success.<p>

Why Asia? Asia is the fastest growing region in the world for medical equipment and supplies. By the year 2000, the economies of East Asia, from Japan to Malaysia, will almost equal that of the United States. As purchasing power is boosted by swift economic growth, Asians are demanding more and better medical care. The quantity of simple and sophisticated medical goods required to meet this demand provides a serious opportunity for Illinois medical device companies. Sales of quality medical devices are expected to increase to keep pace with more affluent lifestyles and aging populations.<p>

Entering the markets of the Far East can be intimidating at first, but it is impossible to ignore the vast amount of opportunity and the demands for high end medical care. Moving into the future, the companies that develop a long term commitment to the Asian marketplace will reap significant benefits. If conservative assumptions about GNP growth hold true, the East Asian economy will surpass $6 trillion by the year 2000. By the year 2000, less than five percent of the population of East Asia will be classified below the poverty line. One billion Asians will live in households with consumer spending power, and over 400 million of them will be as rich as their western counterparts. Asia is simply too vast a market to ignore.<p>

<h3>DCCA RECEIVES GRANT FOR EXPORT DEVELOPMENT</h3>

Governor Edgar announced that the state has been awarded a $450,000 grant by the U.S. Department of Commerce for export development. "Exporting is one of Illinois' greatest economic strengths," the Governor said. "We manufacture products that are in demand in the global marketplace, and one in eight Illinois jobs is dependant on exporting. It is crucial that Illinois continues to expand and explore markets which have untapped potential. This grant will help Illinois businesses identify those markets and sell their products in foreign markets that are emerging as significant trading partners with our state." <p>

The grant awarded to the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs is one of only eight Market Development Cooperator Program competitive grants awarded this year by the U.S. Department of Commerce for export development. Lt. Governor Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the program DCCA will implement with the grant stresses the importance of cooperation. "This program is an intergovernmental private/public partnership," Kustra said. "The Illinois Manufacturers Association, the Illinois State Chamber of Commerce and The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce supported our proposal and will promote the services to be offered to their members and other interested companies. Small and medium size businesses, in particular, will benefit from the extensive assistance we will be able to provide with this grant."<p>

The program will assist Illinois firms in the targeted industries of environmental, health and information technologies. The markets to be targeted are China, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, South Korea and Turkey.<p> 

Marketing Assistance will be offered at three levels:<p>

<ul>
<li><em>State Level</em> - Trade and Catalog shows for export ready companies will be organized by DCCA's International Buisness Division. The IBD is also responsible for the overall administration of the program.<p>
<li><em>Regional Level</em> - Seminars on market opportunities and exporting training for new-to-export and new-to-market companies will be provided by Illinois' four regional International Trade Centers, which are located in Glen Ellyn, Peoria, Champaign-Urbana and Edwardsville.<p>
<li><em>Local Level</em> - Electronic database development for trade show recruitment and follow-up matching for new-to-export and export ready companies in Chicago will be provided by the City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development Office of International Affairs.<p>
</ul>

<h3>1996 GOVERNOR'S EXPORT AWARDS</h3>

Acknowledging exports as a vital component of the Illinois economy is an important factor for continued economic growth. The Governor's Export Awards were created to recognize and encourage small and medium sized Illinois exporters as well as organizations which work to promote export awareness for Illinois products. Signed into law (Senate Bill 269) by Governor Jim Edgar in 1993, the Governor's Export Award program is designed to highlight the significance of Illinois in the world marketplace. <p>

Currently in its third year, DCCA is administering the awards program as part of the agency's overall strategy to promote business expansion into global markets. Small and mid-size enterprises were responsible for more than one-third of total merchandise exports in 1994 and play a crucial role in driving the next generation of U.S. jobs. Companies that are competing to overcome the "export gap" should apply for this prestigous award. Deadline for application is March 29, 1996; and presentation of the Awards will take place on May 16, 1996, at the Crossing International Borders Annual Conference. The conference is jointly sponsored by DCCA's International Business Division and Arthur Andersen and will be held at the Chicago Hilton and Towers.<p>

Awards will be given for outstanding achievement in global competition in the following three categories:<p>

1)  New to Export (honoring companies that have successfully exported Illinois products for one to five years); <p> 

2) Continuing Exporting Excellence (honoring companies that have successfully exported for more than five years); and<p> 

3)  Export Awareness and Development (honoring not-for-profit organizations involved in the promotion of Illinois exporting and raising export awareness).<p>

Winners are selected each year by the Governor's Export Award Review committee comprised of a representative for the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, the Illinois Department of Agriculture, and Illinois based trade organizations and firms experienced in international business. Applications will be judged on export sales as a percentage of total company sales, growth of export sales, number of employees involved in export sales, and distinct factors indicating progressive international marketing strategies.<p>

For information on obtaining a Governor's Export Award application or for information regarding the Crossing International Borders Conference to be held on May 16, 1996, at the Chicago Hilton and Towers, please contact Patty Makropoulos of the International Business Division at 312/814-5713; TDD, 800/419-0667.<p>

<CENTER><H3>Global Access from Illinois</H3></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
Illinois has long known the importance of international trade.  
Illinois created its International Business Division, housed at the 
Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, in 1965 and  was among the 
first states to open an international trade office when it opened a 
facility in Brussels, Belgium in 1968. Today the state helps businesses 
pursue international opportunities from offices in Brussels, Tokyo, Hong 
Kong, Mexico City, Warsaw and Budapest, as well as through trade leads, 
participation in trade shows, catalog shows and trade missions.  In 
addition, the International Business Division, headquartered in Chicago, 
oversees a network of International Trade Centers in five locations around 
the state to help smaller Illinois businesses achieve success in the global 
marketplace.<P>

International markets play a critical role in the Illinois economy.  
International powerhouses such as Caterpillar Inc., Deere & Company, Archer 
Daniels Midland and Motorola are headquartered in Illinois, helping to make 
Illinois the fifth largest exporting state in the nation, seventh in 
manufactured exports and second in agricultural shipments.  Exports of 
agricultural products and manufactured goods from Illinois in 1994 were 
estimated at more than $26.4 billion.  Nearly 500,000 Illinois jobs are 
linked to exports and nearly 236,000 Illinois workers are employed by 
foreign-owned firms.<P>

Illinois is home to O'Hare International Airport, the world's 
busiest, which is served by all of the major international carriers.  
Thirteen port districts are located in the state, offering companies direct 
links to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.  Foreign trade zones, 
which offer low-cost production and warehousing facilities for imported and 
export-bound products, are located at the Illinois International Port 
District in Chicago, the Tri-City Regional Port District near St. Louis, 
and in Peoria, Rockford, the Quad Cities and Lawrenceville.<P>

More than 150 export managing/trading companies and more than 100 
international freight forwarders and custom house brokers maintain offices 
in Illinois.  At least 60 foreign governments have representatives in 
Illinois and 59 nations maintain consulates in the state.<P>

Seventy international banks have established branches or 
representative offices in Chicago.  The Illinois Export Financing 
Partnership, a joint effort between the Illinois Department of Commerce and 
Community Affairs and the Illinois Development Finance Authority, also 
helps small and medium-sized exporters by packaging loans for the Working 
Capital Guarantee Program through Eximbank, the independent U.S. government 
agency that facilitates the export financing of U.S. goods and services. <P>

<HR>

In order to provide Illinois companies with an improved system to receive international trade leads, DCCA's IBD has implemented a new technologically proficient system known as "ExPro" (Export Promotion Trade Management System).  ExPro is designed to facilitate the matching of companies with trade leads in order to deliver fresh leads in a more timely manner.<P>

Companies interested in this free service may request a Company Background Sheet form from the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs - International Business Division.  After the form has been completed, it may be returned, via fax or mail, to our office.  The form will require companies to provide their 6 digit Harmonized System (H.S. or Schedule B) Codes and their 4 digit SIC Codes for each product.  A foreign trade lead, specific to your industry, can then be matched and faxed directly to the company.  Harmonized System Codes may be obtained from either your company's shipping department, a freight forwarder/custom broker, or you can contact the U.S. Department of Commerce at 301/763-5200 or fax to 301/763-1109.<P>

Company specific information will be entered into our database and your company will be notified via fax of any trade lead matches as they occur. Our database is uploaded weekly via a computer clearinghouse to insure access to the most current trade lead information possible.  If you wish to participate in this program, please call DCCA's International Business Division at 312/814-7164; TDD, 312/419-0667, or send your request via fax to 312/814-6581, Attention: ExPro - Guang Yang.<P>

<HR>
<H3>IV.  Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Any business (such as golf courses, orchards, nurseries, crop production or any business using  large amounts of water) planning to drill a water well with an expected use of 100,000 gallons a day must notify the local Soil and Water Conservation District of its intent to be a substantial user of water.   In the counties of Kankakee, Tazwell, Iroquois, and McLean, businesses must register any new well.<P> 

In  emergencies (such as drought) the Department has authority to restrict groundwater withdrawals in those 4 counties.  Failure to notify the Soil and Water Conservation District of a proposed new point of withdrawal (a well), or any business failing to register a well in the 4 counties named above, or a business failing to restrict withdrawals if required to do so by the Department, is guilty of a petty offense.

<H3>V.  Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Notice to the local Soil and Water Conservation District Office of the intent to be a substantial user of water may be by phone or in writing, but must be given before  construction of  the well begins. The Soil and Water Conservation District then notifies the Illinois State Water Survey, which conducts an investigation to determine the impact the proposed groundwater withdrawal may have on other water users.  The conclusions of that investigation are published in a general circulation newspaper. The Soil and Water Conservation District informs any local units of government that might be affected by the proposed groundwater withdrawal.  The review must be completed within 30 days of receipt of the notice.

The drilling company normally complies with those requirements (although it is the responsibility of the business to be sure that they do) and to provide a "well log" to the State Water Survey.   The business must make pumping data available and allow the Department and/or Soil and  Water Conservation District employees access to private property to conduct investigations.

An Administrator may require an escrow account be established and impound fees or other funds until all obligations have been fulfilled, or a surety bond is furnished.  Registration may be denied, or registration suspended or terminated by an order of the Administrator, if an application/registration form is incomplete or if an annual report disclosure statement is deficient. In such a case the Administrator gives written notice to the  applicant or registered party, who may then request a hearing to modify or vacate the Administrator's order.

<H3>IV.	Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
In order to be designated as a Qualified Solid Waste Energy Facility (QSWEF), electric generating facilities fueled by either methane gas from a landfill or from the incineration of solid waste must meet specific criteria.  Illinois electric public utilities are required to enter 10-year (landfill gas) or 20-year (solid waste) contracts to purchase the electricity generated by the QSWEFs located in their respective service territories at rates that are approximately equal to the average rates that units of local government (e.g., cities or counties) pay the utility for electric service. The public utilities who purchase the electricity are entitled to tax credits equal to the difference between the amount paid for electricity and the amount that they would have otherwise been required to pay such facilities for electricity under the federal law (federal Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978). At the end of its contract, a QSWEF is required to begin repaying the State for the tax credits taken by the utility for purchasing its power.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.	Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
The owners or operators of an electric generating facility must file a petition with the Illinois Commerce Commission seeking a determination that the facility meets the criteria for QSWEF status. The Commission will hold a public hearing to determine whether the facility qualifies.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI.	Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
The owners or operators of an electric generating facility must be able to demonstrate compliance with the requirements for QSWEF status that are set forth in the Public Utilities Act and Local Solid Waste Disposal Act, and if QSWEF status is granted, file reports with the Illinois Commerce Commission demonstrating their continuing compliance with such requirements.<P>

There are no filing fees.

<DL><DD>The purpose of EPCRA is to provide
information to the public that can help protect private citizens and
property against adverse effects of an inadvertent release of an extremely
hazardous substance into the environment and to minimize the likelihood of
such an occurrence. The Act requires businesses to file reports identifying
hazardous substances, chemical locations, chemical properties, etc., at
their facilities in amounts above established threshold quantities.  EPCRA
requires the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC) and the Local
Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to make these reports available to the
public upon request.  Because this information is accessible and useful, it
provides local citizens and local government officials an opportunity to
mitigate and prepare for any contingency involving a release of a hazardous
substance into the environment.  A business must notify immediately the
National Response Center, IEMA and the LEPC, and give pertinent information
about any inadvertent release of a hazardous substance into the environment
in reportable quantities.</DD></DL>

Chemical Inventory (Tier) report.

<P>2. Any facility with 10,000 pounds or more of a hazardous substance (as
defined by the USEPA) must file either a list of chemicals or a MSDS, and
an annual "Tier" report to the SERC, the LEPC and the local fire
department.

<P>3. Any facility that releases into the environment reportable quantity of
either an extremely hazardous or hazardous substance must report this
release immediately to the National Response Center, the SERC and the LEPC.
A written follow-up notice is also required to be filed with these agencies
as soon as practical after the initial notification.</DD>

<HR>
<H3>IV. Requirement Description:</H3>

<DL><DD>The purpose of the ICSA is to establish an
orderly system to assure that owners and/or operators of business
facilities are adequately prepared to respond to a release of chemical
substances into the environment and to improve the ability of State and
local authorities to respond to such releases.  Businesses subject to ICSA
regulations are those assigned or included within the Standard Industrial
Classifications (SIC) named in the Act 430 ILCS 45/3.  The requirements of
Act also apply to businesses that are subject to the provisions of Section
302 of the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act
(EPCRA) of 1986 and  use, store and/or manufacture a chemical substance in
a quantity that poses a threat to the environment or public health.  The
ICSA requires business owners/operators to prepare a written Chemical
Contingency Safety Plan (unless exempted by the statute), to maintain a
copy of it on the business site, and provide copies to the local emergency
response agencies.  These businesses must certify in writing to IEMA that a
Chemical Contingency Safety Plan has been developed and provided to the
local planning and response agencies and the dates that the plans were
delivered to local officials.</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V. Approval Process:</H3>

<DL><DD>None.  However, the IEMA may issue an exemption from
these requirements for chemical substances used or stored in innocuous
amounts that are not likely to result in a release that threatens the
environment or the public health.  Exemptions are issued on the basis of an
on site inspection of a facility.</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI. Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>

<DL><DD>Requirements of the

  To hire an alien, an employer must demonstrate that no U.S.  workers are available, and that the employment of the alien will not adversely affect working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. 

As a first step in the U.S. Immigration process, an employer must file a Labor Certification request with the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES), the agent for the U.S. Department of Labor (IDOL).
Hiring an alien without  authorization subjects an employer to fines (and in some cases is a felony).

The employer must post the position within his company, enter a job order into the Statewide Job Service system, and advertise the job in a publication identified by the Alien Certification Unit. The employer will be sent resumes of U.S. workers submitted through IDES and must interview qualified applicants.

If an employer fails to hire U.S. workers referred by IDES or any individuals submitting resumes, he/seh will be directed to document, in detail, why the U.S. worker had been rejected. IDES will follow-up with those applicants referred for their insight into the interview with the employer. If an employer fails to comply with the directives of IDES, the case will be referred directly to the U.S. Departmen of Labor Certifying Officer for a ruling, thereby delaying the hiring process. If the Labor Certification for an alien worker is not granted by the USDOL, the employer may appeal directly to the USDOL, Alien Labor Certification Unit.

<DL><DD>
Permits may be required of any business that has emission units (stationary equipment, operations and associated control systems) that have the potential to emit any regulated air pollutant (particulate matter, volatile organic material, and nitrogen oxide). Businesses usually required to have these permits are steel mills, manufacturing plants, electric utilities and chemical plants, as well as certain smaller businesses like hospitals, dry cleaners, grain terminals, print shops and electroplating shops. <P>

Construction Permits are required for the construction of new
emission units and modifications to existing units if those
changes increase emissions, and are valid for 1 year. <P>

Operating Permits  include four (4) types:  Smaller Source
Permit, State Operating Permit, Federally Enforceable State
Operating Permit (FESOP) and Clean Air Act Permit (CAAPP).  The
type of operating permit needed depends upon the amount of
regulated pollutants emitted and the geographical location of
the business and commonly are valid for 5 years. To determine
which Permit is needed, ask for "Does Your Business Need an Air
Pollution Control Permit?", from the Agency.<P>

If both are applied for at the same time, they both commonly are
valid for 5 years. Operating without a Permit may result in
fines.  Permit holders failing to comply with the Act are
subject to penalties that vary with the severity and duration of
their actions.<P>

However, when public notice is required (e.g., FESOP, CAAPP & significant or major construction), the Agency is allowed 180 days or more to respond. Permit applications are reviewed by Agency engineers and are approved if the application shows that the emission units comply with all applicable air pollution control regulations. <P>

Applications can be denied if non-compliance is shown or if insufficient information is provided in the application. Permit denials can be appealed through the Pollution Control Board. <P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI.	Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>

<H3>IV. Requirement Description:</H3>

<DL><DD><P>The purpose of the permit program is to
provide assurance that planning is provided for proper environmental
safeguards for the location, preparation, operation and abandonment of
mining, mining related activities and mine refuse disposal operations in
order to prevent pollution of waters within the state.  Mining and mining
related activities include the surface or underground extraction or
processing of natural deposits of coal by the use of any mechanical
operation or process.  The term mining also includes the recovery or
processing of coa from a mine refuse area.

<P>Related activities refers to all activities at a facility which are
directly in furtherance of mining, including activities before, during and
after mining.  Such related activities include but are not limited to coal
refuse disposal and coal combustion waste (CCW) disposal.  The term mining
related activities does not include land acquisition, exploratory drilling,
surveying and similar activities.  Also included in the Mine Pollution
Control Program permit process is coal transfer facilities and coal storage
yards (exluding consumer stockpiles) which is defined as any areas where
coal is transferred from one mode of transportation to another or where
coal is dumped, piled, stored or blended.

<P>Coal docks, blending yards, conveyor belts and pipelines are also included
herein.  Conducting Mining or Mine related activities without a permit is a
civiil penalty punishable by a fee of not more than $10,000/day that
violations are occuring.  The permit generally remains effective for a
period of 5 years at which time a renewal is required.  If a renewal
application is submitted at least 180 days prior to permit expiration, a
standard condition will allow the permit to remain effective until such
time as the renewal is addressed.</DD></DL>
<HR>
<H3>V.  Approval Process:</H3>

<DL><DD><P>In order to obtain a permit (Subtitle D or NPDES),
an application must be completed and submitted directly to the IEPA.  In
instances of a new facility construction or significant revisions to
existing facilities, a permit is not only required by the IEPA but also
from the Illinois Department of Mines & Minerals (IDMM).  If this is the
case, the application to IDMM may be used as a joint application to the
IEPA, if so indicated.  All applications to the agency, whether a direct
submittal or submitted as a joint application to IDMM/IEPA, shall be
complete and include all items and requirements identified in Title 35,
Illinois Admin. Code, 405.104.

<P>All applications are reviewed by the IEPA for completeness, accuracy and
compliance with mine related environmental regulations.  Reasons for denial
of a permit from the IEPA -Mine Pollution Control Program would include any
proposed activity that threatens or allows the discharge of contaminants
into waters of the state.  Any permit denial can be appealed to the
Illinois Pollution Control Board.  The average processing time for a new
locations is generally quite timely and by comparison, shorter than for
renewals.</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI. Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>

</DD></DL>

<H3>IV. Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
A license, a permit and/or a certificate is required for projects that will cause a discharge into streams, wetlands or other bodies of water.  Federal permits are issued by the Corps of Engineers under the Dredge and Fill program.  Licenses are issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for hydroelectric power facilities.  Certificates issued by the Agency confirm that a proposed project may be constructed and operated in compliance with the applicable water quality standards established by the State.  Dredging, placement of fill, draining or other similar actions in streams, lakes, canals and adjacent wetlands must be authorized by the Corps of Engineers and the Agency under the Section 404 and 401 permit/certification program.  Causing a discharge into streams, wetlands and other bodies of water without the proper permit is subject to fines up to $50,000 plus $10,000 for each day the violation continues.  Permits remain effective until a project is completed.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V. Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Applicants must file a "Protecting Illinois Waters" form including a description of the proposal and copies of plans and drawings of the project with the Corps of Engineers.  For projects requiring an individual permit, the Corps will issue a public notice jointly with the Illinois Department of Transportation and the Agency describing the project and offering the public an opportunity to comment and to request a hearing on the matter.  At the end of the public notice period the Agency will review all comments and evaluate the water quality aspects of the proposal.  If disputed issues arising from the impact of the proposed project and the public can be resolved, certification will be issued, usually within 30 days of the end of the public notice period.  The Corps usually acts within 3 to 6 months after an application is received.

</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>IV. Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Permits are required to construct and operate a community public water
supply (CPWS) that serves 25 or more residents or that has 15 or more
residential service connections. (The Illinois Department of  Public Health
regulates smaller water supplies.)  A permit may be issued only to an owner
or official custodian in charge of the water supply.  The purpose of a
permit is to insure that installations, changes or additions to a CPWS do
not adversely affect the sanitary or mineral quality, or the adequacy of a
water supply.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V. Approval Process:</H3>

<EM><STRONG>Construction Permit:</STRONG></EM> Applicants must submit an Application for Construction
Permit, together with construction drawings (bearing the seal of an
Illinois registered engineer or architect), specifications and an
engineer's design summary.  Applications are reviewed and approved by
Agency engineers if the proposed work will  not adversely affect the
sanitary or mineral quality and adequacy of the water supply. Law requires
the Agency to respond to applications for a permit within 90 days unless a
fee is required, in which case the Agency must respond in 45 days.<P>

<EM><STRONG>Operating Permits:</STRONG></EM> A permit to operate is required before improvements to
an existing water supply may be put in service.  The Agency provides the
required form at the time the construction permit is issued.  The official
custodian of the CPWS must sign the form and confirm that a certified
operator is responsible for the water supply system. The permit holder must
provide satisfactory water sample test results to the Agency.  Applications
are sometimes denied because a CPWS has reached it's expansion limit,
because of  technical flaws in the proposed construction, or because the
CPWS is in violation of a water quality standard.  If denied, an
application may be appealed to the Illinois Pollution Control Board.<P>

<HR>
<H3>VI. Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Owners and official custodians of CPWS must register with the Agency.  A
CPWS must be under operational control of a certified operator in
responsible charge of the water supply.  Owners/official custodians of a
CPWS are subject to monitoring and reporting requirements administered by
the Agency's Bureau of Water, Compliance Assurance Section.
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VII. Fees:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Application fees for permits to construct,  install or extend water mains:<P>

From 200 to 1,000 feet = $120.<P> 
From 1,000 feet to 5,000 feet = $360.<P>
Over 5,000 feet = $600.<P>

</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>IV.	Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
A Development Permit authorizes the construction or installation of a "unit" (meaning any device, mechanism, equipment or area used for storage, treatment or disposal of waste, prior to September 18,1990).   An Operating Permit authorizes the use of a waste treatment, waste storage or waste disposal operation.  An Experimental Permit authorizes use of a process or technique that does not satisfy the requirements set forth in this Section when the applicant submits proof that the process or technique has a reasonable chance of success and the environmental hazards are minimal.<P>

A Supplemental Permit is the mechanism by which these permits are modified to reflect changes in the facility or regulations under which the facility operates.<P>

The permits apply to facilities that receive wastes from off-site.  Storage, treatment and disposal, within the site where such wastes are generated, are conditionally exempt from Permit requirements. However, the agency may require a Permit for these activities through enforcement proceedings if conditions warrant it.<P>

Conducting these activities without a permit may result in civil suits by the State's Attorney, the Attorney General's Office or any third party alleging violations of the Act.<P>

Development or Operating Permits don't expire. Experimental permits may be valid for up to 2 years. Landfill and composting permits are valid for up to 5 years.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.	Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Applicants for a Development Permit must file Forms LPC-PA1, LPC-PA3, LPC-PA8 and LPC-PA16. <P>

(For oil storage facilities, substitute Form LPC-PA13 instead of LPC-PA3.) 
(For "potentially infectious medical waste", substitute Form# LPC-PA17 in place of  LPC-PA3.) <P>

(For landfills, substitute LPC-PA2 instead of LPC-PA3.) (For composting, substitute LPC-PA6 instead of LPC-PA3.) <P>

For landscape waste composting, substitute LPC-PA12 instead of LPC-PA3.) 
Guidance is available for "land treatment of petroleum contaminated soils" and should be considered before submitting an application for that activity.  <P>

Applications for an Operating Permit must include Forms LPC-PA1, LPC-PA4 & LPC-PA16. Applications for an Experimental Permit require the same forms as a Development or Operating Permit, together with an explanation of the proposed experimental process and proof or reasons why the process should be allowed and why the process poses a minimal environmental threat..<P>

Applicants for Supplemental Permits must submit the forms appropriate for the type (i.e. development or operating or experimental) of permit being modified. <P>

The Agency has: 1) 90 days to reach a decision on solid waste permits (nonhazardous), but usually reaches a decision in 60 days; 2) 45 days for operating permits (where construction has been completed), but the Agency usually reaches a decision within 30 days. The review period for an existing landfill (which was not required to go through siting), and new landfills, will be 180 days.Permits for the management of non-hazardous solid waste (i.e., storage, treatment or disposal) of off-site generated wastes.<P>

The most common reasons Permit applications are denied is due to technical deficiencies such as not providing secondary containment around tanks and/or containers. <P>

If an application is denied, the applicant may appeal the decision to the Pollution Control. In the hearing the burden of proof is on the applicant. The denial may be resolved through negotiations with the agency before the Board holds the hearing. The negotiations may result in a revised permit.  <P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI.  Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Facilities managing waste received from an outside source must receive local siting approval before a Permit application may be filed with the Agency.<P>

Technical data, such as design drawings, specifications and engineering studies which accompany applications must be certified and sealed by a  professional engineer licensed to practice in Illinois.<P>

Facilities accepting nonhazardous special waste, must file an annual report with the Agency by February 1 of each year, specifying the quantities and disposition of the waste accepted during the previous year. <P>

Permits will usually specify inspection requirements, groundwater monitoring (in some instances), financial assurance for closure (for landfills) and soil testing (for remediation  of contaminated soils). <P>

A permit is required to breed, hatch, propagate or raise aquatic life species including, but not limited to, amphibians, reptiles, crustaceans, mussels, clams, gastropods, fish and aquatic plants.  

Permits are issued for one year, and are valid from February 1 of the year issued and expire the following January 31.
</DD></DL><HR><H3>
V.   Approval Process:</H3>
                           <DL><DD>
A permit will be issued by the Department upon receipt of a completed and signed Application for Aquaculture Permit, together with the necessary fees.  

Applications require approval by a Department biologist, which includes an inspection of proposed facilities if an application involves a species not named on the Department's "Aquatic Life Approved Species List".  

Applications may be denied (or consideration of an application may be postponed) if applicant has not provided sufficient information regarding risks associated with a species not named on the Department's "Aquatic Life Approved Species List".  In such instances, applicant may appeal the denial to the Chief of Fisheries.

The Department cautions applicants that no authority is granted to operate an aquaculture facility until a permit actually is issued.  The mere filing of an application or  possession of a canceled check representing payment of fees does not entitle a person to operate an aquaculture facility.

Typically, permits are issued approximately 2 to 3 weeks following receipt by the Department.

IV.  Requirement Description:</H3>
                                  <DL><DD>
A permit from the Department is required for any individual to "hold, possess or engage in the breeding or raising of live fur-bearing mammals".  A permit must be obtained before purchasing a species and species can be obtained only from another licensed breeder.  

Only eleven species are authorized for possession by this permit.  They are: Badger, Beaver, Gray Fox, Red Fox, Muskrat, Mink, Raccoon, River Otter, Opossum, Least Weasel and Long-tailed Weasel.

It is illegal to take a species in the wild, and this permit does not authorize taking animals from the wild.  (Note:  1. A Permit does not authorize possession of striped skunk, bobcat or coyote, and possession of those fur-bearing species is prohibited.  2. A permit may not be required for breeding, raising and producing in captivity, and marketing by the producer, of Mink, Red Fox or Arctic Fox as live animals or as animal pelts or carcasses.  Such activity may be deemed to be an agricultural pursuit and persons so engaged may be considered "fur Farmers".  For complete details consult the Department at the address shown above.)

Permits are issued for a period of up to one year and expire on March 31 after the date of issue.
       </DD></DL><HR><H3>
V.   Approval Process:   </H3>
                              <DL><DD>

Applicant must swear that the information contained thereon  is true and accurate. False or deceptive information may subject applicant to arrest and revocation of license privileges for up to five years.

Licenses are issued approximately two weeks after a properly completed application and fees are received by the Department.  Common reasons for denial are applications that name a species not authorized a species obtained from an unlicensed breeder, and incomplete applications.
                                      </DD></DL><HR><H3>

<HR>
<H3>IV. 	Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
A permit is required to extract coal, either by surface or underground methods, including removal of coal refuse. Exemptions from this requirement are as follows: 1) No permit is required where 250 tons or less of coal are removed in any 12 consecutive months for the  landowner's or lessee's own noncommercial use, or 2) where the extraction of coal incidental to the extraction of other minerals does not exceed 16 2/3% of the total tonnage mined for purposes of commercial use or sale.  However, where incidental extraction is proposed, the entity must first receive an exemption from the Department.  (This procedure is explained in a separate OMM Business Requirement Profile: "Approval to Conduct Incidental Coal Extraction".<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.  	Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Applicants must file an application including background environmental data, legal information regarding an applicant's right to mine, any past violation history, corporate structure (if applicant is incorporated), maps and detailed engineering drawings prepared by, or under the direction of, and sealed by a qualified, registered professional engineer licensed in Illinois. <P>

Applicant is required to place a newspaper advertisement for 4 consecutive weeks, describing the type of proposed activity and location. Anyone who believes he or she may be adversely affected by the proposal may request a conference or hearing.  <P>

Based upon OMM's internal technical review, and comments received from the general public and Interagency Committee, a decision to approve, deny or modify the application is issued. (In nearly all cases, the Department issues a decision requiring the applicant to modify the application.) If the applicant responds positively to OMM's request for modifications a permit may be issued.  Generally, applications take 1-2 years to process. A permit may be denied to anyone "blocked" on the Applicant Violator System, a computer network of mine operators with compliance problems.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI. 	Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
OMM may not issue a permit until an applicant posts a performance bond guaranteeing reclamation of the site. <P>

Coal mine sites require a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit from the Illinois EPA. Additional permits may be required from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources - Office of Water Resource Management, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers if floodplain disturbances are planned or if a large impoundment is proposed to be constructed, and the federal Mine Safety & Health Administration.  Operators are obligated to adhere to performance and monitoring requirements. <P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VII. Fees:</H3>
<DL><DD>
$125 per acre for all land within the permit boundary to be surface mined. $5 per acre for each year the bond is in force for all non-surface mined land within the permit boundary.<P>

<HR>
<H3>IV. Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Any entity using radioactive material in Illinois must be licensed or
registered with the Department.  (Certain small sources or quantities of
radioactive material, such as those found in home smoke detectors or
luminous dial watches, are exempt.  Other small quantities, such as some
gauging devices, only need to be registered.)  Businesses that want to use
radioactive material that is not exempt, or quantities and forms other than
those requiring registration, must obtain a Radioactive Materials License.<P>

Typically, Licenses are required for medical use, research, and
manufacturing of items containing radioactive material.  Entities using
measuring and gauging devices (moisture/density gauges, lead paint gauges,
etc.) must also obtain a Radioactive Materials License prior to receiving
and using them.   Anyone may contact the Department to determine if a
license is required for a particular use. Using radioactive material
without a license is a Class B misdemeanor.  Licenses are valid for 5
years.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.  Approval Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Applicants for a Radioactive Materials License must file an application.
The Division of Radioactive Materials will provide assistance in preparing
a license application.<P>

Applicants must describe the type and quantities of radioactive material to
be used and the procedures to be followed for the safe receipt, use,
storage and disposal of radioactive material.<P>

If the Department review determines that the proposed program of radiation
safety is adequate to protect public and worker health and safety, a
license will be issued in 30 to 90 days.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VI. Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
License holders  may be inspected periodically to ensure the requirements,
regulations & conditions of the license are being met. Licensees also must
comply with regulations concerning accreditation of technologists for
medical use of radioactive materials and certification of industrial
radiographers.  Licensees may also be subject to low-level radioactive
waste reporting requirements.
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VII. Fees:</H3>
<DL><DD>
The various fees associated with licensure are specified in Title 32,
Illinois Administrative Code, Part 331.  They cover the cost of routine
licensing and inspection activities performed by the Department and vary
according to the degree of complexity of the license. Licensees and
applicants for a radioactive materials license can contact the Division of
Radioactive Materials for detailed and specific information regarding fees
for a particular use of radioactive material.  There also are fees
associated with Technologist accreditation, Industrial Radiographer
certification and generation of low-level radioactive waste.

<H3>IV.Requirement Description:</H3>
<dl><dd>
Federal and state law require judges in domestic relations cases to order employers to withhold a portion of an employee's income for payment of child support. Whenever an Order for support is entered, a separate Order for Withholding must be entered also. The Order for Withholding is served on the employer immediately unless the parties agree and an alternative arrangement that insures payment of support is secured. An employer may not fire, discipline, deny employment or otherwise penalize an employee because he or she is subject to an Order for Withholding. Employers have 10 days after being served with the Order to comply. Non-compliance with the Order may result in a fine on the employer of $100 per day plus payment of the amount of the order.
</dd></dl><hr>
<H3>V. Approval Process:
</H3><dl><dd>
Illinois courts, the Illinois Department of Public Aid (IDPA), or administrative agency or court of another state may issue a Support Order and an Order for Withholding and have it served on an employer. Upon receipt of a Support Order and an Order for Withholding from another state, an Illinois employer must treat it as if it had been issued by an Illinois tribunal, provide a copy of the order to the employee, and distribute the funds as directed in the order.<P>

The employer may withhold from the employee's pay the amount(s) stated in the Order, but not more than the limit allowed by the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act (FCCPA). Some Orders will state that the employer must enroll minor children as beneficiaries in the company's health insurance plan. The employer must send withheld child support amount(s) to the Clerk of the Circuit Court, the IDPA, the court or administrative agency of another state and/or the child's custodial parent, as directed in the Order. The withheld insurance premium is sent to the insurance carrier.<P></dd></dl><hr>

<H3>VI. Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post Requisites:</H3>
<dl><dd>
In cases where insurance coverage is mandated, employers must notify the custodial parent, IDPA, or the court or administrative agency of another state, of the date when coverage begins, information on the dependent coverage plan and all necessary claim forms within 15 days of enrollment (or upon request).  Employers must notify the office that served the Order when an employee is no longer employed. If available, employers must provide a new address, name of a new employer and other information that may be necessary to continue the withholding process. If health coverage is terminated or changed for any reason, the employer must notify the custodial parent, the IDPA, or the court or administrative agency of another state of the change and any conversion privileges within 10 days of the change date. For each deduction, the employer must provide the Clerk of the Circuit Court, the IDPA in direct pay cases, or the court or administrative agency of another state with the date the employee was paid. The employer must pay the amount withheld to the custodial parent, IDPA, the Clerk of the Circuit Court, or the court or administrative agency of another state in accordance with the court's Order or Administrative Order for Withholding, within 10 calendar days of the date the employee is paid.<p></dd></dl><hr>

<H3>VII. Fees:</H3>
<dl><dd>
An employer can deduct a fee of up to $5 per month for each Order for Withholding. The fee is to be deducted from the employee's remaining pay (wages excluding the amount withheld). This fee must be within the limits of the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act.

<DL><DD>
Laboratories performing microbiological analysis of milk may have a Certificate of Approval from the Department acting under the authority of the US Food & Drug Administration (USFDA). Certificates are granted on the basis of a  laboratory's facilities, quality control records, equipment and the performance of the analysts. This requirement applies to laboratories at dairies, commercial milk laboratories, and health departments.<P> 

Certificates name the analysts who have demonstrated the ability to properly perform representative test procedures with which they are involved while under observation of the certification officer. Each new analyst must meet the certification requirements and demonstrate competency prior to performing milk tests.<P> 

Violations may result in a 60 day suspension from testing all milk products subject to rules under the Grade A Pasteurized Milk Ordinance.<P>

Full certification is granted when the split milk samples and the evaluation are successfully completed.  The Department schedules another  on-site evaluation before the expiration date of the Certificate.<P> 

The most common reason for denial of Certification is the inability of the analyst to correctly perform the procedures during the on-site evaluation, failure to properly analyze split milk samples, malfunctioning equipment, or inadequate records.<P> 

Applicants may reapply after 60 days, once the deficiencies from the original evaluation have been corrected. Upon certification, certificate holders are given a guidebook on the USFDA's statutes and regulations which must be followed.<P>

Applicants must submit an application to become a licensed lead abatement contractor together with other information including a certificate of financial responsibility documenting liability insurance, a letter of credit or bond (minimum $250,000), a copy of a valid Lead Abatement Contractor/Supervisor's License issued to the contractor or the name of a Lead Abatement Contractor/Supervisor employed by the contractor, the contractor's written statement that only licensed lead workers will be employed, a copy of the contractor's written standard operating procedures and employee protection plans, which include specific reference to medical monitoring and respirator training programs as required in OSHA regulations at 29 CFR 1910.1001 and 29 CFR 1926.62 (1993), and; a description detailing all legal proceedings, lawsuits or claims which have been filed or levied against the contractor or any of his past or present employees or companies in regard to construction related activities. Applicants licensed or certified as Lead Abatement Contractor in another state may request reciprocal licensure. IDPH evaluates the requirements for licensure in the other state and issues a license if IDPH determines that the requirements for licensure in the other state are equal to the requirements for licensure in Illinois. If an application to become licensed is denied, the applicant may attempt to correct any deficiencies found in the application and then reapply. To renew a contractor license, applicants must submit an application and a certificate of completion of an Illinois-approved refresher Lead Abatement Contractor/Supervisor 8-hour (1 day) course that is issued to the contractor or a contractor/supervisor employed by the contractor. The average  processing time for the contractor license is approximately 1 week.

<HR>
<H3>IV.	Requirement Description:  </H3>
<DL><DD><P>A Motor Fuel Use Tax is imposed on interstate carriers operating commercial motor vehicles* on highways in Illinois. There are two Motor Fuel Use Taxes programs: 1.) the International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) and, 2.) the Illinois Interstate Motor Fuel Use Tax.  Illinois based carriers who operate one or more commercial motor vehicles in at least one other IFTA jurisdiction can apply for an IFTA license and decals.  A carrier based in a non-IFTA jurisdiction, who wishes to operate in Illinois, can apply for an Illinois Interstate license and decals.

<P>An Illinois license and IFTA decal allows a carrier to travel in all IFTA jurisdictions and to file a single return with the Department, reporting miles traveled, gallons used and gallons purchased in each jurisdiction.  The carrier then pays the net due, or receives a refund, whichever applies.  An Illinois Interstate license and decal only allows the carrier to travel through Illinois. If a carrier qualifies as an IFTA or Illinois Interstate licensee but does not wish to participate in either program, a single trip permit (valid for 72 hours) must be obtained from the Department or from a wire service to travel through Illinois.

<P>Operating a commercial motor vehicle in Illinois without displaying a valid motor fuel use tax license, a decal, or a single trip permit, is a petty offense. A commercial motor vehicle found operating in Illinois without registering and securing a motor fuel use tax license or single trip permit is subject to a penalty of $1,000. Operating as a motor carrier without a valid motor fuel use tax license or a single trip permit is a Class A misdemeanor, and each subsequent offense is a Class 4 felony.</DD></DL>
<HR>
<H3>V.	Approval Process:  </H3>
<DL><DD>Applicants for a Motor Fuel Use Tax license and decals must complete and file application Form # MFUT-12 with the Department.  Licenses and decals are valid for a maximum of one year, from January 1 through December 31.  Applications for licenses and decals are processed in approximately two weeks, but may take longer during renewal season (October through February).  Carriers may be required to file a bond if they have failed to pay taxes, file timely reports with the Department, or an audit indicates it is appropriate to protect the interests of member jurisdictions.  Common reasons for denial of licenses are if the carrier:  Is revoked in Illinois or another jurisdiction, the application is not signed by an owner or corporate officer, has failed to file returns, has a balance due of over $50.00.  Carriers may appeal denial of an application.</DD></DL>
<HR>
<H3>VI.	Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:  </H3>
<DL><DD>Carriers must file a quarterly return.  Form (MFUT-15) with Fuel Summaries must be completed by Illinois IFTA carriers.  Form (MFUT-16) must be completed by Illinois Interstate Carriers.</DD></DL>
<HR>
<H3>VII.	Fees:  </H3>

<DL><DD><P>There are no application or renewal fees.  However, the fee for decals is $3.75 per set for each calendar year.  Checks must be made payable to the Illinois Department of Revenue.

The Illinois Income Tax Act (IITA) and the Retailers Occupation Tax Act (ROTA) impose a liability obligation upon the purchaser of assets* of a business for any unpaid sales, withholding, income, or excise taxes from the seller. This includes returns to be filed for any period up to the close of business, or the sale date. The IITA and ROTA provide for a reporting of a sale. Also, a requirement is imposed on the purchaser to withhold funds from sale proceeds. This acts to limit the amount of transferee liability the purchaser may be held liable for.  A release of transferee liability is issued when the seller's accounts are clear or the purchaser has paid the funds in escrow.<P>  

Purchasing a business without complying with the requirements may result in the seller's unpaid liabilities being transferred to the purchaser.  *(Defined as the major part of  the inventory, furniture and fixtures, machinery and equipment, or real estate.) <P>
