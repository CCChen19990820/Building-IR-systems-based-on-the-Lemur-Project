[A short blurb from the Boston Globe, 11 Dec. 1991]

Washington - The Hubble Space Telescope has shut itself down temporarily
because of a computer programming error that rotated its communications antenna
into a technical no-parking zone.  The Hubble went into a "soft safe mode,"
shutting down some but not all its systems and halting scientific work on
Monday.  It is programmed to take this kind of action whenever necessary to
protect itself from harm.  In this case, it was at the hands of what officials
called a "fluke" buried undiscovered in its millions of lines of computer code.

   [PGN provides the following additional excerpt from an AP item:] 

   The trouble was in the system that swivels to keep the Hubble's antenna
pointed to an overhead relay satellite, as the telescope orbits the Earth.  On
Monday, the onboard computer issued a command that exceeded the software
limits on the speed of antenna movement and the system went into an emergency
"safe mode" to protect itself from harm.  "These things are going to happen
over 15 years," Weiler said, calling the incident "a non-problem." The Hubble's
planned lifetime is 15 years.

According to a report by WEWS-TV, a repair technician at a U.S. Postal Service
facility in Columbus, OH, when repairing a machine used to automatically stamp
messages on cancelled letters, reconfigured the machine to display a test
message that he had learned from his instructor during training, but forgot to
reset the machine to print the correct message after he completed his repairs.
So now, instead of "MERRY CHRISTMAS" or "HOLIDAY GREETINGS", thousands of
letters in circulation bear the message "YOU BITCH".

   [Also noted by Mowgli Assor &lt;mowgli@cis.ohio-state.edu&gt;:

      only envelopes 5 1/4-inches tall or taller were affected, but Johnson
   said postal officials estimated that more than 12,000 were printed and only
   a handful were caught before they were loaded onto trucks for delivery. The
   office handled about 5 million pieces of mail Saturday ...]

This rings a bell with me, because I have seen a few cases where this type of
message was used in test versions of software.  For example, a young programmer
I worked with placed a message in a program instructing the user to press a
certain key to "bomb off", which would produce a dump of the program's current
state so that he could examine it.  The message made it out the door and into a
customer's hands.  They were less than amused.  In another case, an obscene
message was displayed when the use entered an illegal value at a prompt.  That
software was almost sent out the door, but was caught at the last minute and
removed.

I suppose the moral is don't enter anything in the system you wouldn't want a
customer to see.

&gt;From _Westword_, an alternative Denver weekly (12/4/91):

Safeway may be turning its "preferred customer" program into a "proffered
customer" deal.  According to the _Wall Street Journal_, grocery stores in
Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and Denver are part of a Citicorp program that
uses checkout scanners to record shoppers' buying habits.  You may have thought
that preferred customer card was just a way to get some free Jimmy Dean sausage
and a friendly monthly letter from Safeway's Bob Green -- but it also links
your name and mailing address to your shopping list.  Once you've presented
your card, your personal purchases are no longer so personal.

Citicorp originally planned to sell data on shoppers' purchasing patterns to
grocery marketers.  But for the last month, the _Journal_ says, that
information has been for sale to all comers.  It's handily divided into eight
categories, including "weight-conscious consumers" (511,227 names of people
caught buying lo-cal treats) and "fancy food buyers" (refrigerated pasta is
enough to brand you fair game for marketers of travel magazines).

And just where does the fried-pork-rind-and-Cheese-Whiz contingent fit in?

   [Imagine the fun a health insurance company could have with this
   information:

if (subscriber) {
   if (high-fat-foods &amp;&amp; !fiber) {
      colon-cancer++;
      rates++; }
   if (cigarettes) {
      lung-cancer++;
      rates++; }
   if (condoms) {
      sexually-active++;
      rates++; }
   if (KY-Jelly) {
      test-for-aids++;
      rates *= large-number }}

(Of course, they would never purchase the records from my health club for
"physically-active++; rates--").

The fact that Citicorp offers this information for Safeway customers certainly
implies the same type of information is available on your Citicorp-issued
credit cards.

Aha!  A new, high-interest category: unfaithful spouses!  (Check for flowers or
hotel rooms within 50 miles of home charged to credit cards).  Sure to be read
by divorce lawyers across America!

Framingham Union letter solicits from dead - again
 
By Adam Gaffin
NEWS STAFF WRITER
     FRAMINGHAM - The letter expresses the hope that Matthew Jong's recent stay
in Framingham Union Hospital went well and asks him to consider making as large
a donation as possible.  The only problem is that Matthew Jong was pronounced
dead in the hospital emergency room on Oct. 5 after a car accident on Rte. 9 in
Natick.
     ``This solicitation was the final straw,'' says his mother, Gail, a
Wellesley resident. She has been fighting with the hospital for two months over
the way she was told Matthew was dead - a phone call from the emergency-room
doctor, rather than a visit from a Natick or Wellesley police officer.
     At least one other deceased Framingham Union patient has received a
similar letter since September, when the hospital said it had fixed a computer
glitch that resulted in a number of dead people being sent fund- raising
letters. At the time, Ross Mauro, the hospital director of marketing, said he
had been assured this ``will not, cannot happen again,'' by the hospital's data
processing department and the firm hired to send out the letters to former
patients.  ``Your gift will be an investment in the future health of your
family and your community,'' the letter, signed by medical-staff President
Joseph Baron concludes. ``It could help save the life of someone you love.''
     ``This family has suffered enough and we wish they never had gotten the
letter,'' said hospital spokeswoman Ruth Stark.  She said the mix-up occurred
partly because of the way the emergency-room physician who attended Jong filled
out a form on his case.
     A standardized form is required for every patient who enters the hospital,
and care-givers are supposed to mark a box on the form with a one-letter code
indicating the patient's status.  
     In Jong's case, the doctor wrote ``deceased - sent to morgue'' in longhand
across the form, rather than putting an ``E'' - for ``expired'' - in this box,
Stark said.  The form ultimately wound up in a data-processing office, where
workers type patient information into a hospital computer. A clerk did not
notice the box was empty on Jong's form, and did not read the doctor's
comments, and so entered his data into the computer, she said.
     The computer is supposed to delete the records of anybody who is deceased,
a prisoner or a Medicaid patient before the data is shipped to the mailing
company, Stark said.  ``It's not a foolproof system,'' despite efforts to
reduce such incidents.''...  She said hospital personnel have been reminded to
fill out the box to prevent such mishaps.  But she added that the computer
program that does the deleting is currently set up to assume that a blank
disposition box means the patient went home and that officials are looking at
ways to change that.  ``We are intending to insure that this doesn't happen in
the future,'' she said.   [...]

According to a report in the Guardian newspaper (London), of 6 Dec 91, a recent
murder case was solved by police partly through a computer disproving a
suspect's alibi.

John Tanner murdered his student girlfriend and hid her body underneath the
floorboards of her house. Initially, the police treated him as a witness rather
than a suspect, but his story began to fall apart. He told the police that he
and the girl had taken a bus ride together to the train station at a time when
she was already dead. The Guardian reports:

"The company that runs the local bus service keeps computerised records of its
tickets. Only one person got on the bus and bought a ticket to the station at
the time Mr Tanner claimed."

A RISK, I suppose, of trying to get away with murder. But also another example
of low-level, invisible, surveillance that computers introduce into our lives.

    From Oracle Teletext Service (ITV, UK), 8 Dec 1991:

"Urgent checks are going-on following the Severn Tunnel rail crash on backup
equipment installed after earlier technical problems with the signals.  Sixteen
people are still in hospital after the crash between an Intercity and a
two-carriage Sprinter on Saturday.  BR [British Rail] is looking at whether
there was `further failure of equipment' or whether human error was involved.
The express had slowed to 20mph after a proceed-with-caution signal and was hit
by the Sprinter from behind - so what signal, if any, did the Sprinter get?"

  [`Intercity' and `Sprinter' are two types of train. The crash which happened
  on Saturday morning injured close to 100 people.]

Excerpted from an article by EVAN RAMSTAD, AP Business Writer, 10Dec91:

   DALLAS (AP) _ TRW Inc. has settled a lawsuit with 19 states and the
Federal Trade Commission, which accused the company's credit reporting unit of
violating consumer privacy and making reporting errors that harmed the credit
ratings of thousands of consumers.  The settlement requires Cleveland-based TRW
to make sweeping changes in its credit reporting business, including providing
reports to consumers who ask within four days.  [...]
   The settlement comes against a background of growing consumer anger over the
enormous power of credit reporting companies, which keep financial dossiers on
tens of millions of Americans.  [...]
   The lawsuit cited cases where different consumers' reports were mixed
together and said such inaccuracies are hard to correct. The states and FTC
charged old information reappeared in consumers' files and that consumer
disputes were not adequately investigated.  [...]
   The settlement requires TRW to improve its procedures so that files of
consumers are not mixed up and to prevent old information from reappearing in
consumers' files.
   TRW also agreed to establish a toll-free number for consumer inquiries,
investigate information disputed by consumers and check public records if
necessary to verify information.
   The company also agreed to notify consumers of their rights to dispute
information and to tell them, upon request, about other companies to whom the
credit reports have been sold.
   TRW also agreed to disclose to consumers their individual credit scores,
starting Dec. 31, 1992.
   The company will have to keep records of its compliance and pay the states
$300,000 to cover legal costs, according to the settlement.

   [PGN saw a Washington Post article on 11Dec91, page F1, by Albert B.
   Crenshaw, who noted that as part of the settlement TRW said it would

     * Adopt procedures to prevent data mixups
     * Review within 30 days any disputed information, and delete any that
       cannot be confirmed within 30 days
     * Delete any disputed information when the consumer presents relevant
       documentation
     * Implement procedures to prevent reappareance of seriously derogatory
       information that has been deleted following a complaint.            ]

&gt;From Gov't Computer News, Dec. 9, 1991:

FBI SHOPS FOR A SPEEDY FINGERPRINT SYSTEM

... The FBI wants IAFIS [Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification
System] to complete urgent fingerprint matches in under 15 minutes. It expects
a three second response to searches for name and description against its
Criminal Master Database.  Now the fingerprint and information searches can
take two weeks...  The system is slated to start running in Clarksburg, W.Va.,
in late 1994 ...

IAFIS will give law enforcement agencies throughout the country a way to check
fingerprints electronically, through the FBI's National Crime Information
Center (NCIC) network... AFIS will perform a search of the agency's national
fingerprint database.  The system will provide a list of the most likely
candidates, or a message reporting that none were found...  The FBI wants a
system that has a 95% accuracy rate for 10-print searches.  For crime scene
prints, "the correct candidate shall be listed in the top-ranked position 50%
of the time, and in the top 20 positions 65% of the time"...  To keep the
system secure, the FBI will not make technical details public.

The Criminal Damage Bill, 1990, is about to be passed into law in Ireland,
containing what appears to be an extremely broad definition of 'unauthorised'
use of computers. Section 5 reads as follows:

(1) A person who without lawful excuse operates a computer ...
within the State with intent to access any data kept either within or
outside the State ... shall, whether or not he accesses any data, be guilty
of an offence ...

(2) Subsection (1) applies whether or not the person intended to access any
particular data or any particular category of data or data kept by any
particular person.

Section 6 states that "lawful excuse" applies: "...if at the time ...he
believed that the person... whom he believed to be entitled to consent to or
authorise the ... accessing of the [data] in question had consented, or would
have consented to or authorised it if he or they had known of .. the accessing
and its circumstances, [or] if he is himself the person entitled to consent to
or authorise accessing of the data concerned"

 This Bill has been passed by the Dail (roughly equivalent to the House of
Representatives) and is on its 2nd stage in the Senate (roughly equivalent to
the US Senate) on Thur 12th Dec.
 I would appreciate any comments on what this Bill implies, and examples of
legislation in other jurisdictions. The wording would appear to me to be
extremely dangerous and ill-conceived.
 This is NOT a hypothetical case. I have contacts in the Labour Party ( the 3rd
largest party here ) who want to propose amendments to this Bill, and they have
asked me for advice. There is every chance that they will succeed, if they can
propose an intelligent alternative.
 The last chance to amend it will be late Dec / early Jan.  Then it will become
law.

The Boston Globe "TV Week" movie listings had an unusual description for
one movie this past week:

    _New York, New York_ (1977) Robert De Niro, Liza Minelli.
    Apres la deuxieme guerre mondiale, une chanteuse aide un
    saxophoniste a joindre un orchestre fameux de jazz.  (120m.)

The rest of the listings were in English, as they normally are.  The  
Globe had this to say (Saturday, December 7, 1991):

    A spokeswoman for Tribune Media Services, which supplies the
    movie listings to newspapers in the United States, Canada, and
    the Caribbean, tells us someone selected the wrong description
    of the film from the company's data base and included it in the
    listings sent to the Globe.  Some television stations carry
    English-language films dubbed in French, she notes.  The English
    description reads: "A singer and a saxophonist team up and break
    up in the postwar big-band era.  Directed by Martin Scorsese."

It is hard to believe that this error would have occurred, and not been caught,
before the age of computers.  The RISK here is that as the chain of events
handled purely by computers lengthens, it becomes possible for relatively major
errors to occur unnoticed, because no one is looking closely at the output at
any stage.
                              	Dan Franklin

P.S. A non-RISK is that those of us who can understand a little French
can be amused at how different the two descriptions are...

I've now simmered down, but I was in a state of seething fury yesterday 
from the behaviour of our local Poll Tax office.

Earlier this year, I split up from my wife, and moved house.  Still within the
city, but they gave me a new tax account number: I thought it pretty daft then.
Three months ago I changed the method of payment; in October, they recognised
this and sent me a letter saying that the first payment would be requested from
my bank on 26th November.  On the 2nd December I received a tax demand; when I
finally got through to the payments office, they agreed that it was silly, and
should be dealt with by the direct debit.  Almost immediately, they rang me
back and said there was no direct debit mandate on my account.  If I'd really
given them one, would I please call my bank and ask them to send a copy of
their half of the mandate?  Yesterday, I called them again: I had with me a
copy of their letter about the mandate.  They were adamant; finally we came to
the joint realisation that there were _3_ accounts involved - the one at my old
address, my present one, and the one that had the mandate.  The payment people
had no record on any account they could look at of my mandate.  Through to the
registration people: ah yes, they said, we had a problem with the accounts of
the previous occupants of your house, so we deleted all accounts with that
address.  Sorry, we seem not to have transferred your mandate when we created a
new account for you.

The risk?  Incompetent use of computers causes raised blood pressure!

An advertisement has been running in major computer professional
magazines that I find both obnoxious and dangerous.  I've seen it in several
places, but I'm looking at the inside back cover of the December 2, 1991
PC WEEK (Vol 8. #48).  It's an ad for Central Point Software's "Central
Point Anti-Virus."

The ad has an illustration of nine computer screens.  Eight of them appear
to show illustrations of the results of these virii, but to anyone familiar
with one or more of them they are obviously "artists interpretations."

Though I haven't encountered every virus "shown," it appears that all of
these screens embellish the actual results of the virus, not only making
the results of infection look scarier, but giving some expensive publicity
to the authors of the Stoned Virus, Friday the 13th Virus, Datacrime
Virus, Aircop, Ping Pong, and Falling Letters.

The RISK here, of course, is that giving free publicity to virus authors will
encourage them (and others) to new heights of "creativity". I'm angry in
part because I have been victimized by computer virii.  I think I've got  at
least some understanding of the mind of a computer vandal, and the only
motivation I could see for releasing a virus would be a desire to see your
program widely publicized and your programming "skill" demonstrated.
This ad takes it one step further, prominently identifying and enhancing
(in garish color) the on-screen look of the virus.

I would feel the same way if I was a park system manager, and a company
that sold cleaning agents highlighted the work of a graffiti artist who
was well-known in my town.  If they  also hired professional artists to
improve the quality of this punk's graffiti, and ran photographs showing
statues and benches  allegedly painted by him or her, I'd be raging mad.

Central Point makes some pretty good software.  I've purchased some of it
(not this product, though).  I angered that they seem willing to stoop this
low to sell their product.  I also wonder how long it will be before some
company is willing to stoop low enough to unleash some nasty code from
which their product can protect users.

I certainly can't speak about all of the break-ins.  But I was part of a team
that monitored many such attempts -- and these were very definitely traced back
to the Netherlands.  For more details, see Bill Cheswick's paper at the
forthcoming Usenix conference.

As for the notion that it's up to the U.S. military to take precautions --
nonsense!  What ever happened to ethics?  Is it not sufficient that it's their
computer -- for almost any value of ``their'' -- and they don't want you there?
I note that Herschberg's students have prior permission to conduct their
break-ins.  That's fine -- I not only have no problem with that, I conduct such
authorized break-ins myself as part of my job.  Again, though, note that I'm
acting with prior permission.

John Bowers (University of Manchester) and I were talking a couple months ago
about various interesting people who have been studying technological issues
using new-fangled methods from philosophy, literary criticism, and sociology.
One recurring theme is the influence of "post-structuralists" like Derrida,
Foucault, Lacan, and Deleuze [*].  We realized, though, that these folks are
all scattered among disciplines and countries, so that a lot of them don't yet
know each other.  So we've started up a network discussion group for such
people and their sympathizers.  Its main purpose is to get everyone introduced
and exchanging papers, though perhaps some interesting discussion will start up
as well.  Its address is postech@weber.ucsd.edu.  Anyone who wants to be
included can send a note to postech-request@weber.ucsd.edu.  (Make sure to
include a network address that's accessible from the Internet: me@here.bitnet,
uucpnode!me@gateway.somewhere.edu, me@machine.here.ac.uk, me@ibm.com, or
whatever.)  We'll collect addresses for a month or so; then we'll invite
everyone to describe their work and see what happens.
                                                           Phil Agre, UCSD

[*] The relevance to Risks is that a number of these people tend to take a dim
view of technology as a system of social practices, and have novel things to
say about why we should care.  Foucault in particular has defined an
interesting broad sense of "technology" that includes both the physical
machinery and the kinds of cultivated selves that together, he argues, make up
the deep workings of power.  These ideas have led to some challenging new work,
such as Valerie Walkerdine's book "The Mastery of Reason" (Routledge, 1988),
which uses ideas from Foucault and Lacan in a genuinely deep way to explain how
children learn to use mathematical language.

     AT&amp;T Restores `800' Service
   BASKING RIDGE, N.J. (AP, Friday the 13th, December 1991)
   Thousands of toll-free "800-number" calls were blocked throughout the East
on Friday night, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph said.  The outage struck at
7:20 p.m. as technicians loaded new software into computers in Alabama, Georgia
and New York, said Andrew Myers, an AT&amp;T spokesman. The software identifies and
transfers 800 calls, he said.  Several thousand calls from New England to the
South were affected.
   The company restored service around 9 p.m., when it switched back to old
software. AT&amp;T plans to use the old software until it can find and fix problems
with the new.  "Obviously we don't like it when a single call doesn't get
through, but I wouldn't consider this a serious problem," Myers said.

&gt;From the Seattle Post-Intelligences, Saturday December 14:

             "Boeing Hush-up Charged" by Bill Richards

   A former Boeing computer expert said yesterday that the company ordered him
to play down his discovery of a software flaw in a critical control unit that
could have triggered last May's fatal crash of a Lauda Air Boeing 767.  Darrell
Smith, a computer software engineer employed as a troubleshooter by Boeing in
1989 and 1990, said in an interview with the P-I that he warned the company
last year of problems with software that runs the "proximity switch electronics
unit" (PSEU) on Boeing's 747 and 767 jetliners.
   The device allows the plane's computerized parts to electronically 
converse.  Smith said he told Boeing officials the software could trigger a
rogue signal that would cause the plane's computer-driven systems to
malfunction.  But Smith said Boeing officials in charge of the troubleshooting
program told him they "didn't want to get anybody excited" and ordered him to
omit any mention of potential system-wide problems resulting from the flawed
software from his formal report.  Instead, he was told to report just on the
PSEU's internal problems, he said.  "They said this is a non-critical system 
and I couldn't use terms like `crash' or `catastrophic' in the report because
they didn't want people to get excited," he said.
   Boeing spokesman Chris Villiers said yesterday the company hasn't had time
to study all of Smith's allegations.  Villiers said Boeing doesn't believe
the PSEU was responsible for the Lauda Air crash.  Smith's concerns about the
unit's software on the 747 has been "addressed and resolved," Villiers said.
   Smith, who has 13 years experience as a computer engineer, resigned in
June 1990 after turning in what he called a "diluted" report with no mention
of the potential ramifications from the software flaws.  Boeing awarded him
its Certificate of Outstanding Performance just before he quit.  Smith, ...,
said he told Boeing officials the software contained an "architectural flaw"
that could lead the unit to send a random signal to other electronic systems
within a jetliner, providing them with false information.  So poorly designed
was the PSEU software, he said, that he recommended that it be completely
redesigned.
   One of the electronic subsystems linked to the PSEU is the auto-restow,
which is supposed to automatically retract a jet's backup ground braking
system, the thrust reverser, if it accidentally starts to deploy in flight.
[old news about the cause of the accident omitted].
   While Villiers said that the PSEU can electronically converse with the
auto-restow system on the 767, he said it could only order the system to 
retract the thrust reversers, not deploy them.  Villiers said Boeing tested the
software system in the 767 and found no evidence that the PSEU unit was putting
out false messages to other systems.  [Wishy washy statement by FAA omitted]
   But Smith said that because the software's false messages are random, it is
almost impossible to determine in a laboratory setting if the PSEU software
isn't working.  "It all depends on what is going on with the airplane at the
time," Smith said. "There's no way to repeat the exact conditions that would
cause the messages to be sent.  It can cause the system to crash, or get false
information, or just go crazy."  For example, Smith said, the control unit
could notify the rest of the electronic subsystems that the plane's landing
gear was down while the plane was still in flight.  That would cause the
auto-restow to switch to a ground-speed mode check, Smith said.  The system
would then "see that the aircraft was going too fast, and kick in the reverse
thrusters -- while the aircraft was really in flight."
   [more old news about cause of crash and repetition of above deleted]
   Smith said that Boeing passed on the report to Eldec Corp. of Lynnwood,
which wrote the software for the company, and the findings were independently
verified by other Boeing computer experts.  The report says Eldec's software
violated seven of Boeing's own software specification..  "This problem ... is a
very real and serious impediment to the correct operation of the PSEU," it
concludes.  Thomas Brown, Eldec's president and COO, said yesterday that the
company was not aware of Smith's report.  Brown said that while Eldec produced
the software for PSEU units on both the 747-400 and 767, he does not know
whether software could trigger the auto-restow or activate the thrust reverser
system on either jet.  "We are not in a position to answer that question,"
Brown said.  "We don't know all the uses of our signals.  Only Boeing can
answer that."

[P.S.  This story was followed by a story that Lauda had just ordered four
Boeing 777 jetliners and was the seventh airline to do so.  It now has
86 firm orders for the 777.]

The Winter 1991 issue of WHOLE EARTH REVIEW is a special focus issue on
"Questioning Technology".  I haven't yet read it, but it certainly contains
some provocative feature articles (summaries are from the magazine):

Excerpt from the 1991 book "In the Absence of the Sacred: The Failure of
Technology and the Survival of the Indian Nations" by Jerry Mander.  Our
unquestioning faith in technology's ability to solve problems has led us to the
"greatest environmental crisis since the dawn of human life."

"Artifact/Ideas and Political Culture" by political theorist and author Langdon
Winner.  Political ideas embedded in our technological tools often conflict
with our stated ideals.  "No innovation without representation" is the first of
three steps toward technological democracy.

"Assessing the Impacts of Technology" by Linda Garcia, a project director and
senior analyst at the Office of Technology Assessment.  Describes the approach
and political pressures of OTA's work.

"Renegotiating Science's Contract" by Howard Levine, philosopher and former
director of the National Science Foundation's Public Understanding of Science
Program.  We need greater public participation in the formation of scientific
and technical decisions.

"Reclaiming Our Technological Future" by Patricia Glass Schuman, president of
the American Library Association and of Neal-Schuman Publishers.  Debunks
current myths of a paperless future.

"Privacy and Technology" by MIT sociologist Gary T. Marx.  Examines
data-gathering techniques and offers tips on protecting your privacy.

The following is an article that appeared in one of this week's Pittsburgh
Post-Gazettes.  I was originally going to paraphrase the article, but I think
that the entire article is relevant.  So here it is:

Is `E mail' private on firm's computer? (by Glenn Rifkin, New York Times)

When Alana Shoars arrived for work at Epson America Inc. one morning in January
1990, she discovered her supervisor reading and printing out electronic mail
messages between other employees.  As electronic mail administrator, Shoars was
appalled.  When she had trained employees to use the computerized system,
Shoars told them their mail was private.  Now a company manager was violating
that trust.  When she questioned the practice, Shoars said, she was told to
mind her own business.  A day later, she was fired for insubordination.  She
has since filed a $1 million wrongful termination suit.

A spokesman for Epson America, which is based in Torrance, CA, refused to
discuss Shoars's account of the monitoring episode and insisted that her
dismissal had nothing to do with her questioning of the electronic mail
practice.  He denied that Epson America, the United States marketing arm of a
Japanese company, had a policy of monitoring electronic mail.

The Shoars case has brought attention not only to issues of technology and
employee privacy, but also to broader questions of ethics among computer
professionals.  By taking a public stand, Shoars has become a visible exception
in a profession that tends to ignore or avoid ethical issues, according to
academician and consultants who monitor the field.  Although Shoars has found a
new job as electronic mail administrator at Warner Brothers in Burbank, CA, she
still bristles about Epson: "You don't read other people's mail just as you
don't listen to their phone conversations.  Right is right and wrong is wrong."

Michael Simmons, chief information officer at the Bank of Boston, disagrees
totally.  "If the corporation owns the equipment and pays for the network, that
asset belongs to the company, and it has a right to look and see if people are
using it for purposes other than running the business," he said.  At a previous
job, for example, Simmons discovered that one employee was using the computer
system to handicap horse races and another was running his Amway business on
his computer.  Both were fired immediately.  "The guy handicapping horses was
using 600 megabytes of memory," Simmons said.

Federal Express, American Airlines, Pacific Bell and United Parcel Service all
have electronic-mail systems that automatically inform employees that the
company reserves the right to monitor messages.  But many companies have yet to
formulate clear policies.  "It's highly irresponsible for an employer not to
have a policy," said Mitchell Kapor, former chairman of Lotus Development
Corp., who left the company five years ago.  

Some believe, however, that even if there is advance notice, the monitoring of
electronic mail or searching through personal files is flat out wrong.  One who
takes that position is Eugene Spafford, a computer science professor at Purdue
University.  He said: "Even if a company does post notice, is that something it
should do?  The legal question may be answered, but is it ethical?  The company
may say it is, employees say it isn't, and there's a conflict."

Though they oversee the electronic mail networks, computer professionals have
generally removed themselves from such debates.  Simmons said that if ethics
were the topic of a meeting of information systems experts, "it would be a very
short meeting."

Technologists approach the information resource in a distinctive way, said
Detmar Straub, assistant professor of management information services at the
University of Minnesota.  "They say `If the system can do it, let's do it,'
rather than `should the system do it?'" Straub said.  "I've talked to systems
managers who say the wouldn't hire a programmer who couldn't break into any
system."  But as computers and networks extend their reach into global
business, such attitudes may no longer suffice.

"Information systems people should be held to a higher level of ethics than the
general population, just as doctors and lawyers are," said Donn B. Parker, a
senior management consultant at SRI International in Menlo Park, CA.

My cousin, who lives in Wurstboro NY told me that her address was changed 
from a more rural form to one that is suitable for the 911 database.  Just a 
reminder that the representation problem works both ways, we can change the 
representation to conform to the data or we can change the data to conform to 
the representation.  The latter, in fact, is what happens when the a medical 
diagnosis must conform to the data coding.

Another comment on telecom and 911 is that 911 doesn't work universally for 
the same reason that I cannot simply tell my son to always dial my 800 number 
or my pager number to reach me.  The problem is the design flaw in the phone 
system that requires I not only know my destination phone number, but also 
the particular rules of the phone (and PBX or hotel) I happen to be using. 
Maybe some of this will get fixed in ISDN, but for now, I'd like to start a 
campaign to get a standard for dialing that is location-independent.

Ideally, we'd replace "9" on a PBX with "**" to mean a local call.  
Alternatively, we'd establish a new access code such as "**" that would 
always place one into universal dialing mode that would allow dialing of 
1-xxx.  And since "1" is the North American access code, it would allow 
uniform dialing of any international number.  (Yes, it would be very easy to 
accidently dial the codes for other countries -- a solvable problem).

The key here is that if we want to take advantage of telecommunications 
technology we mustn't accept historic accidents like "9" to exit a PBX and 
the inability to use area codes on many local calls, but must tame the 
technology.  More to the point, if we can renumber our houses in the interest 
of safety then we should be willing to complete the process and make the 
phone simple to use -- especially for those who are panicked or simply not 
ready to deal with arcania.  (I also want check digits on phone numbers but 
that is a separate issue).

Maybe we can use the laws protecting the handicapped to argue that the phone 
system is not sufficiently accessible in its present form.

         [In Wurstboro, The Wurst is Yet to Come.  
         Neither a wurstboroer nor a wurstlender be.  
         Unless you are an Auslaender.  'Aus bayou?
         You never sausage nonsense before?  At SIGSOFT '91
         in New Orleans, there were lots of sausages.  And maybe

Robert Jenkins reports on one John Tanner who
  "murdered his student girlfriend and hid her body underneath the
  floorboards of her house..." and how "...his story began to fall apart"
  when, "He told the police that he and the girl had taken a bus ride
  together to the train station at a time when she was already dead."  A
  computer check of the company's records showed, "Only one person got on 
  the bus and bought a ticket to the station at the time Mr Tanner claimed."

Mr Jenkins calls this "... another example of low-level, invisible,
surveillance that computers introduce into our lives..." as though it were
something objectionable, generally to be avoided.

Mr Jenkins missed the point. The computerized records were used in a way that
would pass strict Constitutional test in the USA, yet contributed (I assume) to
the arrest and conviction of a murderer.  In fact, the *identity* of the
passengers was not recorded.  You might way that Mr Tanner was convicted as
much by mathematics as by computerization.  Then, perhaps this would be
"...another example of low-level, invisible, surveillance that mathematics
introduces into our lives."

| It is hard to believe that this error would have occurred, and not been

| of events handled purely by computers lengthens, it becomes possible for
| relatively major errors to occur unnoticed, because no one is looking
| closely at the output at any stage.

The observation is clearly correct, but the claim in the first sentence is
simply incorrect.  Such errors can and do happen all the time at every
newspaper in the world.  Proofreaders are, as they say, human and to err is, as
we used to admit before we took to blaming computers for everything, human.  I
haven't seen any French in my local paper's classified, but I have seen blocks
of Latin (a classical layout mockup tool), ads set in totally pied type, ads
run upside down and, occasionally, backwards, ads run in the wrong section,
etc., etc.

Jean Paul Barrett, a convict serving 33 years for forgery and fraud in the Pima
County jail in Tuscon, Arizona, was released on 13Dec91 after receipt of a
forged fax ordering his release.  It appears that a copy of a legitimate
release order was altered to bear HIS name.  Apparently no one noticed that the
faxed document lacked an originating phone number or that there was no "formal"
cover sheet.  The "error" was discovered when Barrett failed to show up for a
court hearing.

The jail releases about 60 people each day, and faxes have become standard
procedure.  Sheriff's Sergeant Rick Kastigar said "procedures are being changed
so the error will not occur again."  [Abstracted by PGN from "Fraudulent Fax
Gets Forger Freed", an item in the San Francisco Chronicle, 18Dec91, p.A3]

The RISKS annals contain earlier cases of people getting out of jail by
altering the prison computer system database (LA County) or nearly succeeding
in doing so (Santa Clara).  Authentication sufficient to automagically detect
bogus messages (EMail, Fax, voice mail, etc.) has been discussed here in the
past, and might have been useful here.  But probably not...  PGN

     Oracle Teletext service (ITV, UK), 16-Dec-1991, has just reported that two
former keyboard operators have been awarded 6000 pounds Sterling damages
(approx. $10000) against British Telecom for pain caused by their work.  It
appears that the two operators suffered repetitive strain injury (RSI) because
of unsuitable chairs. Judge John Byrt, sitting at a court in London's
Guildhall, said that BT was not negligent by making them work too hard.  "
Union officials said the ruling was a breakthrough in making employers take
responsibility for serious injuries caused by high-speed work on computers. "

dismissal had nothing to do with her questioning of the electronic mail
practice.  He denied that Epson America, the United States marketing arm of a

Allow me to suggest that there may be some merit in this statement. I would
further suggest that there was far more to Epson v  Shoars than we have been
led to think. Some stories I've seen circulating suggest that Shoars was far
from what you would call the ideal worker, in terms of what she produced. At
this point, Epson was searching for a way to eliminate her.  Here, their
problems began. HAve any of you who happen to be supervisors, attempted to fire
a non-productive worker who was among the people supposedly trampled on by
society? I'm talking about EEO laws, of course.

(Before you get bent outta shape, I don't object to the concept of equality,
certainly... just the way the idiots in Washington have decided to provide it.)

 The Shoars case is  one  where the real issues were being masked by supposed
abuses of electronic mail, IMHO. It is perhaps this reason, that causes many to
think that it's not the landmark case that Shoars, as well as certain groups,
would have you think.

Another point... one that nobody seems to get... is her old super still working
for the company?

My old school-mate, Gene Spafford and I diagree on this one, I'm afraid. As
Mike Simmons says:

"If the corporation owns the equipment and pays for the network, that asset
belongs to the company, and it has a right to look and see if people are using
it for purposes other than running the business,"

 I would think restraint could be used on the part of the employer... and is in
most cases.... (FOr example, if my employer didn't, you'd not be reading this).

However, I would point out that with so much work today being done on company
computers... so much of the work day focused on that one item... that watching
Email is one of the few tools left to the employer to monitor the employee. Sit
accross an office from someone on their terminal. Can you tell if they're doing
cost estimates, if if they're laying odds on the ponies, or perhaps playing
D&amp;D?

As someone recently said: If a train station is where a train stops, what is a
work station?

Opinions are my own, of course, and may or may not agree with official
policy... but give me time....

In the Dutch telephone numbering plan, all area codes starting with 06 were
unused until a few years ago, presumably "reserved for future use".
When this empty can was finally opened, it quickly turned into a can of worms.
Within the 06 prefix today, you find:
- toll free services
- services carrying a surcharge, such as party lines (10 callers randomly
  put in "teleconference"), sex lines, etc.
- PTT special services such as Information, Fault reporting, Time, Weather
- Private and public companies and institutions wanting a nation-wide number
And, since mid 1991, the notion-wide emergency number 06-11!

The first digit following the 06 does provide some classification, for example,
06-0 and 06-4 are toll free numbers. But this is not consistent. 06-11 is toll
free, as you might assume, but the number as such is not in the 06-0 or 06-4
number group. The significance of the third digit is not widely publicized,
so it is not obvious what the charge for a certain number will be, unless you
study the subject rather carefully.

And now the computer RISK:
Many companies have programmes their PABXs to disallow calling 06 numbers
because most of these have little or no relevance to the company, and many
carry rather heavy surcharges. In so doing, calling the 06-11 emergency
number is also blocked!

Some companies start to realize the problem, and do something about it. But,
to my opinion, the real problem is a bad numbering plan. An emergency number
should really stand out from "common" numbers, and not be grouped together
with surcharge numbers.

Finally, I totally agree with Bob Frankston that more standardization is
called for in numbering. I travel quite a lot to several countries, and
often have difficulty remembering the international prefix when calling
out from a particular country.

comp.specification newsgroups.  It is probably too long for comp.risks, but
perhaps it would be worth including a pointer to these two newsgroups.

                                First Announcement of
              THE SECOND CONFERENCE ON COMPUTERS, FREEDOM, AND PRIVACY
              L'Enfant Plaza Hotel, Washington DC    March 18-20, 1992

(A longer, complete, electronic version of this announcement is available
by sending a request with any title and any message to cfp2-info@eff.org.)

(The printed announcement (brochure) is available -- see end of this notice.)

     The rush of computers into our workplaces, homes, and institutions is
drastically altering how we work and live, how we buy and sell, and with whom
we communicate.  Computers are obliterating traditional political and
organizational boundaries, making time zones irrelevant, and bridging diverse
cultures.  They are fundamentally changing our culture, values, laws,
traditions, and identities.

     The turmoil of the changes calls into question many old assumptions about
privacy, freedom of speech, search and seizure, access to personal and
governmental information, professional responsibilities, ethics,
criminality, law enforcement, and more.  The only way to sort out these
issues and arrive at a consensus for action is to acknowledge that we don't
know the answers -- and then, with reason and good will, to find the
answers through discussion and education.  That's why the Conference on
Computers, Freedom, and Privacy was founded in 1991.

     The Computers, Freedom, and Privacy Conference is unique.  It has no
"agenda for change".  It seeks only to bring together people from all the major
communities and interest groups that have a stake in the new world being shaped
by information technology, so that they may share their ideas, ideals, concerns
and experiences.

     At the first conference, hundreds of people from the fields of law,
computer science, law enforcement, business, public policy, government,
education, research, marketing, information providing, advocacy and a host of
others met for several days.  It was the first time such a diverse group had
ever assembled, and the exchange of ideas and points of view was electric.

     The conference is "single-track" -- all participants attend all the
sessions.  A morning of tutorials at the beginning of the conference will help
participants get up to speed in specific "hot" areas.  The conference sessions
themselves take up timely and, at times, thorny issues.  Each session aims for
a balance of perspectives in order to assist diverse groups appreciate the
views of others.  A brief examination of the long list of sponsoring and
supporting organizations will reveal that this respect for diverse outlooks is
built into the conference from the ground up.

     The question is no longer whether information technologies will change our
world.  They are, now.  The real question is how we, as citizens and
professionals, will respond to and manage that change.  Those at the Second
Conference on Computers, Freedom, and Privacy will lead the way.

The Boston Globe (December 30, 1991) reported that a disgruntled Honda owner
called its "Better Business Bureau Information Line" toll-free customer
relations number so many times that he clogged the line.  He did the same to
other 800 numbers used primarily by Honda employees and dealers.  In both cases,
he presumably used an automatic redialing mechanism (daemon dialer).  He then
began tying up a Honda facsimile number by transmitting muti-page letters during
a four-day period.

American Honda Motor Co. says that it was forced to ask AT&amp;T to step in and
block the calls which allegedly came from a Holliston, Mass home.  However, AT&amp;T
security said that it also had to block any calls to the Honda numbers for the
entire 508 area code, which covers west and north of Boston.  Attempts to reach
the Holliston complainer was not possible since his phone is unlisted!   

I seem to remember that a televangelist's number was tied up in a similar
fashion a few years ago and there has been rumours of political candidates'
phones being plugged by their competition.  How common is this form of
destructive behavior?  

It will be interesting to see whether AT&amp;T does some form of call or line
blocking on this individual.  How can phones be made open except for certain
parties who overstep bounds?  When are there too many calls and when is the line
crossed into harassment?  Is this a case where caller ID would have "proven" 
harassment?  Under what conditions is someone no longer allowed "phone rights?"
Was the Los Angeles judge's denial of telephone use by Ian Mitnick to prevent
him from connecting to a computer in any way related in a legal sense to this
present incident?  

Good story to end 1991.  The year of ousted regimes, stalled economies, and
phone disorders.  Sort of an updated version of Sex, Lies, and Videotapes, 
to be called Lex, Slides, and Telegaps.

The Washington Post, 5 Jan 1992, page C6 (the editorial page):

  As technologies become more powerful, the distinction between a helping tool
and a decision-making tool keeps gaining importance.  Nowhere is this clearer
than in the case of the new diagnosis-aiding computers, which offer doctors the
benefit of a gigantic data base -- far larger than their own experience could
be -- compiled from the results of many thousands of cases nationwide.  By
conglomerating and analyzing the results of these cases, the computer can read
out a series of alternative treatments, a probability rating on the success of
a given procedure or -- most controversially -- the statistical risk of a
patient's dying upon arrival in an intensive care unit in a given condition.
Physicians with access to such a machine now bear a responsibility at least as
weighty as that of diagnosis itself: that of balancing the computer's seemingly
precise numbers and instant certainties with the knowledge that its results are
dependent upon human judgement.

  According to the staff in a Michigan hospital using a program of this type
called APACHE, the computer's predictions of a patient's statistical
probability of dying -- calculated to two decimal points -- are used strictly
as tools, rather as any doctor might estimate, say, a 10 percent chance of
survival from a given operation.  A better description of risk, in that
scenario, need not govern the doctor's (or the family's) decision as to whether
the risk should be taken, only inform it better than individual experience ever
can.  But the incomplete results of a different study performed in France
suggested that doctors with access to that kind of risk data were more likely
than others to terminate care.  The fear among practitioners is that hospital
administrators or health bureaucrats, all increasingly beleaguered and pushed
by public pressure toward cost-cutting, might see computer-confirmed statistics
on death risk as a road to easier triage.

  Given the capability for vastly enhanced diagnosis by means of computers, the
medical profession will be stuck with the same responsibility -- also vastly
enhanced -- as before: first, to recognize that a computer can serve the cause
of accurate diagnosis only on the basis of properly entered information by the
physician using his or her senses; second, to keep in mind a fact much of the
general public has trouble with, which is that a statistic about the
probability of an event bears no causal relationship to that event.  A person
with a 95 percent chance of dying under a procedure is not the same thing as a
person whom that procedure cannot help, or a person from whom care can be
withheld with no compunctions.  Obscure that distinction, and you take a step
toward making the computer the master -- a bad one.
                                                               - Mike

Subject: AIDS Computer Virus

Remember that "AIDS Computer Virus" that was distributed about two years ago?
The following article appeared in Information Week on December 16, 1991 on page
40.
         Caesar Chavez

                                - - - - - -
"PC VIRUS  BLACKMAIL

"A bizarre British court case involving computer viruses has pointed up the
vulnerability of users with careless policies on PC software.

"Hearing the case of a U.S. scientist accused of computer blackmail late last
month, the court granted a stay after lawyers successfully argued that the
defendant, Joseph Popp, 41, was mentally ill.  Popp was facing 11 charges of
damaging computer systems and attempting to obtain a total of 6 million pounds
($10.7 million) through blackmailing numerous medical institutes worldwide
around Christmas 1989.

"Popp is alleged to have mailed more than 20,000 floppy disks to the research
institutes.  He promoted the disks as containing valuable information about
AIDS.  But the disks themselves contained a software virus, which has since
also been dubbed AIDS.  When users tried to access the disk, they got messages
demanding 200 pounds  (about $350)  to eradicate the virus that had just
infected their systems.

"Popp was extradited to the United Kingdom, where a chorus of scientists from
universities and research institutes claimed that their software had been
damaged when the disks were loaded onto their systems.

"One organization that fell foul of the virus was the Imperial Cancer Research
Fund in London.  Dr. Ron Catterall, director of the fund's computer research

The FAA has an on line pilot briefing sysem called DUAT (Direct User Access
Terminal).  The version of the service I use is provided by Contel Federal
Systems.  For those who are not familiar with aviation weather the raw data is
supplied in a very cryptic form.  To make simplify things for users DUAT has a
decoder that expands this into `english'.

However last night the FT (Terminal Forecast - a 24 hour forward forecast) for
both San Jose (SJC) and San Francisco (SFO) was showing 3 VBSY which was being
decoded as:
                Visibility 3 in snow and blowing spray 

There seem to be two possible causes:

1) a decode error (I don't know what the correct decode of VBSY is)
2) VBSY does mean snow and spray and the NWS screwed up the forecast.

Either way computer weather briefing has a way to go yet.

    [In response to my comment that Mt Hamilton is east of San Jose and
    Mt Diablo east of Oakland, and they do get snow now and then, John noted 
    that the terminal forecast is for conditions on the airport and within 
    the Airport Traffic Area (ATA), which is 5 miles radius.  &lt;"Anyway, I 
    called the DUAT help desk and they thought the idea of snow was rather 
    a good joke - `another bug for the list'."  (John)&gt;  PGN]

I recently asked at my post office how many houses shared the same ZIP+4 code
with my house.  The answer was that if I lived in a single-family dwelling, I
almost certainly have a unique ZIP+4 code.

I note that the USPS now provides a complete database of ZIP+4 addresses in the
country -- it is on CDROM, and it is included in the postal exhibit in
Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, where you can type in your address
(as you would on a letter), and it gives you your ZIP+4 in response.  I tried
it on my address here in Iowa, and it worked correctly.

The risk I see in this is that statistical data that has traditionally been
available sorted by ZIPcode (for example, census data) may be released broken
down by ZIP+4 codes.  If this is done, it destroys any promise of
confidentiality for such data.

Of course, there is a benefit -- you should be able to send mail to me with
only a ZIP+4; no need to mention city, state, street, or house number.

They handed the cards out in alphabetical order to staff, and the barcodes/card
numbers were congruent and the batch was sorted. Skilled person (not self)
examined 3 in sequence, calculated trivial encryption and checksum algorithm
used, inferred card for senior member of staff, used Public Domain code to
generate barcode strip on apple laserwriter, glued to card and swiped through
lock. bingo! instant access to secured areas, leaving calling card of selfsame
high-up all over the online logs.

Infra-Red readers also handle normal light codes. Good eyes can read thick/thin
sequences in strong light so even if numeric code on card doesn't match bars,
its forgeable. Infra-Red also pretty trivial to obtain as it UV reader.

I really think the local admin/security people have been blinded by science.
Apart from anything else the electromagnets which operate the doorlocks look
very subvertable. Another instance of hindering the novice and legitimate,

Come back to car 7 hours later. It has been a hot muggy day, around 35C at the
peak. Car was parked in full sunlight, and is dark (rusty!) brown.  Interior
could well have been 40C or over. (certainly felt sauna-ish inside)

Entire parking voucher is black. Either the spot heat, the continual lower

I hope nobody's using one of these to do "permanent" chart recording or

This afternoon, a colleague at SLAC (the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center)
was showing me the latest screen lock and saver program he had obtained for his
workstation, a port of the one often found on Suns.  This reminded me of an
incident several years ago when I was visiting my friend George Berg.

George is a professor of computer science at SUNY Albany, known in the
department for his AI programs that run for days or even weeks at a time on
several SPARCstations, grabbing every available CPU cycle.  Over the weekend,
George dialed in from home to check on the progress of his latest project and
was a bit surprised to find that it seemed to be running much more slowly than
it had during the week.  When a later checkup again showed minimal progress he
began to invistigate, and found that the machine was indeed busy -- running
Life on the unused screen in his office!  After disabling the screen saver the
real work continued on without further competition.

Getting back to SLAC today, this is quite relevent as some of our computing
tasks involve many essentially unrelated events, work that can easily be farmed
out to machines on the network with cycles to spare.  Obviously productive use
of our resources depends on users understanding that "their" machine isn't
necessarily free to simulate life, compute pi to a million decimal places, or
enumerate the nine billion names of God just because they aren't in the office.
It's also easy to forget just how many resources some "cute" program can use.

I have recently been reading Richard Hamming's book "The Art of Probability,"
(Addison Wesley, 1991) and wish to strongly commend it to those of you who
haven't yet seen it. Please allow me to whet your appetite with the following
brief excerpts.

"This book...is one man's opinion using a rather more scientific (as opposed
to mathematical) approach  to  probability than is usual." 

"Most  authors of probability books present one version of probability as if
it  were the true and only one. On the contrary, we have carefully developed
a sequence of models on what seems to be a reasonably scientific approach."

"The  model  of  probability you adopt is often relevant to what actions you
later  take,  though  most statistics books do not make plain and clear just
what  is  being assumed. Unfortunately, many times the statistical decisions
affect  our  lives, from health, medicine, pollution, etc. to reliability of
power plants, safety belts vs. air bags, space flights, etc."

"The  weak  law of large numbers encourages one to think that the average of
many repetitions will give an estimate of the underlying probability. But we
have seen...that the number of trials necessary to give an accurate estimate
of  the probability may be much more than we can ever hope to carry out. And
there  are  further  difficulties.  We  assumed  the  existence of the mean;
suppose  it  does  not exist! (see the next Section 8.7). It is not that the
author  is  opposed  to  statistics--there is often nothing else to try in a
given  situation--but  the  stated reliabilities that statisticians announce
are  often  not  realized  in  practice.  Unfortunately,  the foundations of
statistics,  and  its applicability in many of the situations in which it is
used, leaves much to be desired, especially as statistics will probably play
an increasingly important role in our society."

I recently received a copy of "A Pathology of Computer Viruses" by
David Ferbrache of the UK Defense Research Agency.  The book is
copyrighted 1992, and is published by Springer-Verlag (ISBN
3-540-19610-2 and 0-387-19610-2).  US price was $39.50. 300 pages.

This book is an extraordinarily comprehensive book on the history, theory, and
operation of computer viruses, and on virus countermeasures.  It is the most
complete book I have seen on the topic to date, and contains a very detailed
description of how PC viruses work and spread, including viruses in networked
environments, viruses in Amiga systems, and viruses in Unix.  In fact, I expect
David to get some criticism for the detail he presents, but it serves to make
the subject matter much clearer.

Chapter 1 is a general introduction to the topic of viruses, worms, and
malware.  Chapter 2 is devoted to the history of viruses and "malware" starting
from the 1960s and thru the end of 1990.  It has a very complete description of
the earliest viruses, including some events and activities that have not been
generally reported elsewhere.  It also includes interesting information on
related activities, such as the founding of the Virus-L mailing list.

Chapter 3 is a nice introduction to the theory of computer viruses, including
discussion of how computer viruses relate to biological viruses, and other
related topics such as artificial life.

Chapter 4 is a detailed discussion of how viruses operate in an IBM PC
environment.  This includes details on camouflage techniques and signatures as
well as spread and activation.  Chapter 5 provides extensive discussion of
techniques to protect against computer viruses.  Chapter 6 is a description of
how viruses work in the Apple Macintosh.  Chapter 7 discusses viruses in
mainframes and Unix systems.

Chapter 8 is devoted to "network viruses" -- worms.  This includes analysis of
early work, the Morris Worm, WANK, Christma Exec, and even a discussion of
e-mail chain letters!  The chapter also has a nice discussion of Internet
protocols that lend themselves to abuse by malicious code.

Chapter 9 is a chapter discussing reactions of the computing community,
including some legislative history and information on the formation of response
teams.  Chapter 10 is a brief statement about the future of the problem.

The book concludes with 18 appendices, listing everything from the DOS
filestore structure to a PC virus family tree to all the CERT advisories to
date.  One of the appendices provides an extensive reading list.


Overall, the book is one of the best books on computer viruses I've seen.
David's illustrations are clear and his prose is quite readable.  I found
information and details in this book that I have not seen in any other virus
book.  The section on the history of computer viruses, in particular, is quite
well done.

There are some small problems with the book, however.  First of all, I was very
disappointed that there were almost no footnotes or citations in the body of
the book.  As I read through the material I noted material that I wished to
pursue further -- unfortunately, there were no citations to allow me to seek
original sources.  I do not doubt the accuracy of the information presented,
but I feel that the lack of specific citations is a flaw in such a scholarly
work.

The book suffered from spotty copy-editing.  I found many places where there
were quite obvious typos.  In a few places, these typos obscured the text's
meaning or distorted some information.  I am not sure whether to fault the
author or the publisher, but is is sad to see in an otherwise excellent book by
an established publisher.

Another minor complaint is that there is no presentation of formal theory about
viruses or worms.  Although this is not an area that has seen much good work,
it would have been useful to have some coverage of that material here to
complement the higher-level descriptions.

The appendix listing other references was good, and contained some references I
have not seen before, but it did not give any indication which of the many
references were particularly noteworthy or why the references were cited.  For
instance, a number of limited-availability BBS postings and Usenet articles
were cited without an indication of why they were included.  At the same time,
the references did not list either of the fine collections of readings by
Professor Peter Denning ("Computers Under Attack" ACM Press/Addison Wesley) and
Professor Lance Hoffman ("Rogue Programs" Van Nostrand Reinhold), nor did it
reference any of the publications by the NCSA.

The book is written primarily for a British audience.  This means that the
coverage of US-specific items, such as anti-virus legislation, is briefer than
a US reader might prefer.  It also means that some small translation of terms
is necessary in spots; of course, this same criticism can be made of many
US-centric books being published in a non-US market.

Despite these criticisms, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is
interested in computer viruses and security.  It presents material clearly and
comprehensively, and provides unbiased coverage of the area (David is not
involved with the marketing of anti-virus software or seminars as are many
other virus book authors).

Fueling is performed by an external source, not by the plane (at least for all
the American made planes that I have worked with, e.g. MD-80's, 727's, etc..)
The plane has a control panel which works on conjunction with the fueling system
from the tanker to indicate how much fuel the plane should take (i.e. how much
do you want to put in) and then automatically cuts off the flow when either the
limit of storage or the limit of input has been reached.  There are internal
pumps to move the fuel around from tank to tank.

It sounds like the fueling panel on the plane was not working correctly and they
needed to manually determine the amount to input.  This is typically done my
either disabling the fueling panel (or overriding the auto-cutoff) and
determining the fueling progress from inside the cockpit.  One problem with this
technique is that it requires multiple people (one in the cockpit, one at the
pumping station, and maybe others from the airline to supervise the
override/disable of the fueling panel).

This practice is quite common w/ older American jets and only occasionally
causes problems, e.g. when fuel spills due to other malfunctions.

The Guardian of 8 January carries the following report, headlined
"Security Flaw in Whitehall":
 
Fake names were fed into a Whitehall [i.e., central government] computer to
give unauthorised staff access to details of top security safes holding cabinet
papers and sensitive defence documents, an investigation by the National Audit
Office, parliament's financial watchdog revealed yesterday.
 
The issue of security furniture, such as filing cabinets for classified
documents, was "left in the hands of an inexperienced officer who had virtually
unlimited control of the system and was not effectively supervised," says the
report.
 
It goes on: "Control over access to the computer system was minimal; staff who
were no longer authorised to use it, and two fictitious names thought to have
been entered by a previous employee, continued to have access.
 
"Staff training was inadequate, procedures were not documented, and inaccurate
stock information was leading to the posting of wrong figures to the accounts.
The staff were unable to generate invoices for equipment and substantial
amounts had consequently not been charged. At least one duplicate payment,
amounting to 92,000 pounds, had been made to a supplier."
 
The report said there was no evidence of fraud, "but the serious lack of
control, and the limited audit trails, made it impossible to provide an
unconditional assurance that it had not."

My landlord has been `politely threatening' us since the first of the year for
overdue rent.  After careful checking, the problem was that both my roommate
and I each happened to pay with a check numbered 144 from our respective
accounts.  The computer supplanted its record of the first check with its
record of the second -- it was counting on check serial number to be a unique
identifier across accounts!  If we were less lucky, we might be in court over
this by now.

piano teaching system from the Software Toolworks was demonstrated for
announcer Katy Couric.  This is a high-quality electronic piano and software
running on several platforms (including the Mac and the PC) which teaches piano
by lessons and by monitoring play on a key-by-key basis.  It was the subject of
some reasonably smarmy ads as Yuppie parents watched, eyes glistening, as their
Little Darlings played rather complicated pieces reasonably well.  The
performance in the ads has been borne-out by tests of the system; it is a good
way of teaching piano skills, interpreted as being able to play the music on
the page.  Thereby, however, lies a potential Risk to music aesthetics.

For when Katy Couric played a decent version of "Happy Birthday", including
some rather elegant grace notes, the computer gave her a low score of 38%.
This is it could not recognize the slight improvisation represented by grace
notes as an improvement over the music displayed on the screen.  In my opinion,
a good piano teacher would give Couric a higher score for the creativity
implicit in grace notes.

More than this, the developers of "The Miracle" seem unaware of the fact that
Playing The Music Exactly As Written (PTMEAW) is (in a global sense) not the
usual practice.  Not only is folk music almost completely improvised, Indian
classical music gains much of its richness from being IN PART improvised by
master musicians every time it is performed.  Even in the Western classical
tradition, improvisation was the norm prior to the Baroque era.  Deliberate
error, even, has played an extensive part in music.  Italian and German
violinists of the 17th century used a system of deliberately "incorrect"
tuning, called "scordatura", by which the Baroque composer Biber gained much
emotional intensity in his violin sonatas.  Up until Beethoven the
instrumentalist in a concerto provided a "coda" in which the soloist could
improvise on the theme, so PTMEAW was not even the norm in Mozart's time.

Nowadays, although classical music is subject to PTMEAW (with the absurd stress
on "original instruments" being part of this), non- classical music, including
folk, rock and country gains much of its liveliness by retaining both
improvisation and "scordatura" (that is, deliberate error for emotional
intensity.)

"The Miracle" completely ignores this by assigning high scores in a dehumanized
fashion to students who, unlike Couric, don't have the creativity to improvise.
I predict that two types of populations will evolve on "The Miracle":
unimaginative keyboarders of the music as written, and hackers, who will misuse
the features.  In neither group will true musicians be found.

"The Miracle" does look like a useful tool for learning music, but I object
both to its operatic name, which makes an overlarge claim, and to its
incorporation of numeric scoring.  The designers could have (under the advice
of a decent musicologist) deliberately eschewed the assignment of numeric
scores and restricted themselves to the display of natural-language
evaluations.

ABC Radio (Australia) reported this morning that different manufacturers "one
armed bandits" (in-line gambling machines) confuse the centralized checking
systems to which they are networked, and destroy each others records.

This has delayed installation of the systems in clubs and hotels around the
state of Queensland, until new code can be put in to ensure they can be checked
up on.

Worry about abuses of the machines for gambling, tax evasion and links with
crime (for money laundering, and alleged mafia involvement in the manufacture &amp;
distribution) has been a big political football here.

The Washington Post editorial in Risks 13.01 (Subject: Life-and-Death
Computer) overlooked one other problem with the APACHE software: it
has the potential to generate self-fulfilling prophecies.

It appears that APACHE is really reporting on patient "profiles": age,
weight, general medical condition, cross-referenced with specific
complaints or injuries and treatments and survival rates.

Since APACHE reduces people to profiles, we might as well use that
term in discussion.

Lets say that a "profile" is not treated with a given procedure, in part due to
the "advice" of APACHE, and then dies.  If the information concerning this
"profile" is then fed back into the APACHE database, this will decrease the
"survivability" quotient for subsequent "profiles" with the same initial set of
problems.  Each time a patient (oops, "profile") with a given complaint is not
treated (and dies), the survival quotient decreases again.

Each time APACHE (indirectly) advises a doctor to withhold treatment for a
condition, it increases the probability that it will "advise" withholding
treatment for the next patient (oops, "profile") with the same basic
complaint/injury, leading to another death, leading to another survival
quotient decrease.

The editorial remarks that "a computer can serve the cause of accurate
diagnosis only on the basis of properly entered information by the physician
using his or her senses".  Even if data is 100% correct, it still leads to
positive feedback which will further skew the output data.

In RISKS 13.01, Warren McLaughlin cites a Washington Post article about
programs which give highly-precise probabilities on medical treatment outcomes,
and how this can lead to doctors relinquishing their proper decision-making
responsibility.

It seems clear to me that the problem here isn't that the doctor
is relinquishing his responsibility by being too trusting of the
software, so much as it is the programmer is relinquishing the
responsibility to the doctor by presenting bad information.

The problems inherent in encoding weights for different courses of action (or
any other "non-monotonic" comparison) is very familiar to anyone familiar with
expert systems.  In addition to the illusion of accuracy illustrated in the
article, there are numerous other kinds of error introduced at every step, from
the initial assignment of weights for the raw data (what is a "favorable
outcome" in treatments to prolong life in a terminal disease), observed
situation (what is "slight swelling of the lymph nodes"), anomolies when these
are reasoned on in conjunction with each other (often you can prove a&gt;b&gt;c&gt;a),
and then, finally, in the way they are reported.

Assuming that these problems are dealt with in a realistic manner, for the
program to communicate reasonably with the doctor, it is necessary to give some
idea of the precision of these numbers.  One of the better techniques is to use
"error-bars".  This can help transform what appears to be a definitive
decision:

Cut off head:  40%
Give aspirin:  30%
Cut off foot:  20%

vs:

 -Treatment-   0   10   20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90  100
Cut off head:  |-------------------X----|
Give aspirin:       |---------X--------------|
Cut off foot:       |----X--------------|

As you can see, this makes it much more clear that the
program really hasn't decided much of anything at all.

It should also be clear from my example that in addition to the numerical
information, an explanation of the reasoning process together may well be
warranted, to check for any unwarranted assumptions, and other things to look
out for.  (Such as the need for reattaching the head after repairs are
effected, and the assumption that the patient is a robot).

(The disease in question, of course, is "headache").

In real life, a doctor giving a second opinion isn't just going to give a
number.  He's going to give reasons, and an idea how sure he is of the
appropriateness of a particular treatment and alternative treatments and even
perhaps alternative diagnosis to consider.  [Or maybe the insurance industry
has this process reduced to a coded number now too, in which case, the Risks
should be obvious].

The deceptive problems of encoding preferences and subjective evaluations into
numbers is, of course, a pervasive problem in other areas.  Indeed, the entire
area of risk analysis is rife with it, as I've pointed out indirectly in other
messages.  It's so much easier to calculate with simple numbers that this is a
very tempting trap to fall into.  But we must resist the temptation to
manufacture certainty where non exists.  Whether we are computer professionals,
scientists, pollsters, or journalists, or newspaper reader I think being
careful with these issues is a matter of professional integrety.  It's an
integrety which is all too often lacking, out of ignorance, sloppiness, desire
to persuade, or desire to be persuaded.

&gt; 1) a decode error (I don't know what the correct decode of VBSY is)
&gt; 2) VBSY does mean snow and spray and the NWS screwed up the forecast.

There's a third possible cause, which I guess I'd call the probably
cause.  Someone made a typographical error.  VSBY is the contraction
for visibility.  BSY could well translate to snow and blowing spray.

For the RISKS folks, note also that the translation Contel provides
is made available as a courtesy.  They have a large disclaimer
stating this, and requesting that the pilot acknowledges his
responsibility for correct translation according to the relevant
portions of the Federal Aviation Regulations.

There is the RISK, though, of typos in critical information with little or no
redundancy, such as the FAA's cryptic weather information.

&gt;Either way computer weather briefing has a way to go yet.

Indeed.  One of the problems with computerized decoding of National Weather
Service (NWS) weather information is that the format, while supposedly
standardized, is actually typed in by humans with no checking in a pretty
free-form format.  In this case, the answer is both (1) and (2).

A terminal forecast has two parts, an 18-hour "forecast" and a 6-hour
"categorical outlook" (although even weather briefers are often unaware of the
difference).  The forecast is relatively detailed: the clouds are going to be
at 4000 feet, it's going to be raining, the visibility is going to be 5 miles
in fog, etc.

The categorical outlook is pretty generic, and just makes braod claims about
the weather, in particular ceilings greater than 3000', visibility greater than
6 miles, etc.  If the visibility is expected to be restricted, "VSBY" is put
into the categorical.

In this case, the forecaster expected the visibility to be at three miles, so
he stuck a 3 in the categorical (free-format, no checking).  This is not a
meaningless thing to do, since three miles of visibility is a "magic number"
(it allows flight operations that might otherwise be prohibited).

This isn't what the "official" format allows, so the program decided
that it had just hit a standard notation for visibility, where the
visibility is given in miles, then followed by letter codes for what
kind of goo is restricting the visibility (for example, "2RF" means
"visibility 2 miles in rain and fog").  "S" is snow, "Y" is spray, and
"B" in front of a code means "blowing," and the "V" I assume was
ignored, so we have "Visibility 3 miles in snow and blowing spray."

The whole weather reporting system is based on ancient 110-baud teletype
technology, and is in desperate need of being trashed and redone.  But it
probably will not be for many years.

It is pretty well established that such abuse of an 800 number (or any number
for that matter) constitutes harrassment.  In the famous case of the guy doing
this to the tele-evangelist, I believe that the caller was prosecuted, found
guilty, and had to make some sort of restitution.

Keep in mind that virtually all 800 (and 900) customers already receive the
caller's number for about 95%+ callers via the carriers' Automatic Number
Identification (ANI) systems (this is actually different from Caller-ID, but
the distinction is too complex to elaborate on here).  Only larger customers
usually receive this information in real-time with the call, but most receive
the caller numbers with their phone bills, or sometime after the call via other
means, and abusive patterns can be clearly seen in such data.

There is more about this incident.  According to the TAB, a very good local
newspaper in this area, Daniel Gregory has been charged with telephone
harassment after he made at least 100 phone calls in one day and faxed a 14-foot
computer banner saying "Dan Gregory is unhappy with his Honda."  Gregory
admitted making the calls.  "It could have been as many as 100 in one day," he
said last week.  "MAYBE I OVERDID IT.  BUT EVEN IF THAT WAS THE CASE, SO LA DE
DA." (Emphasis added by me to highlight why the U.S. is in decline)

He made a comment about the long fax.  "A roll of fax paper is $12 at Staples
(office store).  We're talking about a multi-million dollar company getting mad
because I use a lot of fax paper?"  

While this story has received some coverage around the U.S., it has been treated
as if it is a funny story.  Some form of man-bites-Honda.  The fact is, however,
that this incident shows a vulnerability of technology.  Is this phone clogging
almost a virus-type phenomenon?  Can it be possible on a larger scale?  Say
someone doesn't like their boss, the Internal Revenue, their ex-spouse, a
political candidate, a computer network, or some other party.  Then "la-de-da"
is the right response.  

For all we know, Gregory may run for national office on the La De Da Platform. 
Oop, sorry, I think that political platform is already taken by at least one
other candidate for president.

The comments concerning the effects of a screensaver on a Sun station brings
to mind a couple of incidents that occured a few years ago on our Vax systems.

The first involved a brand new, state-of-the-art VAX 11/780 and a digital 
"clock" (with alarm). A short (50 or 60 lines) DCL program, it was quite
popular until it was found that four simultaneous "clocks" would swamp
the 1 VUP 780 and cause logins to take upwards of five minutes.

The second was a program that used QIO and QIOW calls (never could get all
of the commas straight without help) that enabled the VAX to function as
a terminal emulator. Add in a Racal-Vadic 1200 baud (great improvement over
300 baud Silent 700s) modem and it was possible to debug systems in New York 
from my desk in Florida. With a TekHex conversion, binary traffic was also 
possible (this was before XMODEM, KERMIT, or UUENCODE programs were available 
so everything was "home grown" but worked) so we could make "on-line" fixes
to a Mil-Std-1750A program.

Trouble was that in order to make a multitasking system operate as a terminal,
constant cyclic checking of the workstation port and the output port was 
necessary. As a result the program was something of a hog and we were politely
requested to only use it when necessary, preferably after hours.

In any event, one Friday an engineer left work with his terminal still running
the program (this was a *long* time ago) even though the phone was hung up. 
Three weeks later we got the bill for that weekend from the computing center: 
$32,000.00 for resources used. Needles to say some frantic negotiations ensued.

Of course the high cost of VAX time back then is what financed the PC
revolution here so it wasn't all bad, just "there is nothing new under the Sun"
(sorry).

Actually, rather than letting people mail to me with my Zip+4 (which only
specifies some people exactly and not others) I would rather the post office
(and other shippers) implement a scheme where I can get a unique code (number
or alpha), perhaps of my choice, which identifies my address in Post Office
computers, and only there.

People would be able to mail to:  Code: foobazbarx, U.S.A.

And the mail would get to me.  The P.O. would be pledged never to reveal where
I actually live except on court order.  In fact, the actual information should
only be available in the local post office computer -- other computers would
only know which local post office to send mail for foobazbarx.

Naturally, you could have more than one code, if you wish to pay.  Mailers
would be free to add more redundant information, but you would want a check
letter (the x) on the end so that people who take down your address can be sure
they have it right when they are talking to you.

There's a real way to use computers to preserve your privacy, and make mailing
and address transcription easier, too.

The AP reported from Atlanta 09Jan91 that CNN Headline News came within
seconds of reporting that President Bush had died at the banquet in Japan at
which he had collapsed from stomach flu on 8Jan92.  A caller identifying
himself as Bush's doctor had telephoned CNN about three hours after Bush's
collapse, and said the president was dead.
   CNN and Headline News are two floors apart but use the same newsroom
computer system.  A staff member had typed the telephoned report into the
computer.  CNN executives had determined almost immediately that the report was
a fake and pulled it from the computer file.  But downstairs at Headline News,
it had already been seen on the screen and was nearly broadcast.  CNN Headline
News anchorman Don Harrison started to read the report on the air at 9:45 a.m.
EST during coverage of Bush's collapse, when he was alerted in midsentence by
another staff member, said CNN spokesman Steve Haworth.
   The alleged caller, James Edward Smith, 71, left his number with CNN and was
traced to Idaho, where he was arrested and later put in a mental hospital.

                 Report: 8th Chaos Computer Congress 

On occasion of the 10th anniversary of its foundation, Chaos Computer Club
(CCC) organised its 8th Congress in Hamburg (Dec.27-29, 1991). To more than 400
participants (largest participation ever, with growing number of students
rather than teen-age scholars), a rich diversity of PC and network related
themes was offered, with significantly less sessions than before devoted to
critical themes, such as phreaking, hacking or malware construction.  Changes
in the European hacker scene became evident as only few people from Netherlands
(see: Hacktick) and Italy had come to this former hackers' Mecca.
Consequently, Congress news are only documented in German.  As CCC's founding
members develop in age and experience, reflection of CCC's role and growing
diversity (and sometimes visible alienity between leading members) of opinions
indicates that teen-age CCC may produce less spectacular events than ever
before.

This year's dominating theme covered presentations of communication techniques
for PCs, Ataris, Amigas and Unix, the development of a local net (mousenet.txt:
6.9 kByte) as well as description of regional (e.g.  CCC's ZERBERUS;
zerberus.txt: 3.9 kByte) and international networks (internet.txt: 5.4 kBytes),
including a survey (netzwerk.txt: 53.9 kByte).  In comparison, CCC'90 documents
are more detailed on architectures while sessions and demonstrations in CCC'91
(in "Hacker Center" and other rooms) were more concerned with practical
navigation in such nets.

Phreaking was covered by the Dutch group HACKTIC which updated its CCC'90
presentation of how to "minimize expenditures for telephone conversations" by
using "blue" boxes (simulating specific sounds used in phone systems to
transmit switching commands) and "red" boxes (using telecom-internal commands
for testing purposes), and describing available software and recent events.
Detailed information on phreaking methods in soecific countries and bugs in
some telecom systems were discussed (phreaking.txt: 7.3 kByte). More
information (in Dutch) was available, including charts of electronic circuits,
in several volumes of Dutch "HACKTIC: Tidschrift voor Techno-Anarchisten"
(=news for techno-anarchists).

     Remark #1: recent events (e.g. "Gulf hacks") and material presen ted on
 Chaos Congress '91 indicate that Netherland emerges as a new European center of
 malicious attacks on systems and networks.  Among other potentially harmful
 information, HACKTIC #14/15 publishes code of computer viruses (a BAT-virus
 which does not work properly; "world's shortest virus" of 110 bytes, a
 primitive non-resident virus significantly longer than the shortest resident
 Bulgarian virus: 94 Bytes).  While many errors in the analysis show that the
 authors lack deeper insigth into malware technologies (which may change), their
 criminal energy in publishing such code evidently is related to the fact that
 Netherland has no adequate computer crime legislation.  In contrast, the advent
 of German computer crime legislation (1989) may be one reason for CCC's less
 devotion to potentially harmful themes.

     Remark #2: while few Netherland universities devote research and teaching
 to in/security, Delft university at least offers introductory courses into data
 protection (an issue of large public interest in NL) and security.  Professors
 Herschberg and Aalders also analyse the "robustness" of networks and systems,
 in the sense that students may try to access connected systems if the adressed
 organisations agree.  According to Prof. Aalders (in a recent telephone
 conversation), they never encourage students to attack systems but they also do
 not punish students who report on such attacks which they undertook on their
 own.  (Herschberg and Alpers deliberately have no email connection.)

Different from recent years, a seminar on Computer viruses (presented by Morton
Swimmer of Virus Test Center, Univ. Hamburg) as deliberately devoted to
disseminate non-destructive information (avoiding any presentation of virus
programming).  A survey of legal aspects of inadequate software quality
(including viruses and program errors) was presented by lawyer Freiherr von
Gravenreuth (fehlvir.txt: 5.6 kByte).

Some public attention was drawn to the fact that the "city-call" telephone
system radio-transmits information essentially as ASCII.  A demonstration
proved that such transmitted texts may easily be intercepted, analysed and even
manipulated on a PC.  CCC publicly warned that "profiles" of such texts (and
those adressed) may easily be collected, and asked Telecom to inform users
about this insecurity (radioarm.txt: 1.6 kByte); German Telecom did not follow
this advice.

Besides discussions of emerging voice mailboxes (voicebox.txt: 2.8 kBytes), an
interesting session presented a C64-based chipcard analysis systems
(chipcard.txt: 3.3 kBytes).  Two students have built a simple mechanism to
analyse (from systematic IO analysis) the protocol of a German telephone card
communicating with the public telephone box; they described, in some detail
(including an elctronmicroscopic photo) the architecture and the system
behaviour, including 100 bytes of communication data stored (for each call, for
80 days!)  in a central German Telecom computer. Asked for legal implications
of their work, they argued that they just wanted to understand this technology,
and they were not aware of any legal constraint.  They have not analysed
possibilities to reload the telephone account (which is generally possible, due
to the architecture), and they didnot analyse architectures or procedures of
other chipcards (bank cards etc).

Following CCC's (10-year old charta), essential discussions were devoted to
social themes.  The "Feminine computer handling" workshop deliberately excluded
men (about 25 women participating), to avoid last year's experience of male
dominancy in related discussions (femin.txt: 4.2 kBytes).  A session (mainly
attended by informatics students) was devoted to "Informatics and Ethics"
(ethik.txt: 3.7 kByte), introducing the international state-of-discussion, and
discussing the value of professional standards in the German case.

A discussion about "techno-terrorism" became somewhat symptomatic for CCC's
actual state.  While external participants (von Gravenreuth, Brunnstein) were
invited to this theme, CCC-internal controversies presented the panel
discussion under the technical title "definition questions".  While one
fraction (Wernery, Wieckmann/terror.txt: 7.2 kByte) wanted to discuss
possibilities, examples and dangers of techno-terrorism openly, others (CCC
"ol'man" Wau Holland) wanted to generally define "terrorism" somehow
academically, and some undertook to describe "government repression" as some
sort of terrorism.  In the controversial debate (wau_ter.txt: 9.7 kByte), few
examples of technoterrorism (WANK worm, development of virus techniques for
economic competition and warfare) were given.

More texts are available on: new German games in Multi-User Domain/Cyberspace
(mud.txt: 3.8 kByte), and Wernery's "Btx documentation" (btx.txt: 6.2 kByte);
not all topics have been reported.  All German texts are available from the
author (in self-extracting file: ccc91.exe, about 90 kByte), or from CCC
(e-mail: SYSOP@CHAOS-HH.ZER, fax: +49-40-4917689).

If your Social Security Number = FedTaxNumber of some business, you could be in
for problems. It turns out that both SSNs and Federal Tax number are 9 digits
and the government does issue Fed Tax numbers that match SSNs.

I recently tried to open an account at Savings of America, they did a credit
check with ChexSystems and my SSN flagged a problem.

After 3 months, and much aggravation it turns out that some business has a
Federal Tax number that is the same as my Social Security number and that
business did something to get reported to ChexSystems.

I'm not sure there is anything I can do. Assuming the business really did
something, the credit ding could be legit.

ChexSystems reports that the business does not have my name on it, but from the
S&amp;L's point of view it's possible I opened a business account using my SSN
under the business's name name. ChexSystems won't even tell me the name of the
business.

I don't really care about opening up this particular account, but I'd don't
want me to come back and haunt me in the future, If anyone has any ideas,
please email engber@ils.nwu.edu.

We had an interesting experience this morning with `timed' (a unix Network time
daemon).  A vendor brought a demonstration machine to a first-time unix user,
who let the vendor install it and boot it while it was connected to our
network.  The machine had a `timed' set up as a master.  When the vendor booted
the machine, he did not set the time.

So, the first time one of our other machines on the net asked for the time,
this machine responded.  Soon all of our machines thought that the date was
1/1/1970.  When this was first noticed, our SysAdmins found the errant machine
and shut it down.  Unfortunately, the story doesn't end here.

It seems that there was also a bug in our 'real' `timed' software, such that
any date with more than 1 digit in the day is not handled correctly.  So, the
date went from 1/1/70 to 10/10/92 instantly.  This caused further havoc with
things like 'at' and all sorts of other unix utilities.

We're still picking up the pieces of our database (which tracks things like
work orders and trouble tickets, some of which now have ages of 20+ years!).

Needless to say, we're working on a `reasonableness' check for `timed', as
well as (more) controls on what gets put on our network!

We were configuring the ethernet card on our new 486 UNIX (SVR5) box when we
determined that we needed to boot and run DOS to run the ethernet configuration
program.  (Or possibly the EISA configuration -- this happened in my office but
I was not involved).

No problem: simply create a boot disk from the DOS system across the hall and
reboot DOS.

Unfortunately, that system had been infected with the 'Stoned' virus.  This
virus overwrote the UNIX BOOT TRACK when the infected DOS was booted.

Result -- no more SVR5.  We will probably have to perform a low-level format of
the disk and rebuild the UNIX from original media.

Morals: 1) don't ignore DOS viruses simply because you run UNIX unless you
NEVER need to use DOS.  2) Pound on DOS users to note and report strange
behavior because some infections are very costly (several person-days to
rebuild this system -- at least it was new and had no work-in-progress on it!)

A recent incident that happend to me has called me to question the accuracy
and privacy of bill collecting.

One evening, I received a phone call at home.  When I answered, I was
greeted by a synthetic voice stating: "Hello, I have importantant
information for Jane Doe, if you are that person, please press 1 now." (I 
replace the real name here with Jane Doe for privacy.)  I was and am not 
Jane Doe so I hung up.  The next night, I received around the same time
the same phone call - again I hang up.  This went on for five days.

Sure enough, on the sixth day, my synthetic friend calls me again.
Annoyed and a bit curious, I finally press 1. The voice then begins to
tell me that Jane Doe, of address [not mine], had a CaT scan that has
not been paid for.  It gave me the date, hospital, referring doctor,
and reason for the scan.

This amazed me for many reasons.  I knew some very private things about
a complete stranger, including a physical disorder she had (abeit
minor), merely because of an incorrect telephone in a database.  If the
automated bill service did not have her phone number and perhaps her
address correct, that could explain why she has not paid her bill.

Well, that was the last time I heard from my automated friend.  I assume that
the autocalling program noted that it delivered its message and it was done
with its responsibility.  What happened to Jane Doe, I do not know.
                                                                    -- Bryan.

Judge pulls the plug on Holliston man's calls, By Lisa LaBanca,
Middlesex News, Framingham, Mass., 1/10/92

NEWS STAFF WRITER
     HOLLISTON - A federal judge has hung up the Honda phone of Holliston
resident Daniel Gregory.  The American Honda Motor Co. has obtained a permanent
injunction in federal court that prohibits him from harassing the company.
     The injunction was granted in U.S. District Court in Boston this week,
according to Bob Butorac, a spokesman for the Torrance, Calif.-based carmaker.
Butorac said that the Burnap Road resident signed an agreement to not
telephone, send facsimile transmissions or otherwise harass the company. ``It
would appear that the issue is now closed,'' Butorac said.
     Gregory, 31, made national news when American Honda decided to go to court
to prevent him from calling or sending facsimile transmissions over the
company's telephone lines. The company said Gregory had made more than 100
phone calls in one day last fall and transmitted multi-page letters by fax over
four days.  American Honda blocked off all calls to its 800 numbers from the
508 area code in order to keep Gregory from tying up the lines.  ``His phone
calling inconvenienced other customers who were trying to call us,'' Butorac
said.
     Gregory, the owner of a 1990 Honda Civic CRX, said his car did not stop
properly in the rain.  Gregory said yesterday {Thursday} that he would abide by
the consent agreement until he disposes of the car. The agreement did not
require Gregory to admit that he had harassed the company.  ``In no way have I
given up my quest to solve the problem,'' Gregory said.  But he said the
experience was useful. ``It gave me some interesting insight: I've got to be a
lot more careful in not losing my cool,'' he said.  ``You can compromise your
opportunity to pursue a resolution if you lose your cool.''
     Gregory is thinking about initiating a suit of his own: He claims that an
American Honda executive contacted an area dealership and notified its
management that Gregory might call them.  The dealership later refused to
service his car, Gregory said. ``As far as I'm concerned, he prejudiced that
dealership against me.''

| This is it could not recognize the slight improvisation represented by grace
| notes as an improvement over the music displayed on the screen.  In my opinion,
| a good piano teacher would give Couric a higher score for the creativity
| implicit in grace notes.

That depends on whether the teacher had told her to play it as written or to
perform it.  Playing the instrument involves basic skills that must be
mastered; performing compositions involves *both* those skills and aesthetic
skills that have to be learned/acquired separately.  It makes a lot of sense
for a computer training system to grade students on their mastery of playing
skills.  At the present level of AI, it makes no sense at all for a computer
training system to make aesthetic judgements.

Think of it as more like a typing teacher than like a music teacher.

| More than this, the developers of "The Miracle" seem unaware of the fact that
| Playing The Music Exactly As Written (PTMEAW) is (in a global sense) not the
| usual practice.  Not only is folk music almost completely improvised, Indian
| classical music gains much of its richness from being IN PART improvised by
| master musicians every time it is performed.

Note the phrase "master musicians" in that last sentence.  You have to earn
your freedom (you're totally free to play whatever you like in your living room
and grade yourself, but if you want to submit yourself for public evaluation,
you'd better have the technical skills to support your improvisational
insight).

Back when I lived in a city, I went to a lot of piano recitals.  I would say
Vladimir Horowitz made more technical mistakes than almost anyone else I heard,
but was also the most riveting and persuasive of the lot.  My daughter, on the
other hand, though better technically and musically than most kids her age,
would probably profit a lot from a mechanical grading that would not let her
get away with sloppiness.

No, it won't make you a musician.  That requires insight and experience.  A
good human teacher will help the student acquire those.  But you'll never be
able to express your musicianship unless you acquire the mechanical skills that
something like the Miracle Keyboard *can* help you with.

Thanks to Phil Karn of the University of Chicago for correcting this post on a
matter of detail.  He reminded me that the improvisational section is a
"cadenza" rather than a "coda", and of course a "coda" is the section in the
concerto towards the end in which the soloist and the orchestra usually play
"tutti."  A rose by any other name and all that, and the fact remains that in a
world-music sense improvisation is the norm rather than the exception (being
vestigial in Western classical music through Mozart in the form of the CADENZA)
but my apologies to comp.risks for this slip.

   Fruit and flower smells [are] good for computer operators
   Moscow, 13 Jan 1992 (tass), by tass correspondent Lyubov Dunayeva

Overloads to computer operators, who have to spend hours before displays every
day, can be eased if the air in the room is saturated with the smells of fruit
and flowers, psychologists say.  Expert experiments [!] have shown that the
scent of lemon, jasmine or eucalyptus boosts productivity and alleviates
drowsiness.  The jasmine smell in a computer room reduces keyboard errors by
almost 30 per cent, and lemon aroma by almost 50 per cent, tass was told at a
surgery research center of the russian academy of sciences.

             [Jasmine is clearly more saLyubrious than JazzMax.  
             By the way, those of you who have read Nabakov's paean to
             programming* language, "Ada &lt;pronounced continentally&gt;, or Ardor",
             might have noticed, among the many outrageous multilinguini of
             puns and adagrams, the russoingleski "yellow-blue Vass"
             (Ya Lyublyu Vas)...  That is certainly Ada-ptive use of language!

                              * I have used "programming" gerundively here, 
                                not adjectivally.  At any rate, I am back
                                from a trip and evidently do not have enough
				good scents!  ...  PGN]

Something in this story doesn't add up. How could a "printer" infect a computer
with a "virus"?   [PRK]

U.S. Spies Planted Computer Virus in Iraqi Defense System
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. intelligence agents reportedly inserted a
computer virus into a network of Iraqi computers tied to that country's air
defense system several weeks before the start of the Persian Gulf War.  The
virus, U.S. News and World Report says in its issue dated next week, was
designed by the supersecret National Security Agency at Fort Meade, Md., and
was intended to disable a mainframe computer.  Citing two unidentified senior
U.S. officials, the magazine said the virus appeared to have worked, but it
gave no details. It said the operation may have been irrelevant because of the
allies' overwhelming air superiority.
	   The secret operation began when American intelligence agents
identified a French-made computer printer that was to be smuggled from Amman,
Jordan, to a military facility in Baghdad, the magazine said.  The agents in
Amman replaced a computer microchip in the printer with another microchip that
contained the virus in its electronic circuits. By attacking the Iraqi computer
through the printer, the virus was able to avoid detection by normal electronic
security measures, the report said.  ``Once the virus was in the system, the
U.S. officials explained, each time an Iraqi technician opened a `window' on
his computer screen to access information, the contents of the screen simply
vanished,'' U.S. News reported.
	   The report is part of a book, based on 12 months of research by U.S.
News reporters, called ``Triumph Without Victory: The Unreported History of the
Persian Gulf War,'' to be published next month.
	   In a series of adaptations from the book, U.S. News also reported
that two 5,000 pound bombs developed by the Air Force during the Gulf War,
called GBU-28s, were dropped on a command bunker on the second-to-last day of
the war with the explicit purpose of killing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
The fact that the bombs were dropped Feb. 27 has been reported previously, but
U.S. officials have repeatedly denied that Saddam was the intended target.
	   Gen. Ronald Yates, commander of Air Force Systems Command, told
reporters last year that the bombs were aimed at ``senior staff'' of the Iraqi
military.
	   U.S. News also said it had calculated, with the help of private
defense analysts in Washington, that as few as 8,000 Iraqi soldiers may have
been killed in the war. The U.S. government has made no official estimate of
Iraqi casualties, although the Defense Intelligence Agency has said the number
killed may range between 50,000 and 150,000.

News Report of Computer Virus Attack On Iraq Is Similar To Hoax Report
ROBERT BURNS, Associated Press Writer
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A newsmagazine report that U.S. intelligence
agents planted a disabling ``virus'' in an Iraqi military computer network
before the Gulf War is strikingly similar to an article published last year as
an April Fool's joke.  The main author of the U.S. News and World Report
article, Brian Duffy, said Monday, ``I have no doubt'' that U.S. intelligence
agents carried out such an operation, but he said the similarities with the
spoof article were ``obviously troubling.''  Duffy said the magazine was
rechecking the sources who told it of the operation to determine whether
details from the spoof article ``leeched into our report.''  [...]
	   The main elements of the U.S. News virus story are similar to an
article published in the April 1, 1991, edition of InfoWorld, a computer
industry publication based at San Mateo, Calif. The article was not explicitly
labeled as fiction but the last paragraph made clear that it was an April
Fool's joke.  [...]
	   The U.S. News report is part of a lengthy collection of stories that
it said would be published in February by Times Books-Random House as a book,
titled ``Triumph Without Victory: The Unreported History of the Persian Gulf
War.''
	   The Associated Press carried a report on the U.S. News story on
Saturday, as did some other media. Questions about the story arose Monday when
a number of readers called The AP to say the virus account was curiously like
the InfoWorld article.  That article said the virus was designed by the
National Security Agency for use against Iraq's air defense control system, and
that the CIA had inserted the virus into a printer being smuggled into Iraq
through Jordan before the war began.  ``Then the virus was on its own, and by
Jan. 8, the allies had confirmation that half the displays and printers in the
Iraqi air defense system were permanently out of commission,'' the InfoWorld
article said.
	   The U.S. News report also said the virus was developed by the
National Security Agency. It said that once the virus was in the Iraqi computer
network, ``each time an Iraqi technician opened a `window' on his computer
screen to access information, the contents of the screen simply vanished.''
	   The InfoWorld article also said the virus was designed to attack
``window'' technology in which an operator gains access to information in the
computer by use of an electronic pointing device rather than typing in
commands.
	   John Gantz, who wrote the InfoWorld article, said in a telephone
interview Monday that it was fictional and that he had no knowledge of any such
intelligence operation.
	   Duffy said he had not heard of the InfoWorld spoof. In response
to an inquiry by The Associated Press, he said a U.S. News reporter
in Tokyo got the ``initial tip'' on the computer virus story, which
the reporter then confirmed through ``a very senior official'' in
the U.S. Air Force.
	   Duffy said he personally confirmed the story through a senior
official in the Air Force and a senior intelligence official. He said he could
not reveal the three sources' names because they had spoken to U.S. News on
condition of anonymity.
	   Both the U.S. News and InfoWorld articles stressed that the reason
for placing the virus in the printer was to circumvent normal anti-tampering
systems in mainframe computers.
	   Some private computer experts said, however, that it seemed highly
unlikely that a virus could be transferred to a mainframe computer from a
printer.
	   ``A printer is a receiving device. Data does not transmit from the
printer to the computer,'' said Winn Schwartau, executive director of the
International Partnership Against Computer Terrorism.

&gt;We were configuring the ethernet card on our new 486 UNIX (SVR5) box ...

Please note that this does not mean UNIX systems are infectable by PC viruses,
rather computers that use PC BIOSes can be damaged (not infected) by a 
certain class of PC viruses known as Master Boot Sector Infectors of which 
the STONED is probably the best known example. 

This has been known by people who understand the architectures involved for 
some time. It does not mean that the STONED can infect a SPARC-station 
or HP/Apollo (it cannot).

What happened is that when the machine was booted with a DOS disk, the STONED
being unintelligent, found the fixed disk, assumed it was another DOS disk, 
copied itself to absolute sector 1 and the original sector 1 to sector 7.

At this point the question becomes one of whether this actually overwrote
any important data or, since the STONED changes the fixed disk access in a 
manner incompatible with UNIX, prevented the re-boot from acting properly
(in this case all that is needed for recovery is to copy sector 7 back to 
sector 1. In the first case it would be necessary to rebuild sector 7 also).

For some time I have been distributing as FREEWARE two technology 
demonstrators: SafeMBR and NoFBoot directed at stamping out this kind of 
problem in the DOS world by making it impossible for MBR infectors like 
STONED or its clones AZUSA, MICHELANGELO, NOINT, or EMPIRE to spread. Both 
are tiny and only one (NoFBoot) requires any RAM (c.a. 500 bytes). They 
would not have prevented the damage caused to the Unix system by booting 
from an infected DOS disk. They would have prevented the machine "across 
the hall" from infecting the disk in the first place.

Ohio justices probed over alleged fight (Chicago Tribune, 8 November 1991)

COLUMBUS, Ohio - An investigation is under way into allegations that an Ohio
Supreme Court justice angrily wrestled a fellow justice to the floor over
complaints about computer file snooping, state police said Thirsday.  Associate
Justices Craig Wright and Andrew Douglas scuffled in front of fellow Justice
Alice Robie Resnick until two of her clerks separated the pair.  The witnesses
said that Douglas confronted Wright over comments he reportedly had made about
Douglas' secretary, Sue Pohlman.  Wright said Wednesday that he and Douglas had
a "little disagreement."  He would not comment further Thursday.  Douglas said
he has been told that the State Highway Patrol is investigating.

  I clipped this a while ago but didn't send it in, hoping that an Ohio
correspondent would report with more details than this digested wire service
bulletin offered.  It is not clear who was alleged to have been doing the
snooping in the others computer files.  Nor is it clear whether the scuffle was
over what was recorded in those alleged files or over the alleged snooping.

  The question for RISKS is, as it often is, whether the incident would have
happened without a computer.  Would the offending notes have been made and
retained?  Would the other party have snooped?  Would the parties gotten so
excited?

I have not confirmed this personally.  I heard it from an AT&amp;T VAR.  He claims
that no AT&amp;T PCs can have their system dates set to 1992 via the DOS DATE
command.  Something about some prom code only accepting an 8 year range which
ended in 1991.  Further, he claims that the patch, now shipping, only provides
for an additional 8 years!

NOTE: Last graf. JQ [1.800.544.5410 (2806 at tone)]

    SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) _ Curtis Ratliff hit the jackpot when he stuck a stolen
credit card into an automatic teller machine four months ago, and it spit out
$5,600.  But Ratliff's luck ran out in court Thursday when he pleaded guilty to
third-degree grand larceny, the Syracuse Post-Standard reported.
    In September, Ratliff stole a woman's purse from her car. The woman had
left her personal identification number for the ATM in the purse along with the
card.  Ratliff inserted the stolen card into a grocery store ATM, which started
ejecting $20 bills, much to Ratliff's surprise.  Twenty minutes later, Ratliff
had stuffed $5,600 into his pockets.  ``He became blinded to the reality of
what he was doing, and the money just kept coming,'' Ratliff's lawyer, James
Hopkins, told the Post-Standard.
    Ratliff made similar thefts at several other Price Chopper grocery store
ATMs, stealing a total of $63,900.  Ratliff, 36, of Kirkville, was sentenced
Thursday to five years' probation for the theft.  ``I'm sorry for what I did,''
Ratliff told County Judge Patrick J. Cunningham. ``It won't happen again.''
    Ratliff, who was suspended from his job as an equipment salesman after his
arrest, has repaid all but $1,800 of the money he stole, Hopkins said.
    ATMs, which hold up to $20,000, usually limit withdrawals on a single card
to several hundred dollars in a 24-hour period, industry experts said.  The
Price Chopper machines were apparently incorrectly programmed.

This from the February 92 Atlantic Monthly column, Word Watch by Anne H.
Soukhanov...

  shoulder surfing -- noun, slang, the theft of computer passwords or access
  codes, such as long distance telephone access codes, by reading the numbers
  over the shoulders of authorized users: "How do outsiders discover a
  company's codes? by '*shoulder surfing*,' 'dumpster diving', and stealing
  calling cards" (Investor's Business Daily).

  BACKGROUND: *Shoulder surfers* operating in the telephone marketplace are
  typically found in airports, train stations, and other crowded areas.  In
  some instances they position themselves on balconies above phone booths and
  use binoculars to read callers' access numbers, which they later sell for
  $5-$10 each.  Such fraud now costs long-distance companies some $1.5 billion
  a year -- triple the damages incurred in 1985.

       [Such fraud?  Well, NOT JUST shoulder surfing alone...   PGN]

LATEST CRASH HEIGHTENS CONTROVERSY OVER AIRBUS A320
By Michela Wrong (REUTERS 21 Jan 1992)
 
   PARIS, Jan 21, Reuters - The Airbus A320, a model of which crashed in France
on Monday night killing 87 people, has been dogged by controversy since before
its 1987 launch, with critics arguing that its computerised controls are too
sophisticated.  A French Air Inter A320 on a domestic flight ploughed into a
mountainside in snow and fog shortly before it had been due to land at
Strasbourg, giving no distress signal.  Only nine of the 96 people on board
survived.  The narrow-bodied 150-seater became the world's fastest selling
plane even before its 1987 maiden flight, notching up over 200 orders.  It is
central to Europe's challenge to U.S. planemakers for dominance of the world
civil aviation market.
   But Airbus Industrie, a consortium of French, German, British and Spanish
firms, has fought to win acceptance for the advanced avionics first put to
civilian use in the A320.  "Each time (one crashes) the crew is blamed whereas
the responsibility is really shared in the hiatus between man and machine,"
said Romain Kroes, secretary-general of the SPAC civil aviation pilots' union.
   In a technique previously used only in combat aircraft, commands are sent
electronically rather than hydraulically.
   Pilots say the system restricts what they can do in a crisis by setting
built-in limits on the plane's movements.  They objected to a cut in the number
of cabin crew on the A320 from three to two.
   Airbus insists that "fly-by-wire" is safer in an emergency, allowing pilots
to know how far they can push the plane without causing a disaster.
   Kroes said the latest crash, which followed accidents in France and India,
proved that pilots' fears were well-founded.  "There are numerous faults in the
way man-machine communication and the cockpit have been designed on the A320...
since the Habsheim and Bangalore crashes it has been clear to us that the crews
were caught out by cockpit layout," he said in a radio interview.
   In June 1988, one of the first models sold to Air France crashed during a
demonstration flight in eastern France.  The plane cruised into a thicket of
trees, killing three aboard.
   A commission of inquiry accused pilot Michel Asseline of "cowboy-like
behaviour" for flying too low and concluded that there was nothing wrong with
the aircraft.  But Asseline, who survived, insisted that the plane's equipment
had failed to alert him to the loss of altitude.
   A report commissioned by the victims' families found that standard
procedures with flight recorders following a crash had been flouted.  The main
French pilots' union, SNPL, was convicted of libel for accusing the authorities
of tampering with the recorders to absolve the plane and protect Airbus sales.
   The controversy resurfaced in February 1990 when an Indian Airlines plane
crashed at Bangalore Airport, killing 90.  Indian authorities grounded all
Airbuses after the Indian Commercial Pilots Association blamed a systems
problem.
   But a judicial inquiry concluded that the pilots were to blame for putting
the engines on the wrong setting, which made the plane fly too slowly.
   Airbus, which sent four experts to the scene of Monday's crash, declined to
speculate on the cause, saying it would await the results of an official
inquiry.
   But company sources said there was no reason to think that fly-by-wire had
played a role.  Bad weather and the mountainous terrain were more likely
factors, they said.
   Created in 1970 as a European challenge to U.S. giants Boeing Co. and
McDonnell Douglas Corp., Airbus has received a total of 661 orders for the
A320, with 251 already delivered.  The consortium of British Aerospace PLC,
France's Aerospatiale, the Deutsche Airbus subsidiary of Germany's Daimler-Benz
AG and Spain's CASA has 26 per cent of the world market.
   The fly-by-wire technology used in the A320 is due to be adopted in a new
four-engine A340 wide-body Airbus, which is being flight tested, and may also
be used in a 600-seater that is in the planning stage.

     [The 22 Jan 1992 San Fran Chron, p.A7, notes Agence France-Presse,
     citing informed sources, said that the aircraft made an abrupt 2,000-foot
     drop on its approach to the Strasbourg-Entzheim airport.  PGN]

	"How could a "printer" infect a computer with a "virus"?"

One technically straightforward approach would be to plant the agent in a
printer that will be connected directly to a network.  For example, Macintosh
printers are typically connected to an Appletalk network, where they enjoy full
peer privileges.  There is nothing to prevent such a printer from snooping
around the network attempting to find and compromise other servers.

[My employer, a printer manufacturer, doesn't do this sort of thing.]

   "and so the brave little printers destroyed all of the Evil Empire's
computers and they lived happily ever after." - Some of the items seen in the
last year bear a remarkable resemblance to the works of Hans Christian Anderson
but then it just goes to prove P. T. Barnum's axiom.

     The simple fact is that the public will believe anything the public wants
to believe, particularly when it deals with "magic".  As a result we have
printer viruses, modem viruses, CMOS viruses, and on, and on, ad nauseum.
(Actually I like Aryeh Groetsky's story of a virus that infects floppy disk
drives and toasters that causes both to eject their contents at lethal
velocities).

     This is not to say that there hasn't been a printer virus (actually a
trojan - it scrambled the password in Postscript printers rendering them
inaccessible), rather that information does not flow both ways (not that it
can't, both zero slot LANs such as Lantastic-Z (R I'm sure) and a nifty program
by Diacom (plug) that comes with a cable to connect my car's computer to a
laptop and lets me find out what is going on inside utilize bidirectional
communications through the parallel port) without help from a program inside
the computer (I am told that Dan Jenkins, one of my favorite authors, dislikes
parenthetical statements immensely).

     This was the underlying problem with that Army RFP about radio transmitted
viruses (understand that there were two grants made for phase one @ $50k each):
Building a virus is easy (too easy), transmitting the virus via radio is easy,
the hard part is getting the other guy's computer to retrieve &amp; execute it.  Of
course, if you can design the listener into the other guy's computer, you've
got it made - see the French Novel "SoftWars" (not the current paperback of the
same name, this one was earlier) for a description of one method. As I recall,
the basis was a weather computer tied to Soviet defense systems and the program
was designed so that if St.  Kitts reported some impossible temperature...

     Of course, the problem is that to understand what can and what cannot be
done you must understand the architecture and that actually takes some research
on the subject (shudder) - something abhorrent to the public and, while not
unusual for a journalist, is really not what most get paid for (no-one is more
ignorant than an expert speaking out of their field). Besides phone calls are
more fun.

     So what happens ? - a rumor starts, often innocently - like the April
Fool's "InfoWorld" parody (incidentally one of the three best weekly PC
magazines). However, for a parody to work it has to be just a bit off center,
something obvious to experts but close enough to reality to be possible,
especially when quoted out of context. In fact, as I recall, there were two
similar stories at that time with the other in PC-Week).

     So the rumor starts and the first thing that happens is journalists start
calling up "experts" and asking "could this happen ?"  with the predictable
responses: "Uhhh", "If the SendMail buffer overflowed into the command
queue...", "If the muffler bearings spun the transmission backwards..."  and
other techno-babble. Point is, it takes a lot of confidence to stand up and say
"It can't happen." - besides, the journalist will then call up someone else who
will say "It could" &amp; guess which gets printed tomorrow ?

     And so the headline comes out: "Army infects Iraqi computers with virus
shipped in printers from Jordan". One comment made by a neighbor (remember, my
house is only a half mile from Universal Studios) during televised coverage of
the Gulf War sticks in my mind: "Universal could have done it better" &amp; the
"printer virus" is a natural. - You will, Oscar, you will.

Several CPAs in town are not using the electronic filing offered by the I.R.S.
Why?  Because the I.R.S. initiates the phone call to the CPA's office to
retrieve the form.  This means that the I.R.S. would be accessing computers
remotely.  Tax preparers are worried that the I.R.S. could get more than a
person's tax information by accessing all of the data on the computer.

The solution that some tax preparer's are using is to have a separate,
dedicated computer for filing electronically.  They put only the tax forms onto
this computer.  This is an easy solution since they could probably get by with
just a floppy drive.

Another threat is that someone else could call the tax preparers computer and
get the information.

	The posting made in <A HREF="/Risks/13.04.html">RISKS-13.04</A> concerning AT&amp;T machines seems to have
been a little over-inflated and wrongly put by the writer.  If he had indeed
spoken to the VAR he would have been told that the date problem existed SOLELY
on AT&amp;T 6300 models - these were made around 83 and have 8088 CPUs.  The
company did not expect these machines - in their current configuration to last
as long as they have (one point for us).  It is a simple matter to upgrade the
bios or use the date patch [Let us note that this warning is made clear to
users if they ever read manuals].
	I thought this list existed for the purpose of discussing risks, not
for editing of the truth to make a story YOUR OWN...

In <A HREF="/Risks/13.04.html">RISKS-13.04</A> Thomson Kuhn notes that AT&amp;T PCs cannot set the date to 1992.
The reader may be referring to and old, and well known "feature" of the XT
class AT&amp;T 6300.  This MS-DOS machine, based on the Intel 8086, had a clock
chip which ran out of gas at the end of 1990.  Many PC user groups have since
circulated several software patches to this problem which effectively add five
years to the clock chip date.  These programs typically are loaded in the
config.sys file and the user may merrily compute with the '6300 until the
device falls apart from age.

The application to RISKS is that users, especially small businesses and home
users, do not care about double declining depreciation schedules nor the
technology refreshment rate of Intel-based personal computing.  Once they've
bought a machine this class of users has every intention of running it into the
ground until it is no longer functioning, or, passing it on to their children.
The manufacturer of the AT&amp;T 6300, which as the Italian firm Oliveti, built the
'6300 like a tank and mine, built in early 1986, is still surviving the
assaults of four teenagers and one freelance writer.  The only thing it objects
to is temperatures below 65 F.  Obviously, the engineers who designed the
system thought any user worth his salt would give the '6300 the old heave ho
within five years and so limited the clock chip accordingly.

[Disclaimer: I'm not trying to sell anything (in fact, none of the stuff I
mention can be bought anyway), I just had a fascinating experience I'd like to
share with you.]

I had been toying around with vtalk (an Ethernet-telephone for
SPARC-stations from Oki Elektric Industry, Co.) and tried to add some bells
and whistles to it.

Now, in the line of my studies came the exhortation "Be formal!". I have been a
bit dubious of formal methods, they have seemed as a lot of sweat for obvious
results.  But anyway, I thought it could be nice to at least draw a little
automaton so that I could have a pretty picture of all signals going back and
forth between the processes of the parties.

I had Anneli Avatare, a coworker from SICS, over and we both worked for perhaps
an hour drawing up an automaton on the wyteboard and trying to account for all
signals. This wasn't a very large design, so after having both gone over it we
were satisfied that it seemed sound.

Now Anneli suggested that we test the design in the Graphical Concurrency
Workbench, GCW, on which she had worked.  I had used the Concurrency Workbench
before and disliked it, but the GCW was a new acquaintance.  I got in to SICS
the next morning, where Anneli had already drawn most of the automaton.

A little background is in order: CWB, the Concurrency Workbench is a tool
developed by the Swedish Institute of Computer Science and the University of
Edinburgh which allows the user to enter definitions of concurrent
communicating processes and validate them, check for deadlocks, minimise the
state space and so on.

As the name suggests, GCW is a graphical front-end to CWB and is implemented as
an application on top of LOGGIE, a meta-tool for generating language-oriented
graphical editors.

We finished up the automaton and toyed around a bit, fascinated by the
(relative) ease with which we could neaten up the graph, redoing nodes and
signals.

Then we got to testing the design.  We created a pair of the automata and
connected them to each other as the two parties.

We could then simulate the design by "sending signals" to the processes and see
how little pucks moved from one state to another.  To our surprise we soon
managed to run the processes into a deadlock.  We stared at the trace and
realised we had forgotten to handle the reply signal from a sequence of
hangings up and callings up.  It was obvious what the fix was, and we could
just add the missing vertex to the graph.

Now we tried automatic deadlock finding and watched as GCW ran through the
state space moving the pucks along and found two more potential deadlock
situations, both in which the fix was as trivial as in the first case.

Now, the moral of this story is perhaps not so much How Formal Methods Carried
The Day And Saved My Program, but something more on the psychological side: I
had been exposed to formal methods all through my professional education, but I
had never realised the point of them and generally regarded them as a nuisance.
Now, suddenly there was a way for me to work out the definition of a process
*interactively*, easily amending any problems in the process, the graphic
display giving me a clear picture of *why* my ideas were faulty, showing me
*how* I got in the mess I was in and suggesting ways to get out of there.
Perhaps the moral can be stated as: When Formal Methods Are Fun And Simplify
Your Work, Then You Will Also Want To Use Them.

While purchasing some pre-recorded cassette tapes for my mother for Christmas,
the clerk placed all 15 of them down on one of those pads that have a big sign
reading "Don't place credit cards or ATM cards on or near this device!"

I asked "if this thing can cause damage to the magnetic info on cards, is it
safe for other things magnetically encoded to be placed on it?"  After
conferring with another clerk (while the tapes continued to sit on the pad),
the first clerk said it is better to be safe than sorry and started to move
them.

Upon hearing this short discussion, a third, more pompous clerk came over and
said that these pre-recorded tapes can't be damaged by this device.  She went
on to say "there is this little plastic tab" on the back edge of the cassette,
which, when punched out, "prevents *any* inadvertent erasure or recording!"

I did not know where to begin....  But clearly an example of a little knowledge
can be dangerous.

A mildly amusing incident happened during the opening talk by O J Dahl today at
a workshop on Software Construction here at Schloss Dagstuhl in Germany. He
started his talk and a few minutes in, whilst fumbling with his foils, he
suddenly realised that they had all been printed the wrong way round on the
attached paper side rather than the transparency side. Always check your
computer-generated slides before your talk! The replacement talk used good old

want to do with a call that is placed to my number?

My intention in finding out that poor Mr. Doe had a credit problem was simply
to find the number of the company that originated that message and inform them
of the error in their database, which I did do.  The woman with whom I spoke
about the problem was very sympathetic to my concerns of receiving unwarranted
phone calls and assured me that their database would be corrected.  It must
have been fixed as I have not received any more calls from them since.

The bottom line: I *HATE* these computer generated phone calls.  If someone is
calling with personal information, it had better be a person so that such
errors can be detected (and apologized for) before the personal information is
given out to someone it shouldn't be.  At least, to the benefit of this
company, they did give me a contact number.  I have, in the past, received such
calls telling me that I (no name given in that message) was in trouble with
company X and I should send in payment immediately.  They didn't leave a number
to discuss it with a human.

Sigh...are we starting to rely on computers a bit much?

Snooping is not new.  What is, perhaps, new, is naivete about the accessibility
of information.  Back in the old days of Multics, security was viewed as a key
system facility.  This wasn't just because of ARPA funding, but also because
the computer utility had to embody social conventions beyond those needed in a
calculator.  The default access to a user's information was no access.  This
was in keeping with the convention that one doesn't paw through another's desk.
While one can argue that locking desks is not the norm, the ability to
surreptitiously browse from another terminal requires something beyond simple
trust.

Unfortunately, many newer systems in a misguided attempt to be friendly 
either ignore access control entirely or default the systems to give the 
world, or at least, colleagues read access.

The moderator and other readers can provide more details of the evolution of 
these conventions.  And I'm sure newspaper staffers can tell about the 
entertainment of reading others' drafts.

Wed, 22 Jan 92 16:48:30 GMT
</i><PRE>

At around 1945 local time (1845 GMT) on Monday 20th January, Air Inter flight 
IT5148 from Lyon to Strasbourg vanished from radar and radio contact. (In some 
reports the time is given as 1920 local time.) Five hours later, rescue teams 
arrived at the crash site on Mont Sainte-Odile (2496 feet) in the Vosges, about 
30 miles south of Strasbourg. The aircraft was around 75 minutes into its 
flight, and about 7 minutes flying time from Strasbourg airport. 

Of 90 passengers and 6 crew, 87 died, 9 survived. All of the survivors were 
in the rear section of the aircraft. Ten casualties were reported to have 
survived the impact, but frozen to death while awaiting rescue. The temperature 
on the ground was around -10 degrees C, there was thick fog, or cloud 
clinging to the mountains, and deep snow. The nearby village of Barr was used 
as a clearing station for the casualties. 

No emergency message was received from the cockpit before impact. Survivors 
report that there was no prior warning, and that nothing seemed to be wrong 
until the impact occurred. 

The emergency beacon which should have guided rescuers did not operate. 
According to one report, it was destroyed by the crash. 

At that point on that approach to Strasbourg, the recommended height is 9000 
feet, and the minimum height for a safe approach is around 4700 feet. On 
impact, the aircraft was below 2500 feet. Strasbourg airport is equipped 
with a directional beam for use by aircraft instrument landing systems (ILS). 
For some reason, IT5148 was not following the beam. Just before impact, the 
aircraft was descending at 2300 ft/min, instead of 800 ft/min (DGAC spokesman).

The flight data recorders, i.e., Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Digital 
Flight Data Recorder (DFDR), had been found by Tuesday night, but (according 
to one report) are damaged. They have been taken to Paris for examination. 
According to one report, they were accompanied all the way by the local 
examining magistrate in person. 

A Commission of Enquiry has been appointed, and an interim report is expected 
within a month. 

The pilot, Christian Hecquet, and his co-pilot had 14000 flying hours between 
them, but had only recently switched to the A320 from flying Caravelles. The 
aircraft which crashed went into service in 1988, and had a maintenance check 
on Monday morning. 

This information has been extracted from various reports in The Guardian, 
The Times, The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail, 21st and 22nd Jan. 

      **** Above are the facts, below is the speculation. **** 

The crash bears a certain resemblance to the previous two A320 accidents, at 
Mulhouse in 1988, and Bangalore in 1990. In all three accidents, the pilots 
seemed to think that the aircraft was higher than in fact it was. 

According to the DGAC spokesman, four possible causes are being investigated:-

- "altitude computer" (FMGC? - see below) failure,
- engine cut-out caused by bad weather, 
- ice build-up on the wings,
- human error (in the cockpit, maintenance or ATC)

The latest crash is a serious embarrassment for Airbus Industrie, and already 
mutterings of "pilot error" are being heard. This is most obvious in 
The Times of 22nd Jan. The front page headline is:-

"Experts suspect pilot error. Crash Airbus `programmed to fly too low' "

The article (by Harvey Elliott, Air Correspondent, and our foreign staff) 
begins: 

"The pilots of an Airbus jet that crashed into a French mountain killing 87 
 people probably programmed the aircraft to fly too low. 

 As a five-man commission began its enquiry into Monday night's accident, 
 safety experts tried to recreate on simulators the last minutes of the Air 
 Inter flight from Lyons to Strasbourg. Their efforts suggest that the A320's 
 "fly-by-wire" technology was not to blame." 

Later in the same article:- 

"Computers are capable of operating all flight controls on the Airbus, other 
 than altitude, but David Velupillai of the manufacturer, Airbus Industrie, 
 said: "If you program it to fly into a mountain, it will." The aircraft will 
 prevent the pilot making a manoeuvre outside of its built-in "safety 
 envelope", but it cannot tell the pilot that he is heading for a mountain 
 until a few seconds before impact, when lights and buzzers alert him that he 
 is close to the ground. 

 The Air Inter jet should have been at about 9,000 ft as it approached 
 Strasbourg airport. The minimum altitude for any aircraft in that area is 
 4,700 ft, but the Airbus crashed into the mountainside at no more than 2,500 
 ft. Experts working on simulators yesterday believe that the pilot may have 
 thought he was nearer the runway than he was, and pushed the "open descent" 
 button that would take the aircraft to a pre-programmed altitude. Otherwise, 
 he might have forgotten about the peaks and programmed a "normal descent" 
 putting him on a crash course." 

On page 9 of The Times, 22nd Jan., the headline reads:-

"Computer error by pilots suspected" by Harvey Elliott, Air Correspondent.

and the article goes as follows:- 

"A fatal programming error by the pilots of the Airbus A320 jet which smashed 
 into a French mountainside was emerging last night as the most likely cause of 
 the the crash which killed all but nine of those on board. 

 Safety experts, anxious to discover if anything had gone horribly wrong with 
 one of the world's most advanced passenger aircraft, took over simulators from 
 Airbus customers around the world to try to recreate the last minutes of the 
 flight IT5148 as it approached Strasbourg airport. Slowly, although with no 
 real proof that their theories were right, they began to build up a picture of 
 confusion in the cockpit. 

[Stuff about minimum altitudes omitted.] 

 Height is the one parameter not controlled by computer in the Airbus. It is up 
 to the pilots to tell the aircraft's five computers what height they want to 
 fly at by dialling in a particular altitude. 

 The track the aircraft flies can be programmed in before take-off and the 
 computers then automatically follow it." 


My own initial reaction to this is:-

1. The extension of the concept of "pilot error" to "pilot computer error" is 
   interesting. (Not only can those dumbos not fly a 'plane, they can't even 
   program a computer! :-)

2. Height is not a "parameter" which can be controlled directly, in the same 
   way that pitch, roll, yaw and thrust are governed by the Electronic Flight 
   Control System (EFCS) and the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). 
   The "five computers" referred to in the Times article above are presumably 
   the three Spoiler and Elevator Computers (SEC) and two Elevator and Aileron 
   Computers (ELAC) which together make up the EFCS. The pilots do not "tell" 
   these computers anything about altitude. The Flight Management and Guidance 
   Computer (FMGC) performs the autopilot function, and interfaces with the 
   EFCS to cause the aircraft to follow a pre-programmed course. The FMGC *can* 
   control altitude, by manipulating the EFCS. In some circumstances, the FMGC 
   can select "open descent" mode automatically, or, on approach to an airport, 
   the pilot can select it manually. 

3. Unless we assume that two experienced pilots simply forgot that there are 
   a few mountains in the way on the Strasbourg run, they would only have 
   selected a descent mode prematurely if they did not know where they were. 
   If they didn't, why not? 

4. The aircraft did not "smash into a mountainside". It crashed into trees in 
   an area where there is a fair amount of reasonably level terrain, as shown 
   by the fact that the rear section was slowed down by the tail catching in 
   trees. Close to impact, the altitude alarm should have started to give 
   audible warnings at 200 ft. 

Not everyone is so keen to accept the "pilot error" theory. One source was 
quoted as saying that, in an aircraft like the A320, pilot error lies in the 
"hiatus between the pilot and the computer" (lovely phrase!). 

In the Times article, we read:-

"Jean-Paul Maurel, general secretary of the French pilots' union, said the 
 aircraft had been on a normal approach path, well above the Vosges peaks when 
 it suddenly plunged and hit the ground in less than a minute." 

After 4 years in service, and 600,000 flying hours, the A320 has scored 3 
major accidents and 177 lives lost. In 11 years, the Boeing 757 has flown 
4 million hours with no fatalities. 

As the headline to the Daily Mail feature article which quoted these statistics 
asks: "Is this aircraft too clever for its own good?"

In Risks 13.05 Romain Kroes, Secretary General of SPAC is quoted as saying "...
it has been clear to us that the crews were caught out by cockpit layout"

     Surely this statement implies that there is a problem with training
rather than the software or the crew.

PGN notes an article in the San Fran Chron saying there was an abrupt drop in
altitude of 2000 feet in approaching the airfield.

     Since the previous two crashes of this type of aircraft seemed to be
related to the altimeter it would imply that a specialised set of conditions
that arises very infrequently could cause incorrect altimeter readings that
indicate to the pilot that he is too high. Since both flight recorders are
reported damaged we probably won't find out on this one though....

Before we speculate over the cause of the crash we ought to bear in mind that
there are vested interests in the A320. Airbus Industrie is knocking spots of
Boeing and MD in sales. The US FAA can easily take the side of US
manufacturers, using "software safety" as an excuse.  Similarly, the French
Government, which will investigate the accident, owns a share in Airbus
Industrie (via Aerospatiale), and has a motive to find the accident was caused
by "pilot error". There is nationalism bound up in this: Europeans are proud of
the achievements of `home grown' industry, Americans are proud of their home
aircraft industry.  The news reports want a sensational accident to report -
"Computer kills 80" instead of "Man bites Dog".  Safety Critical Software
researchers want to get on TV telling the world how bad computers are and
"incidentally, funding of research in safety is far too low..." We should also
bear in mind that the pilots' unions are concerned over the manning of modern
aircraft: the 747-400 `loses' an engineer. Pilots are also concerned over the
`loss of things to do'.

We should also be aware that the A320 is far from unique in having computer
control. Many many commercial aircraft have computers controlling some or all
aircraft subsystems. I spent a long time a couple of years ago going through
microfilm of The Times checking up on aircraft accidents. Way before the
Habsheim crash I found that an DC-9 aircraft crashed from a slat/flap computer
being incorrectly operated, deemed Pilot Error (August 17th 1987). The 747-400
manifested a very serious auto-throttle bug, causing loss of engine power (See
RISKS 10.04).

Now, there is the very serious problem of HCI in these aircraft - the "glass
cockpit" problem. The Bangalore crash (See RISKS 10.48) was blamed on pilot
error, but it could be argued that the pilots were lulled into a false sense of
security by the autopilot. It could also be argued that the training of pilots
when flying in "glass cockpits" is inadequate. However, the A320 is not unique
in having these problems.

Before any hysteria breaks out over computer control in aircraft (e.g.  the FAA
revoking the A320 license, the European aviation authorities responding by
banning the 747-400, etc), we must consider what things were like before
computers. In RISKS 12.72 and 13.01 the problem of the A320 Fuel Monitoring
system was discussed. In olden days the re-fuelling of aircraft was a real
problem. Different airports have different fuel densities, qualities, etc.
Certain aircraft can only run on certain grade fuel, and whenever refuelling
the technicians must know how much fuel is left and what grade it is, how the
new fuel will mix with the old, and how much the new fuel will weigh
(obviously, the fuel tanks have a volume capacity, whereas different density
fuels will weigh different amounts) - there is an (apocryphal) story of a jet
being trapped at an African airport because the fuel quality was too low. The
density of fuel will change the way the aircraft is trimmed, and will change
the range of the aircraft. Do RISKS readers seriously believe that ground crews
with clipboards and pocket calculators made less mistakes than the A320 fuel
control system?

I should point out that I am a European, and that my research (into Distributed
Hard Real Time Systems) is being funded by a member of the Airbus consortium,
and that my opinions are mine and no-one else's. You are free to ask whether I
too have a vested interest in computer control of commercial aircraft.

Finally, I would like to quote an `expert' on aviation who in a recent TV
interview said that "the common theme to all three of the A320 crashes is 
lack of altitude".

The recent spate of reports of a virus which shut down Iraq's air defence
system during "Desert Shield/Storm" seems to have started with the series
"Triumph Without Victory: The Unreported History of the Persian Gulf War" by U.
S. News and World Report.  The articles are being rerun in many papers (as
well, apparently, as CNN and ABC Nightline), and the article on the virus run
in my local paper is specifically credited to USN&amp;WR.  The bare bones of the
article are that a French printer was to be smuggled into Iraq through Jordan,
that US agents intercepted the printer, replaced a microchip in the printer
with one reprogrammed by the NSA, that a virus on the reprogrammed chip invaded
the air defence network to which the printer was connected and erased
information on display screens when "windows" were opened for additional
information on aircraft.

The first question is: could a chip in a printer send a virus?  Doesn't a
printer just accept data?

Both parallel/Centronics and serial RS-232 ports are bidirectional.  (Cabling
is not always, and I well remember having to deal, in the early days of PCs,
with serial ports which had been used as printer ports, and could not be used
as modem ports because the "return" pin had been sheared off, a common practice
to "fix" balky printers.)  However, the "information" which comes back over the
line is concerned strictly with whether or not the printer is ready to accept
more data.  It is never accepted as a program by the "host".

The case of "network" printers, is somewhat more complex.  There are two
possible cases: network printer servers and "network printers (such as
the Mac Laserwriters): and they are quite distinct.  The print server
(on, say, DECnet) is actually a networked computer acting as a print
server; accepting files from other network sources and spooling them to
a printer. True, this computer/printer combo is often referred to simply
as a printer,  but it would not, in any case, be able to submit programs
to other hosts on  the net.  The Mac case is substantially different,
since the Mac laser printers are attached as "peers".  Mac Laserwriters,
at least, do have the ability to submit programs to other computers on
the network, and one Mac virus uses the Laserwriter as a vector. 
However, it is unlikely that the Iraqi air defence system was Mac based,
and few other systems see printers as peers.

Second question: if it *was* possible to send some kind of program from the
printer to the computer system/network, was it a virus?

Given the scenario, of a new printer coming into an existing system, any
damaging program would pretty much have had to have been a virus.  In a
situation like that, the first thing to do when the system malfunctions after a
new piece of equipment has been added is to take out the new part.  Unless the
"chip" could send out a program which could survive, in the network or system,
by itself, the removal of the printer would solve the problem.

Third question:  could a virus, installed on a chip, and entered into
the air defence computer system, have done what it was credited with?

Coming from the popular press, "chip" could mean pretty much anything, so my
initial reaction that the program couldn't be large enough to do much damage
means little.  However, the programming task involved would be substantial.
The program would first have to run on the printer/server/peripheral, in order
to get itself transferred to the host.  The article mentions that a peripheral
was used in order to circumvent normal security measures, but all systems have
internal security measures as well in order to prevent a printer from "bringing
down" the net.  The program would have to be able to run/compile or be
interpreted on the host, and would thus have to know what the host was, and how
it was configured.  The program would then have to know exactly what the air
defence software was, and how it was set up to display the information.  It
would also have to be sophisticated enough in avoiding detection that it could
masquerade as a "bug" in the software, and persistent enough that it could
avoid elimination by the reloading of software which would immediately take
place in such a situation.

The Infoworld AF/91 prank article has been mentioned as the "source" for the
USN&amp;WR virus article.  There was, however, another article, quite seriously
presented in a French military aerospace magazine in February (which possibly
prompted the Infoworld joke.)  This earlier article stated that a virus had
been developed which would prevent Exocet missiles, which the French had sold
to Iraq, from impacting on French ships in the area.  The author used a mix of
technobabble and unrelated facts, somehow inferring from the downloading of
weather data at the last minute before launch, the programmability of targets
on certain missiles and the radio destruct sequences used in testing that such
a "virus" was possible.

It has also been rumoured, and by sources who should know, that the US military
has sent out an RFP on the use of computer viri as computer weapons.  Although
I have not seen the request, I *do* believe it went out, and we have
confirmation in the report of a contract being awarded for further study in
that area.  I *don't* believe in the USN&amp;WR report.

On the topic of how it would (obviously) be much easier to get your adversary's
system to accept erroneous commands if you had "designed-in" such abilities,
the film-conscious reader might wish to check out the science-fiction film
"Gog" (1954).

In this actually above-average presentation, a top-secret U.S.  space
research/defense facility is plagued by a series of inexplicable "accidents".
These include deaths due to runaway centrifuges, malfunctions of a giant solar
mirror (ZAP!), and attacks by two utility robots ("Gog" and "Magog") which
almost destroy the facility, among other major problems.

It is eventually determined that the various incidents have all been triggered
by enemy forces, via a very stealthy high-altitude jet, sending signals to
special receivers which were embedded within the facility's central computer by
enemy agents during the computer's construction in Germany.

So keep your eyes on those printers!

_The__New_York_Times_ led its January 19, 1992, Business section with "David
Gelernter's Romance with Linda", an article which discussed the massive amounts
of free computing cycles available at any given moment.  The thrust of the
article was that these cycles could be harnessed to speed up compute intensive
jobs, a general concept with which computer scientists have been working for
years.  Early on, however, it was alluded that sights are set on going after
not only machines arranged to do the work by groups of co-operating
researchers, but indeed after any machine it can access.

Several columns in it was said without even the blink of an eye:

  Mr. Gelernter visualizes all these computer networks linked together
  --- along with all the desktop computers that are not now linked to
  anything.  When that happens, his piece de resistance will go to
  work:  a software program that constantly goes from computer to
  computer seeking out idle computer power and putting it to work.

I was a bit amazed at how directly this was offered, suggesting mostly
that the only hurdles to overcome were technical ones.  This even
after they had already discussed the great secrecy with which some
Wall Street firms are using the technology.  At least several
paragraphs later they got to "At Issue: Free Choice":

  What is to keep Pirhana Linda or its descendants from being
  subverted by someone who wants to tamper with another computer or
  steal information?  And what if an individual doesn't want to share
  a computer?  Indeed, a generation of computer users embraced desktop
  technology in the 1980's precisely because they were suddenly freed
  from sharing a single mainframe computer with hundreds or thousands
  of others. [...]

  Privacy experts say the issue is a broader one:  being able to chose
  whether to participate at all.

  "The critical test for any technology is whether it leaves you the
  ability to retreat into a private sphere," said Mark Rotenberg,
  Washington director for the Computer Professionals for Social
  Responsibility.  "If you can't turn the system off, you're trapped."

Good!  At least they seem to be aware of some of the risks and social
obstacles they beget.  But wait, there's more ...

  But trends already taking hold in the computer industry are likely
  to SWEEP ASIDE or OVERRUN such concerns.  The growth of networks is
  expected to continue as more and more corporate data processing
  executives turn to Mr. Gelernter's ideas about parallel computing.

[Emphasis mine.]

Now, I don't really have a problem with these executives using
machines like this within their own networks, but I do have a problem
with it being used more widely.  I am unaware of exactly what this
care-free "trends in the computer industry are", but if they do exist
I hope other RISKS contributors can point them out.  I had been under
the impression that with the founding of organizations like the EFF
and CPSR that trends within the computer society were actually better
about issues like this.

Perhaps I am over-reading the scope with which "a computer program
which goes from computer to computer and network to network" was
offered, but even so, there seem to be many potential pitfalls which
must be guarded against to prevent such a helpful migrant worker from
being mutated into a rogue virus with millions of possible victims.

I am quite confident that Mr. Gelernter and the others working on this
project only have the best intentions in mind, but I do hope to see
better how they are addressing the risks.

Bob Frankston tells about the good old days of Multics, where the system
defaultly enforced the convention that you don't have access to what's in your
neighbor's desk.

It's worth noting that, at the same place and time, another laboratory across
campus operated under a different set of social conventions.

The ITS operating system was implemented without any security.  Any user could
access another person's files or mailbox, or view another user's screen in real
time, and in fact these practices were considered socially acceptable.  In
certain cases, this limited the utility of the system.  For example, grading
information was not usually kept on the machine.  However, this open attitude
and policy was generally felt to be more desirable than a secure situation, and
there's no doubt that it contributed substantially to the techno-social
environment there, and to the success of the laboratory.

I am mentioning this here to remind us that computer environments interact
with, and partially redefine, the social situations that they are intended to
support.  (Of course, most computer systems don't support the subtle
intricacies of secrets and privacy in natural social settings.  Even flexible
ones like Multics are often considered by users to be too difficult to figure
out how to use with the desired level of finesse.)

Computer privacy ("security") systems need to be flexible, human engineered,
understood by their users, and have their policies advertised and in
conformance with the social setting in which they are used.  It's very easy for
counter-productive security measures to infect a group's thinking - a real case
of a "computer virus" infecting people!  :)

The German Pilot Union confirms that the European A320 does have navigation
problems (abnormal behaviour of the altimeter), but ONLY during ONE of the
COMMON LANDING manoeuvres, namely during the manoeuvre carried out by the
crashed A320!  Lufthansa (German Airlines) admits that AIRBUS has advised all
the companies using the A320 to avoid THIS landing manoeuvre, but added that
there is no doubt about the security of the plane itself:

  "There is no reason to withdraw the A320 from service!" the chief pilot said.

Former A320 accidents:
26.06.1988    Habsheim near Mulhouse (France)    Air France          3 dead
14.02.1990    Bangalore (India)                  Indian Airlines    90 dead

But all these accidents didn't have any impact on the success of A320!

&gt;     Surely this statement implies that there is a problem with training
&gt;rather than the software or the crew.

No, it means there's a problem with the cockpit.  There's a great tendency
to fix poor interfaces by training, in the industry.  The majority of
a transition program, for example, is devoted to keyboarding on the flight
management system, at the expense of basic skills. Indeed, there's a trend
to shorten training programs, not expand them.  In highly automated
cockpits, there is also a well-recognized problem of the pilot being too
far out of the loop; however, manufacturers do not seem inclined to change
current design practices (although there are some promising refinements in
the 777).  This was a problem even with the "second generation" aircraft
of the late 1960's; it doesn't take much imagination to see how far glass
aircraft have gone.  My tolerance for "fixing it through training" extends
to one (1) mistake.  Airliner manufacturers, however, are carrying through 
complete cockpit management concepts to broad families of aircraft, though, 
which is absurd.

&gt;Before we speculate over the cause of the crash we ought to bear in mind that
&gt;there are vested interests in the A320. Airbus Industrie is knocking spots of
&gt;Boeing and MD in sales. The US FAA can easily take the side of US
&gt;manufacturers, using "software safety" as an excuse.

But probably won't: Boeing wants to sell its 777, which is be a fly-by-wire
airliner.  The majority of customers will come from Europe and the Third
World.  The time for the FAA to take a stand was in 1987, and it didn't.
You may recall Europe dragging its heels when certifying the 747-400, in 
apparent retribution for the lengthy FAA special conditions for the A320 
(less than a third of which dealt with the FBW control system, and even 
then, very superficially).


&gt;We should also be aware that the A320 is far from unique in having computer
&gt;control. Many many commercial aircraft have computers controlling some or all
&gt;aircraft subsystems.

The 757/767/A310/A300-600 were the first generation to even step in this 
direction, and, as you say, all four relegated authority to *systems*.  
Safety-critical systems generally had a failsafe human interface.  The 
airplanes all let the pilot have complete flight control.  

The A320/A330/A340/777 are the first generation which genuinely filter ALL
inputs through a computer.  The Airbus FBW aircraft have hard limits; the
777 will have "soft" limits (which can be overridden if the pilot so 
desires).  The latter simplifies design, and relies on pilot competence;
the former assumes pilot INcompetance, and greatly increases the complexity
of the code needed.      **

a central component of almost all the large fans, including the -400,
but Airbus exploited the features extensively with the A320).


&gt;security by the autopilot. It could also be argued that the training of pilots
&gt;when flying in "glass cockpits" is inadequate. However, the A320 is not unique
&gt;in having these problems.

I differ: the A320 cockpit is unique in the secure feeling it generates.  I kid
you not: I've been in a lot of cockpits; the A320 comes closest to being a
spaceship.  It has a TOTALLY insulated feel to it.  Even a veteran A320-basher
like myself felt decidedly cozy when I visited one a couple of years ago.  The
A320 pilots I know are aware of the threat, and make an attempt to fly "manual"
as much as possible, with or without the airline's blessing.  This concept has
somewhat belatedly come to most airlines running third-generation airlines as
well, which makes one wonder whether ALL the automation--which is designed to
be operated from takeoff to landing, for maximum profitability--is even worth
it, if nobody wants to use it beneath 18,000'.


&gt;banning the 747-400, etc), we must consider what things were like before
&gt;computers. [...]
&gt;
&gt;Do RISKS readers seriously believe that ground crews
&gt;with clipboards and pocket calculators made less mistakes than the A320 fuel
&gt;control system?

Yes.  The issue is not reliability, it's economy.  

The dispatch reliability of the A320 still lags a couple of points behind
aircraft such as the 737 or 727.  But it *may* be more profitable (the airplane
is yet to deliver on a few promises).  In the case of the A320 fuel control
system, the issue was how best to eliminate the F/E position (at $2
mil/year/plane in savings).

As far as the fuelling mechanism goes, the ones on the L-1011 and 747 are 
at least as sophisticated as the one on the A320.  And, when all else fails,
there're always the non-tech dripsticks, regardless of airplane. :-)

IMHO, the A320 is an aircraft with a considerable degree of notoriety (much of
it exaggerated), but I think it is premature for the a320-bashers to start
beating the war drums, until more information comes to light from the crash
investigation.  Airplanes do crash, from time to time; not every one is tied to
some catastrophic flaw in design and operation.

   ...Romain Kroes, Secretary General of SPAC is quoted as saying "...it
   has been clear to us that the crews were caught out by cockpit layout"

   In Risks 13.06, T.C.Bennett@syse.salford.ac.uk asserts: "Surely this
   statement implies that there is a problem with training rather than the
   software or the crew."

T.C.'s statement is a popular, but inaccurate claim, among manufacturers of
safety and security systems.  The manufacturer will say, "It doesn't matter if
that naturally lures the system administrator into leaving the system in an
insecure/unsafe state--we'll put something in the manual that tells him/her NOT
to do that."

An example of fatal man-machine interaction that is taught in most user
interface classes is that of a plane used in WWII.  In said plane, when a lever
in the cockpit was up, the landing gear was down.  This plane experienced a
number of accidents until the manufacturer switched so that lever down=landing
gear down.

There are certain things that humans naturally expect machines to do in
response to certain actions, and training and manuals are not entirely
successful at changing those expectations.

Just some random thoughts on the subject, based on what's been posted here
thus far:

&gt;&gt;1. The extension of the concept of "pilot error" to "pilot computer error" is
   interesting. (Not only can those dumbos not fly a 'plane, they can't even
   program a computer! :-)&lt;&lt;

Then how in the world did they manage to get 14,000 flight-hours between them,
I wonder? It would appear that inexperience with flying in general is not a
factor here.

&gt;&gt;3. Unless we assume that two experienced pilots simply forgot that there are
   a few mountains in the way on the Strasbourg run, they would only have
   selected a descent mode prematurely if they did not know where they were. &lt;&lt;

This would appear to be the best answer. Consider: If there was equipment
failure either 
  A: the impact would have been far more sudden this this report indicates, or
  B: they would have radioed a mayday, since they'd have had enough time to do
     so.

But since, as  is pointed out:

&gt;&gt;4. The aircraft did not "smash into a mountainside". It crashed into trees in
   an area where there is a fair amount of reasonably level terrain, as shown
   by the fact that the rear section was slowed down by the tail catching in
   trees.&lt;&lt;

it would appear that the pilots never knew that something was wrong; and all
equipment appeared to be working, until it was FAR too late to do anything
about it, and this is the only logical reason I've seen offered as to why they
were unable to get a message off before going down.


All of this is made garbage, however, if you believe the Times article, though,
where is states:"Jean-Paul Maurel, general secretary of the French pilots'
union, said the
 aircraft had been on a normal approach path, well above the Vosges peaks when
 it suddenly plunged and hit the ground in less than a minute."

This scenario would indicate some sort of major systems failure, and not the
fauilt of the pilots in question.  (But then, would anyone really expect a
pilot's union rep to say that their members screwed up and killed X number of
people in doing so?)

&gt;&gt;In Risks 13.05 Romain Kroes, Secretary General of SPAC is quoted as saying
"... it has been clear to us that the crews were caught out by cockpit layout"

     Surely this statement implies that there is a problem with training
rather than the software or the crew.&lt;

Not being a flyer, I wouldn't know, but new equipment, particularly if there
are controls in places other than where you expect them to be, or that have a
different command structure to them will foul even the best of us up in a
crunch. I drive a stick shift car, for example. I'm forever poking a hole in
the floorboard of my wife's automatic, trying to find the clutch when I need to
stop in a hurry.  Some of you, I'm sure foul your typing when trying to get
used to a new keyboard. Could this be a factor in this crash?

I mean, it seems established that the plane was below a safe approach level,
well before the crash. Could it be, that the pilots realised this, and
attempted corrective action in a hurry, and being a new system to them, fouled
things up?

&gt;&gt;Finally, I would like to quote an `expert' on aviation who in a recent TV
interview said that "the common theme to all three of the A320 crashes is
lack of altitude"&lt;&lt;

Then, if true, could the pilot/computer interface with regards to altitude be
different enough to be causing problems in panic situations?

Pure speculation, here, of course.

Final question: If the twoer was able to record that the plane was below a safe
path, why was there no message radioed to the plane of the situation?

In the PC/AT environment, some adapter cards (i.e. interface circuit boards)
have ROM's which contain extensions to the motherboard's own BIOS ROM for
dealing with the peculiarities of accessing the interface board.  These
programs are executed when someone accesses the device, and could contain code
which could do anything to the host system, such as writing a virus onto the
hard disk.  I've only seen these ROM's on graphics cards, but I think other
devices perhaps including printer interfaces might have them too.

It seems to me that there are many ways in which something that the media would
consider a "printer" could contain a virus, or more likely a worm.  The most
obvious one is if the "printer" was a console printer terminal.

Some of the less obvious ones are:

The printer could simply print the wrong information. This is quite easy if you
know the output is coming from some well-known program. Of course, then it
wouldn't act the way it was reported to...which leads to the next possibility:

My best guess is that it's more of a meme than a virus. That is to say, an idea
that you plant in the heads of your enemies that causes them to waste time
checking *everything*, no matter how ridiculous it may be. Once you propagate
the meme of a "printer virus", people without local printer technologies have
to worry every time they get a printer from somewhere else, and spend time
reverse engineering it (assuming that's even possible).

I often think some of the PC and Mac viruses fall into this category more than
any other.

Watch what you believe, it determines who you are.

I agree that the Iraqi printer-virus story was almost certainly a hoax.
But I perceive some vagueness in your explanation ...

	"The print server (on, say, DECnet) is actually a networked
	computer acting as a print server; accepting files from other
	network sources and spooling them to a printer. True, this
	computer/printer combo is often referred to simply as a
	printer,  but it would not, in any case, be able to submit
	programs to other hosts on  the net."

I disagree.  With a bus-style network such as Ethernet, what is to
prevent a subverted print server from mimicing one of the VAX hosts?
I've seen it done.

	"However, it is unlikely that the Iraqi air defence system was
	Mac based ..."

Can you substantiate this?  Why is it unlikely?

	"In a situation like that, the first thing to do when the
	system malfunctions after a new piece of equipment has been
	added is to take out the new part.  Unless the "chip" could
	send out a program which could survive, in the network or
	system, by itself, the removal of the printer would solve the
	problem."

But "... a program which could survive by itself ..." is pretty much
the defining characteristic of a virus: it installs itself into a new
host.

	"Coming from the popular press, "chip" could mean pretty much
	anything, so my initial reaction that the program couldn't be
	large enough to do much damage means little."

Indeed.  In the scenario I envision, the "chip" would be a set of ROMs
which fully replace the 2 megabytes of instruction storage on a
PostScript printer (which is a typical size for an Adobe level 2
system such as the Laserwriter IIf.)

	"However, the programming task involved would be substantial."

The NSA is capable of performing substantial programming tasks.

	"The article mentions that a peripheral was used in order to
	circumvent normal security measures, but all systems have
	internal security measures as well in order to prevent a
	printer from "bringing down" the net."

And this security is woefully inadequate to prevent a virus that is
designed with full knowledge of that security.

	"The program would have to be able to run/compile or be
	interpreted on the host, and would thus have to know what the
	host was, and how it was configured."

Yes, and it seems quite reasonable that a federal spook agency would
have that information.

	"It would also have to be sophisticated enough in avoiding
	detection that it could masquerade as a "bug" in the software,
	and persistent enough that it could avoid elimination by the
	reloading of software which would immediately take place in
	such a situation."

But viruses do this every day!

	"It has also been rumoured, and by sources who should know,
	that the US military has sent out an RFP on the use of computer
	viri as computer weapons."

The military confirmed the RFP, but pointed out that the objective of
the study was *defense* against such virus weapons.

Fishy as the "printer virus" story is, one should note that the statment:

| 	   ``A printer is a receiving device. Data does not transmit from the
| printer to the computer,'' said Winn Schwartau, executive director of the
| International Partnership Against Computer Terrorism.

is not necessarily true anymore.  With the advent of printers that speak TCP/IP
and hook directly to the network, the idea that a printer could wreak havoc on
computers and networks is no longer such a far-fetched idea.

&gt;The first question is: could a chip in a printer send a virus?  Doesn't a
&gt;printer just accept data?

I read that set of articles in my copy of USN&amp;WR, and it made me think
about what a printer does and the software that drives it.

No, today's printers are vastly smarter than the dot matrix (or band printers)
of yesterday. The PostScript one sitting 20 feet away is smart enough to tell
the computer feeding it that it is out of paper, and not just by raising an
interface signal, but by saying "out of paper". It can also tell me exactly
what it didn't like about the print commands I gave it.

&gt;However, the "information" which comes back over the
&gt;line is concerned strictly with whether or not the printer is ready to accept
&gt;more data.  It is never accepted as a program by the "host".

Ah, but is that true? It was not but a short while ago that an Internet worm
was released whose method of entry was to overflow the data input of a certain
program, causing the extra material to be written to the stack and executed as
a program. This is, I am sure, just one example of how DATA can become PROGRAM
(and, as a programmer, I have had that happen too many times).

&gt;The case of "network" printers, is somewhat more complex.  ...
&gt; ... True, this computer/printer combo is often referred to simply
&gt;as a printer,  but it would not, in any case, be able to submit programs
&gt;to other hosts on  the net.  

Perhaps it could. Networked printers (the ones that hang on the Ethernet) are
assigned Internet addresses just like systems are. They have access to all the
information passing through the Ethernet, including passwords and login id's
from remote logins.

Unless the network admin specifically excludes the printer addresses from being
able to log in (if that can be done, I would have to spend some time
investgating that question) there is nothing that would stop a printer from
generating a login similar to one that it sees coming across the net, dumping
an executable to the system, and running it.

Thinking about this, it suddenly becomes apparent the danger of terminal
servers. They are capable of monitoring any login coming in through them, and
the systems they talk to are unable to keep them from using it to log in 'by
themselves', without also closing out the users.

&gt;Third question:  could a virus, installed on a chip, and entered into
&gt;the air defence computer system, have done what it was credited with?

I don't recall if it was explicit or merely implied that the NSA knew what
systems the Iraqi's were using. You wouldn't need to know much about the
specific software, as long as you knew they were using X (a fact a smart
printer could probably determine by watching the type of packets on the net)
you could screw up the display.

All of this is, of course, probably highly secret and will never be known for
sure. It does look like the technology is there to do something like this.
Whether the NSA invested the time and effort to do it is the question.

To quote Christopher Stacy: "Computer privacy ("security") systems need to be
flexible, human engineered, understood by their users, and have their policies
advertised and in conformance with the social setting in which they are used.
It's very easy for counter-productive security measures to infect a group's
thinking - a real case of a "computer virus" infecting people!  :)"

This was precisely the point of Multics access control -- developing 
effective security meant usable and "friendly" security.  I do question 
whether the fishbowl atmosphere of ITS necessarily contributed to the success 
of the labs research.  (Though there were lots of valuable ideas in (and on) 
ITS independent of AI and ignoring privacy issues did simplify aspects of 
project administration.)  An organization can choose a fishbowl model and 
reflect it throughout the organization.  To a large extent I do like the 
relatively open atmosphere.  But we shouldn't mistake a total lack of privacy 
as being fundamentally virtuous.

The fishbowl approach is easy but misses the point of computer systems a part 
of the cultural infrastructure.  I must have confidence in the privacy of 
email in order to use it as a fundamental means of communications and not 
just as a novelty.  I don't discuss confidential information on my cellular 
phone for just that reason. The cellular phone system is a prime example of 
lessons not learned and a reason to periodically remind people of Camelot, 
oops, Multics.

The Ohio case, (given my guesses as to what happened) is another example 
where the fishbowl model is not appropriate.

In the PC world we have physical position as the model of privacy.  This works
nicely as an extension of ones desk.  In order to more effectively share
resources we need to have faith that the shared systems will also respect my
privacy.

As an aside, I fear that misguided organizational policies may pressure people
into making people contribute their machines Linda servers.  After all, a CPU
is a terrible thing to waste.  Let's recycle them.  (Luckily there are the new
power management chips like the 386SL that will allow me to argue that
noncomputing is nonpolluting)

Lotus Notes is a modern example of a system with a high regard for 
nonintrusive privacy.  It achieves mixed success in regard to usability but 
does demonstrate how one can provide Multics-like security (and then some) in 
a loosely coupled PC environment. (I'll have to admit some bias here being a 
heavy Notes user myself).

In RISKS 13.06, Christopher Stacy responds to an earlier remark about
the fact that Multics normally protected files against access by
others, [noting the ITS system ...].

A still different computer security scheme was in use at the Stanford A.I. Lab
(SAIL) in the same period, with still different social conventions.  Default
file and screen protection was used and protected resources were regarded as
private.  However, special commands made it possible for anyone to remove any
security that got in their way.  Such actions "left tracks" so that questions
could be asked later about why it was done.  If it was done without adequate
justification, social or employment sanctions were applied.

This approach probably would not work well in situations where users have
little contact with each other, but in our laboratory environment it worked
very well.  We knew that there were enough computer security loopholes and
enough smart people around who knew how to exploit them that there was no hope
of strictly computer-enforced security working.

By making security-breeching software available to everyone, we levelled the
playing field and diverted energies that might otherwise have been expended on
creative "locksmithing" into more productive channels.  The un-secure commands
proved useful in a number of situations in which individuals or groups had
failed to foresee the need to access certain protected files whose owners were
not available.

Marc Shannon describes a computerized telephone call from a credit agency,
misdirected by a wrong phone number to him, concerning another person's
account.  Of course, the call violated the privacy of the intended recipient.
He concludes by wondering if "we starting to rely on computers a bit much?"

Probably true in many cases, but you don't need to involve a computer for this
particular problem.  Although this kind of program can dehumanize the situation
worse by moving you further apart, a simple answering machine will suffice.  I
frequently get all kinds of misdirected messages contain private information
left on my answering machine; these are all different places calling different
people.  One popular one is for one or another doctor's office to call and
leave exasperated messages telling me about how the payment for someone's
particular medical service is overdue.  Sometimes they bother to leave a return
number.  It doesn't seem to matter what the outgoing greeting on my answering
machine says.

I believe that most people leaving messages simply assume that if they reach an
answering machine, they have reached the correct number.  Or perhaps it has
little to do with technological risks, and is instead really a social issue.
For example, maybe these kinds of incidents can be attributed to people just
not caring about the quality of their work, rather than to technological
naivete.  Perhaps these problems contribute to each other.

One risk that we run in RISKS, is attempting to analyze broad social issues
with our pronounced technocratic tendencies.

I went home and thought I'd calculate my gas mileage.  I whipped out the
receipt and noticed that it was for $2.00 less that what I had put in.  Hmmm,
that's strange.  Then I noticed that it was somebody elses card number and name
on the slip.  I had watched the receipt print, so I know it wasn't the case of
someone not taking it after the sale.

If I got someone elses receipt, maybe that person got mine.  Somehow, I don't
get a warm fuzzy feeling from that.  Sounds like a risk to me...

There was an article in the San Jose Mercury News, 12 January 1992, titled
"Stolen Identity", that should be of interest to RISKS readers.  It concerned a
woman who had numerous driving infractions charged to her because an
unscrupulous aquaintance was able to get away with supplying the woman's
driver's license instead of her own.  Here's a summary:

One woman (Donna) lets another, down on her luck, (Billy) live in her apartment
for a few months till she gets back on her feet.  Billy finds out Donna's
Drivers License number, and proceeds to give it any time she is stopped by the
police, which happens quite a lot.  The police take Billy's word for her name,
and Donna is unwittingly saddled with tickets from Police Departments in
Oakland, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and San Jose as well as the CHP.  Early in the
game, an officer may have allowed her to see the results of looking up the
license number in the databases accessible from the squad car.  Donna has
tickets for speeding, expired registration, open containers of alcohol, going
through stoplights, failure to wear a seatbelt, and of course driving without a
license.

Donna has given up on fixing the problem, and has cancelled her license.  Her
last hope is that some cop will arrest Billy for the more serious charge of
driving with a suspended license.

Here is an example of a backpropagation neural network that has very
wild behavior at some points not in the training or test sets.  It has
just one input unit ( for variable x), two hidden units with a
sigmoidal squashing function, and one output unit.

This kind of subnetwork, a "neural net virus" if you like, may exist in many of
the networks that have been trained to date.  It could be built into any large
BP network, and might hardly change the latter's output behavior at all --
except in one small region of the input space, where a totally unexpected
output could occur that might lead to disaster.

I hope this note will be taken as a warning by all persons whose ANS are used
in safety critical applications in medicine, engineering, the military etc.  It
is also an encouragement to design safety into their neural networks.

In order to avoid details of the backpropagation algorithm, we shall just use
the property that once a BP net has reached an absolute minimum of error on the
training and test sets, its parameters are not changed.  So our net will have
zero error by design and the BP algorithm, applied with infinite precision
arithmetic, would not change its weights.  The issue of getting stuck at a
local minimum of error does not apply in this case, since it is an absolute
minimum.

All the weights in the system remain bounded, and in this case, the
bound on their absolute values is 40.  The output unit's function is
40 * H1 + 40 * H2 - 40, where Hi is the output of the i-th hidden unit
(i = 1, 2).  The output unit has no sigmoid, though one could be
inserted with no loss of generality.  The two hidden units have
outputs of the form 1/(1 + e ^ (w0 + w1*x)) with w0 = -10 and w0 = 30,
while w1 = + 40 and -40, respectively.

We assume the net has been trained on a subset of integers and also tested on a
subset of integers.  This could be replaced by a finer grid, and safety assured
(for bounded weights).  However, in a d-dimensional input space with a
quantization to L levels of each variable, one would need L ^ d training and
test points, which can easily be an astronomically large number (e.g. 1000^10).
Hence it is not generally feasible to assure safety by testing.

Below is the overall function f(x) produced by the net, which is also the
specification of what it is *supposed* to do outside the interval (0,1).  In
(0,1) the specification is to be less than 0.002 in absolute value.

f(x) = 40 [ 1/( 1 + e^40*(x - 1/4))  +   1/( 1 + e^-40*(x - 3/4))  -1 ]

The largest deviation of our trained network f(x) from 0 on all integers is

f(0) = f(1) = 0.0018...

So f is within 2/1000 of being 0 everywhere on our training and test sets.  Can
we be satisfied with it?  No! If we happen to give an input of x = 1/2, we get

f(1/2) = - 39.99...

The magnitude of this is over 22000 times larger than anything
appearing during training and testing, and is way out of spec.

Such unexpected values are likely to be very rare if a lot of testing has been
done on a trained net, but even then, the potential for disaster can still be
lurking in the system.  Unless neural nets are *designed* to be safe, there may
be a serious risk involved in using them.

The objective of this note is *not* to say "neural nets are bad for safety
critical applications".  On the contrary, I personally believe they can be made
as safe as any digital circuit, and a lot safer than programs.  This might make
ANS the method of choice for safety-critical electronic applications, for
example in aircraft control systems.

But to achieve that goal, a design methodology must be used which is
*guaranteed* to lead to a safe network.  Such a methodology can be based on
decomposition of the input space into parts where the function synthesized is
forced to be monotonic in each variable.  For adaptive logic networks, this is
easy to achieve.  The random walk technique for encoding real values used in
the atree release 2.0 software available by ftp is not appropriate for
enforcing monotonicity.  Instead, thresholds should be used, which are
monotonic functions R -&gt; {0,1}.  By forcing monotonicity, one can assure that
no wild values can occur, since all values will be bounded by the values at
points examined during testing.

For BP networks, I am not sure a safe design methodology can be developed.
This is not because of the BP algorithm, per se, but rather because of the
architecture of multilayer networks with sigmoids: *all* weights are used in
computing *every* output (the effect of zero weights having been eliminated).
Every output is calculated using some negative and some positive weights,
giving very little hope of control over the values beyond the set of points
tested.

&gt;&gt; Lufthansa (German Airlines) admits that AIRBUS has advised all the
&gt;&gt; companies using the A320 to avoid THIS landing manoeuvre...

Given the description of the local geography, it sounds like this either means
you use this landing maneuver (guess which side of the pond I'm from :-), or
you don't land A320's at Strasbourg.  Is this a RISK of bugs in flight software
affecting seemingly unrelated things, such as airline equipment schedules?

The localization of "pilot error" in "the hiatus between the pilot and the
computer" is a more solidly persuasive notion than the slick equivocation
of the phrase might suggest.

As I understand it, control of the A320 is mediated by flight control computers
differently in one dimension (the vertical) than in the other two.  Why is this
the case?  Is particularly different status given to altitude, in terms of
attentional demands on pilots, compared to the aircraft's motion in the other
two dimensions?  Or, must A320 pilots attend to and control altitude in a
manner different from what is for them either customary or sensible?

Re the overall FBW design, if pilots circumvent, push the limits of, tweak or
otherwise attempt to assert as much direct control over the aircraft as
possible, working against the "hard," "soft" or whatever degree of automated
mediation imposed by the computers, the problem is one caused not by pilot or
aircraft as such, but by the designers.

Germane to this, in cognitive psychologist Don Norman's (1988) The Design of
Everyday Things (aka The Psychology of Everyday Things), he writes:

	Aircraft designers started using meters that looked like clockfaces
	to represent altitude.  As airplanes were able to fly higher and
	higher, the meters needed more hands.  Guess what?  Pilots made
	errors- serious errors.  Multihanded analog altimeters have been
	largely abandoned in favor of digital ones because of the prevalence
	of reading errors.  Even so, many contemporary altimeters maintain
	a mixed mode; information about rate and direction of altitude change
	is determined from a single analog hand, while precise judgments of
	height come from the digital display.

Some relevant questions about the A320 flight deck should be obvious.  Norman
continues:

	Automation has its virtues, but automation is dangerous when it
	takes too much control from the user.  "Overautomation"- too
	great a degree of automation- has become a technical term in the
	study of automated aircraft and factories.  One problem is that
	overreliance on automated equipment can eliminate a person's 
	ability to function without it, a prescription for disaster if,
	for example, one of the highly automated mechanisms of an
	aircraft suddenly fails.  A second problem is that a system may
	not always do things exactly the way we would like, but we are
	forced to accept what happens because it is too difficult (or
	impossible) to change the operation.  A third problem is that
	the person becomes a servant of the system, no longer able to
	control or influence what is happening....

	All systems have several layers of control.... Sometimes we
	really want to maintain control at a lower level...  At other
	times we want to concentrate on higher level things....

So the question is, what is the level of control that is appropriately accorded
aircraft pilots, based upon how humans think, on how pilots actually behave?

I have a much simpler theory for why the A-320 has had so many crashes so far.
My experience is that the fewer number of events that have to occur to cause a
particular error the more likely that error is to occur. It seems to me that if
the pilot makes an error that isn't immediately fatal, then most of the time
the co-pilot is going to catch the mistake before it is fatal. Let us say that
the co-pilot catches 90% of the pilot's mistakes. So one time out of ten the
co-pilot misses the pilot's mistake and the plane crashs. Let us assume that in
a plane with a three man crew that the flight engineer also will catch the
pilot's mistake 90% percent of the time.  It seems to me that the chance that
both of them would miss the error would only be 1%, that is the rest of the
flight crew would catch the pilot's error 99 times out of 100.  Now I know this
is a gross oversimplification and the actual ratios are wrong, but
qualitatively the idea feels right.  There is just one less pair of eyes and
ears in the cockpit to notice that something is wrong.

One thing that might support this is to study the relative accident rates of
large airlines that would generally have three crew members, commuter airlines
that would probably have two and air taxis and general aviation, that would
probably only have one pilot. The difference might not entirely be due to the
difference in the experience of the pilots. It might be informative to compare
the A-320 accident rates to other planes that have a two man crew, rather than
comparing it to planes of similar size that use a three man crew.

Also has anyone ever broken aircraft accident rates down to the rate per
landing and takeoff? It seems to me that might be more informative than
aircraft-hours or aircraft-miles.

        I am a great admirer of the A320, and, while I am not a pilot, I enjoy 
a similar level of automation when navigating the 35' sailboat I race on every 
summer.  The equipment I use works extremely well, but if you punch in the 
wrong numbers it will take you to the wrong place just as fast as it would to 
the correct one.  Although double and triple checking your work and monitoring 
the progress of your vessel should always be done, the technology for "getting 
you there" has greatly outstripped the technology for "telling you where you 
are, and where you are going", i.e., situational awareness.

        Although you can easily read latitude, longitude, altitude and airspeed
from your instruments, the method for relating this to possible hazards to
navigation is still primarily a manual one.  Now that pilots are becoming
"system managers", they need to have the tools to monitor the system as a
whole, not just the hydraulic and mechanical subsystems.  Simple ways to
improve upon this might include a vertical profile display on one of the
cockpit CRTs that plots both the programmed flight path of the aircraft and the
altitude of the ground from zero to five minutes into the future, and a moving
map display that also shows the predicted flight path.  I know that on the boat
I race on I would dearly love to have the Trimble moving map display that does
this, it would significantly reduce my workload.

Regarding the Airbus crash.  It has been noted that altitude is the one
parameter the pilots cannot program in.

Altitude maybe the most important parameter.  Perhaps it is better that the
pilot-programmers program in altitude and let the computer derive the rest of
the information.  The question may be which piece of data is crucial to the
problem and which is an artifact of antique technologies and obsolete methods.

If I were specifying a fly-by-computer system, I would certainly require a
database of all relevant altitudes (elevation at 100 foot intervals, airports,
minimum operating altitudes, etc).

Certainly with today's INS and GPS Systems, there is no more reason for a
computer controlled plane to fly into the ground then for a cruise missile to
overfly its target.  Say how much software does the Airbus and the Exocet
share?

Some followup on the earlier posting I made regarding the U.S. Army's proposal
to use "DNA dog tags" to build a database of soldiers genotype's as a universal
identification resource.

The New York Times (Jan. 12, pp. 15 "Genetic Records to Be Kept on Members of
Military") reports that the Army will go forward with the idea incorporating a
number of protections for the genetic privacy of soldiers.  First, they will
only collect DNA samples (blood spots), but they will not genotype them unless
there is an actual need.  Second, these samples will be destroyed when the
individual leaves the military.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, these
samples will be treated as "medical specimen with confidentiality and respect,"
so they would not be available for testing for other purposes unless subpoenaed
by court order.

The net effect of these protections is about as much as could be hoped for.
The military will be able to use a valuable new technology in identifying the
remains of soldiers, and they will be able to do this without creating a
massive electronic database of genotype data.

Meanwhile, the British journal Nature reports an anecdote which illustrates
some of the pitfalls and prejudices of dealing with genetic data, "Challenge to
British forensic database" Nature, vol. 355, p.191.  Since you can't change
your genes, the data in a genotype database will never go out of date, right?
Well it appears that is what the Metropolitan Police believed.  Scotland Yard
has been building a database of genotypes from all the DNA samples they have
analyzed in the course of various criminal investigations.  The problem is that
when a man cleared of all charges on the basis of a DNA analysis asked to have
his profile removed from the database, they found it necessary to "call in a
computer specialist." It seems that in designing the database, no one had
considered the possibility that you might want to delete an entry.

If the printer was a SCSI Printer, it could do the following :-

1) Change from Target mode to Initiator mode.

   Most SCSI controllers support both initiator and target modes.

2) Interrogate each device on the bus to find the boot disk.

   It may choose not to select ID 7 as this is probably the host ID.

3) Write the virus directly to the boot disk (or indeed any other disk).

Some SCSI devices can even have their firmware downloaded across the SCSI
Bus. A rogue program could download a virus that infects the disk as
described above. Therefore the O/S ought to prevent direct low level
access by user software to any SCSI device!

So, could we please stop the discussion right here? I mean, we got two sides:

"Well, assuming 1,2,3 and 4 it might very well be possible for a printer to
 spread a virus throuh a network"

"Nah, never. Printers are used to print stuff. The programs in printers would
 never be able to do such a thing"

Regardless of who is right, maybe the discussion should focus on a way to make
sure that 1 2 3 and 4 do not occur anytime. To me it seems very unlikely that
such a thing occured in the Gulf war. But maybe, just maybe, someone got the
idea, and has just now finished his first compile.....

So the real RISKS in my opinion is not "has it happened" but "what will be the
consequences when it does happen". 

I'm already giving my printer strange looks every time my job doesn't come
out as I want it to be :-)

About the military uses for viruses:

To ensure defeat of the enemy, a military commander will use every weapon at
his disposal, to exploit all weaknesses. The computer systems that are
necessary to operate an air defence network are obviously a weak link.

If the lives of Allied aircrew can be saved by a computer virus, then that
option would appear very attractive to the Commander in Chief.

Anyone reading this can believe that maximum effort was made to to exploit all
weaknesses.

If the NSA got ahold of a piece of hardware that was going to be used in an
Iraqi computer network that was supposedly secure, I would expect that there
are lots of things they could do with it that would be far more helpful to us
or damaging to them than messing around with a virus, and a lot easier to do
besides.  For example, a printer connected to a network could be set up to
broadcast everything coming across the network in some fashion, or for that
matter it might glean info merely by broadcasting any talking it picked up near
the printer.

Well, as so many other people are indulging in speculation, I might as well
join in. :-)

First, we should consider some things about the likely target of such an
attack, if it happened.  First, it is unlikely that the system involved was a
general-purpose system with programs out on disk that could be run, one at a
time.  It is also doubtful there was any such thing as a peer printer on a
network link.

Why do I say that?  Because the alleged system was for air defense.  This means
it was a system with a strong real-time component.  In general, systems such as
this are built on older, more stable hardware and involve an embedded system --
not a disk full of utility programs like your favorite Unix or VMS time-share
environment.

The idea of a virus in such a system is ludicrous.  Viruses don't work in
embedded systems.  That, coupled with the general press's inability to tell a
virus from a spreadsheet, leads me to believe it certainly wasn't a virus, if
it was anything.

However, if we care to speculate a bit further, consider the possibiity of a
small Trojan horse being built into the air defense software by the original
contractor.  Now imagine that a printer is brought in to the system that has a
small radio receiver involved, so that when a certain coded signal is received,
the printer uses a timing channel to signal the trojan in the printer driver
that it is time to disrupt operations.  This is particularly easy in an
embedded, real-time system.  Suddenly add a 5-second delay loop, for instance.

This is certainly within the realm of possibility.  Furthermore, it would be
harder to detect under test (timing channels are notoriously difficult to find,
but are well-suited for certain real-time systems) without actual source code,
and it would not have the same hit-or-miss qualities of a virus. (Even source
code might not help, if we keep Thompson's little cc/login escapade in mind.)

April Fool's joke or not, don't believe the press when they say "virus" -- but
don't automatically believe they don't have a story underneath the mistakes,
either!

"Kai-Mikael J\d\d-Aro" &lt;kai@nada.kth.se&gt; says in RISKS DIGEST 13.05:

&gt; Perhaps the moral can be stated as: When Formal Methods Are Fun And Simplify
&gt; Your Work, Then You Will Also Want To Use Them.

This might not be an unmitigated success, from the RISKS point-of-view.  For
example, when the transition occurred from assembly language to compiled
languages, people found they could solve their old problems more easily.  They
could say a + b = c without even knowing the address of a, b, and c.

The problem is that compiler technology (known in the old days as "automatic
programming") gave the individual programmer more reach.  It allowed him to
attack problems beyond his mental grasp in the pre-compiler era.

Tools will always be pushed to their limit, because the limit is actually in
the programmer and it is the fundamental nature of programmers -- like athletes
-- to go as far as they are capable, and try to go a bit farther.  The tool
simply provides an amplification, like giving a pole-vaulter a longer pole.
The RISK is that the new tool allows the programmer to do more damage than
before.

Will Kai-Mikael J\d\d-Aro find himself next year creating state diagrams with
the complexity of a street map of Stockholm with 100 pucks circulating around
it?  This might open a whole new range of computer applications (like, say, an
automatic vehicle control system for the streets of Stockholm), but there is no
particular reason to believe these systems will be more reliable than the
smaller systems built before the tool was developed.  The RISK is that these
larger and more complex applications will cause more damage when they fail.

A snowstorm here in Toronto last week caused a "brownout" that revealed an
interesting failing in our emergency lighting system.

The emergency lighting is supplied by boxes containing batteries with a pair of
spotlights mounted on top. These are plugged into sockets around the building.
The idea is that if the mains supply fails, the lights will turn on.

When the mains supply voltage dropped, most of the fluorescent lighting failed.
However, the drop was insufficient to trigger the emergency lighting, which
remained (mostly) off. Fortunately the units could be unplugged to trigger the
lighting.

Also of note was a PC, which failed to detect the power problems and continued
operation when the rest of the computers shut down. I'm not sure if this was an
advantage (doesn't lose your work in the event of a brownout) or a disadvantage
(doesn't react to power problems which may damage the computer).

Here's a risk from the software industry that seems to have bled into other
areas with the help of no less than our own Federal Government.

We've all heard, joked and complained about -- and suffered with -- software
warranties that do far more to protect the vendor than the buyer.  Loosely,
they can be summed up as saying 'We warranty that there are recoverable bits on
this disk.  Beyond that, you're on your own.'

I recently made some substantial (~$1300) purchases of a couple of non-computer
products.  Imagine my feelings at finding the following familiar seeming words
on the backs of the associated user's manuals (manufacturers and products have
been concealed to protect the guilty):

			   WHY NO WARRANTY CARD HAS BEEN
		   PACKED WITH THIS NEW &lt;manufacturer&gt; &lt;product&gt;

     The Magnuson-Moss Act (Public Law 93-637) does not require any seller
     or manufacturer of a consumer product to give a written warranty.  It
     does provide that if a written warranty is given, it must be
     designated as "limited" or as "full" and sets minimum standards for a
     "full" warranty.

     &lt;manufacturer&gt; has elected not to provide any written warranty either
     "limited" or "full", rather than to attempt to comply with the
     provisions of the Magnuson-Moss Act and the regulations issued
     thereunder.

     There are certain implied warranties under state law with respect to
     sales of consumer goods.  As the extent and interpretation of these
     implied warranties varies from state to state, you should refer to
     your state statutes.

     &lt;manufacturer&gt; wishes to assure its customers of its continued
     interest in providing service to owners of &lt;manufacturer's product&gt;.

Sound familiar?  At least I don't have to worry about voiding the
warranty, since there isn't one.  I fear this may indicate a trend ...

     "Why this new &lt;computer/aircraft/heart monitor/etc.&gt; comes with no
     warranty ..."

It worked for the software industry.

On Tuesday night (1/29/92), after President Bush's State of the Union address I
happened to tune into the CBS television network as they were announcing a
novel poll.  They claimed nothing like it had ever been attempted before, and
it sounded interesting so we stayed with them for awhile, and even tried to
participate.

The basis for the poll was an interactive telephone system set up at a site in
Omaha, Nebraska, with an (800) WATS line to allow toll-free access from
anywhere in the US.  Early in the show CBS announcer Charles Kuralt reported
that the telecommunications center was capable of handling thousands of calls
per minute, "so there should be no problem".  HA!

Participation required a touch-tone phone, so that callers could respond via
keypad entry to the canned questions posed by the automated response system.
Although we live in a rural area with old mechanical switch gear, my phones
all can switch between rotary and touchtone mode, so I could dial up using
pulse mode and then switch to tone for the response.

After watching a few minutes to see what additional explanations were given, I
decided to try accessing the poll.  At the time they seemed to be running at a
couple of thousand calls per minute.  My initial attempt to call them resulted
in a very long dead interval, followed by a message saying "Your call cannot be
completed as dialed, you must supply more digits in the number dialed."

That seemed strange, so I tried redialing several times, more carefully, with
similar results.  Since the map showing calls received was showing nothing from
our area of New England (New Hampshire and Maine were both showing null), I
wondered if there was a problem with the WATS routing or something, that might
have caused the strange error message.  So I called the operator, and when I
started to say I was having trouble dialing an (800) number she immediately
asked if it was the one that had been given on TV.  When I said it was, I was
told that the lines were flooded.

Apparently the volume of calls was either forcing the long-distance system into
some strange failure mode in which it thought more digits were required in the
number being called, or there was a mismatch between the particular error
condition and the error message being used.  I suspect, based on my limited
knowledge of the telephone network, that there may have been some timeout or
connection loss or contention or something that inadvertently truncated the
routing information string, due to the huge volume of calls.

Shortly afterward, with the display showing about 125,000 calls processed, Dan
Rather reported on the air that AT&amp;T was estimating there had been about
7,000,000 call attempts!  Obviously their throughput was a little below the
capacity requirements...

BTW, using redial, I was able to access the number on a subsequent attempt, and
did get my response included in the poll.  At that time they were reporting
about a hundred thousand calls processed.  From the ratio of call attempts
reported by AT&amp;T to calls processed it looked to me like the ratio was upwards
of 70 to 1.  It took me only about ten tries or so, so I guess I was lucky.

The risk seems obvious, experimenting with a novel application in a live
production environment requires some careful system analysis and planning to
avoid unexpected errors.

One thing I'm curious about, wonder what their phone bill was?

 Joel&gt; It might be informative to compare the A-320 accident rates to
 Joel&gt; other planes that have a two man crew, rather than comparing it
 Joel&gt; to planes of similar size that use a three man crew.

OK. We'll do this. 

The Boeing 757. No total hull losses. No incidents *at all*, that I can recall.

The Boeing 767. One total hull loss, due to a problem with the engines (and on
the engines that were least used. The ones in question were the Pratt &amp;
Whitney, while most customers had the GE/SNECMA).

The Boeing 747-400 (though not a 2-engine plane, is the most "technologically
advanced", aside of the A320, with an almost total glass-cockpit) some
incidents, but no hull losses. The 747-400 is particularly interesting because
earlier models had three flight crew members.

The A-320 is about the same vintage as the 747-400, and is newer than the 757
and 767 by a good five plus years.

... The AT320's fly-by-wire system or glass cockpit ... may not have been
directly involved in the lastest A320 crash.

A U.S. air safety source informs me that initial information suggests that a
miscommunication between Air Traffic Control and the A320's pilot may have been
the primary cause of the accident.  Apparently the A320 was originally on a
landing path to a runway with a fairly rapid descent slope.  Sometime fairly
late in the landing sequence, the pilot was ordered to a different runway by
ATC, but may not have been warned that the new runway would require a different
descent to avoid slamming into a mountain.  The pilot descended at the original
rate and the crash resulted.

Before someone argues that the automated information transmission systems being
planned would have solved this problem, it's worth noting that many are very
concerned that such information systems would deprive pilots of information
being sent to other planes, which they might need to know to avoid collisions
or other problems.  Many accidents have been avoided by pilots who heard ATC
directions being given to *other* pilots (over conventional radios, of course)
and realized that they themselves needed to take evasive action!

There is an old story about WWII in the Pacific, where an operations research
team was sent to the combat zone to determine where armor should be added to
the fighters in use. Originally they were going to survey aircraft returning
with battle damage to see where the battle damage was concentrated--the armor
was to be added to those areas. However, an older analyst pointed out that the
armor should be added where there was no battle damage--planes receiving damage
in those areas were not returning.

&gt;In RISKS 13.05 Romain Kroes, Secretary General of SPAC is quoted as saying
&gt;"...it has been clear to us that the crews were caught out by cockpit layout"
&gt;
&gt;     Surely this statement implies that there is a problem with training
&gt;rather than the software or the crew

Not necessarily.  Especially in stressful environments, a poorly-designed
cockpit layout can be a disaster waiting to happen.

An aviation example on a smaller scale is the control panel layout of the
flight instruments.  For years there was no standardization of what 
instrument went where, neither between manufacturers or even between 
models.  Only after studies showed that there was a quite significant
safety advantage did the designers agree to the "basic" formation:

    airspeed           artificial        altimeter 
    indicator           horizon

    turn-and-             gyro         vertical speed
  bank indicator         compass         indicator

Prior to the standardization these instruments could be almost anywhere in
the cockpit.  (Of course, we now have the interesting problem of trying to
figure out how to best present the information on integrated displays in
an EFIS (Electronic Flight Information System) environment.)

Another example of poor cockpit design was the way that Beech Aircraft
moved cockpit controls around in different years in some of its airplanes.
In some years the Beech Bonanza airplane put the control for the wing
flaps (which are to be retracted after landing) on the left side of the
cockpit and the gear retraction switch on the right; in other years the
positions were reversed...with the obvious problem of pilots retracting
the landing gear while on the ground.  Beech also had a disconcerting 
habit of not following common industry practice in the order of the
engine controls: where most designers put the controls on the panel
in left-to-right sequence of throttle/prop/mixture, some Beech products
used throttle/mixture/prop.

My point is that while training can teach a pilot about the particular
idiosyncrasies (or idiotsyncrasies) of a particular airplane, a design which is
nonstandard and/or unintuitive and/or misleading can be the trigger for
failures which are eventually blamed on "pilot error".

This does have a direct significance to the normal subject matter of the
RISKS-FORUM: the design of user interfaces in software systems.  In fact, it's
almost exactly the same issue: poorly-designed, or nonstandard, or "slightly"
different interfaces between programs which perform similar functions are one
of the reasons for many of the problems we have in this industry.

A couple of comments about topics related to the A320 crash:

Potential of the FAA banning or restricting the A320 for nontechnical reasons
(i.e. politics or advantage to US aircraft manufacturers): I think this is
unlikely for at least two reasons.  First, at least one major US airline
(Northwest) has a significant A320 fleet.  There may be others.  If anything,
the FAA is more beholden to US airlines than it is to US aircraft
manufacturers.  Second, the FAA is has an excellent reputation in safety
matters to consider/defend.  Aviation authorities in many other countries look
to the FAA on aircraft safety matters, and routinely implement FAA safety
directives.  Issuing an unjustified safety directive with significant impact
would do major damage to the FAA's status, influence, reputation, etc.

2-man crew (vs. 3-man) as a major factor.  Highly unlikely.  Virtually all
recently manufactured aircraft (newer 737's, 757's, 767's, 747-400's, MD-80,
MD-11, ... [hope this list is correct]) have two man crews.  None of them have
the crash record of the A320.

On the other hand, I wonder if we're looking at the wrong statistics.  Fatal
aircraft crashes are so few and far between that it's hard (statistically) to
draw reliable inferences from such spotty data.  I'd be much more comfortable
looking at data that included significant failures that could have caused the
aircraft to crash (but the plane didn't due to skill of the crew, luck, etc.).
I'm sure the FAA keeps such numbers, but of course they're not newsworthy
because nobody died, and there aren't any good pictures ...

         Joel Upchurch suggests 3 man aircrews will be safer than 2 man crews.
         Studies have shown 1 man police squad cars are safer than 2 man squad
cars.  Nevertheless police feel safer in 2 man cars (which may be part of the
problem).  I suspect something similar may be true of aircrews.

Communication between Air Traffic Control and Pilots is currently verbal and in
English (as a `Universal' language).

An item in a recent BBC radio program mentioned work on a possible replacement.
They played back a recording of a dialogue where neither participant had
English as a first language as a demonstration of misunderstandings that
happen.  The cure was to be a means of transmitting coded messages, presumably
displayed in the pilot's native language, and presumably vice-versa.  The
interviewer asked `why not have the commands transmitted directly to the
plane?', and was reassured that the pilot would have ultimate control.

However  nothing was said  about:

  Error checking, natural language is redundant, but coded messages may not be.

  What happens if the message to be sent was not anticipated by the system
  designer (Elephant on runway ?).

  How the message was displayed: Headup display, voice, or another console
  display

There has been an instructive little flurry about hacking in the British press.
 
It starts with Police Review, 17 January 1992: A columnist, C H Rolph, writes:
"Did you know that there are hackers (i.e., people who make a hobby out of
studying and programming other people's computers, or who get unauthorised
access to computer systems by telephone) making a good living out of `cleaning
up' people's driving licences. A wealthy man with an endorsed licence will pay
a lot to have his file beautified at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre at
Swansea. I'm told that for 100 pounds a point, it is possible to get an
endorsement completely erased, and then apply for and get an unblemished
licence. Or was, until fairly recently."
 
The Times took up this "revelation" and, on 20 January, reported that "an
investigation is under way after claims that computer hackers are wiping
motorists' penalty points from the DVLC computer in Swansea. The hackers are
charging 100 pounds for each penalty point, according to the Police Review".
 
On 31 January, C H Rolph returned to the affair. He referred to the Times story
and said "I didn't quite say that. I said there were allegations that this *had
been* going on. And it turns about that there had certainly been attempts. The
Driver and Vehicle Licencing Centre at Swansea tells me that the story first
appeared in the *Sun* in 1986, and that it was at once jointly investigated and
refuted by the DVLA and Scotland Yard ... "
 
Looks like pretty bad behaviour by C H Rolph (a former senior police officer,
by the way). His original story seems to have had no foundation whatsoever (the
*Sun* is not a serious newspaper), but he is trying to wriggle out of accepting
fault. And the Times doesn't come out of it well, either. Doesn't *anyone*
check out hacking stories, or do journalists prefer urban myth. (I write as a
journ.)
         [This sounds as if an old tale had been warmed over.  See <A HREF="/Risks/2.38.html">RISKS-2.38</A>,
         8 April 1986, for Brian Randell's contributed item on the alleged DVLC
         hacking activities.  (See also Software Engineering Notes, vol 11, no
         2, April 1986, page 4.  [The reference is WRONG in the RISKS INDEX,
         which appears once again in the January 1992 issue of SEN, pp. 23-32.

Reading the January 1992 `Inside Risks' column in the CACM reminded me of what
seems a very relevant article in "The Australian Computer Journal", Vol. 22 No.
1 (February, 1990) pp. 11-20 [published by the Australian Computer Society
(ACS)]: 'Implications of the tax file number legislation for computer
professionals'.  After years of public resistance against anything like a
Social Security Number, the Australian Government finally opted for a 'tax file
number.'  Although organisations such as employers and banks are expected to
collect this number so that it can be included when submitting information to
the federal tax authorities, there are also VERY strong legislative safeguards:

-   It can ONLY be used for tax-related functions.
-   It must NOT be disclosed to anyone who does not need, nor revealed if
    not immediately relevant.
-   It may NOT be used as a national identification scheme nor for building
    up a database on individuals nor for matching personal information.

After discussing the meaning and implications of the legislation, the article
touches on implementation issues (access control, personnel screening,
communications and operating system security, and professional responsibility)
that relate to the securing of the number.  It discusses in some detail the
choices of including the tax file number in a file/table with other personal
information versus isolating it in a separate file/table.  Interestingly, the
article opens by noting that the legislation is based on privacy principals
espoused by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
It might be interesting to know what they are exactly ...  If you would like a
copy of the article and are unable to get it from anywhere else, I would be
glad to send a copy if you can provide an address.  Regards ... BJ

Last week I received an erroneous form 1099-G from the state of Indiana.  The
form erroneously claimed that I had received a large tax refund from the state.
A call to the local state revenue office revealed that a faulty computer
algorithm had created the problem. Apparently, if you claimed a tax refund or
received a tax deduction, and also filed an estimated tax payment for the first
quarter in 1991, the algorithm &gt;added&lt; the two numbers together rather than
subtracting one from the other.

In my case, the error was compounded by a combination of a misplaced decimal
point and adding the numbers together. The tax rate for Indiana is 0.034. Thus
if you have a $1,000 tax deduction, it reduces your tax liability by $34. The
statement that I received had apparently used 0.34 as the tax rate and added
this to the amount owed and estimated taxes.

The person at the state revenue office said one million people were affected by
the error. But I'm not certain if it's that large. At any rate, don't people
bother to check their software for mistakes before doing a mass mailing? The
last time I received an erroneous 1099 form, I underwent three audits for three
years in a row before the IRS finally recognized the error.

[ Unfortunately I don't have a citable source for this as I no longer live
  in the UK and so I rely on BBC Radio for this news. ]

Local taxes in the UK were changed a couple of years ago from a system known as
the "Rates", which was based on property values, to a system called the
"Community Charge" (by the Government; most people call it the "Poll Tax")
which is based on the number of adults living at an address. Many people
consider the new system unfair, and a campaigning movement has been set up to
fight against it.

One of the principal attacks has been simply refusing to pay the demands.
Local councils have therefore taken defaulters to court to request orders for
payment. However, the magistrates' courts which should deal with such cases are
refusing to hear them, on the grounds that computer output is hearsay and
therefore not acceptable as evidence.

[ Curiously, in the main criminal courts, computer evidence is acceptable as a
result of specific legislation, but this legislation does not apply to the
lower courts. The government has promised to end this anomaly. ]

My understanding is that if a warranty is not provided, the implied warranty
gives the buyer quite a bit of protection.  Manufacturers supply `limited'
warranties for the very reason of saying how far they are willing to go, and
for how long, to remedy a problem with their product.

An implied warranty, as I understand it, usually says something to the effect
that the thing is supposed to perform as advertised or specified in
instructions that come with it, basically forever.

So, if the manufacturer doesn't supply a warranty, the product had better be
good.

Mark Thorson (mmm@cup.portal.com) responded to a posting by
"Kai-Mikael J\d\d-Aro" &lt;kai@nada.kth.se&gt; in RISKS DIGEST 13.05:

&gt;Tools will always be pushed to their limit, because the limit is actually in
&gt;the programmer and it is the fundamental nature of programmers ...

&gt;Will Kai-Mikael J\d\d-Aro find himself next year creating state diagrams
&gt;with the complexity of a street map of Stockholm ... ?
&gt;This might open a whole new range of computer applications ... but there
&gt;is no reason to believe these systems will be more reliable than the
&gt;smaller systems built before the tool was developed.

We have 2 different classes of tools here, very different. As Mark said,
the shift to (more) automatic programming simply abstracts away certain
technical details in software development. This makes bigger problems 
easier to tackle, but that's not the essential value of formal methods.

I remember Kai-Mikael saying that his workbench provided tests of various state
machine properties; this goes far beyond the rudimentary correctness tests a
compiler might apply (eg type consistency). Thus, the formal methods _do_ give
us more reason to believe in the system's correctness.

If the tool in question simply provides a graphic representation for some
network (streets, whatever) then it isn't contributing much to increased
software reliability. After all, the network's correctness would still depend
on whether the coder sees any errors in it when it is created and manually
reviewed.

Serious dangers in the Caltrans AVI spec [URGENT for Californians]

</i><PRE>

I just received the latest revisions to the State of California's proposed spec
for automatic vehicle identification (AVI) equipment.  This is the box that the
state envisages attaching to your car that broadcasts your car's vehicle
identification number (VIN) when pinged by a roadsite transmitter.  The spec is
being developed on the instructions of the state legislature, which is
considering automated systems for collecting tolls.  The spec has been through
a number of revisions.  The latest, dated 17 January 1992, is considerably
different from the others.  It is an irritating document because so little is
explained about how toll collection would actually work, and in particular
whether it would be necessary for every car on the road to have one of these
transmitters.  Many of the new revisions are highly technical in nature, but
some RISKS-relevant trends are clear.

First and most obviously, the proposal no longer contains any language at 
all about privacy or about encryption.  Previous drafts had specified the use
of DES, but this is gone.  In the former sentence "The initial data records
are designed for voluntary implementations of automatic toll collection, 
where security and anonymity are not overriding concerns.", the phrase "where 
... concerns." has now been struck (section 1702.1).  Whereas the former 
document had provided both encrypted and unencrypted versions of the "reader
communications protocol" (section 1704.5), the encrypted version is now gone.

But this seems to be a symptom of a much deeper change in the purpose of 
this whole spec.  Caltrans (the state Dept of Transportation) has generalized
the proposal; the "AVI" equipment is no longer specifically aimed at toll
collection but is now intended to support a much wider range of applications.
For example, in section 1701 "Definition[s]", the term "Transponders" has been
changed from "Electronic devices attached to a vehicle and contain information
which can be communicated to the reader."  to "Electronic devices that contain
information which can be communicated to the reader."  New text in section
1702.1, "Objectives", reads "It is further envisioned that more complex data
records will be developed to handle anonymous transactions, secure funds
transfers, information transfers, and other transactions between the Reader
and the Transponder that will be defined as needed."  Caltrans will authorize
new record types, but "shall pass this responsibility to an appropriate
standards setting organization when one is established and recognized."

It seems to me that this is a serious situation, for two reasons.  The first
reason is narrow and clear: the state is about to receive an AVI spec that
calls for an unencrypted protocol for toll-collection purposes.  This is a
serious matter in any case, but just how serious depends on whether it will 
be compulsory to attach one of these boxes to your car.  I cannot understand
how automatic toll collection could work unless every car has a transponder.
(Maybe there's a box that can "see" a car going by, like the European boxes
that issue speeding tickets automatically, and then determine whether any 
of those cars failed to transmit their VIN's?  Even this is a scary enough
thought.)  The spec certainly reflects no effort to develop a proposal
that would not require cars to transmit their VIN's, say through public-key
encryption or the anonymous purchase of a transponder that gets decremented
like a phone-card.

The broader and murkier reason for worry is that the state is envisioning a
bureaucratic mechanism for the multiplying applications of automatic tracking
mechanisms.  The spec is actually broad enough, in principle anyway, to
encompass certain kinds of anonymous schemes (as section 1702.1, quoted above,
mentions), but the proposal reflects no analysis of the specific technical
requirements of anonymous schemes.  In effect, all of the hard social issues
have been pushed down the line, to the committee that will authorize new uses
of these boxes.  Once the boxes exist and are in wide use, though, that will
be a whole new ball game.  We ought to stop now and think.  Do we want to set
up a bureaucratic mechanism that can turn out automatic tracking schemes on 
an assembly-line basis, hoping that we can hold the line on privacy and other
civil liberties by keeping careful enough track of this process?

Or should we take some action -- for example, writing letters to the Pete
Wilson, the state legislature, and Caltrans -- to get this entire process to
be suspended long enough for a proper public debate?  I vote for the latter.
The official address for public commentary is as follows ("All written
comments received by February 6, 1992, which pertain to the indicated changes
will be reviewed and responded to by the Department as part of the compilation
of the rule-making file."):

   Les Kubel, Chief
   Office of Electrical and Electronics Engineering
   Department of New Technology, Materials and Research
   PO Box 19128
   Sacramento, California  95819-0128

More importantly, we need to publicize the issue, so that Californians -- and
others who live in jurisdictions that might adopt the California proposal as a
model -- can make an informed choice.

Dr. Demento collects the weirder songs for his nationally syndicated show --
he's one of the best reasons to own a radio.  Last week's program featured The
Ballad of Silicon Slim, a country &amp; western song by John Forster.

It's about a rootin-tootin, home computin' guy who breaks into Chase Manhattan
Bank and snags a penny from everyone's account.  This salami-slicing thief 
makes millions, gets caught, tossed in jail, but is popped out by a computer.

It's a song praising the thief as being democratic (stealing equally from
everyone), and carries several dubious stereotypes (the best programmers break
into computers, outsiders are the biggest threat to banking systems, 
skimming of bank accounts won't be noticed).

A ballad about a computing thief.  Had to happen sometime!

-Cliff Stoll     stoll@ocf.berkeley.edu


A few excerpts 
(without permission of copyright holder; I'm trying to reach him)

In the dead of night he'd access each depositor's account
And from each of them he'd siphon off the teeniest amount.
And since no one ever noticed that there'd even been a crime
He stole forty million dollars -- a penny at a time!

Little Janet was only eight but she had her own account
And the seven dollars in it was to her a huge amount.
So the day that penny vanished one unhappy little tot
Screamed, "Hey, what happened to my penny?"
And the teller tried to tell her but could not.

Is your whole year's withholding getting to the government?
Have you figured out your FICA to the hundredth of a cent?
Though the average Joe don't even know how much his FICA was
Out there, somewhere, there's a software packin' buckeroo who does!

If you were one of the 1.1 million people who filed a 1991 tax return
electronically between 10Jan1992 and 27Jan1992, you may have gotten a
notification that a refund was forthcoming even if one was not.  Apparently
during that period the IRS computer program ignored all back-tax debts, which
would otherwise have offset the refunds.  Relying on the refund notification,
lenders have been making loans that were (supposedly) secured by the expected
refunds.  No one knows yet how many such unsecure loans were actually granted.

This is a revision of an earlier posting carrying the same title.  Any
inaccuracies are my own responsibility.

According to Dutch TV and newspaper reports, the Amsterdam police have arrested
two computer crackers and seized their equipment.  A press conference was held
on Friday 31st.  The two made a full confession.

The reports state that over the past four months, R.J.N., age 25, computing
science engineer, and H.W., age 21, c.s. student, installed so-called Trojan
horses on a computer system of the Amsterdam Free University, and used that
same system to break into computer systems in the US, Canada, and several
European countries.  According to a Dutch police spokesman, the two had no
intention to damage or to steal information, but were doing it `just for
kicks'.

Dutch law on computer crime is still in preparation. Apparently, the charges
are based on existing law: falsification (corrupting systems files in order to
get privileges), destruction of property (rendering a computer system
unusable), and fraud (using stolen passwords).

Both fidelio and wave were students at my faculty, so I know them personally.
The sad thing is, had the police been ready for this type of action a year
earlier, they would probably still be free.

"Sabotage fails - Virus in Power Plant Program for the Lithuanian Atomic Power
Plant in Ignalina vaccinated

Vilna/Moscow (dpa)

This past weekend an act of sabotage against the computer system for the atomic
power plant in Ignalina failed. A worker in the computer center of the plant
tried on Thursday to plant a virus in a program in the non-nuclear part of the
reactor, in order to cause disruption.

dpa learned on Saturday from Vilna that the man probably wanted to get money
from the reactor managers for repairing the damage he himself causes. The plant
engineers managed, however, to repair the damage themselves in a very short
time, according to information from the news agency ITAR-TASS, which is based
on information from the government press office in Lithuania. A warrant for the
arrest of the sabotager has been issued, and officials state that he will be
prosecuted.

The shutdown of one of the two reactors since Thursday has nothing whatsoever
to do with the attempted sabotage, said the deputy Lithuanian energy minister,
Saulus Kutas.  ["Wer das glaubt, wird seelig."   LOOSELY TRANSLATED AS "If you
believe that, you'll believe anything." dww]

[And goes on to explain about the tiny leak in the cooling system and how the
water is not radioactive, and there are no problems, and a team of Swedish
specialists looked at the reactor and found no big problems, but they do have a
list of 20 little things they want to look at, and the Swedish government is
going to pay for it all.]"

While having dinner I overheard two automobile mechanics discussing a problem
one had with one of the fancy automotive diagnostic systems. Apparently, any
attempt to 'take a measurement' caused a catastrophic failure in the system
(i.e., it 'crashed'). The cause was attributed to a `virus'. While to a
computing professional such rationale appears ludicrous, it is quite a logical
conclusion for the layperson.

From a UPI press release:

The Supreme Court's decree topped a roller-coaster day for refugees waiting to
learn their fate. Earlier Friday, the clerk's office of the 11th Circuit issued
an order allowing the government to send the refugees back to Haiti. But 4 1/2
hours later, it said that order had been made by mistake.  ``It was a clerical
error,'' said Joyce Larkin, deputy clerk.  ``The order was erroneously issued.
The motion filed by the government to stay the injunctive order issued by Judge
Atkins remains pending before this court.'' Kembra Smith, motions attorney for
the 11th Circuit, said a facsimile message between judges apparently was sent
by mistake to the clerk's office, and the erroneous order was then issued.  ``I
think we got an erroneous fax today, directed between the judges.  It should
not have come here -- it should not have been released,'' Smith said.  She said
there had been no final decision by the court, and that it should not be
assumed that the court necessarily will issue an order similar to the one
issued in error.  ``They (the clerk's office) received a number of documents
after the office received that (erroneous fax),'' she said. ``A decision is
probably in the near future.  But there's no way to know that. Any time period
is totally speculative on my part.'' Smith said the mistake was unusual -- and
highly embarrassing to the court because of the magnitude of the case.  ``We're
aware that it's fairly outrageous,'' she said. ``Hopefully, this will never
happen again. Oh my God, especially in a case like this.''

  [I can only add that had this been a last-day death penalty case, the error
  could have caused an unjust killing -- 4.5 hours is a long enough delay, and
  in a case involving less people, the delay may have been much greater.  CJ]

There's been a fair amount of writing lately that the "real world" needs
protection against loss of integrity, not loss of confidentiality.  I'm not
sure it even cares about that.  Last week I learned something about how
Hennepin County (where Minneapolis is located) handles important documents that
sort of bothers me.

I needed to get a certified copy of a power of attorney that we had filed with
the county's title registry a couple of years ago.  I walked into a 30' x 30'
room that had a clerk, a copying machine, a half dozen microfilm
readers/printers and maybe half the room filled with racks of microfilm.  A
quite visible sign at the entrance said something like "please have the clerk
retrieve printed documents; microfilm is self-service." Several lawyer-looking
people appeared in fact to have done that -- they were sitting in front of the
viewers just like one does at a public library.  Not wanting to wade through
the film I just gave the clerk the document number.  She went over to the
appropriate rack, got the film, and made a print of what I had asked for, which
she then duly certified with the date and embossed county seal as being a true
and accurate copy of the original that had been filed on such and such a date.

All true scam artists and system penetrators by now ought to be asking
themselves the question that came to my mind as I drove home.  After having
done a little reconnaissance to find out what kind of film was used, what would
have prevented me from going to view a film, pretend to re-file it, but
actually slip it in my pocket and remove it?  (I saw no signs of any alarms
like they have in stores.)  I could then take it to a lab and temporarily or
permanently replace any image of a document with the image of one I had forged
up on a laser printer.  I'd return, put it back in the files, and then ask for
a certified copy of the forged image.  (I'd pick either a very recent document
or a very old one so the chances of the film's being missed while it was being
doctored would be slight.)  I would think that if one could forge a
legally-certified power of attorney giving himself power over, say, the affairs
of the president of 3M, or perhaps, the deed to a downtown office building one
could make a lot of mischief and probably a lot of money.  (You'd have to be
careful, but the possibilities are, as they say, intriguing.)

(Two additional points to note: nowhere was I asked for identification,
although I did have to sign for the certified copy.  Also, the registrar does
NOT keep any originals -- all they have are the microfilm copies; we didn't
have the original of what I needed because that had in fact to be deposited at
a different state office.)

I'd like to draw RISKS readers' attention to Daniel P Siewiorek's recent survey
of fault tolerant computer design:

   Daniel P Siewiorek, Architecture of Fault-Tolerant Computers: An
   Historical Perspective, Proceedings of the IEEE 79, 12 (Dec 1991), 1710-1734

Siewiorek proposes a 3D design space and classifies two dozen well known
systems ranging from the Univac I to the Galileo mission.  There's a wealth of
juicy tidbits with a broad historical perspective.  For example, I didn't know
that the Univac I contained more error detection circuitry than most
contemporary microprocessors -- the circuitry was essential because they
couldn't simulate the machine in advance!

Although I highly recommend the survey, I have two reservations.  First,
publication delays have dated it a bit -- e.g. surely the new CM-5 deserves a
place in Siewiorek's pantheon.  Also, there's a frustrating lack of coverage of
software fault tolerance, despite hints scattered throughout that software is a
big problem area.  Perhaps we'll have to wait for the book.

&gt; [direct message transmission from ATC to aircraft]
&gt;  How the message was displayed: Headup display, voice, or another console
&gt;  display

There was a piece in a recent Aviation Week (Jan 6, I think) on NASA
experiments with a digital data-transmission system.  The pilots who tried it
generally liked it, with reservations.  They wanted to see voice used during
high-workload times like landing approaches, because they didn't want to have
their heads down inside the cockpit reading a screen at such times.  For
communication at less busy times, though, they liked it a lot.  Messages
generally did not need repeating, which was needed for a significant fraction
of voice messages.  There was less room for misunderstanding, and more time to
think about complex messages.  Being able to scroll back and look at earlier
messages was something they liked very much.  They particularly liked digital
transmission and scrolling back to earlier messages for weather data, since
this gave them some sense of how weather was changing.

The Omaha World Herald reported that one problem with this level of calls is
that quite a number of them went to an 800 number in Minnesota either by
accident or because of other circumstances. The company in Minnesota is asking
(unsuccessfully) for CBS to repay them for the several thousand phone calls
that they received by accident, and is claiming that at least in some areas the
phone number shown on the TV special was their 800 number and not the one for
Call Interactive. CBS has decided that it should not have to pay for anyone
dialing a wrong number (good point) and denies that the number shown on
television was ever the incorrect one.

Subject: Re: Confusing Telephone System Overload Message

... The owner of the store had been watching the SotU address and recognized
his 1-800 number as the one CBS gave.  He raced to the store only to find that
his answering machine tape was filled to capacity (approx 50 msgs).  He said
some of the messages were pleasant, but others contained language unfit to
print, apparently from frustrated viewers?  He estimated the calls had cost him
several hundred dollars in lost business. (No mention of any plans to sue CBS
for compensation. :)

CBS also had some comments but I don't recall what those were; typical
apologies for the screw-up and disbelief that it could occur come to mind,
though.  I don't recall any explanation being given for the screw-up.

In light of this article, I wonder how accurate CBS's numbers are:

&gt; Shortly afterward, with the display showing about 125,000 calls
&gt; processed, Dan Rather reported on the air that AT&amp;T was estimating there 
&gt; had been about 7,000,000 call attempts!  Obviously their throughput was 
&gt; a little below the capacity requirements...

I can't seem to come up with an especially pithy RISK but perhaps our
moderator can.  To me, it seems either to be one of not very thorough
testing of the system (I mean, c'mon, couldn't someone have _dialed_ the
number before showing it to the entire nation) or perhaps a typical
transcription error, though as I said I don't recall any mention in the
article.

A less obvious risk - although any phone-in survey is less than scientific, the
low call completion rate (1 in 70) could further bias the results. Consider
that the probability of success is probably strongly correlated with various
factors such as geographic location (e.g. due to blocking systems that allow
equal numbers of calls from areas with non-equal populations), population
density (rural/urban/suburban), or ownership of a repeat-dial phone.

With an extremely high call-blocking probability, it is easy to imagine that
these factors could result in a given population sub-group (e.g. residents of
New Hampshire and Maine*) being under- or over-represented in the sample by a
factor of two or more.
				Peter Desnoyers

* I especially find it hard to believe that no residents of New Hampshire - who
are supposed to live and breathe politics every 4 years, with a 70%
presidential primary turnout - would have gotten through in the first few
minutes if the blocking probability was uniform.

&gt;... However, the magistrates' courts which should deal with such cases are
&gt;refusing to hear them, on the grounds that computer output is hearsay and
&gt;therefore not acceptable as evidence.

It is a little more complex than this. The law regarding summoning non-payers
requires that the Council send a bill (of course) and a reminder before any
court action is possible. The computer evidence problem surrounds this. In the
UK proof of posting in the Royal Mail is _legally equivalent to proof of
delivery_ (a precedent was set in Victorian times - they had a better postal
service then*). Reams of computer printout are used to prove that bills and
reminders have been sent, but all RISKS readers know that just because a
computer prints out that a letter has been sent is no proof that is has. There
have been a lot of software errors with Poll Tax systems (See RISKS passim) and
I suspect that the Magistrates are so annoyed at having to deal with so many
computer errors that they threw the cases out, which has now set a legal
precedent.

Now, the Government has changed the law for the Poll Tax making computer
evidence legal. There are worrying aspects to making computer evidence legal: 
does the Plaintiff have to prove that the computer system is accurate? Or is 
it up to the Defendant to prove that it is full of errors? Will the accuracy 
of computer evidence ever be questioned? This problem will open up a whole
can of worms in the English legal system, and I bet we will see
non-computerate ill-advised legislators making sweeping changes which will
create more problems than they solve. Sounds like a case for the EFF?

&gt; [ Unfortunately I don't have a citable source for this as I no longer live
&gt;   in the UK and so I rely on BBC Radio for this news. ]

I had been surprised that no-one else had posted about this matter, and had dug
out old newspapers: there were articles in `The Guardian' on Jan 16 and 17.

&gt; [ Curiously, in the main criminal courts, computer evidence is acceptable as a
&gt; result of specific legislation, but this legislation does not apply to the
&gt; lower courts. The government has promised to end this anomaly. ]

Actually, the case is a _civil_ one (presumably because the government never
believed that the non-payment campaign would get off the ground).  The specific
legislation that Kevin talks about applies to Crown Courts and up for civil
cases (I don't know what the rules are about criminal cases).

If there were only small numbers of defaulters, the ruling would presumably not
be a problem: a council officer could attend the court for the (trivial) time
it takes a magistrate to make an order.  In fact, there were (until the ruling)
hundreds of defaulters being dealt with in every court.  All of this legal
activity (and interest charges on loans to cover uncollected tax) is adding
massively to the costs of administering local government.  The (Labour Party)
opposition has claimed that, on average, Poll Tax bills will go up by 50% in
the coming financial year.

The government's promise to end the anomaly has not taken the form of `rushing
legislation through'; the councils have complained that their collection
strategy is in a shambles until the new legislation is passed.

	Jerry Hollombe questions the trend to selling things without
warranties.  Does not the commercial code require that all things offered for
sale be merchantable, unless the sellor limit this merchantability in some
explicit way?  That a program called Taxamatic-91 can be expected to compute my
1991 taxes correctly as long as I answer its questions correctly?  That the
sole purpose of a warranty is to limit the sellor's liability, and if there is
no warranty, there is no limit.  Therefore, if it is called Taxamatic, with no
91, and there is no mention of the year in the instructions, I have grounds for
suit if it doesn't work correctly for my 92 taxes, and my 93 taxes, etc..

	How can lack of a warranty be worse than one that says, more or less,

   Under the Uniform Commercial Code, there are implied warranties, but they
are much more limited than you suggest.

   The basic implied warrenty is that of "merchantability" [UCC 2-314];
that is, the product is good enough to: 

  - pass without objection in the trade under the contract description; and

  - in the case of fungible goods, are of fair average quality; and

  - are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used; and

  - run, within any agreed variations, of even kind, quality and quantity 
    within each unit and among all units involved; and

  - are adequately contained, packaged and labelled as the agreement may 
    require; and

  - conform to the promises or affirmations of fact made on the container 
    or label if any.

    There is also an "implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose"
when the merchant selects the product for the buyer based on a description of
the intended purpose, and the buyer relys on the seller's skill and judgement.
[UCC 2-315]

    Neither of these warranties are perpetual; rather, they describe the
condition the product is expected to be in when delivered to the buyer.  The
buyer has four years from the date of delivery to file a claim against the
seller, regardless of when s/he becomes aware of the defect. [UCC 2-725]

Subject: Dutch Hackers in Jail

                      DUTCH POLICE ARRESTS HACKERS

The facts

At 10.30 in the morning of monday the 27th of January 1992 Dutch police
searched the homes of two hackers. In the city of Roermond, the parental home
of the 21-year old student H.W. was searched and in Nuenen the same happened to
the parental home of R.N., a Computer Science engineer, age 25.  Both were
arrested and taken into custody. At both sites, members of the Amsterdam Police
Pilot Team for computer crime were present, alongside local police officers and
representatives of the national organisation CRI (Criminal Investigations
Agency). Both suspects were transported to Amsterdam. The brother of one of the
suspects was told the suspects could receive no visits or mail. All of this has
happened more than one week ago and the two are still in jail as we write this.


The charges

A break-in supposedly occurred at the bronto.geo.vu.nl site at the VU University
in Amsterdam. This UNIX system running on a SUN station (IP 130.37.64.3) has
been taken off the net at least for the duration of the investigation. What
happened to the actual hardware is unknown at this time.

The formal charges are: forgery, racketeering and vandalism. The police
justifies the forgery part by claiming that files on the system have been
changed. The vandalism charge is valid because the system had to be taken off
the net for a period of time to investigate the extent of the damage.  By
pretending to be regular users or even system management the hackers committed
racketeering, the police says.

Both suspects, according to the Dutch police, have made a full statement.
According to a police spokesman the motive was "fanatical hobbyism".
Spokesperson Slort for the CRI speaks of the "kick of seeing how far you can
get".


`Damages'

According to J. Renkema, head of the geo-physics faculty at the VU, the
university is considering filing a civil lawsuit against the suspects.  "The
system was contaminated because of their doing and had to be cleaned out. This
cost months of labour and 50.000 guilders (about US$ 30,000).  Registered users
pay for access to the system and these hackers did not.  Result: tens of
thousands of guilders in damages." Renkema also speaks of a `moral
disadvantage': The university lost trust from other sites on the network.
Renkema claims the university runs the risk of being expelled from some
networks.

Renkema also claims the hackers were discovered almost immediately after the
break-in and were monitored at all times. This means all the damages had
occurred under the watchful eyes of the supervisors. All this time, no action
was taken to kick the hackers off the system. According to Renkema all systems
at the VU were protected according to guidelines as laid down by CERT and
SurfNet BV (SurfNet is the company that runs most of the inter-university
data-traffic in The Netherlands).


What really happened?

The charge of `adapting system-software' could mean that the hackers installed
back-doors to secure access to the system or to the root level, even if
passwords were changed. New versions of telnet, ftp, rlogin and other programs
could have been compiled to log access to the networks.

What really happened is anybody's guess. One point is that even the CRI
acknowledges that there were no `bad' intentions on the part of the hackers.
They were there to look around and play with the networks.


About hacking in general

In the past we have warned that new laws against computer crime can only be
used against hackers which are harmless. Against the real computer criminals a
law is useless because they will probably remain untraceable.  The CRI
regularly goes on the record to say that hackers are not the top priority in
computer crime investigation. It seems that hackers are an easy target when
`something has to be done'.

And `something had to be done': The pressure from especially the U.S. to do
something about the `hacking problem' was so huge that it would have been
almost humiliating for the Dutch not to respond. It seems as if the arrests
are mainly meant to ease the American fear of the overseas hacker-paradise.


A closer look at the charges and damages

The VU has launched the idea that system security on their system was only
needed because of these two hackers. All costs made in relation to system
security are billed to the two people that just happened to get in. For people
that like to see hacking in terms of analogies: It is like walking into a
building full of students, fooling around and then getting the bill for the new
alarm-system that they had to install just for you.

Systems security is a normal part of the daily task of every system
administrator. Not just because the system has to be protected from break-ins
from the outside, but also because the users themselves need to be protected
from each other. The `bronto' management has neglected some of their duties,
and now they still have to secure their system. This is not damages done, it's
work long overdue.

If restoring back-ups costs tens of thousands of guilders, something is
terribly wrong at the VU. Every system manager that uses a legal copy of the
operating system has a distribution version within easy reach.

`Month of tedious labour following the hackers around in the system'. It would
have been much easier and cheaper to deny the hackers access to the system
directly after they had been discovered.  `Moral damages' by break-ins in other
systems would have been small. The VU chose to call the police and trace the
hackers. The costs of such an operation cannot be billed to the hackers.

Using forgery and racketeering makes one wonder if the OvJ (the District
Attorney here) can come up with a better motive than `they did it for kicks'.
If there is no monetary or material gain involved, it is questionable at best
if these allegations will stand up in court.

As far as the vandalism goes: there have been numerous cases of system
management overreacting in a case like this. A well trained system-manager can
protect a system without making it inaccessible to normal users. Again: the
hackers have to pay for the apparent incompetence of system management.

This does not mean that having hackers on your system can not be a pain.  The
Internet is a public network and if you cannot protect a system, you should not
be on it. This is not just our statement, it is the written policy of many
networking organisations. One more metaphor: It's like installing a new
phone-switch that allows direct dial to all employees. If you get such a
system, you will need to tell your employees not to be overly loose-lipped to
strangers. It is not the callers fault if some people can be `hacked'. If you
tie a cord to the lock and hang it out the mail-slot, people will pull it. If
these people do damages, you should prosecute them, but not for the costs of
walking after them and doing your security right.


Consequences of a conviction

If these suspects are convicted, the VU makes a good chance of winning the
civil case. Furthermore, this case is of interest to all other hackers in
Holland. Their hobby is suddenly a crime and many hackers will cease to hack.
Others will go `underground', which is not beneficial to the positive
interaction between hackers and system management or the relative openness in
the Dutch computer security world.


Public systems

If you are not a student at some big university or work for a large
corporation, there is no real way for you to get on the Internet. As long as
there is no way for some people to connect to the net, there will be people
that hack their way in. Whether this is good or bad is besides the point. If
there is no freedom to explore, some hackers will become the criminals that
government wants them to be.

                 "Our system is perfectly secure !"

                        (and if you prove it's not,
                         we'll have you put in jail)

It's apparent that some people don't have a clear idea of how the A320's
automation is set up.  This has been a problem with net discussions for the
past couple of years, but it's not getting any better.  There have been
numerous comments attributing what are clearly flight management problems to
the electronic flight control system (FBW): given the notoriety of the A320
(and its FBW) in the academic community, it has been assumed that other
problems are unique to it.  Many are not.

Following is an attempt to explain what flight management on the A320 is, how
it differs from FBW, and how it compares to other airplanes (such as the 757).
Issues pertaining to the Strasbourg crash appear about 2/3 through. A glossary
for the (necessary) alphabet soup follows at the end.  Manufacturers each tend
to use their own proprietary jargon; in light of that, I've tried to keep the
discussion as generic as possible.

First, the physical concept of "autopilot" is obsolete on the A320.  Instead,
Airbus uses a "Flight Management and Guidance System" (FMGS).  A more generic
term for this is a flight management *system* (FMS).  Note the emphasis on
*system*.

An FMS is a way to accomplish four major goals:

        o  Control the flight path of an airplane, in four dimensions,
           from takeoff to landing.

        o  Make sure that this is done as profitably as possible.

        o  Provide high-level services to flight displays and other
           systems.

        o  Eliminate many of the "book-keeping" roles in the operations
           environment, traditionally performed by a flight engineer.

An FMS has many components, the most important of which are:

1.  A Flight Management Computer (FMC).  This does all the thinking.  It
derives data from many sources, such as air data computers.  On the A320, many
input services are partially integrated into the FMS proper.  An A320 has two
FMCs.

2.  Inertial Reference System (IRS) units.  These are what Inertial Navigation
Systems (INSs) have evolved into; when combined with an FMC, they lead to more
features, and are more reliable.  They provide position information to the FMC.
The FMC has the capability of automatically tuning in VORs and DMEs and
verifying the aircraft location, thus correcting for en route precession error
in the IRS.  There are three IRSs on the A320.

3.  A Control Data Unit (CDU).  This lets the pilot enter a variety of abstract
data, such as the flight number, what the intended route of flight is,
preferred cruising altitudes, navaids and fixes to use, etc.  The FMC is able
to relate all this to an internal database of airports and navaids, and provide
a number of convenient features.  Using this--as well as features which amount
to being a glorified performance calculator-- the pilot can sketch out a
relatively profitable trip.  There are normally two CDUs on the A320, one for
each pilot.

As the first of many asides, at least one recent poster has implied that the
FMS interface is similar to that of an INS, which it isn't.  The pilot
generally does not deal with lat/long numbers, so the potential for a KAL 007
sort of mismanagement is minimal: he deals with gate numbers and four-digit
ICAO mnemonics for the airport at hand (but mistakes are still quite common).
Some airlines have card readers that feed everything in automatically: the
pilot need only verify the flight plan.  This process, too, is different from
the INS.  The user does not normally view the navigation product of the FMS
through lat/long readouts on the CDU.  Instead, a navigation display shows a
plan view of aircraft position, in a variety of scales and formats.  The use of
the CDU is required when any changes to various types of abstract data are
made.

4.  A Flight Control Unit (FCU).  This is what confuses a lot of people.  The
FCU is where the autopilot interface used to be in older airplanes, such as the
747-200.  It looks a lot like it as well.  It is used for selecting short-term
features of the FMS, especially heading hold, altitude capture, rate of
descent, and autothrottle.  The FCU's similarity to an old-fashioned autopilot
interface is intentional, but, again, it's just an interface to the FMS.  This
concept is extended to other input devices in the cockpit.  The frequency
selectors on the radio panels, for instance, serve as user-friendly input
mechanisms for the FMS.


Autopilots (until the advent of FMSs) traditionally have been structured
around the pilot commanding short-term actions, which the autopilot then
faithfully executed.  This frees the pilot to adopt a more supervisory role: he
can deal with ATC, systems, track weather better, etc.  It is also generally
less fatiguing than hand-flying.  Airbus classifies traditional autopilot
management as "selected" control.

FMSs also provide such short-term capability (via the FCU).  But the FMS can
be set to meet all the waypoints and clearance altitudes *automatically*,
without any significant interaction needed from the pilots on the CDU or FCU.
Airbus classifies this as "managed" control.

In effect, with a properly set-up FMS, the pilot can plan a flight from takeoff
to landing.  After lining up the airplane on the runway, he can just turn loose
the FMS, which then flies the airplane, requiring minimal crew interaction.
The system can then take the airplane through a category III landing (700 feet
runway visual range).  Of course, air traffic control is rarely so obliging, so
en route modifications must be made to the stored flight plan.

This is all done with the presumption that the FMS will figure out and use the
absolutely cheapest way to fly the airplane.  Even a 1% waste of fuel can cost
an airline tens of millions of dollars a year.  The main problem with
"profitability" is that ATC is not geared to handle FMS-equipped airplanes, and
its actions soak up a lot of the "saved" money.  It is not clear whether this
situation will change in our lifetimes.

FMSs are here to stay: but the design of interfaces are a major point of
contention among many pilots.  Mention "automation," and they don't think EICAS
or FBW: they think FMS.  While many features have been added at the hardware
level in the last ten years, the CDU interface has changed hardly at all.  A
significant criticism--and the most persistent--is that, since any changes to
an airplane's clearance (the route of flight ATC has approved for it) require
changes to the internal flight plan, and since this requires use of the CDU,
thus leading to a heads-down posture, safety can be affected: the pilots are
not able to practice "see and avoid."  In addition, it requires a SIGNIFICANT
refocusing of one's attention and attitude, from flying the airplane, to
dealing with an unfriendly user interface.  It therefore helps put pilots even
further out of the loop.  This increases workload, but workload can increase
even more in terminal environments, where frequent changes to clearances are
common (a terminal environment is the airspace where aircraft are being routed
to or from a nearby airport).  Many airlines have restricted CDU use under
18,000'; still more under 10,000'.  In such cases, the airplane is flown with
the FCU, or, occasionally, even by hand (!).

Balanced against the CDU interface problem is the high degree of "situational
awareness" the overall system provides, when one isn't fiddling with the CDU.
The FMS provides a number of output services, including navigation
information:, the FMCs are the heart of navigation services.  One can therefore
look at one's navigation display, and see a graphic spatial representation of
heading, track (calculated path across the ground), nearby alternate airports,
where one will be when one completes a climb or descent, what VORs the airplane
is using, where the fixes are, etc.  This sort of thing is pretty popular with
pilots.  But the quality of the derived data products is dependent on the
quality of data in the system: thus, there's a tendency to try to keep as much
of the display "valid" as possible, which lends to excessive CDU interaction.

On the issue of "authority," it is important to note that the pilot must
explicitly requests FMS services.  The FMS is "on" all the time; but it only
*controls* the airplane when the pilot wants it.  Whether executing a stored
flight plan, or selecting short-term features, the PILOT holds the ultimate
authority over the operation of the system.  If, after the FMS is engaged, it
performs unsatisfactorily, the pilot can just "click it off" (disengage it).
There are at least three ways to accomplish this (a switch on the sidestick,
buttons on the FCU, or, as a very rare last resort, a circuit breaker).  After
disengagement, the pilot simply flies "manual" (although "manual" in the A320
is still filtered by numerous computers, and still an artificial construct).
The capacity to disconnect assumes the pilot is "in the loop," and is aware
that a problem (whatever its cause) exists, to the point of applying corrective
action in time.  Cockpit interruptions, heads-down postures (CDU interaction or
systems diagnostics), fatigue, or checklists can affect this capability.
Another factor is the WILLINGNESS to disconnect: a significant problem is that
pilots tend to wait too long before clicking off a system; they can become
over-dependent on automation.

It is unlikely that faults in FMS design could logically migrate to the FBW
computers, or vice versa, barring *possibly* a significant electrical system
failure.  There are elaborate safeguards to protect against completely
off-the-wall instructions, but a more insidious, higher-level (but erroneous)
command within parameters would simply be quietly executed by the receiving
system.  It is impossible, as one person recently suggested on sci.aeronautics,
for the *FBW* to "freeze" the airplane into some arbitrary navigation maneuver,
such as a holding pattern (that tale, repeated at least twice in the last
couple of years, is taking on the form of an Urban Legend).

The important point to note about all of this is that the FMS has NOTHING
WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH FLY-BY-WIRE.  It is at least a couple of levels "higher,"
from the systems integration perspective, than the FBW service.  FMSs are used
in virtually all modern airliners, such as the 757, 767, 737, MD-11, MD-80,
A310, A300-600, and, yes, the A320.  Pick an airliner manufactured since 1982,
and it'll probably have a cockpit designed around an FMS control concept,
regardless of whether it has glass displays, FBW, or both.

Of particular interest, recently, has been the A320 FMSs "vertical navigation"
functionality.  In what follows, "autopilot" should be regarded as a synonym
for "FCU," with the understanding that it's just a high-level interface to the
FMS, using a subset of FMS features, and can be "clicked off."

A few people have been saying things like "altitude can't be set on the
autopilot."  That is incorrect.  The A320's altitude selector is located on the
right side of the FCU.  Not only can the user set the altitude to fly, but can
also set the rate of climb that the airplane should fly at in order to achieve
it.  The latter can be achieved three ways:

1.  By pressing an "Expedite" button, located under the altitude-selector
window.  This will make the airplane reach the desired altitude as FAST as
possible, using either maximum climb attitude and climb thrust, or flight-idle
and maximum airspeed.

(With the following two modes, one can either select a capture altitude, or let
the airplane fly "free."  The distinguishing feature between the modes is a
simple push-button.)

2. By simply dialing a value into the vertical-speed selector.  For example, if
one wishes to fly 3000 feet per minute up, the user just dials in 3000 fpm.

3.  By flying a flight path angle (FPA).  This is an angle the airplane's
flight path will make with the ground.  The intended use of this feature is
rather obscure (other advanced aircraft do not support it), but apparently one
application is for use in conjunction with nonprecision approaches to airports.
A non-precision approach is one that does not include vertical guidance: the
airplane is vectored in a manner such that it reaches a "final approach fix"
pointed in the right direction relative to some sort of navigation aid, then
flies down to a minimum descent altitude.  It then flies toward the airport
until it sees it, and can land visually, or is compelled to try again (or
divert to an alternate).  An ILS, in comparison, provides vertical guidance
from the final approach fix down to the ground, even in very marginal
visibility.  A normal ILS (or visual) approach angle is 3.0 degrees; a
non-precision approach is too complex to categorize briefly.  The point has to
be made, though, that FPA is one of the strangest features in the A320: the
airspace system isn't really set up to let the pilots use it effectively.

On the A320, in a rather dubious interface, the FPA mode and vertical-speed
mode share the same selector.  The way vertical speed is set is to dial in a
TWO-digit number.  So 30 = 3000 feet per minute up; -30 = 3000 fpm down.  There
is no additional feedback--like a couple of extra zeroes-- to indicate one's
dialing in "3000."  The SAME selector, and the SAME indicator, are used to set
"flight path angle." So 30 would then equal a flight-path command of 3.0
degrees down.  The difference between the two modes, as said before, is the
push of a button, and an easy-to-overlook decimal point.  The A320 uses a
liquid-crystal display, with fixed numeric elements, to display all of the FCU
indicators.

So, say one wishes to fly a 3.0 degree flight path.  This is the normal slant
range between a "final approach fix" and an airport.  This would give one a
descent from 700 to 900 feet per minute, and the computer would automatically
adjust the aircraft's attitude to maintain a glide path, if the pilot lowers
flaps, commands a change in airspeed, etc.  But there's a clear potential for
disaster if this mode is *confused* with "vertical speed" mode.  How
significant is this?  If one is 3000' above the ground, and sets a 3.0 degree
flight path, one would contact with the ground in four minutes.  If one
accidentally engages vertical speed mode, instead, one will contact in sixty
seconds.  All this is a tad bit simplified, to relate it to normal
"straight-in" approach angles: the let-down portion of a non-precision approach
would require an even steeper angle (4.0 degrees), with similar consequences
should modes be confused.

I am interpreting union comments on the Strasbourg crash as suggesting this
type of mode confusion may have contributed to the crash.  In this case, the
FPA mode may have been used in response to an enroute descent air traffic
control clearance.  When the airplane crashed, it was descending at some 2300'
per second, according to one source.  The angle of descent between the two
transition points the airplane was cleared to fly was 2.28 degrees (from 9000'
to 5000', over 19 statute (?) miles).

Similar theories about the FPA mode abounded after the Bangalore crash, but
proved unfounded (instead, a more complex pattern of FMS mismanagement
emerged).  The British pilots' union, though, early on cited the poor interface
as one that needed to be improved, in a report dated July 1988, a few months
after the airplane was introduced into service:

    "4.2.  Glareshield Flight Control Unit.  Despite the LCD labelling
    on the FCU, and the FMA annunciation on the PFD, it is still
    possible for pilots to commence an approach in the wrong vertical
    mode, i.e., vertical speed rather than flight path angle.  Under
    pressure, the tendency is merely to look at the figures one is
    selecting, and the figures themselves look almost identical in both
    modes.  The selection of FPA merely adds a decimal point.  I have
    seen a non-precision approach commenced with the selection of
    3000 fpm instead of 3.0 and the result was quite exciting.  The FCU
    figures in FPA mode should be made to look quite different - e.g.
    the figure after the decimal point in small font."

An important point is that automatic control of the airplane can lead to a
mismanaged energy state, just as manual control can.  The FBW protections in
the A320 are designed to provide high-speed, loaded, and slow-speed
protections.  It does nothing to stop the pilot from managing the airplane in
such a manner that it gets dangerously close to an obstruction (the ground)
without enough energy--or even too much energy--to pull out of danger.  This is
what Airbus claimed happened with the crashes at Habsheim and Bangalore, with
the pilots flying manually and dealing with the FCU, respectively.  Airbus's
Bernard Ziegler's "black holes": energy states the airplane could not recover
from.

Airbus is faced with the contradictory problems of "protecting" against gross
incompetence (safety issues which IT defined as problems, and which its
marketing people ran away with), without being able to "protect" from the types
of mismanagement their own extreme, and unrealistic, protections appear to
engender.  Far from changing its interface, it long ago froze it, for use in
its newest aircraft, the A330 and A340, thus assuring commonality in
training--and theoretically ensuring a market share among airlines who have
bought heavily into the A320.  But I digress. :-)

If nothing else, I hope I've made the point that FBW is NOT equivalent to
flight management.  FBW computers are relatively simple and straight-forward in
design and purpose: FMSs are fairly complex software/hardware packages.  The
correct functioning of them is important (especially when used in certain
ways), but not as ESSENTIAL as the FBW system.

In addition, note that the A320's automation includes many more services than
just FMS-derived and FBW: there are various mechanisms to display and control
systems information, warning and caution computers, etc.  It's also important
to note that the A320's cockpit design concept (with the exception of
sidesticks and throttle management) is fairly close to that of other airplanes
in production or development at this time (747-400, 777, MD-11, etc). FMS is
not unique to the A320, although its actual integrated environment (as with all
the airframe vendors) is proprietary and unique.

The following article about faulty computer control of radiotherapy treatment
is reprinted in its entirety, from today's Independent, a "quality" national
paper here in the UK. The story was covered last night on BBC TV news - where
interestingly enough they referred only to "human error", if my memory serves
me correctly, and where some of the medical experts they sought comments from
expressed fears that the fault might well have led to some fatalities.

HOSPITAL ADMITS ERROR IN TREATING CANCER PATIENTS  (By John Arlidge)

Nearly 1,000 cancer patients were given radiotherapy treatment up to 30 per
cent below the proper level, North Staffordshire hospital centre said
yesterday.  A computer programming error meant that for the last 10 years
patients at the hospital in Stoke-on-Trent received doses between 10 and 30 per
cent below the required level.

Stuart Gray, the hospital general manager, said yesterday: "We very much regret
that an error has been made.  We are very concerned about it and the staff of
the department are very upset."  The 447 surviving patients and their general
practitioners have been informed.  Patients and relatives of the 542 who have
died who "need reassurance" can see consultants or call a telephone hotline set
up by the hospital.  Officials say there is no evidence that patients have
suffered.  "It is up to individuals whether they seek compensation from the
district health authority," a spokesman said.

Most of the patients, from as far away as North Wales and Cheshire, were
suffering from cancer of the bladder, pelvis, lung and throat.  No children
or patients with breast cancers or brain tumours were treated.

The physicist who made the mistake by introducing an unnecessary correction
factor when a new planning computer was installed in 1982, has been transferred
to another department while two doctors carry out an independent inquiry.
Colleagues said she was "devastated" after realising her error when the
equipment was replaced just before Christmas.  Mr. Gray said it was too early
to say whether there would be disciplinary action.

The Department of Health, which has been investigating the incident since
December, welcomed the independent review.  A spokesman said: "There is no
doubt that negligence was involved.  An error has been admitted... If there
are any lessons to be learnt they will be implemented."

Mr. Gray said consultants have reviewed the case notes of all 989 patients
treated and have found no evidence that patients had died or suffered because
they received the low doses.  "We have no reason to believe this has had a
deleterious effect on the health of any of our patients.... We would welcome an
independent inquiry to confirm the findings of our consultants."

Two senior radiotherapists - Dr. Thelma Bates of St. Thomas Hospital, London,
and Dr. Daniel Ash of Cookridge Hospital, Leeds - are to carry out the
independent clinical review.  "We want to determine why it happened, why it
went undetected for 10 years and to make sure it never happens again," Mr. Gray
said.

    It is appropriate to note that UNDERdoses may also be life critical.  PGN]

  The front page of today's issue of the (UK) Computer Weekly is dominated by a
  photo of a very stern-looking Bev Littlewood, under the main headline stating
  "Experts warned CAA before Airbus disaster". The article is by Tony Collins.

Software experts warned the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) that rules governing
the safety of software in aircraft were inadequate two weeks before January's
crash of the A320 Airbus jet in France.  The results of an enquiry into the
January 20 Airbus crash, which killed 87, are not yet known, but the disaster
has focussed attention on aircraft such as the A320 which has fly-by-wire
controls dependent on the software.

Safety-critical software experts from the British Computer Society (BCS) met
the CAA to express concern about the laxity and ambiguity of certification
criteria used by regulatory authorities to test the safety of complex software
in aircraft.  They also called for improvements in an aviation software
certification codebook, D0/178B, which is now in draft form. They complained
that DO/178B fails to lay down mandatory requirements for aircraft software
safety and relies instead on guidelines.

The delegation to the CAA was led by Brian Wichmann, a software engineering
specialist at the government's National Physical Laboratory and acting chairman
of the BCS's task force on safety related systems.

Airbus Industrie, based in Toulouse, southern France said this week that it has
demonstrated that the A320 and its systems fully meet the requirements of the
world's certification authorities.  But the delegation said that the safety
claims made by the aircraft manufacturers for the software cannot be adequately
tested. One member said that the committees which lay down certification
standards represent the manufacturers' interests more than those of the
consumer.

Another member of the delegation, Bev Littlewood, professor of software
engineering at London's City University, said that some parts of DO/178B were
"appalling". He said that it fails to stipulate the way in which the claims
made for the software's safety by manufacturer can be tested.

The delegation's third member, Martyn Thomas, chairman of Bath software house
Praxis, said aircraft manufacturers should have to prove that their software
can be easily analyzed to check for any flaws. Certification standards make no
provision for this, he said.

A CAA spokesman said he sympathasised with views expressed by the delegation
and added that it is also seeking tougher standards for testing safety-critical
software.

  Clearly the paper has sought to dramatize its account of a meeting by linking
  it so directly to the A320. However I note that the article is followed up by
  a very supportive and reasonably well-argued editorial on page 23 - an
  editorial which ends "The CAA is said to agree with many of the BCS
  objections to the DO/178B guidelines. Only with international support can it
  make any changes."   Brian Randell

Edited bits from a story in the weekly "Marketing" column by Bruce Horovitz
in the "Los Angeles Times" 4-Feb-92, p. D6:

	OUR DATABASE SAYS YOU'LL READ THIS COLUMN

"If you need a stiff drink before reading this column, .... the folks at
Seagram Co. already have a pretty good idea who you are.  And they'll prove
that in this month's issues of Newsweek, Atlantic, and U.S. News and
World Report.  If the marketing gurus at Seagram suspect that you're a
drinker -- or are a likely candidate ... -- you'll be seeing their ads in
your February issues.  But if their research tells them that you're a
teetotaling subscriber, don't expect to see their ads....

"Beginning this month, for the first time on a large scale, a major advertiser
-- Seagram -- will test the ability of a handful of national magazines to
selectively place its ads only in those issues subscribed to by likely buyers
of its liquor....

"Marketers are watching more closely than ever whether consumers eat Wheaties,
collect colorized movies or take frequent trips to Toledo....  How deos
Seagram get this kind of personal information?	Officials there declined to
return phone calls.  But typically, [it] is gleaned from elaborate databases
on consumers who order from catalogues, telephone toll-free numbers, or even
fill out questionnaires when renewing magazine subscriptions....

" 'No one wants to get involved in an invasion of privacy,' says James R.
Guthrie, Exec. V.P. of marketing at Magazine Publishers of America.  'But
there is no doubt in my mind that this is the direction that magazine
publishing is going.'  This is just the beginning.  Before the end of the
decade, marketing experts say, many of the advertisers in major national
magazines will do individualized advertising regularly.  And within 20 years,
they say, most of the advertising placed in each issue of every major magazine
will be targeted specifically to narrow groups of subscribers....

[Approving quotes from marketers for Lexus, Reebok, etc., and other magazines]

"But not everyone is enamored of the concept.  'We're not going to do it,'
said Richard McEvoy, Senior V.P. at Carillon Importers, which imports
Absolut vodka.	'It sounds like a good idea, but you won't bring in new
customers if you only advertise to old ones."

   [from Marc Rotenberg &lt;Marc_Rotenberg@washofc.cpsr.org&gt; 
   via Lance J. Hoffman &lt;hoffman@seas.gwu.edu&gt;]

As a result of the Massachusetts DPU's order requiring free per-line blocking,
New England Telephone has refiled for three of the original four "PhoneSmart"
(CLASS) features in the original filing.

N.E.T. proposes to offer Call Trace, Return Call, and Repeat Call, but not
Caller ID or any of the other features that are part of CLASS such as Incoming
Call Blocking, Selective Call Forwarding.  The last two were not part of the
original filing.

N.E.T. had proposed a monthly fee for Call Trace as well as a charge for each
use; the DPU ordered that it be provided free on all lines with only a per-use
charge.

Call Trace will provide the needed protection from annoyance calls without the
privacy problems.

It's been reported that US Sprint is trying to "transform a billion-dollar
industrywide problem into a source of income" by offering phone fraud insurance
to its customers (Information Week, 2/3/92).  Discussions about the conflict
of interest inherent in making a "security industry" financially dependent on
a thriving security problem suddenly seem much less far-fetched...

Is security against phone fraud something that Sprint, a company that doesn't 
require the use of PINs on their calling cards, should be asking its
customers to pay for?

"Man To Be Tried on Phone Hacking Charges" by Jonathan Gaw.
From the Los Angeles Times, Wednesday, February 5, 1992, page B8.

  [Excerpted by Mark Seecof; elisions and bracketed interjections
  mine as well as all errors -MS.]

VISTA-A telephone hacker who allegedly tied up lines at Palomar Hospital for
hours at a time has been ordered to stand trial on dozens of felony wiretapping
and eavesdropping counts.  Rick Ivkovich is accused of using his touch-tone
telephone to jam the lines of the Escondido hospital, bringing switchboard
operators to tears.  From as early as April, 1990, prosecutors allege, he
occasionally blocked calls to and from the hospital and connected hospital
operators to outside lines, including 911 emergency lines and the county jail
here.  He also allegedly reported false emergencies to 911 while making it
appear that he was calling from the hospital.

         [Various quotes about stuff the defendant allegedly did.]

Outside the courtroom, Deputy District Attorney James Valiant [dig that name!]
said Ivkovich "had a gripe with the operators at Palomar.  He wanted to use
their telephone system and he wasn't allowed to."

         [Ivkovich has been confined for treatment in Palomar Hospital's
         mental-health unit in the past.]

Ivkovich is charged with 18 counts of wiretapping, 18 counts of eavesdropping,
and nine counts of falsely reporting an emergency, all felonies.  Escondido
police tracked down Ivkovich in December through a series of telephone "traps."

Public Defender William Saunders argued that there may have been no violation
of the law.  "The calls are not private communications as required in the
(eavesdropping) statute.  First of all, he's a party to the call," Saunders
told the court.  "Any call to 911 is a taped call... and I don't think there is
any expectation of privacy there."  Saunders argued that wiretapping charges
require physical attachment to telephone lines, and Ivkovich had none.

But Vista Municipal Judge Harley Earwicker said "there was an unauthorized
connection," which met the wiretapping provisions.

  [Mark Seecof &lt;marks@latimes.com&gt; (Los Angeles Times) says: 
    The big question here is why Palomar Hospital couldn't (apparently) keep
    this guy from hacking their PBX.  They should have just frozen him out.
    Why did the whole episode get as far as an arrest and felony charges?]

"...A well trained system-manager can protect a system without making it
inaccessible to normal users."

Mr. Gonggrijp's argument seems to be that the hackers could not have really
broken in, as the system was reasonably well protected.  Therefore, it must
have been the "fault" of the system managers that they got in, because they did
not do what was needed and (he implies) were not well-trained enough to do what
was needed.  Ergo, the hackers *really* got in because the system was *not*
well-protected, and hence should bear no responsibility for any costs incurred
in cleaning up after them.

Resting a plea for openness and continued ignoring of crackers on such a
contradictory argument seems foolish, to say the least.  By this reasoning, the
two gentleman should be let go, and the system managers arrested, perhaps for
recklessly endangering the data of their customers.

Why are all the pro-cracker arguments of the form of "Yes, I did it, but it is
not my fault, because {blame someone else here}"?  The risk?  People who buy
into this line of "reasoning" will feel that it is their moral obligation to
chastise those who they can victimize.  After all, the damage is not real, just
lines on a screen 2000 miles away, and anyway the bozo had it coming...

The New York Times reported today (6 February) that a $617 million
communications network designed to combat drugs is caught in a budget squeeze
and will not be completed for at least nine years.  The network, designed by
the Pentagon and law enforcement agencies, was developed due to consistent
communications problems in fighting drugs.

In his otherwise excellent posting, in contrasting FMS with INS, Robert Dorsett
states that "the potential for a KAL 007 sort of mismanagement is minimal,"
implying that INS-related problems were to blame for KAL 007's massive
deviation.  But INS-related theories are debunked in R.W. Johnson's book
"Shootdown" (including the theory later relied on in Hersh's book).  More
importantly, the jury in the KAL 007 case found that the deviation was, as a
matter of law, "intentional" and "willful."  KAL was accordingly held liable,
whereas the case against the manufacturers of the INS dismissed.  The INS was
found to be not a credible proximate cause of KAL 007's deviation.

I didn't mean to claim that there was one singular authoritative cause of
KAL 007's demise.  At least two books (and many net discussions, including
RISKS) put forth a credible theory that a misplanted number may have thrown 
the track off the requisite number of miles.  I should have made the nature

"Le Canard Enchaine" ("The Chained Duck") is a satirical French rag which
specialises in political commentary of the less respectful variety. It
maintains a high standard of investigative journalism, and is not afraid to ask
awkward questions.  The nearest equivalents are "Private Eye" (UK) and "Der
Spiegel" (Germany).

One of our French colleagues faxed us a recent article from "The Duck".  By 
coincidence, it was written by a certain Jerome Canard (and no jokes about 
his brother Donald, please! :-).             &lt;It's an old canard, anyway.  PGN&gt;

As usual, RISKS readers will have to bear with my own limited ability to 
translate French into something that might pass for English. [Translator's, 
and other, notes in brackets.] :-

            Disconnected alarm system on the Air Inter Airbus

The "Flight Analysis Report" [I'm not sure of the exact title of this 
document in English] of Air France is confidential. Pity! Its last number, 
dated 18 December 1991, reports five cases where the pilots, thanks to 
the GPWS (Ground Proximity Warning System), were able to conclude their 
flights successfully. This was not the case with the Lyon-Strasbourg A-320. 

Explanation: This GPWS is an alarm system which is triggered by five "modes":
excessive rate of descent, excessive rate of approach to the ground, loss of
altitude, etc. Among the five incidents noted by the Air France document, two
concern the A-320. The first was a non-stabilised "approach", the second a
rapid "approach" [to the ground (?)]. Thanks to the GPWS, their pilots avoided
the crash.

Forbidden alarm

All the aircraft of that type are equipped with this system provided by the
manufacturer. Even the A-320s of Air Inter. Alas, they had been "disarmed", as
"Le Point" [a publication which I don't know] wrote. For what reason?  "The
company only serves the Hexagon," it was explained with a slightly bothered air
[i.e., "Don't ask stupid questions!"]. "The pilots know the terrain perfectly."
[Anyone know exactly which region the "Hexagon" is?]

One fact has been established: when the Lyon-Strasbourg Airbus, which was 
making a VOR-DME instrument "approach", was judged "clear" by the radar, 
it was at an altitude of 5000 feet (1600m) and 5 nautical miles (9.5km) 
from the start of the landing strip. In 3 [nautical] miles and one minute, 
it had lost 2700 feet and struck the side of Mont St. Odile. 

It is there that the essential cause of the drama resides. The experts, without
a doubt, will be astonished at the disconnection of the famous GPWS, all the
more so since, on 12 December 1991, M. Frantzen, director of the aeronautical
training and technical control service, enjoined Air Inter by letter to
"reconnect" these alarm systems.  Il s'est fait envoyer sur les roses. [I think
this means he was told to **** off, but any French reader is welcome to correct
me!]  &lt;c'est obscur et idiomatique. PierreGN&gt;

Black mystery

As for the black box containing the flight parameters, it is, it seems,
unusable. "The Duck" has made enquiries of the manufacturer, the Schlumberger
company, which asserts that this mini-strongbox withstands a temperature of
1100 degrees C for thirty minutes, and confirms that the other black box, the
one for recording the conversation in the cockpit, situated some centimetres
from the first, is intact. Let us recall that, on the Air France Boeing 747
reduced to ashes at Karachi, the black boxes were recovered and used, just like
those in the Korean Air Lines' 747 shot down by a Soviet missile, recovered
from the bottom of the ocean.

In 1989, Gilles Pinchon, general engineer of the A-320, declared to the British
TV channel Channel Four: "Our system is so reliable that only one breakdown can
occur in a billion hours." [US billion: 10^9] Paul Quiles [Surname not clear
due to poor fax], Minister of Transport, promises that the enquiry will be
"open". Why doesn't that go without saying?

Actually, on Neil Young's old album "Trans" (lots of computer-related
songs, but for some reason not released on CD), there is a song called
"Computer Cowboy (aka Syscrusher)", from which I quote:

 "Ride along computer cowboy, 
 To the city just in time,
 To bring another system down,
 And leave your alias behind...

... another ballad, I imagine one of the first mass-marketed popular
songs celebrating the computer intruder. I think, by the way, the song
was actually released prior to the book Neuromancer, so the
coincidence of "computer cowboy" is rather odd.

A colleague just gave me this juicy tidbit.  Seems that his brother-in-law was
with the 82nd Airborne and, upon assignment to Fort Bragg, was given an office
that had never been used.  He plugged a phone into the jack and the phone
immediately rang.  No, it wasn't telemarketers; he was greeted with a modem
tone instead.  Hung up.  Phone immediately rang again.  This repeated 24 hours
a day until the Army put a trace on the call.  The trace led to, get this, a
Coca-Cola machine.  The manufacturer had built into these vending machines the
capability to call the bottling company when they were getting low on supplies
and order more.

Unfortunately for my friend's brother-in-law, the bottling company that owned
this machine in particular wasn't interested in this option, so they didn't
change the default telephone number that was programmed into the machine, and
which was happened to be set to, you guessed it, the office at Fort Bragg.

The Army cut the telephone cable on the Coke machine.  (I guess they weren't
armed at the time.)  This brand of vending machine also has the capability of
signalling via modem that it was out of change, full up on money, or had been
broken into ("Help, I've fallen over and I can't get up...").

I also received a revision of the specification for Automatic Vehicle
Identification (AVI) equipment that Phil Agre talked about in Risks 13.09, and
that I've talked about here before.  I'm much happier than Phil was with the
new draft.  It still has lots of problems, not the least of them the lack of
attention to security.  However, they've done just what I wanted on the subject
of privacy.

I testified before a CalTrans hearing in October on the spec, and a state
Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Privacy in December, and it appears that
my message got through.  The new draft doesn't leave room for an identifier of
the vehicle or the driver in the communication packets.  At the hearing in
December, Senator Bill Lockyer, the chair of the committee, made it clear to
the head of CalTrans and to Les Kubel, who is responsible for collecting
comments, that they were going to support anonymity in their system.  That's a
major victory.

On to the rest of the spec.  First, it won't be easy to forward a copy of the
spec via EMail.  The current draft is presented as a marked-up copy of the
previous ones, even though it has changed massively.  All deletions are
presented with strike-through, insertions have double-underline, and all
unchanged text has a single underline.  Besides making it very difficult to
read, this also means that a scanner isn't going to be able to figure it out.
Oh well.

Phil misinterpreted some of the spec in his message, and asked some questions
that I can answer.

    From: pagre@weber.ucsd.edu (Phil Agre)

    the state envisages attaching [the box] to your car that
    broadcasts your car's vehicle identification number (VIN)
    when pinged by a roadsite transmitter.

They aren't going to use VIN.  The spec mentions a Reader ID number which is a
32 bit field that would identify the reader unit.  This is as opposed to the
first version, which said VIN, and the second that said "Character-based ID,
identifying the vehicle.

   would it be necessary for every car on the road to have one of these
   transmitters.

All the CalTrans folk and vendors I've talked to say that there's no need for
every car to have one in order to collect tolls.  Some are willing to say that
they expect "other forces" (maybe DEA or INS?) to try to make this kind of
equipment usable for tracing people's movements.  There may have been attempts
to make this be standard equipment on new cars.  Lockyer appeared to say that
the California AVI spec had better not support this "feature".

    Caltrans has generalized the proposal; the "AVI" equipment
    is no longer specifically aimed at toll collection but is
    now intended to support a much wider range of applications.

I'll have to look at the old spec, to figure out why, but I always
understood this to be the intent.  I specifically remember that the
previous version said that more packet types could be added later to
serve other purposes.

    I cannot understand how automatic toll collection could
    work unless every car has a transponder.

The spec doesn't talk about it because it's not part of the technology being
designed.  The following is my guess, based on how I'd build such a system.
For corroboration, we should ask someone who uses the existing systems in
Dallas, New Orleans, or elsewhere what their systems do.  I would expect any
such (toll-collection) system to be prepared for vehicles without a
transponder.  Some vehicles will be from out of state, some batteries will die.
So, you just have cash lanes.  This also allows you to take care of the cars
with boxes that have run out of credit: As you approach the toll point, a
sensor queries your box to find out how your balance stands.  If your account
is low, you see an overhead sign directing you to use the cash lane.

This doesn't make it possible to collect tolls every half-mile, but it's fully
capable of supporting toll roads like the ones we currently have, or private
toll roads, which could be limited to vehicles which had the units.

Phil is right, however that there are lots of other issues which are left
unaddressed by the spec.  The folks at CalTrans aren't interested in listening
to these, so you might as well address them to your state congresscritter.
There's a new draft with a new deadline of February 28, so if you want a copy
or to comment on the spec itself, write to:

I must strongly disagree with the following comment in the discussion
of the damages caused by the Dutch hacker's break-ins:

&gt;If restoring back-ups costs tens of thousands of guilders, something is
&gt;terribly wrong at the VU. Every system manager that uses a legal copy of the
&gt;operating system has a distribution version within easy reach.

Rebuilding the operating system for a small workstation takes at least
a half-day. Re-editing all site-specific files, such as pasword files,
network host tables, mail aliases, and all site-specific privileged
files will certainly take several more days. For a large site with
networked disks and distributed resources, the cleanup must extend to
all other systems that the transgressors may have reached. This is
a difficult and non-trivial task.

Please do not assume that I agree with other statements in the article.

Here in the UK the BBC had a quiz on a Saturday night show - during the show
they asked a simple question and you phoned in the answer and a randomly
selected person with the correct answer was phoned back at the end and told
what prize a "celebrity" had won for then (the quotes are due to the fact the
the first "celebrity" was Eddie the Eagle - the UK's famously bad ski-jumper).
The next week British Telecom announced that during the show 1.25 million calls
had been attempted on the line, but only 7,000 had been answered by the BBC!

In the past the BBC have had phone polls e.g. on capital punishment
when that was  being debated in parliament, and people complained that
the 50-50 result was due to the capacity of the phone system and not
public opinion as both lines seem to have become overloaded.

Does anyone have any other information about this than the newspaper article?
The account in the Independent doesn't make it sound like it was a computer
error although the article appears to blame the computer.

      The following article about faulty computer control of radiotherapy
      treatment is reprinted in its entirety ...
      
      A computer programming error meant that ...

But it later says that:
      
      The physicist who made the mistake by introducing an unnecessary
      correction factor when a new planning computer was installed in 1982 ...

Medical physicists compute the dosage to be given to the patient (using
physicians instructions about desired treatment).  If the physicist did not
know how to compute a proper dosage, it does not matter whether the computation
was done by hand, on a calculator, or by a computer.  It seems strange to blame
this on a programming error.  Did the physicist really do the programming?  Was
there treatment planning software already installed on the computer and the
physicist just entered some factors (i.e., data)?  If the programmer was told
by an expert to implement a particular formula that is incorrect, how could
this error ever be found by testing or any other method that involved software
engineering techniques? If a person drives a car into a fence, is it reasonable
to blame the car?
      
This is not at all related to what happened with the Therac-25.
                                                                     nancy

With regard to computer risks in general:

I think it is time to establish licensing of software engineers, and that there
should be an independant review body for such critical software of the sort
that we literally place our lives directly in its care.

Many programmers of such systems have no knowledge whatsoever of the techniques
of reliable programming. They were the scientist, or expert, or whatever on the
object under software control, and were chosen to write the program because
they could hack out something that worked.

Consequently, they turn out spaghetti. Do you want your child to be the next
Therac victim?

The moniker "software engineer" is used a little loosley, for my mind. I think
there is a place for real software enginners, with the education in applied
science that it implies.

A program (5 years in Nova Scotia) of
	2 years of applied science
	3 years of software science
	professional experience.
	comprehensive examinations.
	membership in a professional society of engineers.
	a provincial license.
	a review committee.

No, I am not an engineer.

&gt; By coincidence, it was written by a certain Jerome Canard (and no jokes about
&gt; his brother Donald, please! :-).     &lt;It's an old canard, anyway. PGN&gt;

Of course not a coincidence. As every reader of Le Canard
knows, ``Jerome Canard'' is a pseudonym. The choice of pseudonym
indicates that articles with this signature are probably written by
the editor-in-chief, or at least a quite senior editor.

&gt; [Anyone know exactly which region the "Hexagon" is?]

Please think for half a second, or look at a map.  ``The Hexagon'' means
France.  It's a term favored by bureaucrats and journalists. (``Today, at the
four corners of the Hexagon, ...'' is a famous parody of technocratic style.)

``Le Point'' is one the four major weekly news magazines. (The others are Le
Nouvel Observateur, L'Express and L'Evenement du Jeudi.)

[...] The term came into use in the 1960's after the loss of Algeria had
blurred the French sense of where their borders lay.  (Not too long ago, France
included much of Africa and the Middle East, along with bits of the Caribbean,
Latin America and Pacific Oceana.)

    The term is the French equivalent of "the lower 48" in the US.

		 DaVinci Discovers Michelangelo Virus
		  Warns users of possible infection

RALEIGH, North Carolina, February 1, 1992 - DaVinci Systems announced today
that a recent shipment of eMAIL 2.0 demonstration disks and 30-day kits may be
infected with a computer virus known as Michelangelo.  Approximately 900
customers and potential customers were sent the infected disks.  Of these, over
600 were DaVinci resellers.

DaVinci Systems immediately notified its resellers of the problem via
electronic mail and will mail a new set of disks to all recipients of the
infected disks by February 6th.  DaVinci Systems also advises anyone who has
received a DaVinci eMAIL 2.0 demo disk or 30-day kit between January 20, 1992
and January 31st, 1992 not to use the disks they received.

According to Bill Nussey, President of DaVinci Systems, "While there is only a
slim chance of one of our customers contracting the Michelangelo virus from
these disks, we wanted to take every possible precaution."

The Michelangelo virus sits passively on infected machines until March 6th
(Michelangelo's Birthday) when it corrupts data on a user's hard disk.
FORTUNATELY, THE VIRUS CAN ONLY BE CONTRACTED BY BOOTING UP AN INFECTED FLOPPY.
Because the infected disks are not bootable, most users who have received these
diskettes will not contract the virus on their machine even if they run the
demo or install the software on their hard disks.  The only way users could
catch the virus from an infected disk is if they inadvertently boot up their
computers with the infected floppy in driver A while the drive door is closed.

DaVinci officials are still investigating the source of the virus.  Although
DaVinci's master disks are routinely checked for viruses, the virus software
used apparently did not detect Michelangelo.  "We are now using multiple
virus-detection products and insisting that our duplicating contractors also
check for viruses", said Nussey.

The Michelangelo virus can be detected by Microcom's Virex version 2.l1 or later
or by McAfee Associates shareware program VIRUSCAN version 7.9v84 or later.
DaVinci users and resellers can download VIRUSCAN from DaVinci's BBS at (919)
881-4342.

CA-92:02                        CERT Advisory
   			      February 6, 1992
                         Michelangelo PC Virus Warning

The Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) has
received information concerning a personal computer virus known as
Michelangelo.  The virus affects IBM PCs and compatibles.  A description
of the virus, along with suggested countermeasures, is presented below.

I.   Description

     The Michelangelo virus is a computer virus that affects PCs
     running MS-DOS (and PC-DOS, DR-DOS, etc.) versions 2.xx and
     higher.  Note, however, that although the virus can only execute
     on PCs running these versions of DOS, it can infect and damage PC
     hard disks containing other PC operating systems including UNIX,
     OS/2, and Novell.  Thus, booting an infected DOS floppy disk on
     a PC that has, for example, UNIX on the hard disk would infect
     the hard disk and would probably prevent the UNIX disk from
     booting.  The virus infects floppy disk boot sectors and hard
     disk master boot records (MBRs).  When the user boots from an
     infected floppy disk, the virus installs itself in memory and
     infects the partition table of the first hard disk (if found).
     Once the virus is installed, it will infect any floppy disk that
     the user accesses.

     Some possible, though not conclusive, symptoms of the
     Michelangelo virus include a reduction in free/total memory by
     2048 bytes, and some floppy disks that become unusable or display
     "odd" graphic characters during "DIR" commands.  Additionally,
     integrity management products should report that the MBR has been
     altered.

     Note that the Michelangelo virus does not display any messages on
     the PC screen at any time.

II.  Impact

     The Michelangelo virus triggers on any March 6.  On that date,
     the virus overwrites critical system data, including boot and
     file allocation table (FAT) records, on the boot disk (floppy or
     hard), rendering the disk unusable.  Recovering user data from a
     disk damaged by the Michelangelo virus will be very difficult.

III. Solution 

     Many versions of anti-virus software released after approximately
     October 1991 will detect and/or remove the Michelangelo virus.
     This includes numerous commercial, shareware, and freeware
     software packages.  Since this virus was first detected around
     the middle of 1991 (after March 6, 1991), it is crucial to use
     current versions of these products, particularly those products
     that search systems for known viruses.
        
     The CERT/CC has not formally reviewed, evaluated, or endorsed any
     of the anti-virus products.  While some older anti-virus products
     may detect this virus, the CERT/CC strongly suggests that sites
     verify with their anti-virus product vendors that their product
     will detect and eradicate the Michelangelo virus.

     The CERT/CC advises that all sites test for the presence of this
     virus before March 6, which is the trigger date.  If an infection
     is discovered, it is essential that the user examine all floppy
     disks that may have come in contact with an infected machine.

     As always, the CERT/CC strongly urges all sites to maintain good
     backup procedures.

The CERT/CC wishes to thank for their assistance: Mr. Christoph Fischer of the
Micro-BIT Virus Center (Germany), Dr. Klaus Brunnstein of the Virus Test Center
(Germany), Mr. A. Padgett Peterson, P.E., of the Technical Computing Center at
Martin-Marietta Corp., and Mr. Steve R. White of IBM's Thomas J. Watson
Research Center.

     This virus has really surprised me. When I first say it, my thought was
"yet another STONED" (and not as well written), but it seems to be spreading &amp;
spreading &amp; spreading...  If Rob Slade's estimate is right, for every report we
see, there are at least three other infected computers that we don't. March 6th
may just be interesting.

     Some time ago I did a number of experiments concerning boot sectors in
general since we seemed to have good protection from DOS viruses but few people
were working at the BIOS level before DOS ever starts. IMHO, since over 50% of
the reported infections begin at the BIOS level, then that is where the
checking should start.  The first experiments (written in 1988) were a set of
integrity checking programs, two of which were CHKMEM and CHKBOOT (now
FREEWARE) that could be used to detect all "common" viruses - I presented a
paper on this at last year's Virus &amp; Security Conference in New York (March 12
&amp; 13 this year call (800)835- 2246 x190 for info - plug).

     These operate from the DOS level. About two years ago, I began studying a
BIOS level approach - at this point the Intel PC is a fully functioning
computer with access to all peripherals, it is just not yet a DOS (or Unix or
OS/2 or...) computer.

     The first result was the DISKSECURE program that was designed as a
technology demonstrator &amp; performed BIOS level integrity checking and
protection of the MBR, hidden sectors, and DOS boot record.  Many researchers
seem to like it as an additional layer of protection.

     DISKSECURE's biggest limitation was that it could do nothing about a
floppy boot (only hardware can prevent this) and I was and am convinced that a
global solution had to be software based - not for technical reasons but for
logistical and economic ones.

     The next effort was SafeMBR - a BIOS level Master Boot Record replacement
that performed integrity checking on the system and which would halt a boot if
"something" was wrong and used lessons learned in DISKSECURE to avoid conflicts
with the incredible array of disk controllers, BIOSes, and DOS variants that
exist. SafeMBR is FREEWARE.

     Late in 1991, I extended the SafeMBR concepts to a similar floppy disk
replacement SafeFBR to provide a generic floppy disk boot record replacement
with warning messages.

     Concurrently with SafeMBR, I addressed the "floppy boot" problem as far as
possible with software, a TSR (512 bytes needed &amp; can be loaded "high") was
written to intercept the Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence and test for a floppy in drive
A. If one is found, the reboot is denied. This taught me more about the inner
workings of the BIOS and the Interrupt Controller. NoFBoot was the result and
is also FREEWARE.

     The final parts FixMBR and FixFBR were extensions of this concept used to
install SafeFBR and SafeMBR. FixMBR came from hours spent disinfecting machines
infected by MBR viruses and was designed to automate the repair based on the
fact that ALL leave an intact partition table SOMEWHERE. Given an intact
partition table, all that is usually necessary is to replace the MBR program.
Generally I use the SafeMBR code to do this.

     For some time, I was hesitant to release these techniques but then along
came the Azusa virus...

     FixFBR works essentially the same way except that only four Boot Parameter
Blocks are needed (does not work with 2.88 Mb floppies yet). Since it also
incorporates the CHKBOOT techniques, it will also flag potentially infected
disks.

     This last is the key to the concept. None of these programs (well maybe
NoFBoot) will prevent a virus infection.  What they will do is to detect
viruses almost immediately.  Flag the "anomaly" in a way the user cannot
ignore, and provide a recovery mechanism. They do not "identify 1000 viruses"
but will tell you that "something" has happened at the BIOS level without going
resident.  They are designed as one layer in a layered protection (I use four
layers myself).

     Similarly, either CHKBOOT or FixFBR will detect the Michelangelo virus on
floppy disks and report them as "suspect".  FixFBR will then remove the
problem.

     To me this is a vital element in fighting malicious software, knowing
early on that "something" has happened and isolating the abnormality to as
narrow range.  I personally believe that if these techniques were used
globally, those viruses responsible for over half of reported infections:
Stoned, Azusa, Aircop, Brain, Joshi, &amp; Michelangelo would quickly disappear.

     But today there appears to be a very real threat: Michelangelo that needs
to be addressed. I have never seen so many reports of a virus in so short a
time before and am particularly disturbed about the number of "shrink-wrapped"
reports.  Consequentially, while normally I "suggest" a nominal SHAREWARE fee
($1.00) for the two "FIX" utilities, from now until 7 March, 1992, payment
requirements are suspended and they may be freely used, posted, &amp; transmitted
without limitation so long as they are not modified.

may be found in directory msdos.antivirus at urvax.urich.edu (141.166.1.6 -

Ted Urbanowicz of Stow, Ohio, sent in an item from the 30 Jan 1992 issue of
Computing (UK).  I have abstracted.

  Police have charged a woman under the Computer Misuse Act following a million
pound hacking incident at a leading city finance company.  Elaine Borg, a
computer operator at fund managers Henderson Financial Investment Services, is
accused of hacking into the company's computer system between 1 Oct 1991 and 19
Jan 1992 with intent to defraud it of a million pounds.  Borg was charged in
London's City Magistrates' Court under Section Two of the Act, which covers
unauthorised access to systems with the aim of assisting a more serious crime,
such as fraud or blackmail.  Her activities were being monitored for several
days before she was apprehended.  Oddly, the managing director of Henderson was
quoted as saying that it would have been difficult to complete the fraud,
because it would have required collusion at the other end.  But the article
noted that Borg faces a second charge of conspiracy with another person,
Richard Hollands, while another man, Keith Cheeseman, was also arrested in
connection with the fraud, but not charged because of extradition problems.
Cheeseman is wanted by the FBI in connection with a multimillion pound bond
theft in London two years ago.

The COMPUTING article closed with a note on a recent National Computing Centre
report (Security Breaches Survey, NCC, Oxford Road, Manchester M1 7ED UK;
contact David Lindsay, phone 44 6355524040), which estimates that security
breaches cost UK industry 1.1 billion pounds a year.

SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, 1992 FEB 6 (NB) -- Australian government officials are
ducking for cover as yet another case of personal data misuse "hits the fan."
More than 6,000 households received official letters containing personal and
financial details about others.

Recipients of what should have been a routine Department of Social Services
letter about child allowances were shocked to see a list of information about
others, sometimes neighbors.  The data included name, address, bank account
details, tax file number, and income.

One recipient said: "I was looking at the back of the letter, assuming the
information I saw was meant as an example, when a neighbor rang to say she was
reading all about me on the letter she had just received. I felt sick, knowing
that my private affairs had been revealed like that. They say 'give us your
details - you can trust us' but we can't, can we?"

Officials from the department have given two explanations so far, though it may
be some time before the complete story surfaces. The letters had correct data
on the front, but incorrect data on the reverse. The first explanation was that
the laser print run had faltered, and when it was restarted, the letters were
printing front and back, one step out of sync. The second (and expected) excuse
was that there was a glitch in the computer program which had been imported.

Unfortunately for the Australian government, this was not the first incident of
its type, and a large public storm is rising over the rapid increase in the
amount of data held in a central computer in Australia's capital, Canberra.

The selection process for the third Chicago airport continues to generate
controversy (see a previous issue of Risks Digest).  In this particular case,
its an excellent example of PC-based computerized mapping programs and
spreadsheets being abused.

A revised configuration for the Lake Calumet site (which is strongly favored by
Mayor Daley), has modified the footprint for the airport. The Ford assembly
plant in Hegewisch, Illinois is now spared (this plant is used for the assembly
of the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable). However the revised footprint for the
airport has it crossing the stateline into Northwest Indiana. One of the
runways ends within less than a mile of the Amoco Oil Refinery in Whiting. An
estimated 25,000 homes, half a dozen schools and 15 churches would need to be
razed to make room for the airport. The revised plan doesn't anticipate the
relocation of any industrial sites.

However it also calls for the draining of several hundred acres of wetlands.
The fate of several lakes that are adjacent to the airport site is also in
question. An estimated 50,000 people would be dislocated by the project.

The second risk is one of computer spreadsheets. The original cost of the
airport was $5 billion. A revised cost from Mayor Daley is $10.8 billion.
However this assumes the razing of only 10,000 homes. An estimated $18 to 30
billion would be needed to raze the 25,000 homes that are within a 7 mile
radius of the proposed site. Assuming a $10.8 billion dollar cost a ticket
surtax of $12-15 per ticket would be levied for any flight originating or
terminating from Midway and O'Hare. With the $30 billion estimate the ticket
tax would be in the range of $36 - $50.

The entire justification for the third airport is based on FAA data from the
late 1970's which was gathered just before the deregulation of the airline
industry in the United States.

One question for the Risks community. Has anyone ever estimated the area of
destruction that would result if a jumbo jet was to make a direct hit upon an
oil refinery? Whenever the issue of safety is mentioned it is dismissed with
the statement that commercial aviation is safer than driving.  O'Hare was the
site of a DC-10 crash in 1979 which killed several hundred people. Indiana
within the past 4 years has had two crashes (one in Indianapolis, and a more
recent one in Evansville) with planes going down near airports with a
significant loss of life from people on the ground.

CARPAL SYNDROME REPORTS RISE SHARPLY (Jon Van, Chicago Tribune)

Reports of repetitive-motion disorders have risen sixfold in recent years and
now account for more than half of all occupational illnesses in the United
States, a report in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association
noted.

Physicians must work with employers, industrial designers, labor
representatives and others to modify work sites so that these injuries,
sometimes known as cumulative trauma disorders and sometimes as carpal tunnel
syndrome, can be avoided, the report said.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found that there were 24 cases of
cumulative trauma disorder for every 10,000 U.S. workers in 1990, up from 4
cases per 10,000 in 1982.

Dr. David M. Rempel, director of the ergonomics laboratory at the University of
California at San Francisco, said in his Journal report that several factors
account for the increase. They include increased awareness of the problem,
advances in medical diagnosis and an ever-accelerating pace of work.  Even
though the problem is growing, most physicians are ill-prepared to deal with
it, Rempel and his colleagues said.  ``Because of the scarcity of medical
research on [the disorders],'' they wrote, ``many physicians are unable to
identify patients working in high-risk environments and are inadequately
prepared to treat patients with symptomatic disorders.''

When someone applies force over and over to the same group of muscles, the same
joint or the tendon, the result may be tissue tears and trauma. Other factors
causing damage are awkward joint posture and prolonged constrained posture.

Workers should be encouraged to watch for symptoms, especially pain, and seek
medical attention early, Rempel and the co-authors said. They shouldn't be told
to work through pain, the report said.  ``Medical intervention for the patient
with [a disorder] requires not only accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy,
but also direct involvement in changing the patient's work environment,'' the
report concluded.

This RISKS submissions concerns a computer problem with a patent application.

When the patent examiner issues a final rejection of a patent, the patent
office can give you a shortened time to respond.  This response is an appeal to
the board of patent appeals.

The statutory time to respond is six months; however the patent office has the
authority to shorten this time.

You can extend the time given by the patent office by paying a late
fee--however, late fees won't extend your total time more than the six months
specified in the statute.

On 08/13/91, the patent examiner issued me a final rejection of my patent.  The
problem concerns the date on the letter informing me of this.

That letter was issued on a standardized form, PTOL-326.  

That form included the statement:

"A shortened statutory period for response to this action is set to expire
3(three) month(s) 0 days from the DATE OF THIS LETTER."  (Emphasis mine).  The
3 for three months and the zero for 0 days were entered in handwriting.

The date was supposed to be printed on the preprinted form under or next to the
preprinted text that said "Date mailed"

Unfortunately, the dot matrix printout of the date was obscured by the
preprinted "Date mailed."  The date printed on the letter of "08/??/91" was
eighty percent obscured.

It was obvious that the form was not correctly aligned in the printer.  The
name of the examiner was not under the heading "examiner."  And the number 231
wa not under "art unit."  Thus, I couldn't read it properly and read the date
as 09/10/91.  The slash overlapped one of the letters which appeared to be a
nine.  Section 1.134 of 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations states in
pertinent part,

  "An office action will notify the applicant of any non-statutory or shortened
  statutory time period set for response to an Office action."

The office action failed to notify me of the indicated time.  Thus, "unless the
applicant is notified in writing that response is required in less than six
months, a maximum period of six months is allowed."  (37CFR 1.134).  Thus, I am
arguing my response was not due for six months from the indicated date as the
Patent office did not fulfill it's regulatory requirement of notifying me as
specified by this section.

Therefore, I requested that no fee be assessed at all.  

This points out the obvious risks of not aligning forms when put into
printers.

However, this likely human error was compounded by:

1) using a cheap nine-pin dot matrix printer with this form.  If the numbers
   were printed with a daisy wheel printer or 24-pin printer, they would have
   been more readable even if printed on top of other information.

2) Using a numerical date format "08/13/91" instead of August 13, 91.
   One is less likely to confuse August and September than 08 and 09.
   Although "November" and "December" have most of their letters in common.

3) However, the patent office had the correct date in a computer
   system.  They should have printed everything out using a laser
   printer including the shortened statutory time, the date of final
   reject and the date the response was due.  All the information on
   the preprinted form would be printed out at the same time.

   This would be a simple WordPerfect merge application.

        INDEX.192:    survey of all entries published so far 
                      (214 viruses/trojans)
        AMIGAVIR.192: 14 new viruses (total: 29 viruses/time bombs)

                      Moreover, the first polymorphic virus using Dark Avenger
                      "Mutating Engine 0.9" is classified, named "Dedicated".

After analysis of an accident with a UNIX shellscript virus in a European
university, based on several publications of an AT&amp;T author who described all
details of the virus' code and sufficient details of his "attacks" on several
UNIX systems in his enterprise, we have classified this virus under the
provisional name "AT&amp;T ATTACK virus". This information is available from the
author, on specific demand; despite the fact that this classification does not
contain any information helpful in programming this virus, we wish to avoid as
far as possible a similar virus wave as we observer so regretfully in the PC
world.  This is the reason for some restrictions in distribution of the Catalog
entry.

All information including all other Virus Catalog entries may be received 
either by demand from the author or may be downloaded from our FTP site:

              address: ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de

              password your-email-adress
              directory: pub/virus/texts/catalog

Moreover, those interested in Chaos Congress material (e.g. CCC91): these are
available on the same ftp site with the same procedures in
              directory: pub/virus/texts/hackers

Finally, we are updating the Index of Malicious MsDos Code; to avoid those
inaccuracies which unfortunately were built-into the first edition (IMSDOS.791)
due to misleading information from several alternate sources, Vesselin Bontchev
and I decided that we *only publish information on those viruses/trojans etc
which are in our Secure Malware Database*. In the next edition, it will
describe about 1,150 viruses/trojans with those names/aliases which are used by
major antivirus software. This edition will be available on the ftp-site early
in March.

All comments and critical remarks which helps us in enhancing the quality of
our work and information is strongly welcomed.

In discusing system restoration following illegal hacker activity, Martin
Minnow takes issue with the assertion, "...Every system manager that uses a
legal copy of the operating system has a distribution version within easy
reach."  He says, in part, "Rebuilding the operating system for a small
workstation takes at least a half-day. Re-editing all site-specific files, such
as pasword files, network host tables, aliases..."

It seems to be RISK-y behavior not to keep an image of your operating system,
including the site-specific files, on tape back-up...off-line, not available
via automatic de-archiving, mountable only manually, etc.  What happens when
disks are corrupted by more benign influences such as power surges or head
crashes?

Brinton Cooper notes that it is "RISK-y behavior" not to keep a fully-
configured system image on tape backup, especially in order to recover from
hardware errors.  He is absolutely correct. However, if your system was
intentionally attacked, this might be insufficient. I know of one case where
the system manager not only rebuilt the system from distribution tapes, but he
even went so far as to order new tapes from the manufacturer in order to avoid
the minuscule risk that the attacker had physical access to the on-site tape
library. Of course, only the system owner can evaluate the tradeoff between
acceptable risk and the cost of protecting against that risk.

&gt;From rec.humor, a commentary on those over-optioned
                 automated phone answering/messaging systems.

                       AUTOMATION IN THE 20th CENTURY
                            By Michael J. Clark
         
The setting is a typical bedroom, a woman is in the bed asleep, next to her bed
is a night stand with an alarm clock and a telephone.  Suddenly the woman
awakens to the sound of a strange noise in the house, she looks around, starts
to panic and then picks up her phone to call the police.

Woman: (Startled and panicked, talking out loud to herself in a low tone)
"I-I-I-I've got to call the police, there's someone here, oh God I know there
is, let's see...what's the number, (she nervously punches the numbers into the
phone.)

After a few rings the phone is answered, there is a delay, then we hear:
"Welcome to our emergency phone mate 911, the automated emergency answering
system, the latest in emergency response technology!  If you are calling from a
touch tone phone, please enter a 1 at the tone, enter now"......(the woman
looks both shocked and puzzled as she nervously punches in a "1") "Thank you,
our emergency phone mate 911 recognizes that you are calling from a touch tone
phone......To serve you better your police and emergency services have set up
this system to route your call to the appropriate emergency service
personnel......If you are in need of police assistance enter a 5, if you
require information in Spanish, enter 7, in Chinese enter 4, in Greek enter 9,
in French enter 6 or Italian enter an 8, if you wish fire or medical service
enter a 3 and the corresponding numerical code for the language in which you
will be speaking or in need of translation......to repeat the previous
information please enter 0.......Enter your code now please"......(the woman,
who has now gone from fear and panic to being irritated and confused enters a 5
and waits.....) "Emergency phone mate 911 recognizes that you have requested
police assistance in English....In order to better serve you, please enter the
appropriate number at the tone....a 1 if your call is not an emergency, a 2 if
you need information, a 3 if you are returning a call from a police official, a
4 if you are inquiring about a parking ticket, or a 5 if this is an emergency,
enter your code now"........(she shakes her head and rolls her eyes and enters
a 5 quite forcefully) "Emergency phone mate 911 recognizes that you have a
police emergency, please enter a 1 if it is a life threatening emergency, a 2
if it is a non life threatening emergency, a 3 if there are weapons involved, a
4 if there are multiple perpetrators, a 5 if the perpetrators are non English
speaking and will require a Miranda warning in any other language....Please be
sure to enter the appropriate language code if you enter a 5....if the police
emergency is a non life threatening rape or physical assault please enter a
7.......

(the woman now has lost her temper, she punches in a 2 saying out loud "How the
hell do I know if it's life threatening or not you imbecile!)  "Emergency phone
mate 911 recognizes that you have a police emergency that is non life
threatening, emergency phone mate will now direct your call to the appropriate
department for response.....please hold while your call is transferred.....(we
hear ringing......, the phone is answered) "Dunkin' Donuts, may I help you?"

    Apparently airline passengers with portable PCs are using the shaver
outlets in the toilets to recharge their PC batteries.  Since recharging a
battery can take some time, this behavior dramatically reduces passenger access
to toilets. [Computers constrain key bodily functions... :-)]

    I've encountered three pieces of information that suggest this is not just
a nice urban myth.  First, two colleagues have reported encountering the
problem.  One on a flight to Japan (where apparently at one point, almost all
the toilets were taken by folks sitting inside recharging their PC batteries),
one on a flight cross the US.  Second, there was an article several weeks ago
(I think in the SF Chronicle travel section) on business travel that mentioned
that some business travelers were now requesting seats at the back of the plane
for easier access to the shaver outlets (the article suggested said passengers
were using extension cords...)
                                             Craig Partridge

   [HIT or MYTH?  Not aMYTH.  I noticed on last week's cross-country trip that
   ALL of the shaver outlets had been blocked off, with a sticker over the jack
   saying that this blockage was effective as of something like November 1991.
   A myth is as good as a mile-per-hour increase in speed.  Some planes provide
   phone hookups in each row group; perhaps we will soon see per-seat
   electrical outlets as first- and business-class perks.  Opportunity for a
   SURCHARGE?  &lt;Quadruple pun intended.&gt;  Call your favorite airline now.  PGN]

Phone May Trap Kidnapper, by Paul Cheston (London Evening Standard, 7 Feb 1992)

Detectives hunting the kidnapper of estate agent Stephanie Slater believe they
can trap him through the mobile phone he used to pass on instructions for the
175,000 (pounds) ransom drop.

Courier Kevin Watts is convinced the kidnapper used a mobile phone to direct
him in thick fog towards the disused railway bridge where he left the money.
Mr. Watts had been ordered by the kidnapper, descirbed by police as Britain's
most wanted man, to a remote phone box near Penistone outside Barnsley.
Parking nearby, he carried the ransom money into the booth when the phone rang
almost immediately.  The ring was so fast the estate agent branch manager
realised the kidnapper had been watching him and must have been using a mobile
phone.

A mobile phone's unique electronic serial number is recorded by the computer
which runs the network and can be used to trace the phone user.

The note about extradition problems is interesting. They become especially
acute with computer crimes (ecrimes?).  In the old days one would commit a
crime and then escape to a "safe" country.  Today one can first escape and then
commit the crime.

What are the implications and remedies?

In partial answer to Bob Frankston's question, the implications are of course
quite profound.  We need more international cooperation to establish and hinder
what is illegal.  (Cf. the US-Dutch noncommunication noted in <A HREF="/Risks/13.11.html">RISKS-13.11</A>, 12,
13, 14.)  Might we see pirate ships from which cracking would be legal?  And a
new breed of international terrorism protected by safe havens?  The existing
international legal situation is certainly inadequate today, but it is also
intrinsically limited in what it might eventually be able to do even with
greater international cooperation.  In addition, we need more-secure
computer-communication systems, better user and system authentication,
meaningful audit trails, etc., to hinder misuse.  Without them, crying over
electronically spilled milk money leads to ECrim(e)osus/lacrimosus/lactimosus/
galactimosus.  The -osus with the mos'us is the crime that won't rhyme.

On Jan. 27th, D.C. Lawrence reported on D. Gerlernter's "Linda" for distributed
computing, and the possible lack of risk awareness shown in related trends. He
asked for related trends.

In the "NetWork Project", the StatLab Heidelberg has been working on another
system for distributed computing making use of idle times of workstations on a
net. We agree on the critical asked by D.C. Lawrence.  Here is how they are
delt with in the NetWork Project.

(1) Privacy and user control. The owner should always be in full control of the
machine. NetWork uses a demon as a communication agent. All communication for
the NetWork system is funneled through this demon, the "NetWork Processor".
This "NetWork Processor" is under full control of the owner of a machine. The
owner can set up the machine not to participate in NetWork distributed
computing at all. Or the owner can set up a certain threshold of idle time
after which the machine can be used for distributed computing. The "NetWork
Processor" takes care to repect these settings.  A machine will only visible to
the NetWork System if it is published and is idle in terms of the definition of
the l o c a l user. And if the local user comes back, the "NetWork Processor"
guaranties to remove (kill, if necessary) any guest processes immediately.

(2) Code and information security. How do you prevent the introduction of
worms, and how do you guard local information ? At present, we did not see any
solution to this problem. We would have liked to migrate code. And we would
have liked to Program/train a recipient machine "on the job", as is done in the
Japanese TRON system. But we did not see any sound possibility to overcome the
risks involved. So we had to refrain from code migration.  Again, we put
control back in the hand of the owner of the local machine.  Using the "NetWork
Processor" demon, the onwer may set up one trusted path, and only programs in
this trusted path will be accessed by NetWork.  So we rely on the risk
awareness of the owner, and the usual local system provided by the file system
access privileges. To educate user awareness, we took the aggressive way. We
gave an example of how you can risk everything by putting an unrestricted shell
in the trusted path. And we told everyone to take a lesson from it and never to
do this.

(3) Competing access. This is an issue which was not addressed in D.H.
Lawrence's letter. But we felt it of utter importance. If you have a
distributed computing system, it will compete for network bandwith.
Moreover probing and look-up will generate computing load even on those
stations which are not used for idle time computing. In particular, any
machine must be handle every broadcast it sees, even just to discard it.
Competing communication load will be negligible for small sites. But it may
become a major problem if the number of compute clients increases. If a
distributed computing system does not address these problems, mere
communication load may lead to a denial of service with increasing system
size. NetWork takes three means to address this problem. (A) instead of
using high overhead protocols like RPC, we use lightweight communcation -
for UNIX, based on UDP - and have special techniques to reduce
communication load, (B) we limit the additional bandwith taken up by the
NetWork administrative system to an arbitrary fraction (1 per cent) of the
bandwidth on the transport medium available, (C) we control and limit the
global rate of broadcasts and multicasts used by NetWork.

scheme associated with shareware.  I have not looked at the book yet, myself
(perhaps I should be fore submitting a real posting to comp.risks), but even if
the story is inaccurate, it bears passing on because it points out yet another
possibilty in mistruth-in-advertising.

&gt; TITLE: Beware the THOUSAND DOLLAR BOOK.   (TINAR)
&gt;
&gt; "DOS Power Tools, Second Edition" looks a lot like the First Edition.  The
&gt; price is $10 higher, but, why not?  The first edition only had one disk,
&gt; containing a lot of useful, ready to run, PAID FOR, utilities, at $39.95.
&gt; This one's got THREE disks filled with "over 100 all-new utilties", at $49.95.
&gt;
&gt; I've had the book for a week, and I'm reading page 811.  This is where the
&gt; author urges you to register shareware you use; it's the right thing to do.
&gt;
&gt;            Sounds beautiful so far, what makes this an ONION?
&gt;
&gt; MOST OF the "100 ALL-NEW UTILITIES" with this $49.95 book are SHAREWARE!
&gt; 48 programs, by 7 authors, asking for a total of $925 in registration fees!
&gt; 18 additional programs ask to "call or write" to 5 more authors for prices.
&gt; If each "write for price" is only $25, the grand total is $1,375.  Even if I
&gt; pay each author for ONE program, the total registrations would come to $242.
&gt;
&gt; On the covers, there's NO notice of the $1,375 shareware bargain inside.
&gt; This important information is on page 815 thru 965 of this 1070 page book.
&gt;
&gt; Bantam Computer Books, ISBN 0-553-35464-7.  Down payment only $49.95.
&gt; Total price approximately $1,424.95.  Postage and taxes not included.  TINAR.

&gt; ================================ END ========================================
&gt;
&gt; Personally speaking, I feel this type of practice, if not illegal, is
&gt; unethical..  The first edition did not require the purchaser of the book to
&gt; pay large sums for the use of the Shareware included.. There was an
&gt; agreement with the publisher and the shareware authors For which, Im certain,
&gt; the authors were compensated for their labors.. I, for one, will not support

I recently needed to use my "prescription drug plan" employee benefits, 
available to Maryland state employees.  (This is in response to problems with
a flu virus rather than computer virus, as usually discussed in this forum.)
This presented my fever-ridden imagination with an interesting array of risks
due to a system that is substantially supported by computer.

The prescription drug plan in Maryland is contracted out to a separate company
called PCS, Inc.   Our membership ID is, unfortunately, assigned by social
security number.  All transactions in the system are recorded in a "PCS 
databank", a centralized facility that is billed as being an important employee
safeguard, since it is intended to warn pharmacists when you are given some
conflicting medications.   The obvious sorts of computer risks here have been
discussed previously -- what if the databases' list of drug interactions is
not correctly recorded, what if the data being entered for a patient is mis-
entered or associated with another patient, etc.

But the fine print in our benefits contract reveals there is room for other
sorts of problems.  We aren't given much in the way of promises concerning
accuracy of information ("... neither PCS nor your ... sponsor is responsible
for any damage or liability out of or in connection with the performance, or
failure to perform, ... services for you.")  Neither are we given much in the
way of assurance concerning how information is to be used.  Is PCS free to 
decide someday to sell mailing lists based upon records?  Or (more likely)
sanitized records?  Send all those heart patients advertisements for the latest
Ronco CPR-o-matic!  (And what if they mix it up and send diabetics those 
chocolate ads really intended for folks with eating disorders....?)  A longer
range issue, of course, is that this is one more way for the state to get
access to personal medical information.  Want to custom-tailor a benefits
package to the employee? No problem --- just tap into the centralized medical
records and see what kinds of problems they'll likely have down the line. 
(Let's see, this Purtilo guy is overweight, attitude-ridden and near-sighted...
better charge him the max for medical insurance.  Now if we could only cross
reference the DNA mapping info in order to predict other diseases....)  Entry
into this database is mandatory for any employee who uses the plan benefits.

This assumes you can use the benefits.  The cough syrup I wanted to buy took
about 40 minutes to prepare. 10 of these minutes were due to waiting in line
and paperwork, 30 were due to the lab person fooling around at the computer
terminal.  The pharamacist was not very open to gab about this, so I cannot
report on his perceptions concerning system reliability, but I got the distinct
impression that if they could not log in to the centralized facility, then I
could not buy the medication (under the plan).  Moreover, since membership
cards are only issued in the employee's name, it is plausible that a valid user
might _not_ get medication at all: spouse goes with prescription and no cash,
expecting to get critical prescription filled under terms of the plan; computer
is down, denying verification of user [the card explicitly states that only the
user whose name is on the card can get benefits ... participating pharmacies
are told to overcome this problem for family members by checking in the
computer]; spouse has different last name than on card, so the pharmacy cannot
even honor the card based upon paper records; and spouse doesn't have the cash
to buy the medication (and hope the paperwork doesn't kill him or her later).

All I know about the recently reported radiation therapy underdoses are what I
read in RISKS.  As usual, it is not possible to determine what actually
happened from the news account.

However, since I do work in a radiation therapy clinic, I can provide some
general information.

Doctors prescribe the radiation dose that is to be delivered to particular 
sites in the patient's body.   Typically the prescription includes, in
effect, a lower limit on the dose to the tumor and an upper limit on the dose
to various healthy tissues such as the spinal cord, etc.  Then a physicist or
dosimetrist creates a treatment plan, including a geometric configuration of 
radiation sources (usually beams from a linear accelerator), and the amount 
of radiation to be delivered from each source.   Because of the nature of
the radiation producing machinery, and the physics of radiation absorption in
the body,  physics calculations are required to determine the machine settings
needed to deliver the prescribed doses to the prescribed sites.

Clinic staff usually use computer programs called "treatment planning
programs" to perform some of these calculations.  Usually, these programs
produce a printed chart with instructions for setting up the treatment
machines, including the total quantity of radiation to be delivered.  The
treatment planning computer system is usually a completely separate system from
the therapy machines.  Usually the information from the planning program must
be manually entered into the control console for the therapy machine (whether
or not the therapy machine itself is computer-controlled).  Recently some
vendors have produced treatment planning systems that allow some calculated
machine setup information to be loaded directly into a (computer-controlled)
treatment machine via some kind of network connection.

All treatment planning programs depend on tables of data representing actual
machine characteristics measured at the clinic.  Clinic staff must measure this
data and enter it into tables in the format required by the planning program.
These days, the data is often collected with the aid of a semi-automated "beam
scanner" that includes a small computer.  This system is usually completely
separate from both the therapy machine and the treatment planning system.
Sometimes there are facilities for loading data from the scanner into the
planning system via network, without having to type it in manually.

In addition, the therapy machines themselves have calibrations that must be
adjusted frequently by clinic staff.  On some of the newer computer-controlled
machines, a computer is involved in this process as well.

Besides the therapy machine, the treatment planning system, and the beam
scanner, clinics have other instruments that are used to calibrate the rest.

I hope I have conveyed that there are many steps and stages where the clinic
staff have the obligation to measure, record and update information that  must
be accurate and consistent.  Computing is involved in many of these stages. 
There are many opportunites for errors, in particular there  are many
opportunities for dose delivery errors other than the therapy machine itself.  
Clinics must have quality assurance procedures in place to detect and correct
the errors that do occur before they can affect patients.   To me, the most
alarming aspect of this recent story is that some kind of error was apparently 
allowed to remain uncorrected for years.

One thing that is important to understand is that many clinics do not depend
solely on stock equipment from vendors; some use quite elaborate procedures and
instruments that are custom built by clinic staff.   As part of this tradition,
it has long been common to use custom computer programs written by clinic staff
for treatment planning and other tasks.   Many clinics that own and use
commercially produced treatment planning systems and beam scanners also use
locally-written programs for some special applications, or to act as
pre-processors, post-processors or interfaces between purchased programs.
Moreover, almost all commercial offerings are actually adaptations of systems
that were originally developed by staff at some clinic to meet some local need.

Quite often there is no clear distinction between "the physicist" or "the
expert" and "the programmer".    Many people who develop software that is used
in radiation therapy clinics (including yours truly) also have clinical service
duties, and their formal education often does not include specialization in
computer science or software engineering.  I don't believe this is necessarily
a bad thing, but I think it is fair to say that the quality of the methods used
and of the resulting products varies a great deal.

&gt;  [The Therac 25 case was one of OVERdoses being life critical.
&gt;  It is appropriate to note that UNDERdoses may also be life critical.  PGN]

If a machine is expected to do it _right_ then people should have a way of
monitoring whether or not the machine did it right. There should be some way of
measuring what the machine is doing while it takes place.  They could monitor
the radiation and keep a record of what the patient actually received.

These machines should be subjected to routine measurements and calibration
checks to insure that they're doing what they should. The state department
of weights and measures goes around and verifies that gas pumps and
grocery scales are accurate. Shouldn't we expect that hospitals could
do the same to their radiation machines?

Any museum worth its salt has thermographs and humidigraphs all over
the place, recording on paper the temperature and humidity next to
their valuable relics. I'm sure that all of these buildings have central
heat/AC/climate control. But they stil use separate measuring tools to
verify the results of the automatic systems.

Perhaps we're just seeing the "black box to solve all your problems" mentality
in the buyers of these automated radiation machines. Or else it's another case
of cost containment.

&gt;&gt; With regard to computer risks in general:
&gt;&gt; I think it is time to establish licensing of software engineers, ...

Is it a meta-RISK that making such a controversial recommendation
(which has been beaten into the ground before) to such a large
audience is likely to flood PGN with responses to the point where he's
likely to ignore all of them?

  &gt; I think it is time to establish licensing of software engineers,...

I strongly disagree.

Licensure of most professions exists not to protect the public, but to restrict
entry into a field so as to artificially protect the wages of the professionals
belonging to the newly-formed guild. This concept of licensure goes back to
medieval times. One would think that we had advanced beyond feudal times, but
it appears that we have not. A recent cause celebre in Washington, DC has been
a hair salon fighting the districts strict cosmetologist licensing laws. You
heard me: licenses are required to style hair in Washington. The AMA has, via
its legal right to control accreditation of medical schools and licensure of
physicians, systematically reduced the supply of Doctors in our country, thus
driving up the price of health care. Lawyers manage every day to drive anyone
who is willing to help people fill out simple legal forms out of business with
lovely laws about practicing law without a license.

All of this is silly. There is little or no evidence that licensure
does anything other than creating a new protected class of people who
can jack up their fees arbitrarily because they can restrict entry
into their field. No studies or statistics exist to show that people
get better lawyers, cosmetologists, or even physicians, thanks to
licensing laws. However, in the absence of any substantive evidence
for quality improvements in the presense of licensure, people anxious
to run the lives of other people add hundreds of new protected classes
of people every year. Recently, the state of New Jersey created a new
protected class of food specialists. No one but a licensed dietitian
can pronounce your carrots nutritious these days; anyone else giving
out "dietary advice" can get their fannies whacked by the long arm of
the state licensing board.

Even if government licensing could increase safety, the costs involved would
have to be considered. Just as safety could be enhanced by forcing all cars to
travel under 10 MPH, but needed productive uses of automobiles would then be
eliminated, government licensing could drastically increase the costs of
software development without a commensurate improvement in safety.

Government is a fearsome weapon, and rarely a useful tool. I think of it in the
"guilty until proven innocent" category. Until someone can present clear and
sound evidence that licensure of software engineers has actually dropped the
number of dangerous product failures, without incurring excessive costs to
society, I will oppose the concept.

  &gt;I think it is time to establish licensing of software engineers,...

I might agree with this in theory, but want to point out that licensing and
review boards are not silver bullets, to borrow a phrase from Fred Brooks'
recent article in "Computer".

The history of civil/mechanical/electrical engineering is replete with examples
of disastrous projects designed by appropriately trained and licensed
engineers, and approved by suitably experienced review boards.  I'm not sure
the situation would be any different for software engineering; we just might
feel better about the issue if licensing and boards existed.

&gt;Many programmers of such systems have no knowledge whatsoever of the techniques
&gt;of reliable programming. They were the scientist, or expert, or whatever on the
&gt;object under software control, and were chosen to write the program because
&gt;they could hack out something that worked.

Sometimes they're chosen because they're the only person available who
understands the entire task at hand.  I wrote some of the firmware that
controls the X-ray tube gantry in the Omnimedical Quad-One CT scanner; I was
selected because I understood something about X-ray tubes, stepper motors,
power control circuitry, real-time software, 6809 assembler, sliding-ring
mechanics, and gate-level TTL circuit design.  A person with a better
background in software engineering almost certainly would have written better
code -- but they may not have understood the electromechanical aspects of the
system as well as I did.

&gt;Consequently, they turn out spaghetti.

Well, sometimes they turn out spaghetti, and sometimes they do a pretty good
job of organizing the code into something that's robust, testable, and
maintainable.  But "they" may turn out to be software engineering graduates or
medical physics specialists -- and it's hard to tell which by looking at their
code.

During the first session of the women's ice skating competition, the UKs number
1 skater, Joanne Conway, complained of biased scoring after the Canadian judge
gave her only 4.2 marks while all the other judges gave around 5.0 to 5.5.
Subsequently the Canadian judge has revealed that she intended to give 5.2
marks.  Each possible score has a separate button to press to signal the score
to the computerized scoring system.  By mistake the judge pressed 4.2 instead
of 5.2 and, even though she realized her mistake, there was no provision to
correct the mark.  The only way of correcting it would have been for the UK
team to lodge an official appeal - which wasn't considered worthwhile as it was
only the difference between 17th and 15th place.

In another incident the UK 2 man bob team, in the lead at that stage, went out
of contention after being kept at the start of 7 minutes while one of the
intermediate timing controls was fixed - note that this timer was not needed
for the actual result, just to give an intermediate split time. Perhaps another
indication of where technology becomes the master rather than the servant of
sport.  (Some people have tried to read a more sinister implication of a Swiss
engineer holding the leading team up for 7 minutes which help the Swiss No 1
bob go into the lead!)

    The "Unified" team now has to settle for good marks and Lennon music.
    Next time someone will figure out how to hack into the scoring computers.

    I wondered on several very obviously partisan judge's scorings, with
    outrageous (+/- outlier/outliar) scores, whether the judge was overtly
    trying to cheat ...  I thought they used to discount the highest and
    the lowest scores on judged events, but apparently not.  PGN]

AIRBUS CRASH PROBE CITES HUMAN, TECHNICAL ERROR
 
   PARIS, Feb 20, Reuters - French television said on Thursday a preliminary
report to be published next week on the causes of last month's Airbus A320
crash which killed 87 people did not blame the disaster on any single factor or
person.  The TF-1 channel said the independent commission's report concluded
that a mixture of human and technical error had caused the Air Inter flight
from Strasbourg to Lyon to plough into a snow-covered mountainside on January
20, just five minutes before it was scheduled to land.  Nine people survived.
TF-1 said the commission's findings showed the Strasbourg airport was not
equipped with landing approach systems matched to the sophistication of the
Airbus, and that there were serious failings in the crash plane's altimeter
system.  The commission concluded the pilot either did not know how or was
unable to stop the plane's abnormally rapid descent, according to TF-1.  The
station did not reveal how it gained access to the report.
   Publication of the report was delayed because Transport Minister Paul Quiles
is visiting Portugal on Friday and wants to study the findings before
commenting.
   The French civil aviation authority has already taken some preliminary
measures, urging all airlines flying the A320 to review their procedures for
using the VOR-DME beacon system for landing.  But the authorities decided
against grounding the planes, saying there was no initial evidence that
mechanical problems caused the disaster.
   National carriers Air France and Air Inter earlier this month banned their
pilots from using the automatic landing procedure until further notice.
   A spokeswoman for Toulouse-based Airbus Industrie said earlier the aircraft
maker did not yet have a copy of the report and would have no comment until it
did.  Meanwhile a judge investigating legal responsibility for the crash staged
a reconstruction flight on Thursday, circling the accident site three times.

By one of *those* coincidences, it was reported on TV the same week that a
branch of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) sent similarly misprinted forms
to some (as I recall, 80) taxpayers.  Two of the taxpayers had contacted each
other, then presumably the media, to share their disgust at the release of
income and savings data.  An ATO employee on the TV claimed that the misprints
had been caused by a folded page in a box of paper.

[Translated by DWW from the Berlin daily Newspaper "Tagespiegel", 22 Feb 1992]

lui, Rome, 21. February 1992. [...] Half a million Italians are the proud
owners of portable telephones. The cordless appliance has become the favorite
toy of the Southerners, but the game may soon be over: the "telefonini" are not
protected.

Under the motto "Buy one, pay for two", crooks sell manipulated phones that are
used so that the buyer has to pay for the toll calls of the seller.  The trick
works like this: the crooks take a computer with a computing program [whatever
that is ;-) dww] like the ones uses to crack automatic teller machines, and
fuss with it until they find the secret code for the telephone.  The code is a
combination of the telephone number and the serial number that is supposed to
only be available to the telephone company SIP.  When the code has been
cracked, it is no problem to transfer it to a second telephone, so that both
telephones have the same license number.  One phone is sold "under the hand" by
the crooks.  As an added deal, the buyer not only gets to pay his own phone
bill, but the fees run up on the second phone as well.  The Italian underworld
is especially keen on using this method.[...]  The mafia uses the "portabili"
for conducting their unclean business.

[... The police] have not been able to find the instigators, but they suspect
that employees of the telephone manufacturing company are involved, as they
have the knowledge of how the phones are constructed. [...]  The portable
telephone is well-known for the ease of tapping the telephone conversations
[which cannot, however, be traced to the place of origin. A book calle "Italy,
I hear you calling" with some of the more interesting tapped conversations has
just been published.]

[Why is such a telephone easy to crack and easy to reprogram?  dww]

risk to go into Risks, but I thought I'd let you decide.  --Randy]

In TELECOM Digest Volume 12 : Issue 108, the moderator (Patrick A.
Townson) discusses Ameritech Voice Mail Commands and Security Flaws: 

&gt;   After the message has played out, 5 to delete it; 7 to save it. 

Considering that the Aspen voice mail product (from Octel,I think) uses 7 to
delete a message, and that Aspen is widely used by businesses, this seems an
unfortunate choice, as people with Aspen at work and IBT RVMS at home will be
likely to confuse 7 and end up deleting messages by accident.  Of course, this
is not as serious a risk of nonstandardization as airline flight controls which
differ from model to model :-).

An Associated Press article on new processor chips announced at the
International Solid State Circuits Conference appeared in the (Minneapolis)
Star Tribune last Thursday.  It says, in the middle:
	Most of the chips use a technology called reduced instruction
	set computing (RISC), which speeds the processing of data
	by limiting the number of instructions the processor must execute.
	The microprocessors that power personal computers, by contrast,
	use a different technology.
Of course, limiting the number of instructions a processor knows how to execute
typically increases the number of instructions it must execute.

The Op-Ed page of The New York Times yesterday (Feb 23) has an essay by David
Gelernter from Yale's CS dept complaining that when newspapers (even The Times)
use the term "operating system", they feel obliged to define it.  But someone
who doesn't know what one is is "not going to learn on the basis of a single
phrase, no matter how artfully crafted".

He doesn't mention how misleading a single phrase can be, if crafted by
a reporter who doesn't know technology.

     [This is an article which I recently posted to comp.sys.handhelds and
     comp.sys.hp48.  It is in response to a discussion regarding the use of
     calculators on university exams.  I am posting it to comp.risks because it
     demonstrates the risk of introducing computing power into the classroom
     where it may be misused.  TMB]

I have reviewed the responses concerning calculator policies at universities
from all over the world.  Thank you to everyone for sending them.  The
following is my proposed policy.  This policy is intended to eliminate problems
associated with using note-style information, without eliminating the use of
the calculating power of these devices.  If you have any comments, please post
them after thinking them through fully.

   Proposed Policy Regarding the Use of Portable Calculating
           Devices during Closed-Note Examinations

	If a student uses a portable calculating device during a closed-note
examination for the purpose of storing notes, that student shall be considered
guilty of an infraction equivalent to using said notes as they would appear on
paper.

	In the case that a proctor believes beyond a reasonable doubt that a
student is violating the above policy, that proctor shall immediately remove
the calculating device from the student's possession.  The proctor may then
choose whether or not the student should be allowed to complete the
examination.  The calculating device shall remain in the possession of the
proctor until the contents of its memory--both vendor supplied and user
programmed--can be examined.

	The decision of whether or not the above policy has been violated
should be based upon the judgement of a faculty member who shall examine the
memory of the calculating device before it is returned to the student.  In the
case that the memory is found to contain information which, when transferred to
paper, would be considered an unallowable aid, the student shall be considered
guilty of the infraction described above.

	In the case that the student is found to not be in violation of the
above infraction, the student should be allowed to rewrite the examination if
the student so chooses.  Alternately, if the student is found to be in
violation, the student is subject to the same university policies that govern
the use of unallowed notes equivalent to that which would result from
transferring the memory of the calculating device to paper.
     In no case will the student forfeit possession of the calculating device
indefinitely.

Computer Hackers Get Into Private Credit Records

DAYTON - Computer hackers obtained confidential credit reports of Midwest
consumers from a credit reporting firm in Atlanta.  Atlanta-based Equifax said
a ring of 30 hackers in Dayton [Ohio] stole credit card numbers and bill-paying
histories of the consumers by using an Equifax customer's password.

Ronald J. Horst, security consultant for the company said the break-in
apparently began in January.  Police don't know if the password was stolen
or if an employee of the client company cooperated with the hackers.  Horst
said the hackers were apparently doing it just for fun.  No charges have
been filed.  Equifax will notify customers whose credit reports were taken.

[End of quotation]

The usual caveats about media reporting of computer-related topics apply here.
One thing I don't like about this article is the implication that since the
hackers were doing this for "fun", they won't be prosecuted.  Of course, the
article doesn't say that exactly, but I'll be watching to see if this case
goes any farther.

I'll also be waiting to see of I'm one of those people whose credit reports
were stolen, and, if so, what Equifax intends to do about it other than to
notify me.

VT Caller ID Decision

  VT Caller ID Decision
The Vermont Public Service Board has just released its Caller ID decision.
It's good result with an interesting new wrinkle.

Vermont will require that New England Telephone (NET) make free, per-call
blocking available to all subscribers.  NET will also be required to provide
free, per-line blocking to all subscribers with non-published telephone
numbers.  And NET will be required to provide free, per-line blocking to all
subscribers who have "a legitimate concern that it would be unsafe to transmit"
their telephone numbers, including clients, volunteers and staff associated
with domestic violence and sexual assault agencies.

The Hearing Officer initially recommended that such requests should be subject
to review by NET, but the Public Service Board rejected this approach.  The
Board ruled that all customers should be entitled to receive free per-line
blocking through a "simple declaration."

The Vermont Public Service Board thus found a clever solution to a difficult
problem that was first identified in the Pennsylvania Caller ID case.  In that
case, as in Vermont, concern was expressed that certain individuals may require
blocking to maintain personal safety.  But the Bell company's proposed
"certification procedure" left it unclear as to who would qualify for privacy
protection or how adverse decisions could be appealed.

For these reasons, the Pennsylvania court held that the certification procedure
violated basic due process rights.  (The Pennsylvania court also found that
Caller ID violated the state wiretap statute and the state constitutional right
of privacy and ruled that the service could not be offered in the state).

The due process problem -- deciding who is entitled to greater privacy
protection and who gets to makes the decision -- remains one of the most
interesting and difficult issues in the Caller ID debate.

In ruling that phone subscribers should be entitled to decide for themselves
whether per-line blocking is appropriate, Vermont has avoided the due process
problem that arose in Pennsylvania.

In the Vermont proceeding, CPSR was asked to serve as the Board's expert
witness after the Board determined that "there existed a serious imbalance in
the respective parties' ability to present evidence on all relevant issues."

New England Telephone then retained Harvard Law School Professor and Legal
Affairs TV Commentator Arthur Miller as their expert.  Professor Miller had
earlier stated that Caller ID should be offered without blocking, but in this
case acknowledged that per-call blocking might be an appropriate solution.

CPSR provided extensive testimony for the Vermont Public Service Board on the
privacy implications of Caller ID after carefully reviewing concerns expressed
by those affiliated with domestic violence shelters in the state.

Jeff Helgesen relates a Chicago Tribune article on the sharp increase in Carpal
Tunnel Syndrome (repetitive-motion disorder) and the discussion about high-risk
workplace environments.  The article said, in part,

|When someone applies force over and over to the same group of muscles,
|the same joint or the tendon, the result may be tissue tears and trauma.
|Other factors causing damage are awkward joint posture and prolonged
|constrained posture. 

I have no doubt that this is true as stated.  However, anecdotal
evidence causes me to wonder if we're missing something.  (I emphasize
that this is anecdotal.)  Every sufferer of carpal tunnel of whom I am
personally aware is a cashier at a supermarket.  Yet, I work in a
laboratory where some very intensive computing activity takes place.  We
have people who frequently spend more than 10 hours out of 24 at
keyboards.  I am unaware of any carpal tunnel cases here (although I
admit the possibility).  This causes me to wonder:

	What part does psychological or emotional stress play in the
	development of repetitive-motion disorders?

Supermarket cashiers do the work largely for the money.  Folks at this lab work
here for the same reason, but there is great job satisfaction, (dare I call it
"fun?") here that doesn't exist at the grocery store.  Does it matter?

(It's no less a risk either way, but it's better to understand the risk as much
as possible.)

   <A HREF="/Risks/13.15.html">RISKS-13.15</A>.  She pointed out that there are lots of parts of the body

(This is being posted on behalf of M. Stuart Lynn)

As I am sure you are aware, a new Macintosh virus, MBDF-A, has been detected in
the Info-Mac archives at SUMEX-AIM that has also been mirrored to other
archives. Furthermore, it appears that the virus may have originated from or
have been vectored through a machine at Cornell.

Other folks are addressing issues of detection, elimination, and prevention. I
just want you to know that we at Cornell take this situation most seriously,
and are doing everything we can to track down the origin and the originator of
this virus. The university absolutely deplores this kind of behavior, and
should it indeed prove that the originator was a member of this community we
will pursue all appropriate remedies under our computer abuse policy.

If anyone out there has any relevant technical information that would help us
track down the originator, I would appreciate it if you would send it to Tom
Young (XMU@cornellc.cit.cornell.edu).

     FBI Eavesdropping Challenged
   WASHINGTON (AP, 17 Feb 1992)
   Cellular telephones and other state-of-the art telecommunications technology
are seriously challenging the FBI's ability to listen to the telephone
conversations of criminal suspects, law enforcement officials say.  The FBI is
seeking $26.6 million next year to update its eavesdropping techniques.
Normally tight-lipped FBI officials become even more closed-mouthed when the
subject of investigative "sources and methods" comes up.  But a review of the
bureau's 1993 budget request provides an unusual glimpse into the FBI's
research on electronic surveillance and its concerns about new technologies.
   "Law enforcement is playing catchup with the telecommunications industry's
migration to this technology," said the FBI's budget proposal to Congress. "If
electronic surveillance is to remain available as a law enforcement tool,
hardware and software supporting it must be developed."
   The new technologies include digital signals and cellular telephones.  At
the same time, there has been an increase in over-the-phone transmission of
computer data, which can be encrypted through readily available software
programs, say industry experts and government officials.
   The FBI's five-year research effort to develop equipment compatible with
digital phone systems is expected to cost $82 million, according to
administration figures.  
   The FBI effort is just a part of a wider research program also financed by
the Pentagon's secret intelligence budget, said officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Electronic surveillance, which includes both telephone wiretaps and
microphones hidden in places frequented by criminal suspects, is a key tool for
investigating drug traffickers as well as white-collar and organized crime.
   Conversations recorded by microphones the FBI placed in the New York City
hangouts of the Gambino crime family are the centerpiece of the government's
case against reputed mob boss John Gotti, now on trial for ordering the murder
of his predecessor, Paul Castellano.
   Taps on the phones of defense consultants provided key evidence in the
Justice Department's long running investigation of Pentagon procurement fraud,
dubbed "Operation Ill Wind."  But with the advent of digital phone signals, it
is difficult to unscramble a single conversation from the thousands that are
transmitted simultaneously with computer generated data and images, industry
officials said.
   "In the old days all you had to do was take a pair of clip leads and a head
set, put it on the right terminal and you could listen to the conversation,"
said James Sylvester, an official of Bell Atlantic Network Services Inc.  But
digital signal transmission makes this task much more difficult. Conversations
are broken into an incoherent stream of digits and put back together again at
the other end of the line.
   John D. Podesta, a former counsel to the Senate Judiciary's law and
technology subcommittee, said the FBI and other law enforcement agencies are
simply victims of a technological revolution.  For more than 50 years the basic
telephone technology remained the same.

REPORTEDLY A LEGISLATIVE "FIRST"
   This effort in "electronic democracy" may be the first time that state 
legislation has been distributed online, for access by the general public, 
at the same time it becomes available to legislators and their staff.
   A senior member of the Senate computer system's technical staff reportedly 
said they have never-before down-loaded a machine-readable copy of initial 
legislation onto a personal computer for redistribution on public computer 
networks.
  Furthermore, Sen. Lockyer's Legislative Assistant responsible for the bill 
said he knows of no prior instance where legislative staff have gone online 
on public nets to seek citizen input and discussion about new legislation.

SOURCES OF ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS &amp; INFORMATION
   Mr. Ben Firschein is the Legislative Assistant to Sen. Lockyer who is

REPRESENTING LEGISLATION-IN-PROGRESS: A NOTATION PROBLEM
   In the California Senate, printed legislation-in-progress uses the 
following conventions:
  When stating new legislation, *plain-text* states PROPOSED law.
  When *amending* current law, *plain-text* states the CURRENT law, and 
*strike-thru text* indicates current law to be deleted while *underscored* or 
*italicized* text represents wording to be added to those current statutes.  
Deletions and additions represented by strike-thru and underlining or italics 
*amend* current law.
  But, the basic ASCII character-set -- and a great many older terminals and 
computer printers -- have no strike-thru, italics or underlining.  So, here 
is how that unavailable notation is represented in this document:
    [[ annotation ]] -- explanatory comments by "uploader" Jim Warren
       all capitals  -- originally bold-face text; no legislative meaning
  Unless stated as amending current law:
       plain-text    -- text of new legislation, proposed to be new law
  When stated as amending current law:
       plain-text    -- text of current law to remain unchanged
    &lt;&lt; strikethru &gt;&gt; -- text in current law, proposed for deletion
    {{ underscore }} -- text proposed to be added to current law.

THE BEGINNING ...
  The introduction of this legislation in the Senate is the beginning of 
a lengthy process or review and revision by amendment, prior to its possible 
passage into law.
  Please send your comments and suggestions about the legislation -- and 
about the Senate staff's active cooperation in making it publicly available, 
online -- to Mr. Firschein and Sen. Lockyer.

legal meaning, I changed Mr. Firschein's underlined text to all-caps. ****]]

                       California State Senate

TO: Interested parties
FROM: Ben Firschein, Senator Lockyer's Office
DATE: February 14, 1992

RE: BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON SB 1447 (LOCKYER, PRIVACY)
   You should have received a copy of SB 1447 (Lockyer, Privacy) in the mail 
recently.  Senator Lockyer introduced the bill in an effort to address some 
of the concerns raised at the privacy hearing on December 10, 1991.
   This memorandum is intended to explain the intent of the various sections 
of the bill, but it is not a committee analysis.
   (A committee analysis will be forthcoming at a later date, when the bill 
is set for a hearing).  We welcome suggestions as to how to clarify the 
language of the bill, or otherwise improve the bill.


SECTION 1: CITATION
   The bill may be cited as the "Privacy Act of 1992"

SECTION 2: INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM DRIVER'S LICENSES
   This section requires the written consent of a consumer for a business 
entity to (1) sell information obtained from the consumer's driver's license 
or (2) use such information to advertise goods or services.
   The section is intended to cover instances where a consumer presents a 
driver's license or identification card for identification purposes during a 
business transaction.  The section is not intended to prevent businesses from 
using driver's license information for business record-keeping, or for other 
purposes related to the transaction (i.e. authorizing a transaction).
   The section is not intended to change existing law with respect to the 
ability of businesses to obtain driver's license information from other 
sources (such as DMV records).
   The need for this section is heightened by the new "magstripe" drivers 
license developed by the Department of Motor Vehicles.  This license has a 
magnetic stripe on the back which contains much of the information on the 
front of the license.  The stripe will enable a business entity to store 
information contained on a driver's license simply by scanning the card 
through a reader.
   A publication by the Department of Motor Vehicles dated May 1991 
("Department of Motor Vehicles Magnetic Stripe Drivers License/Identification 
Card") states that "using point of sale (POS) readers and printers, the 
business community can electronically record the DL [driver's license] /ID 
number on receipts and business records."  The publication notes that 
"magnetic stripe readers are readily available, relatively low in cost, and 
are already available in many retail outlets."  
   However, a merchant might access much more than the driver's license/ID 
number; the publication notes that "readers have been produced, and market 
available readers can be modified that will read the three tracks of 
information contained on the California card."  According to the publication, 
the tracks contain information such as license type, name, address, sex, 
hair-color, eye-color, height, weight, restrictions, issue date.

SECTION 3: 
DEPRIVATION OF THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY OF EMPLOYEES OR PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES
   This section provides that an employer shall be liable to an employee or 
prospective employee for damages caused by subjecting an employee to 
discipline or discharge or denying employment to a prospective employee, on 
account of the exercise by that person of privacy rights guaranteed by the 
California Constitution. 
   This section is modeled after Connecticut Labor Code Section 31-51q.  The 
Lockyer bill goes further than the Connecticut statute in that it applies to 
prospective as well as current employees. 
   The bill would allow punitive damages and reasonable attorney's fees to be 
awarded pursuant to Section 3 (page 3 lines 10-12).
   The bill would specify that if the court decides that an action for 
damages was brought by an employee or a prospective employee without 
"substantial justification," the court may award costs and reasonable 
attorney's fees to the employer (page 3, lines 12-15).
   As with the Connecticut statute, an employee's cause of action would only 
exist if the activity for which the employee was disciplined or discharged 
did not "substantially interfere with the employee's bona fide job 
performance or working relationship with the employer." (Page 3, lines 4-5). 
   POSSIBLE AMENDMENT: The language in the bill covering prospective 
employees (page 3, lines 6-9) omits the "substantial interference" language 
contained in the section covering existing employees.  Perhaps the bill 
should specify that a prospective employee lacks a cause of action if the 
prospective employer has a compelling business interest in rejecting someone 
because they engaged in certain acts (even though those acts were protected 
by the constitutional right to privacy).
   Such an amendment would be consistent with cases such SOROKA V. DAYTON 
HUDSON CORPORATION, 91 Daily Journal D.A.R. 13204 (1st Appellate District).  
The court in SOROKA found that a psychological screening test administered to 
Target Store security officer applicants violated the applicants' state 
constitutional right to privacy when it inquired about their religious 
beliefs and sexual orientation, because there was no compelling need for the 
test.
   POSSIBLE AMENDMENT # 2: One of the participants in the privacy hearing 
suggests language making it clear that the rights and remedies set forth in 
the section are not exclusive and do not pre-empt or limit any other 
available remedy. 
   POTENTIAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS SECTION: Some may argue that in light of 
cases such as Soroka, this statute is unnecessary, because these rights are 
already set forth in existing case law. 
   They may also point out that the California Supreme Court held in WHITE V. 
DAVIS that the right to privacy is self-executing, meaning that every 
Californian has standing to sue directly under Article I, Section I of the 
California Constitution for a privacy violation.  WHITE V. DAVIS (1975) 13 
Cal.3d 757, 775.  Given that the right to privacy is self-executing, why is a 
statute needed?
   The answer is that case law is in a state of flux, and there is no 
guarantee that future courts will construe Article I in such a liberal 
fashion.  Also, the bill is an improvement over existing case law in that it 
specifically lists the types of damages that may be awarded, including 
punitive damages, and reasonable attorney's fees.

SECTION 4. COMPUTER CRIMES
   Jim Warren (one of the witnesses at the hearing) posted the Leg Counsel 
draft of the bill on one of the networks and showed me some of the responses.
This section generated most of the comments, some of which were quite vocal.
   First a word of caution to those uninitiated in the ways of the 
Legislature: MOST OF THE LANGUAGE IN THIS SECTION IS EXISTING LAW.  Our 
proposed additions are contained in language that is in italics or 
underlined.  IF IT IS NOT IN ITALICS OR UNDERLINES, IT IS EXISTING LAW.
   PROPOSED ADDITION #1 (page 7, line 25): Extend the existing computer crime 
statute [Penal Code Section 502] to allow civil recovery by any injured party 
against someone convicted under Section 502 of breaking into a computer. (The 
existing law just allows recovery by the owner or lessee of a computer 
system). For example, if someone is convicted under Section 502 of breaking 
into TRW's computers and altering credit records, the existing statute would 
allow TRW to recover against the hacker in a civil suit, but the statute 
would not allow someone whose credit history was injured by the hacker to sue 
the hacker under statute.
   PROPOSED ADDITION #2 (page 7, lines 30-33): Extend Penal Code Section 502 
to allow civil recovery against a convicted hacker for more than just the 
cost of expenditures necessary to verify that a computer system was or was 
not altered, damaged, or deleted by the access.  The proposed language would 
allow civil recovery for ALL CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES resulting 
from the intrusion. 
   PROPOSED ADDITION #3 (page 7, lines 38-40 &amp; page 8, lines 1-6): Create a 
cause of action against those who "recklessly store or maintain data in a 
manner which enables a person to commit acts leading to a felony conviction 
under this section."
   The section is intended to address the situation where someone stores 
information (e.g. credit data) in a manner which easily allows unauthorized 
access, and the person who is able to access the information as a result of 
the lack of safeguards injures a third party (e.g. a creditor, or a person 
whose credit history is altered).
   The source of the section is the case of PEOPLE V. GENTRY 234 Cal.App.3d 
131 (1991).  In that case, a hacker figured out that if he queried the credit 
databases of TRW, CBI, or Trans Union, about a nonexistent person, each 
system would create a new file for that non-existent person.  The non-
existent person would have an exemplary credit history, because there was no 
negative credit information in the new file.  The hacker in the GENTRY case 
went into the business of rehabilitating people's credit history by having 
them change their name, and then creating credit files on these "new" people.
   The court stated in a footnote "we do not address the potential liability 
to innocent third parties who might be harmed by this feature of the software 
program.  Although Gentry found a weakness in the program and exploited it, 
responsibility should not rest solely with the felon. Credit reporting 
companies should recognize that this flaw is needlessly risky and remedy it." 
(GENTRY, page 135, footnote 3). 
   POTENTIAL CONCERNS:  some people who have seen the bill worry that section 
4 would apply to someone (e.g. a computer bulletin board operator) who stores 
information on a computer about how to commit a crime (e.g. information about 
how to break into a computer, or how to build a bomb)
   The section is intended to be limited to reckless storage of data in a 
manner which enables a person to commit acts LEADING TO A FELONY CONVICTION 
UNDER SECTION 503 (not other types of criminal acts).  "Reckless storage" is 
intended to mean maintaining a system that lacks appropriate security 
safeguards; it is not intended to include storing information about how to 
commit crimes. Hopefully any potential ambiguities can be clarified through 
amendments. 
   PROPOSED ADDITION #4: The bill requires the reporting to local law 
enforcement of violations of the computer crime statute (Penal Code Section 
503) within 60 days after such violations become known to the owner or lessee 
of a computer system (page 8, lines 26-34).  The bill states that "failure to 
report a previous violation of this section to a local law enforcement 
agency...may constitute evidence of [reckless storage of data]."
   This is intended to ensure that people report such crimes to law 
enforcement.  There are anecdotal reports that some of these crimes are not 
being reported because people are concerned about bad publicity resulting 
from reports that their systems were broken into.
   POSSIBLE AMENDMENT: it has been suggested that the reporting requirement 
be limited to certain types of systems, or to a certain level of monetary 
loss.  Objections have been raised that the bill would apply equally to 
someone who operates a home computer and to a business that operates a large 
mainframe.  One could argue that the reporting requirement is more essential 
where a computer owner has a fiduciary or quasi-fiduciary duty to the people 
whose records are stored on the system (e.g. accounting or credit records).  
An accountant's or a credit company's failure to report a computer break-in 
is more serious than a computer game bulletin board operator's failure to 
report a break in.
   One possible objection to restricting the reporting requirement to a 
certain level of financial loss is that financial loss is hard to quantify.
   However, Section 503 already uses amount of financial loss to determine 
the type of criminal penalty to apply, so one could argue that amount of 
monetary loss could similarily be used as an indication of the need to 
report.

SECTION 5. AUTOMATIC VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS
   Existing law directs Caltrans to develop specifications for automatic 
vehicle tracking systems for toll facilities, such as those on bridges 
(Streets and Highways Code 27565).  People will soon be able have a device 
installed in their car which allows them to drive through a toll facility 
without stopping.  The device will send a signal to a computer,  which will 
keep track of their use of the facility.  At the end of the month, they will 
get a bill. Presumably there will continue to be booths that people can drive 
through and pay cash.
   At the December 10 privacy hearing, concern was expressed that the device 
offers potential for abuse.  For example, if you know a particular vehicle is 
driving through the facility, why not program the system to:
   1. Stop all people with outstanding warrants
   2.  Stop all people who have not paid their vehicle registration 
   3.  Compile lists of all people who drove through the facility during a 
given month and sell the lists to the private sector.
   One could argue that uses 1 and 2 are legitimate uses of this technology, 
because people who have broken the law should expect to come into contact 
with the police when they drive on public roads and highways.  But one could 
also argue that people have an expectation of privacy when they drive and are 
not breaking the law at the time they are stopped (e.g. they are not 
speeding, driving under the influence, or otherwise doing anything to attract 
the attention of the police). 
   Use # 3 is harder to justify.  Why should people have to reveal their 
personal lives to the private sector in order to use a device that will speed 
up their commute?
   WHAT THE BILL DOES: The bill allows people the option of prepaying their 
tolls, and then using the facility anonymously. People would continue to have 
the option of being billed, rather than prepaying tolls.  
   Under the bill, people who prepaid their tolls would be given an 
identification number unrelated to the vehicle owner's name, address, social 
security number, or driver's license number, or the vehicle's license number, 
vehicle identification number, or registration (page 10, lines 34-40).  When 
they drive through the facility, the facility would look at their account, 
and let them through if there was still money in the account.
   The bill provides that once a numbered account has been established, 
neither Caltrans nor a private facility shall keep any record of the vehicle 
owner's name, address, social security number, or driver's license number, or 
the vehicle's license number, vehicle identification number, or registration 
(Page 11, lines 1-7).
   The user could make additional prepayments under the bill by specifying 
the account number and furnishing payment (Page 11, lines 8-10).

A fingerprint found in an unsolved 1984 murder of an 84-year-old woman was kept
in the San Francisco police database all these years.  Recently the SF print
database was linked with the Alameda County database.  The old print matched a
new one taken in connection with a petty theft case, and so eight years later
the police were able to solve the old case (burglary, arson, homicide).  The
two girls implicated were 12 and 15 at the time.  [Source: Article by Stephen

From the Feb. 21 Toronto Globe and Mail...

"A misplaced computer byte has forced a daily newspaper in Kingston to chew a
sizeable hunk out of its budget for 1992. The $300,000 glitch, discovered last
month, means the Whig Standard will be hiring only two students to work as
reporters or editors this summer instead of five, and also has forced it to
reduce its spending for freelance stories, editor Neil Reynolds says.  The
computer in the newspapers accounting department somehow managed to understate
editorial cost by $300,000 when it spewed out editorial budget planning numbers
last fall.....  The newspaper is thoght to have a total editorial budget of
about $3 million a year."

What is interesting about this particular error is the size of the error
compared to the budget : 10%. Surely some cursory review should have identified
an error of this magnitude.

Quotes from an article in the New Scientist 15 Feb 1992:

The US Army's Patriot missiles missed many of the Iraqi missiles that the US
thought they had shot down during the Gulf War, according to a new analysis.
Iraqi's modified Scud missile, called the Al-Husayn, was difficult to hit
because it was so unstable that it broke into pieces when it reentered the
atmosphere, creating a confusing barrage of debris.

Ted Postol, a professor at MIT, re-examined the Patriot's war record at the
request of a Congressional committee.  He found that deploying Patriot missiles
defences did not reduce damage during Iraq's missile attacks on Israel and
Saudi Arabia.

Postol then examined videotapes recored by TV journalists that seemed to show
the Patriot missiles successfully intercepting Al-Husayn missiles.  Paytheon,
the Patriot's manufacturer, has used this footage to promote its missile.
Incoming Iraqi missiles are visible on the videotapes because of their
velocity, about two metres per second, {that must be a mistype in the article,
I expect it should be two kilometers per second W.} makes them glow
incandescently as they re-enter the athmosphere.  The videotape also captures
the explosions of the Patriot interceptors.

Postol played these videotapes in slow motion to an audience of the AAAS.  As
the Patriot detonations flashed on the screen, Postol stopped the tape to show
how far these explosions were from the glowing Al-Husayn warheads.  In most
cases, the Iraqi Al-Husayn warhead appeared to fly straight on unharmed.  In
one case, there was a fireball as the Iraqi warhead exploded on impact with the
ground.

The army claims that the Patriots successfully intercepted 45 of the 47
missiles they tried to shoot down.  But Postol says the tapes show that in some
of these cases, the Patriots missed their targets by at least a kilometer.
Postal measures this distance by comparing the relative motions of the Patriot
fireball, which stays in one place, and the Al-Husayn warhead.

The Patriot had a particularly hard time hitting the Al-Husayn because of
problems with the Iraqi missile.  Iraqi engineers had extended the range of the
Soviet Scud-B missile by lengthening its fuel tanks and making its warhead much
lighter.  The changes made the missile unstable, and caused the Al-Husayn to
flop belly-first as it re-entered the athmosphere, often breaking up in the
process.  the Patriot missile had to distinguish between the Al-Husayn's
warhead and other debris such as the empty fuel tank and tail fins which rained
from from the sky.  In effect, the Iraqi missile released unintended but
effective "decoys" to distract the Patriot, said Postol.  Ther Patriot had its
own problems as well.  One software bug could have directed the Patriot to
attempt to intercept an incoming missile at a point below ground.  In one case
this bug may have caused a Patriot to turn back and dive into the ground.

Postol argues that the effectiveness of the Al-Husayn's unintended decoys shows
how extremely simple factors can frustrate attempts to shoot down ballistics
missiles.  This could teach scepticism when it comes to evaluating the claims
made for missile defence technologies, such as plans for the US Star Wars
system.

Raytheon disputes Postol's conclusions, but has not yet made public a detailed
analysis that would rebut his claims.  Defenders of the Patriot believe the
damage on the ground could have come from falling debris rather than from
detonations of the Iraqi missile's warhead.

  [It is funny how what starts as a great success, turns out less than so, when
  investigated. It also demonstrates that very simple systems can (and do)
  prevent the high technology systems working, as well as showing that
  designers of such systems get a mindset as assumes the opponents have the
  same mindset.  This is not always so...    Lord John - The Programming Peer]

On National Public Radio's Morning Edition program this AM, one report
concerned the series of crashes that have plagued the Airbus 320.  According to
this report, MOST 320 aircraft have an alarm that informs the pilot that s/he
is flying too low, but France does not require this alarm and so aircraft sold
to and/or operated by French companies do not have this alarm installed.

I don't even qualify as a dabbler in this area, but if I recall correctly, at
least 2 out of 3 crashes, and possibly all 3, involved French aircraft.  Since
they have also been somewhat similar (an apparently _unnoticed_ loss of
altitude), could this help to explain what happened?

If so, this points to a particularly interesting human interface problem --
perhaps the A320 tends to drop faster than other aircraft, but, since there is
no alarm, [some] pilots do not realize what is happening until they're too low
to do anything about it.

Any comments from qualified persons?

There was a big case in the Netherlands over 5 years ago where they did the
same. The scheme involved renting a mobile phone from the Dutch PTT, copying
the EPROM, transfering the EPROM to a mobile phone which had been stolen, and
then returning the rented phone. This way, as the phone gets re-rented again
to various persons, the bill gets spread out, and it will be less obvious.

BTW, what inferior kind of ATM's do they have in Italy that let you tamper
with the EPROMS inside? Maybe we have some over here in Holland too? :-)

2 Cornell Students Arrested for Spreading Computer Virus
LEE A. DANIELS, N.Y. Times News Service

   Two Cornell University undergraduates were arrested Monday night and charged
with developing and spreading a computer virus that disrupted computers as far
away as California and Japan, Cornell officials said.  M. Stewart Lynn, vice
president for information technologies at the university in Ithaca, N.Y.,
identified the students as David Blumenthal and Mark Pilgrim.  Lynn said that
both Blumenthal, who is in the engineering program, and Pilgrim, in the college
of arts and sciences, were 19-year-old sophomores.  They were arrested Monday
night by Cornell and Ithaca police officers.  Lynn said the students were
arraigned in Ithaca City Court on charges of second-degree computer tampering,
a misdemeanor, and taken to the county jail.  Lynn said authorities believed
that the two were responsible for a computer virus planted in three Macintosh
games on Feb. 14.  [...]
   He identified the games as Obnoxious Tetris, Tetricycle and Ten Tile Puzzle.
The virus may have first appeared in a Stanford University public computer
archive and spread from there through computer users who loaded the games into
their own computers.
   Lynn said officials at Cornell and elsewhere became aware of the virus last
week and quickly developed what he described as ``disinfectant'' software to
eradicate it.  He said officials traced the virus to Cornell last week, but he
would not specify how that was done or what led officials to the two students.
Lynn said he did not yet know how much damage the virus had caused.  ``At
Cornell we absolutely deplore this kind of behavior,'' he said.

   [reference to RTM deleted.]  

AP item notes both are being held in the Tompkins County Jail on $10,000 bail.

The long term issues are challenging.  In a very few years, the subtablet-size
portable computer will have replaced the calculator as the issue for exams.
These systems will have a few megabytes (32, 64, 1GB?) of space (between the
paging devices and the primary memory) and a full GUI interface.  They will be
preferable to notepaper (especially the pen or its successors complementing the
keyboard).  Even more so than the current personal computers, these systems
will be an integral part of how people solve problems.  Since they are also the
reference devices, it is unclear what the distinction will be between and open
book exam and a closed book (def: a device for presenting information) exam.

Of course, one can ban them from closed book exams, but that would reduce 
closed book exams to an abstract exercise unrelated to actual practice.

The problems become worse when we have the WAN infrastructure so that the
systems have builtin packet radio connections that are an integral part of
their operation.  While we can still have Faraday Cage exams, they too would be
useful for testing the ability to survive without intellectual assists, but
would not test the more important ability to take full advantage of the
technologic infrastructure.

While I sometimes go off the technical deepend in predicting what is going to
happen, I'm already working with the early forms of these technologies so the
issue is one of timing rather than possibility.

Considering that computers have still had little impact on the educational
system, once these systems drop below crucial price points they will rapidly
overwhelm the schools. I'm presuming the appropriate UI's will be available and
that the impediments are mainly economic.

Todd M. Bezenek KO0N &lt;plains!bezenek@uunet.uu.net&gt; communicates his proposed
policy regarding the use of calculators on closed note university exams.  In
brief, he would take possession of a device which he (the proctor) believes to
have been used to violate the intent of closed-note examinations.  He would
have a faculty member judge whether the calculating machine and its memory
content provided an illegal aid to the test-taking student.

I guess he never heard of "due process."  If you try that in universities
supported by public funds, you run the risk of being sued by the student.  His
procedure sets up a couple of faculty as a "kangaroo court" (what does that
mean, anyhow?) to judge whether a student cheated.

High-tech times may call for low-tech solutions.  I simply do not permit the
use of calculating devices on Computer Science examinations and quizzes.  The
reasoning is simple:

  Programmers should be proficient, personally, in computation.

  a. Having to work out a few numerical examples by hand can help budding
     programmers hone their ability to see more than one way to do a
     computation.

  b. Using this ability can provide "sanity checks" on their software.

  c. Programmers should be able to get the answer even when their batteries
     have run down.

I fear that at least some of the human-induced software faults discussed so
often in this forum can be traced to the lack of computational skill on the
part of the programmer involved.

In <A HREF="/Risks/13.16.html">RISKS-13.16</A> Todd M. Bezenek proposed a policy for dealing with "the use of
calculators on university exams."  His posting "demonstrates the risk of
introducing computing power into the classroom where it may be misused."

Unfortunately, such a policy, short of banning a student from using his/her
*own* calculator, could not beat technology.  For example, it is easy to
imagine a calculator that can be activated only by a (say 10 digit) PIN.
Today's photocopiers can operate in this fashion.  The new trick is to require
periodical input (say every 3 minute) of the PIN.  If PIN is not typed in in
time, the calculator locks itself, and starts scrambling some parts of the
memory (using the PIN as key).  then erase the key from memory afterwards.  To

At the risk of starting a lengthy and somewhat off-topic debate, I'd like to
remark that I don't think there's actually any technological risk involved
here.

The "problem" is that calculators with memories enable students to store data
and retrieve it during the exam.  The only reason this is a "problem" at all is
that almost all exams are based around parrot-style repetition of memorized
"facts".

The solution to the "problem" is to allow all students to take in whatever
reference materials they like.  Then the examination will necessarily have to
be a real test of problem-solving ability rather than a test of the candidate's
ability to regurgitate memorized data.

Of course, the problem then is that ability in examinations might in some
way tally with the candidate's ability to work in real-world situations.

&gt;             The calculating device shall remain in the possession of the
&gt; proctor until the contents of its memory--both vendor supplied and user
&gt; programmed--can be examined.

What exactly are you going to do about the "vendor-supplied" part of the
memory?  Many calculators now have common physical constants stored in their
ROMs; is that unfair to those who aren't allowed to take in a databook?

If so, doesn't that mean that allowing people to take in a calculator which
performs logarithms or statistical functions is unfair to those not allowed to
take in log tables or statistical analysis reference books?

Brint Cooper states that all sufferers from carpal tunnel syndrome that he
knows are cashiers, and that none of the computer folks he knows suffer from
it.  He goes on to wonder if stress may play a role.  I can't answer that
question, but I can state, from both first-hand and second-hand knowledge, that
computer users do indeed suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome.

In my own case, the carpal tunnel syndrome is fairly mild -- but I have bad
problems with tendonitis.  Nor was the orthopedist in any doubt about what
caused my symptoms -- his first question to me was ``do you use a computer
keyboard much?''  He went on to state that most of his patients with tendonitis
of the wrist or elbow, or carpal tunnel syndrome, were heavy computer users.

That aside, I also know of several others who have suffered from both problems,
including at least one who needed surgery.  Psychological stress may contribute
-- but don't discount the purely-mechanical.

No, I don't discount the physical causes of carpal syndrome, tendonitis, and
other occupational risks of keyboards.  But I must tell you of my daughter who
had such a case of tendonitis at age 14 that her hand literally locked up at
the (piano) keyboard during a music lesson.  I don't believe I'm violating her
privacy to relate that this was a very stressful time for her for many reasons.
Today, 15 years later, she's got a handle on the stress.  Also, she can and
does play piano for 5-6 hours at a time.  It's necessary; it's how she makes
her living.

Physicians and others who are looking for the connection between computer
keyboards and orthopaedic disease must consider the stress factors.  I'd HATE
to spend 8-9 hours per day keyboarding credit card information for VISA, but
I've often spent that much time and more at keyboards building software, doing
computations, and writing scientific reports.  If we're going to build a
low-risk workplace, we must address *all* the risks, not merely those that are
fashionable.

I know several sufferers of CTS, and all of them are musicians. My mother was
operated on both wrists, and she never had any problems with it any more.
Likewise with the other musicians I know. (Most notedly string players) Here at
wotk also I know of at least one case, in which the sufferer was a programmer.
So also keyboard action can give it you for sure. I am pretty sure that stress
and other psychological factors are involved, but bad muscular techniques are
the no. 1 cause.

I detect a dangerous elitism in this kind of observation.  The author makes a
sociological generalization based upon a tiny, non-random observational sample
with no controls.  We all tend to do this, but let's recognize that it's sloppy
thinking.

Just two points (the first about the social categories affected, the second
about cultural anthropology):

1. The syndrome occurs in all kinds of work environments.  In my own personal
sphere, which again is non-representative, two of my friends suffer from the
syndrome.  They're Associated Press reporters in a fancy, white-collar New York
office who work on outmoded, non-ergonomic keyboards that are holdovers from
AP's early computerization efforts.  There's a potentially precedent-setting
class action suit wending its way through the courts involving numerous AP
reporters who report the syndrome.  There are people in their early 30's who
can't do simple things without pain, like raising a full cup of coffee to their
lips.

2. If you've studied anthropology, you know how hard it is to "see your own
kind."  All social theorizing has built into it lots of preconceptions we're
only minimally aware of.  Brinton says he's not aware of reports among his
colleagues of CT syndrome; having worked for 2 years in a fast-paced immunology
research lab, I would suggest that many hard-driven people choose to ignore
substantial pain in pursuit of their goals.  (Ever heard about the football
player who had his pinkie cut off, rather than submit to a lengthy course of
surgery, so he wouldn't have to miss 4 weeks of the season?)

Do harp players have low job satisfaction? Are they doing it only for the
money? It's probably inaccurate to say that all cashiers/secretaries/etc. are
unhappy in their jobs. While these exceptions may not entirely refute your
anecdotal evidence, I think a better causal explanation can be found. Even if
most people getting CTS are not satisfied with their jobs, you need something
that explains why those who are satisfied also develop it. Something involving
the type of repetitive movement is probably a more proximate cause of the
injury.

I wonder if the low incidence of CTS among your computer lab friends is
explained by the way they type? Do most programmers touch-type using all ten
fingers? Also, how fast do they really type, anyway? I type between 50 and 90,
depending on the keyboard. Someone can manage to type fairly quickly (tho' not
90 wpm) using a few fingers, but the TYPE of repetitive movement is different.
Also, most computer programmers can't type as quickly when they actually have
to compose what they are typing. Some of their time is also spent searching,
scanning the text, compiling, munching M&amp;Ms &lt;tm&gt; ...  :) -S.  -- Disclaimer: I

	I didn't expect the reaction that my piece on the relative risks of the
physical act of repetitive keyboarding and of the psychological pressure under
which many keyboard users must work.  Clearly, the risks attributable purely to
repetitive keyboarding, improper terminal and chair adjustments, lack of
breaks, poor lighting, etc overwhelmingly dominate the issue.

	While I remain committed to being alert to the effects of stress, I
yield to the many thoughtful people who wrote to me and spoke, often sadly, of
colleagues and associates who live with chronic pain directly attributable to
such work.  A few have even been ruled permanently disabled.  This is worse
than unfortunate, and I fear I misguided myself on the issue.

Let me then point out another major group of CTS sufferers who are (at least)
as highly motivated as any hacker: Cyclists. Especially the ones who also do a
lot of keyboard work, but even some who do no keyboard/computer work have been
afflicted.  

[...]

Having worked in a similar environment without any ill effects, I was more than
dismayed when I started showing the classical symptoms of repetitive motion
syndromes after I transferred to computer support. A period of very informal
empirical studies (I experimented :-), indicated that the culprit was the type
of work, not the system hardware. In essence: Using my SUN workstation as a
word processor to enter large amounts of text (on subjects I find interesting
and stimulating) is very prone to give me various pains and numbness symptoms
in neck, shoulders, arms and hands. Using the same workstation to edit and
debug programs is much less fatiguing. I can easily do programming work for a
full workday without problems. Just a couple of hours of word processing is
enough to give me back all the problems.

I started looking at how I work in these two situations and came to the
conclusion that the difference is quite large. Entering text I type for long
unbroken periods, moving my arms very little. Editing source code (even when
entering it the first time), I move about much more. I use the mouse and/or
cursor keys to go back and correct an indentation; I copy a chunk of code I'm
too lazy to write again; I look at the debugger, resting my chin in my hand
while I try to figure what's wrong; I click the "Step" button and stare in
disbelief as the program takes the wrong branch in a "switch"; I scratch my
head and take a sip of tea. In other words, programming work is much less
(physically) monotonous.

|&gt; 	What part does psychological or emotional stress play in the
|&gt; 	development of repetitive-motion disorders?

It wouldn't surprise me if the presence of stress hormones in the body
aggreviates the problems but my belief is that the nature of the work is much
more important. And it is possible that I like programming better than
documenting (who doesn't? :-) to the extent where this causes part of the
difference for me. But I don't think this accounts for all of it. If it did,
why would writing articles for UseNet cause similar pains?

I disagree with the theory. I spend a lot of time *sitting* at a keyboard and
so do many others here. But we don't spend a lot of time bashing keys with our
fingers because we frequently stop to think. I'm sure other computing labs are
the same.  People like us don't come anywhere near the kind of keystrokes an
hour achieved by people doing repetitive keyboarding jobs like copy-typists,
data entry clerks etc. If a job requires some tedious keyboarding, we typically
have the freedom, knowledge and hardware required to automate it. Mostly people
here complain about eyestrain and backache, not carpal tunnel syndrome.

I would also caution Mr Cooper that his theory is liable to misinterpretation
by those who would like to dismiss such injuries as malingering by people who
want to get out of boring jobs.  -- Claire Jones ccmj@dcs.ed.ac.uk

Earlier this evening, I tried to find out the status of my refund from
the IRS.  I called up Teletax, the IRS's voice-mail-like system, and
followed the instructions.  In general, these seem to be well-done;
the most-requested functions are first on each menu, and things seem
to be done consistently.  I say "seem" for a very good reason...

Following the instructions, I entered my SSN, heard it repeat back, and
confirmed that it was correct.  I was then told to enter my filing status,
which I was about to do, when I heard "error, error, I cannot process your
request!" repeated several times.  Thinking that the system had burped, I hung
up and dialed again.  Once more, I gave the machine my SSN.  But now, I was
given a message to the effect that the IRS updates the system approximately
every seven days, that my status had not changed since my last call, and that I
should wait seven days before calling again.  And, oh yes, thanks for using
Teletax.

Now, I know that I probably shouldn't complain about this, since the whole
thing is a freebie, but it is truly irritating.  A well-designed system would
(I think) have told me SOMETHING about the nature of the error, rather than
sounding like it dropped out of Lost in Space (come to think of it, THAT robot
was a good deal more informative than Teletax).  What bothers me most about the
system is its assumption that, once the SSN is entered, you have a completed
transaction.  I haven't tested this out yet, but I'm willing to bet that
entering a bogus number (which, btw, gets you a 'your return has not yet been
processed') a second time would get you the same message that I got -- call
back in seven days.

Of course, this is a minor risk -- it's really more a case of poor
error-handling.  If I were a true paranoid, I guess I could see some legal
claim based on the notion that computer records show me having been apprised of
something when I was not; but for now, it's just an irritation.  The only real
RISK is that someone who enters somebody else's SSN by mistake would, while not
getting the other person's information, effectively block the correct person
from their information for approximately seven days.  [...]

With all the recent interest in wireless communications, I was somewhat
surprised at a recent NCR meeting.  On display was an NCR WaveLAN wireless
network card.  No big deal, I thought, since wireless Local Area Network cards
are produced by several companies using different wireless media.  Radio
Frequency and infrared seem to be the wireless media of choice with one
limiting aspect - coverage of one room or, at most, a single office floor.
 
Since the WaveLAN product uses 902 - 928 MHz no-license band, I assumed
the one floor 100 foot limitation.
 
 Here is the surprise; a FIVE MILE distance between transmitter-receiver!!
 At 2 Mbps!! Real DX for a 250 Mw Digital System...
 
I asked the NCR salesman to confirm this unusual claim.  He said a "typical"
distance in an enclosed office is 100 - 800 feet but, with an optional antenna
and direct line-of-sight path, five miles IS reasonable.  He did not have info
on the optional antenna.  I would assume, at 902 Mhz, the size of the antenna
has to be small (even a directional multi-element yagi at 902 Mhz is really
small).  Ethernet (CSMA/CA) protocol with a low RF bit error rate of 10 exp -8
(at 5 miles?).
 
Using spread spectrum and optional DES encryption, the 2 Mbps could represent a
T-1 data stream with some overhead bits (2 - 1.544 Mbps) potentially as a Local
Loop replacement or a no license repeater system.  Since the antennas are
directional and spread spectrum would allow simultaneous transmissions over the
same frequency band (with an increase in noise level).  INTERESTING

with exhibits on how our mail gets (mis)delivered.  One of these was a
computer which would tell you your 9-digit zip code, based on a normal
address screen:

    NAME
    APARTMENT NUMBER
    STREET AND NUMBER
    CITY AND STATE
    5-DIGIT ZIP CODE

I recently moved and was mildly interested so I gave it a try with my
old (as a check) and new addresses.  But right of the top it occurred
to me ... why do they need my name?!  They don't, but I'm sure many
folks just blindly type it in.  If this data were actually accumulated
by the exhibit (I have no reason to believe it is) one could envision
all sorts of potential uses and abuses.

(I believe the thing got testy if one left the name blank; I used the
"dummy" name Dan Quayle. :-) )

&lt;grin&gt;  I thought that might catch someone's attention!  But I'm not
sure they could get the mail to me -- I recall something a few years
ago where somebody sent a letter to Ronald Reagan in (wherever), CA.
It came back stamped "moved, forwarding address unknown".

Of course I shouldn't pick on government workers too much since as a SLAC
employee I'm one of 'em.

                 New for PC: $79 Caller ID Device 02/17/92
 
ROSWELL, GEORGIA, U.S.A., 1992 FEB 17 -- A start-up company announced a
device which lets your PC access callers' numbers using the Caller ID
service, at a price of $79.  Whozz Calling? is a box, a few inches
square, which connects to the phone line using standard RJ-11 jacks and
to an IBM-compatible PC through a 9-pin RS-232C port.
 
Zeus Phonestuff President Mark Sutherland says the device is designed
for applications like inbound call management, mail list creation, and
modem security.  When linked to an online system, for instance, the
device can assure that only calls from designated numbers get through.
Software comes bundled with it.
 
"We intend to go into mail order to see what markets are interested in
the device, then go to distributors.  They need a track record before
they pick it up," he said.
 
Caller ID is becoming available in increasing numbers of states, usually
with a provision that callers be able to block their numbers from going
out, free, on a per-call basis. The Federal Communications Commission
has suggested per-call blocking might become a national policy but a
number of states, including Georgia, do not allow consumers to block the
sending of the number.

         Extradition of Computer Criminals 
Re: Police Foil Million Pound Hacking Plot (Bob Frankston, PGN)

Bob Frankston and PGN raise some interesting questions about extradition
problems with the recent UK hacking plot.  However, that particular case does
not prove that extradition is impossible.  Work on improving international
cooperation in fighting computer crime, including extradition of computer
criminals, is developing on the political agreements and cross-border law
enforcement levels.

Several years ago, I developed a project on how crime control problems have
become an important aspect of foreign policy and international agreements.  A
few of the more active areas of this trend are fighting drug smuggling,
anti-terrorist coordination, stock market regulation, and riot control/civil
unrest training.

Slowly, computer crime has become part of this international agenda.  Many of
the international efforts that affect computer crime are related more to
financial fraud and money laundering efforts.  While these efforts may not
explicitly mention computer crime, some attention has been paid to the fact that
much of financial fraud and money laundering today is computer-aided.  In
essence, computer crime is covered by many of these "other" crime control
efforts.  

Here are some specific examples of this international cooperation. 

The European Commission has developed a number of directives and regulations
that relate to computer crime issues in the Single Market Europe.  The most
directly related are the various information protection, privacy, copyright and
computer evidence requirements.  Some of these have been adopted from the
Council of Europe while other are derived from various EC actions.  Computer
crime-related decisions are also found in EC decisions regarding banking, EDI,
and other important industry/sector areas.  If anyone is interested in details
on the security aspects of EC '92, they can contact me for my recent article in
_Computers and Security_, which is adapted from my book published by Lafferty
Publications in Dublin in 1990.  

International law experts have also been been attempting harmonization of law.
Extradition has been considered.  Recognition has been given to a requirement
that offenses shall be punishable under the laws of both the requesting and the
requested country and that the offense in question must be of sufficient
seriousness.  Conventions concerning mutual assistance and extradition have been
discussed at the Council of Europe Select Committee of Experts level and the UN
has created the UNCITRAL, which relates to aspects of the problem.  ITSEC may
also create opportunities for classified discussions of these problems.

The BCCI case will probably make this international cooperation even more solid.
Even before this case, significant international cooperation had developed
regarding the fight against money laundering.  Banks are increasingly being
forced to give information about depositors to their governments and to act as
"quasi-investigators" in responding to suspicious deposits.  Even the Swiss
banking system, known for its secrecy, has changed significantly in recent years
in response to highly publicized money laundering cases and international
crooks/political figures.  Once again, although not explicit in the legal
language or the media coverage, computer-aided crime is a major issue in these
situations.

As of last year, the U.S. had a number of bilateral agreements between
regulations in markets around the world.  U.S. pacts have been signed with the
EC on regulating world financial marketplace as well as securities industry
reviews.  An important regional agreement was signed between the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission and the Inter-American Development Bank, which could
affect some of the Asian exchanges that are now becoming active in Latin
America.  Again, computer crime is not explicitly discussed in these agreements
but they are inherent in the nature of the regulations.

The EC has created the Unite de Coordination de la Luttee Anti-Fraude (UCLAF),
which seeks to coordinate anti-fraud activites within the EC.  I do not know
whether there are extradition aspects to this.  I got this information from Gary
Marx from MIT, who is working with European criminologists on research
concerning policing across national borders.

Finally, PGN raises the question of possible data havens, where people will be
free to electronically cross borders but be safe from punishment.  Adrian R. D.
Norman raised that issue many years ago in his book, "Computer Insecurity" in
1983  Worth reading even today.

&gt; According to this report, MOST 320 aircraft have an alarm that informs 
&gt; the pilot that s/he is flying too low, but France does not require this ...

You're referring to a Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS).  Air Inter did
not have them, because the A320 was only used within France, and, as you say,
French law doesn't require them.  The Habsheim crash involved an Air France
airplane, which was used in continental operations; it did have one.  The
Bangalore crash, which involved an Indian Airlines airplane, also had one.

GPWS was mandated in the US following the 1972 crash of an Eastern Airlines
L-1011 in the Florida Everglades.  The crew was distracted by a minor systems
problem; in the process, the altitude-hold feature of the autopilot was 
disengaged.  The airplane then very slowly started a descent, and ended up 
flying into the ground.  Nobody was minding the shop.  Following the US 
decision to require them, most other countries followed suit.

The GPWS normally works by comparing radio altitude (actual height above
ground), speed, and vertical speed rates.  Because of the radio altitude 
component, it's only effective after the airplane has been flying under 
approximately 2500' for some length of time.

On the A320, there are five distinct modes which are handled by the system, 
with corresponding aural alerts: 
   Excessive rate of descent     "Sink Rate" and "Whoop!  Whoop!  Pull Up!"
   Excessive terrain closure     "Terrain Terrain.  Whoop!  Whoop!  Pull Up!"
   Altitude loss after takeoff   "Don't Sink!"
   Unsafe terrain clearance      "Too Low Gear!"  and "Too Low Flaps!"
   Descent beneath glide slope   "Glide Slope!"

The aural messages are normally taped, but knowing Airbus, they're probably
digitized. :-)  A master caution (yellow--not a warning light) also appears.
Most airliners have some variation on the above.

The pilot is able to inhibit the various modes, through four smart switches.

Following the introduction of GPWS after the EAL crash, there were numerous
false warnings, and GPWS got a bum rep among many pilots.  The system still has
problems, due to its basic design premise, but the number of false alarms has
dropped significantly, overall.  Air Inter has stated that it *removed* its
units because of excessive false warnings, i.e., operational considerations.
Which raises the question that, even if the ill-fated A320 HAD the devices, the
crew might very well have ignored the alert.

As with most crashes, the Air Inter crash was likely the result of a complex 
number of factors; no single protection could have "saved" the airplane.  


As for Habsheim, the GPWS went off once, during the set-up to the flyover, but
after that, the last few seconds of the approach was beneath the threshold
arming altitude of 30'.  Which was also beneath the trees.  It wouldn't have
made any difference.

At Bangalore, there were two excessive rates of descent warnings, but the crew
either ignored them, didn't hear them (unlikely, since they're quite loud), or
filtered them out.

A very basic lesson here is that if we're going to mandate these systems, we'd
better make sure their warnings are accurate.  To do otherwise is to limit the
effect they may have on pilots, who tend to have more confidence in their
airmanship than with a poorly functioning subsystem.  Similar arguments can be
applied to the imperfect T/CAS 2 system, which was mandated following a highly
publicised mid-air collision.  Too many wrong warnings can be worse than none
at all.

&gt;... Then the examination will necessarily have to be a real test of 
&gt; problem-solving ability rather than a test of the candidate's

Alas, this would add the requirement that the teachers be capable of asking
good questions.  In all but a few cases, this may be too much to ask.  ;^)

I was involved in setting up rules for calculators etc. at exams a few years
ago.  The problems was: we wanted to permit students to use simple calculators
on exams (as part of "regular exam tools", but did not want to make all exams
open book because of students programming text etc.  into small (and ever
getting smaller) computers.  At the same time we could not make the rules too
technically oriented: the business school (in Norway) I worked for used
retirees as exam proctors, and technical specificities were beyond their
horizon.

Solution:  devices allowed as long as they
 - did not require AC
 - did not make noise or could output to paper
 - could not display more than 80 characters of text or numbers

The philosophy being that if the students really wanted to use devices that
filled these specs on exams to cheat, they were welcome to: they would probably
not derive any substantial benefit from it.  (In fact, if a student goes
through all the trouble of programming all the formulas into his HP-whatever,
he (or she) will probably have learned them by heart and would not really need
to have them programmed).

In RISKS 13.19 several postings commented on the issues involved in the
control of hand-held calculators during closed-book exams.  The original
posting is Bezenek (RISKS 13.16).  Despite the recent interest shown by
the postings, the issue isn't at all new.

My father, who for many years was the head of Tulane University's Physics
department, refused to permit the use of slide rules by students taking exams
for his undergraduate classes.  While I don't necessarily agree that such an
absolute ban was necessary, his reasoning was that while the slide rule (if
correctly used...which wasn't a given assumption) could provide the correct
digits in a problem, the user had the responsibility for keeping track of the
decimal point...and since problems in physics involve huge ranges of exponents,
the students would not develop the necessary recognition of "reasonableness"
for the answers if they didn't work out the problems on paper.  This is close
to the issues raised by Cooper in <A HREF="/Risks/13.19.html">RISKS-13.19</A>.

There's been a story floating around so long that it may be urban legend, but
supposedly there was an experiment several years ago in which a class was given
an examination in which hand-held calculators were provided for their use.
Unknown to the students, the calculators were rigged so that some of the
calculations required on the examination would produce answers which were so
far out of line that anyone paying the least attention to the results would
have known that they were wrong.  According to the story, only a minuscule
number of the students caught the problem; the others blindly copied down the
impossible results.

(Can anyone provide an authoritative citation for this?  It's a good example
even if it can't be verified, but it would be even better if it can be
authenticated.)

My mother, a high school mathematics teacher, has a simple solution to the
problem of calculator use during exams -- she maintains lists of the models her
students are and are not allowed to use. At the beginning of the exam, she
walks around the room and erases the memory of the calculators. (Most
calculators have a short sequence of keystrokes which will erase all the
memory.) A calculator which does symbolic integration, of course, is not
allowed on an integration exam. Whenever a manufacturer debuts a new
calculator, she buys or borrows one to evaluate it.

Working on my home computer on Saturday, I noticed something interesting.  One
computer was smart enough to handle the leap year with no problem.  The other
*would not accept* a February 29th date ... but was smart enough to know that
March 1st was a Sunday.

Oh, well, I didn't get much done Saturday anyway ...

As most RISKS readers know, February 29th is International Software Calendar
Bug Day.  Yesterday's quadrennial event found a bug in Prime's MAGSAV program
that caused the program to fail promptly at midnight, as reported in the Usenet
comp.sys.prime newsgroup by Peter Maurath.  Ironically, the big day was a
Saturday, and Prime's 800 number for software support doesn't work on
weekends.  (Message-ID &lt;17174.29aee0a1@bclcl1.im.battelle.org&gt;)

In the same forum, Richard H. Miller reported the usual workarounds: either use
an older version of MAGSAV, or lie about the current date.  He wrote, ``The
indication is that it `snuck up on them' to paraphrase the Prime support person
I talked with.'' (Message-ID &lt;10383@gazette.bcm.tmc.edu&gt;)

The state of Iowa made a bit of a mistake this year.  All liquor licences that
should expire at the end of this Februrary expired today, on the 28th.  The new
licences only become valid on March first, so a large number of liquor stores,
bars and restaurants have no liquor licence tomorrow (leap day).  The state
liquor control people have announced that this was due to a "computer error"
and they promise not to enforce the law tomorrow, at least, not as it applies
to those caught by this glitch.

As people may know, the rock band U2 is starting a tour soon and is playing
venues much smaller than the number of fans who would like to see them
(13,000 seat arenas when they could easily fill 50,000+ seats).

The group has been going to extraordinary lengths to prevent ticket scalpers
from getting tickets, including selling some venues by phone only.  This has
led to some real messes (as when they put the tickets for the Boston Garden
show on sale.  Half a million calls in the first hour).

One good computer-related side effect came to light the other day with the
suspension of the manager of the Providence Civic Center.  Seems this
gentleman stands accused of deliberately overselling his arena with the
extras going to scalpers.  His scam was shut down after 150 extra tickets
were sold.  The oversell was detected by U2 people who were monitoring
ticket sales from the central computer site in New York City.

So for once computer monitoring worked the way it should.  And in a widely-
distributed system under high stress.  Not too shabby.

Additionally, each ticket sale was verified to ensure that no one made
duplicate orders.  According to local radio reports, computer checks for
duplication were made against "name, address, and credit card number."  "450
duplicates were caught" and the orders cancelled after "human verification."

Again, I applaud appropriate use of technology -- the computer did the dumb
brute work of finding possible matches and coughed up data to a human being
for verification.

I'm sure someone will write in with information on what telephone services
were denied during the deluge of calls, but hey, nothing's perfect.

A recent article by reporter Jay Bryan of the Montreal Gazette in the paper's
business section made some extraordinary claims about the effect that bugs in a
newly-installed integrated computer program had on the demise of a
Montreal-based life insurance company.

It also has some things to say about both systems administration and systems
integrators that might be of interest to the comp.risks readership.

The article begins:

"When Montreal Life Insurance Co., a growing, profitable insurer, decided to
upgrade its main computer program 10 years ago, it jumped in with both feet.
The new program, a kind called an integrated one, [ yeah, right :-)] would tie
together every aspect of the company's operations.

There was a small problem, though. The enormous program had been customized and
installed in haste. Scattered through its one millions lines of computer
instructions, there were a few undetected bugs. And since the system was
integrated, every time a bug caused an error in one department's files, the
error was immediately reflected in several other departments' files.

Within a year, Montreal Life was losing money. After three years, the company
was near collapse. errors in commission cheques, for example, drove away most
of the company's agents. The agents took their clients with them. When agents
weren't underpaid, they were overpaid, which accounted for another $1 million
in losses.

Finally, what remained of Montreal Life was sold by its owners
and most of the company's top managers lost their jobs....."

This horror story is credited to two "systems auditors", Marshall Govindan and
John Picard, who "... are determined to send a wake-up call to all those
corporate leaders who think running a caompany's information system is just a
housekeeping detail." Govindan apparently once worked for Montreal Life.

Despite its apparent "scare tactics" tone, the article goes on to discuss the
need for proper systems management practices in which it makes a couple of good
points about the need for suitable direction to systems staff from upper
management. The point is made that "The systems people are basically a law unto
themselves. They're accountable to nobody...this is because systems managers
are treated as a kind of technological high priesthood. Their knowledge is
considered so esoteric that top managers feel helpless to help them to the same
standards of performance that are common in areas like marketing, operations
or finance."

Apparently Govindan and Picard have written a book on the subject entitled
"Manifesto on Informations Systems Control and Management", published by
McGraw-Hill Ryerson. No further details of the book were given.

The article then describes a "success story", the Wal-Mart chain of retail
stores, which apparently managed to speed checkout handling and minimize
stocking with suitable, timely application of new technology.

The article finishes with a description of how a successful systems integrator
works to bring up new technology and manage the transfer of new clients onto
their systems while minimizing their disruptions.  The conclusion was "All this
[careful client handholding] is a 'pain in the neck' for systems people who
might prefer to be doing something more technologically glamorous than sweating
over every detail of every new installation...But from the perspective of the
company, it means happy customers, rising sales and an assurance that the new
system will produce steady profits instead of unexpected losses."

The article appeared in The Montreal Gazette, Saturday, February 22,
1992 on page C1 of the Business section, continuing onto page C4.

The risks are obvious. The tone is a tad alarmist, but if true, the tale of the
demise of Montreal Life contains lessons for those who would rush into
implementation of such mission critical software, and then insist on staying
with such an obvious failure for as long as three years. I would therefore
suspect that the tale of the fall of this company has a lot more that was left
unsaid.  Would any comp.risks readers have any more details on this?

Speaking of the post office -- (I know that another Ithacan has complained to
you about the way mail gets forwarded in Ithaca, but I thought I'd add my
husband's mail-forwarding story.)

Last November my husband tried to use his ATM card over the Veterans' Day
holiday weekend.  The person in front of him successfully acquired cash from
the ATM, but when he tried to get some money he got the uninformative error
message "We're sorry, but we're unable to process your transaction right now."
(This is the same message you might get when the machine is out of money, which
often happens to this bank's machines during holiday weekends.)  So he assumed
he was just particularly unlucky that the person in front of him took the last
of the cash in the machine.

The next day he tried at a different machine, again just after someone had
taken out some money.  He got the same message about not being able to complete
the transaction.  Frustrated, he tried small amounts of money, $10, $20,
thinking perhaps the machine was out of particular bills.  That didn't work
either.  We also have an ATM card for our joint account with the same bank.  He
tried that card and it worked fine.

(No, he didn't forget his PIN number and yes, the card was in one piece,
and yes, this really does have to do with the Post Office.)

Puzzled, he called the bank after the holiday and asked them why the ATM card
for his account didn't work.  They looked up his record and said "Well, it's
because your last statement got returned to us 'addressee unknown'."  So part
of the story is that the bank was stupid and didn't call to verify if he had
moved (he hadn't), and locked out his ATM card.  And part of the story is that
my husband didn't realize he hadn't yet received his bank statement for the
previous month.  But the rest has to do with the way the Post Office forwards
mail.

The bank gave him the statement that was still in its envelope with
several yellow forwarding stickers on it.  The hash function that the
Post Office uses (at least in the Rochester branch of the Post Office)
is first 3 numbers of the street address and the first 4 letters of the
last name.  My husband has a pretty common last name (Chang).
Evidently, a Chang with a different first name who lived at a house
numbered 216 on a completely different street (in a different section
of Ithaca so the 9 digit zip codes didn't match either) recently moved
out of Ithaca.  Since my husband's name and address matched the 216CHAN
hash function for forwarding, his statement was accidentally forwarded,
and eventually got returned to the bank.  Obviously, no one ever really
compared the 2 addresses because the street names were very different.

All sorts of risks in this whole scenario, but what I can't understand is why
the Post Office uses just these 7 characters for their hash function.  Seems
like there should be a way of using a character from the person's first name
and the street name to make it work a little better.  Our friend Jenn Turney
had problems a few years ago when someone named Turner (with a different first
name, and different street name, but the same 3 digit house number) moved.
Scanning the phone book, I wonder if Andy Chan, Kenneth Chan or Sak Chanthanak
(all with 216 house numbers) have had any problems with their mail being
forwarded...

The recent MBDF-A virus which was (allegedly) uploaded to SUMEX-AIM by two
Cornell students shows a possible risk: it seems likely that the students were
tracked down via examination of machine logs, both at Stanford and at Cornell.
They might have been aware of the "last" log, showing who was logged in to what
machine when, but probably were not aware that "anonymous" ftp accesses are
routinely logged. While the username which you provide can, of course, be
anything, it is much more difficult to disguise the source of the FTP
transaction, and this can be logged.

The risk is not so much that the logs are made, but more that the service
is presented as "anonymous", leading people to believe that it actually is.

This morning I happened to catch newsman Charles Osgood's "The Osgood File" on
the local CBS AM all-news station.  "The Osgood File" is a two-minute long
daily radio "column" in which Mr. Osgood talks about something in the news that
interests him.  Today the topic was the "Michaelangelo" computer virus.  Mr.
Osgood spoke repeatedly of the danger to "your computer", and had a brief
interview with a computer consultant who also spoke of the danger to
"computers".  AT NO TIME DURING THE PIECE DID ANYONE MENTION THAT THE VIRUS
AFFECTS MS-DOS CLONE MACHINES ONLY.  The gist of the piece was that viruses are
bad and that all computers are in horrible danger of losing their files on the
fateful anniversary this Friday.

I called Mr. Osgood's office in New York City and spoke to a woman who was
very pleasant to me, and seemed surprised that that particular bit of
information had not been included.  I'm not sure I was forceful enough in
stating how crucial the missing information was to the story.  I still
can't believe that it was omitted.

&gt; Any comments from qualified persons?

My only qualification is that I have read the interim report of the commission 
of enquiry into the Strasbourg crash, and a few other documents. 

&gt; MOST 320 aircraft have an alarm that informs the pilot that s/he
&gt; is flying too low, but France does not require this alarm and so aircraft 
&gt; sold to and/or operated by French companies do not have this alarm installed.

The Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) is standard equipment, and is
mandated by international regulations. Air Inter, which operated the A320 which
crashed at Strasbourg, are a purely domestic airline. Since their aircraft do
not fly outside France, they are not covered by the international rules.

Air Inter took a deliberate policy decision many years ago *not* to use GPWS, 
since such systems are (or were then) prone to giving false alarms. They 
argued that, in any case, their pilots were highly familiar with the terrain 
around the airports they served, and so didn't need GPWS. 

In its interim report, the commission of enquiry has been *very* careful not 
to draw any conclusions, or even entertain any theories, about the cause(s) 
of the crash. However they are aware that the use of GPWS would have made an 
accident of this type less likely, and the second of their three interim 
recommendations is that the French national regulations are amended as soon 
as possible to make the installation of GPWS mandatory on all aircraft large 
enough to carry one, including those used only on domestic routes. 

Note that international carriers, such as Air France, *are* covered by 
international regulations, and have always had GPWS in their A320s. 

&gt; If so, this points to a particularly interesting human interface problem --
&gt; perhaps the A320 tends to drop faster than other aircraft, but, since there 
&gt; is no alarm, [some] pilots do not realize what is happening until they're 
&gt; too low to do anything about it.

The human interface problem which most concerns the commission, and which 
is the subject of their first interim recommendation, is the possibility 
of confusion between the two modes of descent: "Vertical Speed" and 
"Flight Path Angle". For a detailed description of how this confusion could 
arise, see Robert Dorsett's excellent description of the Flight Management 
System (FMS) in <A HREF="/Risks/13.11.html">RISKS-13.11</A>. One possible effect of the pilot selecting the 
wrong mode is that the aircraft would descend much faster than intended. 
Apart from that situation, as far as I know the A320 drops neither faster nor 
slower than any other airliner.

On 28th January, the DGAC (French equivalent of the FAA) warned users of the 
A320 about the danger of confusing the two modes, and immediately put in place 
procedures and documentation to prevent this happening. The French Minister of 
Transport has directed the DGAC to monitor the effectiveness of these 
temporary measures carefully, and told them to direct Airbus Industrie, who 
manufacture the A320, to produce a detailed plan (within one month) of 
modifications to that particular part of the pilot-FMS interface. The 
implementation and certification of the modified FMS will obviously take 
much longer. 

Again, the report stresses that this recommendation does *not* imply that 
the commission have concluded that confusion of descent modes is the cause, 
or part of the cause, of the Strasbourg crash. 

The commission's third interim recommendation (again backed up by the Minister)
is to make the automatic emergency radio beacon less likely to be damaged in a
crash. At Strasbourg it was destroyed, and this has been suggested as one
reason why it took rescue teams so long to get to the crash site.

The Minister added a fourth directive to the DGAC to look into more rugged
flight recorders, and improved protection for them. At Strasbourg, the Digital
Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) was fried to a crisp, and the Cockpit Voice
Recorder (CVR) and Quick Access Recorder (QAR) were damaged, but still readable
in parts. In the last three years there have been five accidents in which the
recorders have been destroyed, according to the Minister's statement last
Monday.

Recorders and emergency beacons are useful only after you've already crashed 
the 'plane, of course. 

Whether the crash could have been averted if a GPWS had been fitted is 
obviously still an open question. It would depend on the length of time 
before impact at which the warning would have been given, and I do not 
have this information right now. There is, however, another system, the 
radiosonde alarm, which gives a simulated voice warning as the aircraft 
passes down through certain thresholds of altitude, measured by a radio 
beam reflected from the ground. The top threshold is 200ft. 

This is separate from the GPWS, and *was* in use on the Strasbourg A320. The
transcript of the CVR shows a single radiosonde announcement of "Two hundred
feet". Although no time stamp is shown on the CVR transcript, this is the last
thing that appears, and seems to have occurred a mere second or so before
impact.

On 25 Feb 1992, the papers here reported on the interim report of the French
commission of inquiry into the Strasbourg A320 crash.  Although they emphasise
that they have not concluded what caused the crash it seems they are leaning
towards the confusion of the vertical speed and flight path angle modes of
descent as desribed by Robert Dorsett in risks 13.11. To show how confusing
this is, the reports in the Times and the Independent (2 quality UK papers)
contradict each other on the mode that the pilots should have been using.

&gt;From the Independent:

  The French government yesterday ordered modifications to the instruments
of the Airbus A320, one of which crashed near Strasbourg last month.
  Paul Quil\`es, the Transport Minister, said the changes would affect the
systems controlling descent. [He wanted Airbus] to report within one month
on how it would carry out the modifications.  ...
  The commission ... recommended to ``the ergonomics of the aircraft-crew
interface linked to the `Vertical Speed' and `Flight Path Angle' modes''.
  On the A320 ... pilots select a pattern by pressing a button on the
instument panel. The choice is determined by pressing the button once
or twice. The Flight Path Angle would have been normal for the Strasbourg
approach.

[end quote]

The story goes on to say that the government were ordering that GPWS
should be installed in all aircraft. Air Inter did not have this as they
had had reliability and false alarm problems with them.

It also mentions the problem of slippage between the A320's map display and the
position on the ground. Air France and Air Inter had stopped using this after a
pilot flying into Bordeaux noticed a difference between indicated and real
positions. The commission are not saying that this problem was linked to the
Strasbourg crash but the report says that the cockpit voice recorder indicates
that the pilots were concentrating on their lateral position just before the
crash.

&gt;From the Times:

  The manufacturers of the A320 ... are to seek new ways of making their
jets ``pilot-proof'' and preventing crews from mistaking their flight path
angle for their speed of descent.
  Air accident investigators ... have yet to find the precise cause ...
but their preliminary report suggests that the pilots could have programmed
the computer wrongly because of confusion over the role of one of the
instruments. ...
  As they approached Strasbourg and were told to make a standard descent,
it is now thought likely that they ordered the aircraft to descent at an
angle rather than at so many feet per minute.

[end quote]

The Times report is written with much more emphasis on pilot error.  It doesn't
mention the government order to Airbus to change things or the map problem.

On Sunday 1 March the Sunday Times, a `heavyweight' (in both senses of the
word, 9 sections and stilll growing) UK paper had a piece in its business
section headed `Airbus has worst record'.

  Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium, has suffered a new
setback with the revalation that its A320 currently has the worst accident
record of large passenger jets registered in Britain.
  An insurance industry report shows that crashes involving the plane,
the most advanced flown by airlines, have led to a higher death rate among
passengers than on aircraft designed nearly 25 years ago.
  ...
  Paul Hayes, director of Airclaims, the aviation consultancy which drew
up the report, said it was too soon to draw conclusions over the safety
of the four-year-old A320. ``Its loss rates are worse at the moment but
this does not mean that it is a dangerous aircraft. If these are
maintained over a longer time, however, it may indicate a serious problem
for ASirbus,'' he said.
  The report examines the loss and fatality rates for all jet and turbo-prop
aircraft over the past five years. It shows that one person was killed
on A320s for every 331,900 carried, compared with one for every 1,401,100
on DC10s, the next worse. If the French disaster was included, the A320
figure would drop to one for every 270,000, a record more than eight times
worse than the average for its generation of jets.
  The aircraft is shown to have had a fatal accident for every 241,700
landings, seven times worse than the performance of the Boeing 757, one
of its main rivals. The older A300 and A310, which do not use the
contoversial fly-by-wire system, have not had a fatal accident.
  ...
  Airbus said it was unfortunate that aircraft crashes were remembered
for the type of plane involved rather than the cause. ``There have been
three crashes and in the first two it was quite clear that the aircraft
was not at fault,'' a spokeswoman said.

[end quote]

Airbus' comments in the last paragraph of this report seem suspect to me.
Unless you assume that the pilots flying A320s are more stupid than
average, then if pilots have more crashes in A320s than other planes,
even if the cause is officially `pilot error', there must be something
about the plane that makes errors more likely.

Here in northern Illinois, we must have our cars tested periodically (usually
once a year) for exhaust emissions. The test operator has to enter the current
mileage of the vehicle into the computer, which then sets the proper standards
that the vehicle must meet. High-mileage cars are permitted to spew out
slightly more pollutants (within reason) than low-mileage ones. Up until this
year, the operator could only enter five digits, so any car exceeding 100,000
miles on the odometer was listed at 99,000. This year, they've revised the
system to handle six digits, and things got interesting.

Last week I brought my 90,000-mile 1982 Oldsmobile in for its test. The
test operator said, "What's the first two digits on your mileage?"
"Nine, Zero", I replied. He punched it in and the test proceeded.

I wondered at the time how they deal with cars having SEVEN digit
odometers. Seems like the operator would have to know whether to punch
in a leading zero, but from the wording of the question, it sounded like
he could only enter two digits no matter what. The owner of a 90,000-mile
Honda (whose odometer reads "090,000.0") might have answered "Zero, Nine"
to that question, and get stuck trying to meet a 9,000-mile emission
standard instead of a 90,000-mile setting. On the other hand, maybe I
would be the lucky recipient of a 900,000-mile testing standard? If my
car fails THAT, I thought, I'm definitely getting a tuneup.

Well, the car passed with flying colors, and as I drove off, I glanced at the
printout of results given to me with my new 1-year emissions sticker. Sure
enough, the indicated test mileage read "900,000", complete with the comma in
the middle.

Other than the obvious RISK, that of flunking the test because of a goofed-up
mileage entry, I wonder if the odometer reading for emissions testing is
tracked from year to year. Data on the printout shows that the computer is
indeed tied into the registration information for the car. The mileage IS
listed on the car's Title of Ownership to catch rollbacks between purchase and
later sale, but I don't know if any discrepancies are flagged automatically.
Hope not, anyway. I wonder if the operator who gets the test mileage correct
next year, say at 99,000 miles, will get a message from the computer asking
what happened to the other 801,000?

About 1,000 Colorado ATM users had their Visas and Mastercards abruptly
terminated in February by an out-of-control computer system.

For 90 minutes during the President's Day weekend, the Rocky Mountain Bankcard
System software told ATMS around the state to eat the cards instead of dishing
out cash or taking deposits.  The "once-in-a-decade" glitch went unnoticed
because it occurred as programmers were patching in a correction to a different
problem.

The company is rushing new plastic and letters of apology to customers who got
terminated.

   The risk is not so much that the logs are made, but more that the service
   is presented as "anonymous", leading people to believe that it actually is.

Not convinced.  It is standard operating procedure to ask users of anonymous
ftp to specify their E-mail address when prompted for a password.  In fact,
pretty much every document I've seen that describes anonymous ftp mentions this
practice, and explains that the purpose of it is to allow system administrators
to monitor the usage of anonymous ftp.

Given such a widespread, accepted convention, it seems clear to me that users
of anonymous ftp have no reason to expect their usage to be completely
anonymous.  Furthermore, if the provide a fake or bogus E-mail address when
prompted for an ftp password, they are doing something considered anti-social
on the Internet, and I think it is completely reasonable for the addresses of
connecting sites to be logged in case it becomes necessary to follow up on such
anti-social behavior.

I don't see any risk here.  I see a system that worked the way it was designed
to work, and the users who were caught allegedly doing something wrong had no
"right" to expect otherwise.

Since the Air Inter A320 crashed January 20, there have been a number of
comments on shifted map displays, and that Lufthansa had banned the use of
VOR/DME approaches for the previous year.
 
Obligatory technolingo:

A VOR is a ground-based electronic broadcasting station, which transmits 
radial "spokes."  These range from 0 to 359 degrees.  An airplane can check 
to see which "spoke" it's on; this data can then be used for navigation 
purposes.  This is contrasted with an NDB (non-directional station), which, 
like an AM radio station, simply broadcasts in all directions; direction-
finding equipment on board the airplane can then be used to find it.  VOR's 
are generally more reliable over longer ranges, and less susceptible to 
interference.  The operational difference is that airplane instrumentation
points TO an NTB, but shows what radial the airplane is ON with a VOR.

Comments in brackets [].  Some are sarcastic, some are technical clar-
ifications; there are a few mistakes in this.

&gt;From FLIGHT INTERNATIONAL, "New VOR antenna will solve A320 problem",
Feb. 19, 1992, p. 10:

"Airbus Industrie, workin with Lufthansa, has developed a new VOR (VHF
omnirange) antenna for its A320s.

"The resulting modification programme will overcome the occasional poor air-
craft reception of VOR beacon signals, which had caused Lufthansa, in Sept-
ember 1991, to suspend VOR/DME (distance measuring equipment) airfield ap-
proaches in its A320s.

"On 8 February Air France and Air Inter took a voluntary decision to suspend
VOR/DME approaches in their A320s because of an incident in an Air Inter 
A320 on approach to Bordeaux airport three days earlier. 

"The symptom for the Lufthansa problem was oscillation of the VOR indicator
in the A320 cockpit displays.  Also, the Bendix DME equipment in Boeing 747-
400s--the same as in the A320s--had once shown a fault which had been re-
produced on the test bench.

"Work at Bendix has not yet produced a modificaiton, but the fault has not
recurred in the 747 or occurred ever in Lufthansa's A320s.  Air France uses
Bendix VOR/DME, Air Inter has Collins.

"Airbus senior vice-president of engineering, Bernard Ziegler, says that the
antenna problem was related to the position of metal lightning-protection
strips in the composite aerial.

"In the Air Inter incident on 5 February, the A320 captain, carrying out a VOR/
DME procedure for Bordeaux, but flying manually in perfect visual conditions,
noticed that the flight management system (FMS)-produced map on his navigation
display was displaced.  Ziegler confirms it was displaced by 2.2 cm (1.2 nm), 
pointing out that such a degree of displacement, while unsatisfactory, was
within the published system accuracy. [!!!] [!]

"Lufthansa emphasizes that it had not experienced map displacement, only VOR
indicator oscillation.

"Lufthansa's letdown procedure involves one pilot flying to the compass arc/
map display, the other to the VOR compass rose display, to enable cross-check-
ing.  The raw VOR/DME data on both displays is correct even if the map is 
displaced.  [but does anyone use the raw data when the map is so much more
convenient?]

"Ziegler says the Bordeaux map display displacement was caused partly by an
Air Inter database error entered in the aircraft's FMS, which produces the
display map from its integral inertial navigation system (INS) [actually,
ADIRS].  The INS [FMS] depends on VOR/DME for its accuracy updating.  If
fewer than two DMEs are in range (and during descent this often occurs),
then the INS [FMS] updates using a co-located VOR/DME.  The Air Inter
database says the Bordeaux VOR and DME are co-located when they are not [!],
so the FMS was cleared to updated, using incorrect information and affecting
the map. [GIGO rules!]

"The navigation display, Ziegler says, displays the FMS update sources at all
times: 'If you see that the source is VOR/DME and your VOR needle is oscil-
lating, obviously you know you can expect map shift.' [obviously.]

"The French Direction Generale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC) will not ban 
A320 VOR/DME letdowns, but empahsises the need to crosscheck the map displays
with the raw navigation data available.

"The DGAC also points out that there is no evidence of any connection between
the Bordeaux event and the Air Inter A320 crash near Starsbourg on 20 January.
The authority has, however, warned all A320 crews to be careful when they sel-
ect the autopilot descent mode, because there is a possibility that the 
Strasbourg crew may have selected a steep 3300 fpm (16.7 m/s) rate of descent
when they meant to select the shallower 3.3 degree angle of descent.

                              RSAREF(TM):
          A Cryptographic Toolkit for Privacy-Enhanced Mail

                           RSA Laboratories
               (A division of RSA Data Security, Inc.)
                            March 2, 1992


This document copyright (C) 1992 RSA Laboratories, a division of RSA Data
Security, Inc. License is granted to reproduce, copy, post, or distribute in
any manner, provided this document is kept intact and no modifications,
deletions, or additions are made.

WHAT IS IT?

RSAREF is a cryptographic toolkit designed to facilitate rapid deployment of
Internet Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) implementations.  RSAREF represents the
fruits of RSA Data Security's commitment to the U.S. Department of Defense's
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to provide free cryptographic source
code in support of a PEM standard. RSA Laboratories offers RSAREF in
expectation of PEM's forthcoming publication as an Internet standard.

Part of RSA's commitment to DARPA was to authorize Trusted Information Systems
of Glenwood, MD, to distribute a full PEM implementation based on RSAREF. That
implementation will be available this spring.

RSAREF supports the following PEM-specified algorithms:

     o    RSA encryption and key generation, as defined by RSA
            Laboratories' Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)

     o    MD2 and MD5 message digests

     o    DES (Data Encryption Standard) in cipher-block chaining mode

RSAREF is written in the C programming language as a library that can be called
from an application program. A simple PEM implementation can be built directly
on top of RSAREF, together with message parsing and formatting routines and
certificate-management routines. RSAREF is distributed with a demonstration
program that shows how one might build such an implementation.

The name "RSAREF" means "RSA reference." RSA Laboratories intends RSAREF to
serve as a portable, educational, reference implementation of cryptography.


WHAT YOU CAN (AND CANNOT) DO WITH RSAREF

The license at the end of this note gives legal terms and conditions.
Here's the layman's interpretation, for information only and with no
legal weight:

     1.   You can use RSAREF in personal, noncommercial applications,
          as long as you follow the interface described in the RSAREF
          documentation. You can't use RSAREF in any commercial
          (moneymaking) manner of any type, nor can you use it to
          provide services of any kind to any other party. For
          information on commercial licenses of RSAREF-compatible
          products, please contact RSA Data Security.

     2.   You can distribute programs that interface to RSAREF,
          but you can't distribute RSAREF itself. Everyone must
          obtain his or her own copy of RSAREF. (However, free
          licenses to redistribute RSAREF are available. For
          information, please send electronic mail to
          &lt;rsaref-administrator@rsa.com&gt;.)

     3.   You can modify RSAREF as required to port it to other
          operating systems and compilers, as long as you give a copy
          of the results to RSA Laboratories. You can't otherwise
          change RSAREF.

     4.   You can't send RSAREF outside the United States, or give it
          to anyone who is not a United States citizen and doesn't
          have a "green card." (These are U.S. State and Commerce
          Department requirements, because RSA and DES are
          export-controlled technologies.)

The restrictions on the distribution of RSAREF are the consequence of
export-control law. Similar constraints are placed on those redistributing
RSAREF under free license from RSA Laboratories.  Without the export-control
law, RSAREF would be available by anonymous FTP.


HOW TO GET IT

To obtain RSAREF, read the license at the end of the note and return a copy of
the "acknowledgement and acceptance" paragraph by electronic mail to
&lt;rsaref-administrator@rsa.com&gt;.

RSAREF is distributed by electronic mail in a UNIX(TM) "uuencoded" TAR format.
When you receive it, store the contents of the message in a file, and run your
operating system's "uudecode" and TAR programs.

For example, suppose you store the contents of your message in the file
'contents'. You would run the commands:

     uudecode contents             # produces rsaref.tar
     tar xvf rsaref.tar

RSAREF includes about 60 files organized into the following
subdirectories:

     doc       documentation on RSAREF and RDEMO
     install   makefiles for various operating systems
     rdemo     RDEMO demonstration program
     source    RSAREF source code and include files
     test      test scripts for RDEMO


USERS' GROUP

RSA Laboratories maintains the electronic-mail users' group
&lt;rsaref-users@rsa.com&gt; for discussion of RSAREF applications, bug fixes, etc.
To join the user's group, send electronic mail to
&lt;rsaref-users-request@rsa.com&gt;.


REGISTRATION

RSAREF users who register with RSA Laboratories are entitled to free RSAREF
upgrades and bug fixes as soon as they become available and a 50% discount on
selected RSA Data Security products. To register, send your name, address, and
telephone number to &lt;rsaref-registration@rsa.com&gt;.


INNOVATION PRIZES

RSA Laboratories will award cash prizes for the best applications built on
RSAREF. If you'd like to submit an application, or want to be on the review
panel, please send electronic mail to &lt;rsaref-administrator@rsa.com&gt;.


PUBLIC-KEY CERTIFICATION

RSA Data Security offers public-key certification services conforming to
forthcoming PEM standards. For more information, please send electronic mail to
&lt;pem-info@rsa.com&gt;.


OTHER QUESTIONS

If you have questions on RSAREF software, licenses, export restrictions, or
other RSA Laboratories offerings, send electronic mail to
&lt;rsaref-administrator@rsa.com&gt;.


AUTHORS

RSAREF was written by the staff of RSA Laboratories with assistance from RSA
Data Security's software engineers. The DES code is based on an implementation
that Justin Reyneri did at Stanford University. Jim Hwang of Stanford wrote
parts of the arithmetic code under contract to RSA Laboratories.

                      PROGRAM LICENSE AGREEMENT

RSA LABORATORIES, A DIVISION OF RSA DATA SECURITY, INC. ("RSA"), IS WILLING TO
LICENSE THE "RSAREF" PROGRAM FOR YOUR USE ONLY ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET
FORTH BELOW. YOUR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
BY RETURN ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION IS REQUIRED PRIOR TO DELIVERY TO YOU OF THE
RSAREF PROGRAM.

1.   LICENSE. RSA is willing to grant you a non-exclusive,
     non-transferable license for the "RSAREF" program (the
     "Program") and its associated documentation, subject to all of
     the following terms and conditions, but only:

     a.   to use the Program on any computer in your possession, but
          on no more than one computer at any time;

     b.   to make one copy of the Program for back-up purposes only;

     c.   to incorporate the Program into other computer programs only
          through interfaces described in the RSAREF Library
          Reference (the file "rsaref.txt" which accompanies the
          Program) (any such incorporated portion of the Program to
          continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of this
          license) both solely for your own personal or internal use
          or to create Application Programs; and

UUPC/extended is a mail system for personal computers running MS-DOS.  (The
name is a pun on UUCP.)  On Leap Day, Saturday, 29 February 1992, UUPC's UUPOLL
program, which polls a remote system for mail at regular intervals,
consistently hung the PC on which it was running.  One workaround was to set
the system clock ahead a day to 1 March.

Drew Derbyshire, the author of UUPC, traced the problem to a bug in the
mktime() library function in Borland C++ 2.0, which converts a time to calendar
format.  Drew demonstrated that mktime() will hang a PC on Leap Day, and
reported the problem to Borland.  As distributed, UUPC is compiled with Borland
C++ 2.0, though source code is available for do-it-yourselfers.  Apparently,
Borland has issued a corrected version of the library function (I haven't
verified this).

Drew tried to warn UUPC users by mail after discovering the problem on
Saturday.  Ironically, many did not get the message until Sunday or Monday,
when they found their PCs hung in UUPOLL.

From the N.Y. Times News Service, 3 March 1992 (I saw it in the SanFranChron):

   Intel Corp. said Monday it had stopped shipping a computer network software
program because some units were found to be infected with the ``Michelangelo''
virus, a program that infects IBM and compatible personal computers and can
potentially destroy data.
   A division of Intel in Hillsboro, Ore., said it had shipped more than 800
copies of the program, called LANSpool 3.01, which inadvertently contained the
virus. The virus is designed to activate on March 6, Michelangelo's birthday,
and can erase data and programs if it is not detected with antiviral software.
   The company said it had checked its software with a virus-scanning program
before shipping it, but that it had failed to detect the virus.
   A number of computer makers and software publishers have issued similar
alerts about the Michelangelo program and a variety of companies are now
offering free software to check for the virus.
   There are more than 1,000 known software viruses that can copy themselves
from computer to computer by attaching to programs and files.

&gt;Sigh... Sorry, but this is FALSE! The Michelangelo virus attacks any IBM PC
&gt;compatible computers. There is no need that they are MS-DOS machines. You can
&gt;get a 80386 and install only Xenix on it, without any MS-DOS partitions. 

That's a pretty amazing feat, since to do this, it would have to a) be a UNIX
(or XENIX) binary, not a DOS binary, b) somehow get root access on the machine,
c) figure out which device is actually the disk, and then d) munge it (d is, of
course, the easiest part).  Even if you run it under a DOS emulator, it is
usually configured such that a DOS program cannot access any random device, or
open up a disk drive (e.g.., it provides a pseudo-disk, for programs that like
to just open up the disk under DOS themselves... but it cannot open up, say,
/dev/root unless /dev/root available via normal permissions to the person who
started the program).

I think you are seriously confused about things, and I will continue to
believe that until I see proof otherwise.

Incorrect.  The virus CAN affect machines that run Xenix or UNIX, but ONLY if
they are booted from MS-DOS with an infected floppy disk.  UNIX filesystem and
program mechanisms, even on UNIXes that support "mounting" of MS-DOS floppies,
will not permit the Michaelangelo virus to install itself under UNIX or Xenix.
The worst that can possibly happen is that a VP/ix or DOS-Merge partition will
be infected, but *if it is only used under VP/ix or DOS-Merge then the primary
boot track will not be affected because VP/ix and DOS-Merge will not allow it
to be accessed*.

Misinformation about viruses is yet another RISK that must be considered.  I've
encountered an article on Usenet from someone who thought (erroneously) that
ALL computers would be affected (perhaps due to the events detailed in the
original RISKS submission?).  This further claim that the virus can somehow
install itself on computers that are never booted into MS-DOS is just as
incorrect.

Lawyerspeak from hell.  Two questions:

&gt;&gt;  b. The Program is to be used only in connection with a single computer.

Isn't this kind of stupid in the license of a program which is
fundamentally most useful in a networking environment?  Or, since
licenses are free, should I get a few licenses for myself, in case I
happen to want to run it on multiple machines?

&gt;&gt;  d. You may not translate the Program into any other computer language.

Including RTL, or assembler?  Darn.  Can't compile it, then.

RISKS of boilerplate legalese?

Good points. We'd happy to receive comments on the legal agreement, since there
aren't many things like RSAREF to compare against. We were aware of the
"lawyerspeak" on the number of copies; it's pretty conventional, and we don't
intend to keep anyone from storing more than one personal copy for personal in
a network environment. But we wanted to start with conservative language. On
the issue of translating into another language, your observation "Can't compile
it" is a good one ... But of course you can compile it. Let's see if we can
work out some better language.

I invite you to join the RSAREF user's group &lt;rsaref-users@rsa.com&gt;, which will
discuss issues such as the license and help us improve things. To join, send
email to &lt;rsaref-users-request@rsa.com&gt;.

Chris Hibbert (xanadu!hibbert@uunet.uu.net) is correct that I misinterpreted
the AVI spec in one important way.  The spec no longer calls for a VIN to 
be transmitted (the term VIN no longer appears in the spec) but rather the
transponder's unique 32-bit code (see section 1705.5(e)(1).  (I was misled by
the retention of the term "AVI".)  This is a significant improvement PROVIDED
that transponder id's are not indexed against VIN's (or SSN's etc) when the
transponders are sold or installed.  The transponder is still to be fixed to
the front bumper (1705.3, 1705.8), as opposed to being bought at 7-11 and kept
in one's glove compartment.  Whoever does the installing or collects payments
will probably have enough information to register the transponder by VIN or
license number.  And this doesn't even count future uses of the transponders
(e.g., 1702.1); future Transaction Record Formats could contain the VIN or
just about anything else.  Thus it is true that "The new draft doesn't leave
room for an identifier of the vehicle or the driver in the communication
packets", but it is also misleading.

I was unclear with regard to the issue of extensibility.  Earlier versions 
did mention the possibility of extension, but the latest is much more explicit
on the subject.  It is also more careful about separating out AVI-specific
features from the underlying generic device.

A number of people have corresponded with me about how one might implement
toll collection without requiring every car to carry a transponder.  My real
complaint had to do with the whole notion of a "spec".  Chris says that "The
spec doesn't talk about [the broader process of toll collection] because it's
not part of the technology being designed."  But this is only true on the
narrowest possible definition of "the technology being designed".  More
socially relevant definitions are possible.

The folks proposing the Privacy Act reprinted in recent Risks issues are aware
of these issues and seem sincere in their desire to protect privacy.  But I am
horrified by Chris' report that:

    Some [Caltrans folks and vendors] are willing to say that they expect
    "other forces" (maybe DEA or INS?) to try to make this kind of equipment
    usable for tracing people's movements.  There may have been attempts to
    make this be standard equipment on new cars.

The atrocious record of the DMV and the reputed attitude of Caltrans provide
little comfort, and it would take a small twitch of California politics to put
all the Senator Lockyers on the street in a few years.  If personal tracking
technologies cannot be made inherently resistant to civil liberties abuse then
they should be banned.

It sounds like you are the victim of two human errors and one piece of
odd coincidence.  First, your mail carrier incorrectly decided to place that
mailpiece in a change-of-address bin.  Then, the change-of-address mail
was passed Computer Forwarding System (CFS) where the seven digits
you described were typed in.  By coincidence, there was someone on your
carrier's route (or the wrong carrier route was typed in) with certain address
similarities who had recently moved (I believe information is maintained for
1.5 years).  Finally, the person who applies the yellow label is supposed
to check the name and apparently didn't.

Seven digits are usually sufficient because mail typically doesn't get to the
CFS unless the mail carrier is aware of an address change.  Quality control at
the final step was probably lacking for the typical reasons (working too fast,
fatigue, boredom, etc.).

&gt; The risk is not so much that the logs are made, but more that the service
&gt; is presented as "anonymous", leading people to believe that it actually is.

 By his tone and statements William Rucklidge shows himself knowledgeable
 about various logging techniques, both administrative and security-oriented,
 as found on many networked hosts,  So, what bothers me?  Two things...

 First: Network application protocols have evolved over 15 years and more.
 FTP has ALWAYS been a man-in-the-loop protocol.  The FTP-user must use a
 (different on each, we pray) valid ID/PW combination on each of the SOURCE
 and TARGET hosts; i.e., must be able to log on or in to each host to migrate
 any file from SOURCE to TARGET.  Various host administrations realized it
 would be of value for a given SOURCE host to make certain files/directories
 widely available, without having to register huge numbers of users.  Result:
 ANONYMOUS FTP, in which the valid ID/PW combination on the SOURCE host only,
 and for a limited file or directory set, reduces to an advertised pair such
 as "anonymous" and "guest", or "anonymous" and "any-non-null-string", etc.

 The meaning of 'anonymous' here is NOT that no one logs such a transaction;
 rather, that the user can obtain files without being a registered user of
 the SOURCE host.  'Anonymous' here equates to convenient, not unidentifiable.

 Second: William Rucklidge implies, maybe even states, that a widely-known
 Internet host permitted itself to be an anonymous FTP TARGET.  I hope not!

 However, even if the MBDF-A virus was migrated TO a TARGET host by someone
 using a registered ID/PW combination, that indicates a breakdown of trust
 at some point.  Perhaps the (SOURCE or) TARGET host administrator did not
 know his user.  Perhaps the user shared his ID/PW combination.  Perhaps
 someone or two stole an ID/PW combo.  I don't know, and my speculations are
 ignorant and dangerous.  My point: host and network use is built upon and
 dependent upon trust.  Trust is a fragile thing, the substrate of cooperation.

 William Rucklidge, writing from a host apparently at the site where the two
 people alleged to have spread the virus were arrested, seems to imply that
 'anonymous' ought to mean unidentifiable.  I hope I misinterpreted what he
 wrote.  In any society built and dependent on trust, such as our Internet,
 a user should NOT want anonymity, not even as a matter of FTP convenience;
 surely, NEVER as a mechanism for evasion.

If the rate of descent was really 3,300 feet per minute, as reports suggest,
then 200 ft gives 3.636 seconds before impact, assuming flat terrain. I do not
have information about the terrain. Allowing two seconds to react, is this
enough time to go around? I believe that go-arounds can be executed from a few
feet, *if they are expected*, and if the engines have not spooled down. I
wonder what the tolerance on the 200 feet is, and what the allowable delay in
generating the message is? The slant angle of the beam will affect the actual
height at which 200 ft is measured, unless this is corrected for.

Subject: Re: More on the Airbus A320 (<A HREF="/Risks/13.19.html">RISKS-13.19</A>)

It's wrong to assume this is really a crash-alert system, like a GPWS.  It's
designed for use with an airliner flying a normal approach.  Confused?  Allow
me explain!

In a normal airplane, duties are divided between pilot flying and pilot-not-
flying.  Pilot flying flies the approach: manipulates the control column,
throttle, autopilot, etc.  Pilot not flying handles radios, checklists,
navigation, systems, etc.  During the last few minutes of the approach, he
makes call-outs: decision height (when one has to go around if the runway's not
in sight), and a variety of standard altitudes (1000', 500', 200', 100', 50',
etc).  All "above ground," as opposed to regular altimeter readouts, which are
usually "above mean sea level."  (exception being the radio altimeter, which
always displays distance above the ground immediately underneath the sensor).
I can really digress on this point, if pressured. :-)

The call-out practice is intended to enhance the situational awareness of the
pilot flying the airplane, as well as the crew as a whole.  The exact call-outs
are normally subject to airline policy and the approach being flown: some are
very superficial, while others have call-outs at practically every 20 feet.

During these call-outs, it is assumed the airplane would be in the "safe" GPWS
envelope, since it's flying a normal flight path, presumably over level terrain
at this point, and bumping into a sloping mountain isn't much of an issue.
GPWS doesn't know the difference between an airport boundary and a cornfield,
and it would be irritating to have a major warning every time the airplane
simply passes a threshold altitude.

On the A320, of COURSE, the call-outs are automated, freeing the F/O to do
other things.  The system makes all call-outs, including one just before
touchdown, reminding the pilots to activate the thrust reversers, by yelling
"RETARD!"  You can bet this improves the self-esteem of the pilots. :-)

So, again, this is all pretty irrelevant to the Strasbourg crash.  The system
isn't a warning or caution; it's just advisory.  Whether we want the system to
be *automated* is another question entirely, though. As stated, the practice is
designed to improve crew communication.  The whole idea behind call-outs is to
verify that pilot A flying the airplane is thinking the same thing as pilot B,
who is making the call-outs.  All automated call-outs accomplish is to verify
that Pilots A &amp; B both *independently* agree that the computer knows what it's
doing; they may then grow to rely upon its accuracy, and on the other pilot to
cross-check his own instruments.  Automated call-outs are yet another
interesting new dimension on the functional social atmosphere and
professionalism of the cockpit environment.
 
Another practical consideration is that, considering the human factors problems
of tape-style instruments, which provide the altitude and airspeed indications
on the A320, I think it would be a good idea to keep the PNF calling out the
altitudes, rather than rely on the radio altimeter computer.  Especially when
one considers all the approaches that DON'T have a nice, smooth field for miles
around the airport, but rather are on mountains, near cliffs, etc., and will
cause the radio altimeter to think it's much higher than it actually is.  A
human pilot could cross-check with the barometric altimeter; the computer is
designed to work with the radio altimeter.

As for the three seconds they may have had on the Air Inter, and what they
might have done with them: who knows?  If they were in a cloud, they'd be
inclined to believe their instruments and continue flying the airplane,
checking secondary sources for confirmatory information.  And there goes
the three seconds.  On an airplane which is prone to spurious warnings,
they'd probably ignore it, especially if they think they're at 8,000', 
3000' above their target altitude, which, in turn, is a couple thousand
feet above the maximum terrain elevation for the sector.  And then there's 
the good possibility they had much less than three seconds, since, even 
though they were descending at 3000 fpm, they were also going forward at 180 
knots or so.  Pete's comment of 1 second tends to support this idea.

As an aside, good pilots do not yank back on the controls and perform dramatic
maneuvers every time a light goes off: more accidents have been caused by that
sort of behavior than otherwise.  There's an old story of an astronaut -- Gus
Grissom, I believe -- who was suddenly presented with a rather dramatic array
of warnings while on the pad.  Rather than start flipping switches instantly,
as training required, he took a second or two to get his bearings, and study
the situation.  In that period, the systems reset, and the warning lights went
out.  He's commented that if he HAD started doing things instinctively, he
could have REALLY got himself into a lot of trouble.

I suppose there's a moral there for systems that perform automated tasks on the
basis of immediate data--and don't give the pilot the final authority to
correct those mistakes, when spurious data corrects itself or is identified.
GIGO rules.

Just my $0.02.

Just a comment on the function of callouts.  In any airplane, automated or not,
callouts on the final approach do more than ensure that both crew members share
a notion of what is going on.  Flying an approach is a visually intensive task
for the pilot flying regardless of the weather conditions.  An auditory callout
by the PNF provides the pilot flying with important information in a sense
modality that is not already heavily loaded. United Airlines, for example,
mandates a callout at 500' above touchdown that includes the radio altitude,
the descent rate, and an indication of speed relative to the target approach
speed. For example, "five hundred feet, seven down, plus four" would mean seven
hundred feet per minute descent rate, and four knots above target approach
speed.  When you are trying to pick up the approach lights in broken clouds and
would like to transition from instruments to outside references, it is real
nice to learn (without having to look) that you are on path, with an
appropriate descent rate and a have few knots of speed over the target.

If any of you find that the first recommendation of the commission report
translated by Peter Mellor smells suspiciously like a commitment to a cause
for this accident, you might be interested to know that Northwest Airlines
began a program to develop new crew procedures for the use of flight path angle
and vertical speed modes in their A320's before the latest accident happened.
I think the problems have been known to airlines operating the A320 for some
time.  Even if it turns out that the accident was not caused by a confusion of
these modes, the report acknowledges that it is an issue that ought to be
addressed.

The following is a translation of the relevant paragraphs of the interim report:

  The point of impact was situated at an altitude of around 800 metres on the
  south-west slope of "la Bloss" mountain, which rises to 823m (see map in
  annex 1). At this place, the ground slopes upwards. The amount of slope
  varies between 8 and 17%. A forest of pines about 25 metres tall covers the
  entire area. The distance over which trees had been damaged was about 120
  metres.

  Measurements taken of the damaged trees allowed a rough estimate that the
  aircraft entered the trees at an angle of descent of about 12 degrees, with a
  roll inclination of the order of 18 degrees.

  ---End of extract 

The map in annex 1 is large scale, and shows very little. 

Obviously "slopes upwards" means upwards in the direction in which the 
aircraft was travelling. 

The flight data from the QAR approximately confirms the above estimates. The 
QAR was burned, and in particular the last 25 seconds worth of tape prior to 
impact was damaged, and had to be read by special means. The last frame that 
has been read so far is at impact -4 seconds. This final reading shows:

Barometric altitude =  2750 ft
Radio altitude      =   600 ft
Vertical speed      = -4000 ft/min (and seems to have been increasing)
Airspeed            =   186 kt 
Bearing (cap)       =    68 deg

To calculate time to impact from the point at which the radiosonde reported 
200ft (which it would have measured relative to the tree-tops), we must take 
into account the upward slope of the ground, as well as the horizontal and 
vertical speeds of the aircraft. The airspeed would need to be corrected for 
wind velocity to get ground speed. The meteorological report for the area of 
the crash site gives wind between 1000 and 2000 metres as north-east or 
east-north-east 25 to 35 kt irregular, gusting to 40 kt. 

Since it is nearly 7 pm, and I have a pint waiting for me in the Sekforde Arms, 
I will leave this calculation to somebody more dedicated, but bear in mind 
that the ground was uneven, so that any estimate is bound to be rough. 

My own finger-in-the-air guess at the time to impact is "not very long". 
After they heard that "Two hundred feet" announcement, the pilots wouldn't 
even have had time to say "Merde!", never mind do a go-around.

I think you mean to say that any one of a number of factors WOULD have saved
the airplane.  It's the COMBINATION of the factors that caused the crash.

I certainly don't want to fly on anything so screwed up that it's going to
crash for a whole bunch of reasons!

         TSE computers go berserk, floor closed for four hours
         Breakdown bolsters opposition to computerized trading
         BY CAROLYN LEITCH, Toronto Globe and Mail, 
         4 March 1992, business section, lead item

   A software glitch caused computers at the Toronto Stock Exchange to go
berserk yesterday, scrambling information, recording wildly inaccurate prices
and failing to print tickets to confirm trades.  Floor traders quickly used the
breakdown to bolster their opposition to the TSE's planned move next year to an
entirely computerized trading floor.  The malfunction also illustrated the
problems many organizations encounter when they try to change the software code
that instructs computers.

   TSE officials closed down floor trading for nearly four hours between 10 a.m
and 2 p.m. after irregularities were detected in the computer system that
traders use to buy and sell equities.  Carl Christie, a senior professional
trader with Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc. and chairman of the Professional
Traders Association, said he noticed dramatic problems shortly after the market
opened at 9:30 a.m.  An order to buy 20,000 shares in Teck Corp. at $17.37 a
share appeared on the computer as a bid for 3,339 shares at $279.50 a share, he
said.  As well, some sellers were unaware their sell offers had been accepted
because the system was not printing confirmation tickets.

   The TSE said it didn't know if it would have to unwind any of the trades.
The exchange said disputes over orders that went awry will be decided on a
case-by-case basis by floor governors.  Mr. Christie said that as as
specialized trader with certain stocks, he had no flow of orders coming in
during yesterday's shutdown.  As many as 150 other traders were also affected,
he added.  "I know that it cost me money -- we lost two-thirds of our working
day."

   The TSE has voted to replace floor trading with a fully computerized system
early in 1993.  That decision is unpopular with floor traders who fear for
their jobs.

   The bugs appeared after the TSE changed its computer software over the
weekend to deal with new trading rules.  Olaf Kraulis, vice-president of
information systems at the TSE, said the system was restored to its pre-weekend
state after flour hours of grappling with the problem.  He said the software
changes will be reinstated in one or two weeks after programmers figure out why
they fouled up the computer system.

   But Don Unruh, a former TSE vice-president who helped develop the system
eight years ago, said the problems run deeper than yesterday's malfunction.  A
patchwork of different software and hardware has emerged over the years, he
said.  "The people who are making the changes eight years later have no idea
what was done by the people who went before them.  You end up with these
bizarre logic problems."  Mr. Unruh, now a consultant who recently wrote a
report on the TSE's computers for the Professional Traders Association, said
the whole system should be scrapped and a new one developed.

   But Mr. Kraulis said thousands of changes are made to software every year
with few problems.  While the 12 Tandem Computer processors that power the
system have backup provisions in case of a hardware failure, there is no such
contingency for software problems.  "If a copy of the software is wrong, every
copy will be wrong," he said.

   Leonard Petrillo, the TSE's vice-president of corporate affairs, said the
impact on members was minimal.  "Most of the stocks are inter-listed," Mr.
Petrillo said, "and traders were able to instantaneously reroute orders to
other exchanges," such as the Montreal Exchange and the New York Stock
Exchange.  [...]

Summarized from the March 2, 1992, Newsweek, page 58: "Eve Takes Another Fall"

In 1987, a group at UC Berkeley used a computer to analyze mitochondrial DNA
from 147 people and proclaimed that all humankind descended from one woman who
lived in Africa 200,000 years ago.  Last year the team ran a more rigorous
analysis using 189 samples and again concluded the same thing.

The program tries to find the family tree that is most "parsimonious"; that is,
a tree based on the fewest genetic mutations.  The trouble is that there are
multiple equally parsimonious trees, and no algorithm to guarantee the computer
has found the best one.  The resulting tree depends on the order of the data
input.  The Berkeley group assumed the order of data was irrelevant.  "They
weren't using the program in an adequate way," says Alan Templeton of
Washington University.

One explanation of why it took so long to discover this error: ``...[they]
didn't have the mathematical savvy to understand the statistical traps in the
computer.''

There is an ad on TV for a 1-900 telephone service spelling game - if you can
spell twenty words correctly in two minutes, you win $200.  I guess you hear
the words and type them in on your touchtone pad.  Assuming that the game isn't
rigged to make it impossible to win, it would be pretty easy to devise a hack
to allow you to type words on your PC, check their spellings, and send out the
correct touch-tone signals on the fly.

The parts for this hack are readily available.  There are good spell
checkers and big dictionaries (word lists).  Modems these days have
dialers that generate touch-tone, it ought to be possible to program
them to talk to the spelling game (sending tones at the proper speed
and spacing).  I imagine that this computer-aided approach would
improve your odds to a significant extent.

Andrew's message reminds me of this morning's news item that AT&amp;T will need far
fewer operators because it is automating voice processing to eliminate some
operator assistance.  (The scheme is already being tested in various areas.)
The collect call initiation permits the caller to pack an arbitrary short
message into the time slot for the caller's presumed name.  I imagine that will
open up all sorts of new games that are currently prevented by operator
assistance.  On the other hand, it has always been possible to do that now with
a little prearranged coding.  With the new scheme, you would not even have to
resort to Tuesday Weld to anticipate arrival in Maine, Gal Friday to indicate
Galveston, etc.)  It would seem to be much more flagrant with the new scheme.
So, maybe they will try to filter out strange sequences.  Blocking short bursts
of 2.4Kb data transmissions might be possible, for example!  But it would be
terrible to restrict it to small dictionaries like telephone book names
suitably pronounced without too much of an accent.  This sounds like a freebie
fraught with fraud, I'm afraid.

Private SS Data Sold to Information Brokers
San Jose Mercury News, Saturday February 29, 1992. 

Private Social Security data sold to 'information brokers'
By R.A. Zaldivar, Mercury News Washington Bureau

Washington - The privacy of 200 million Americans with records at the Social
Security Administration is threatened by an illegal trade in pilfered computer
files.  Computerization has dramatically improved our ability to serve the
public," Social Security Deputy Commissioner Louis Enoff told a Senate panel
Friday.  "However, it has also made confidentiality more difficult."

Two executives of Nationwide Electronic Tracking, a Tampa, Fla., company,
pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in January for their part in a national
network selling Social Security records.  Twenty-three people, including agency
employees and police officials, have been indicted in the case - the largest
known theft of government computer data.  "Information brokers" will pay Social
Security employees $25 for a person's earnings history and then sell the data
for as much as $300. Their growing list of customers includes lawyers, private
investigators, employers, and insurance companies.

Social Security records contain a mother lode of information that includes not
only a person's past earnings but names of employers, family history and even
bank account numbers of people who receive benefits by direct deposit.  The
information can be used to find people or to make decisions on hiring, firing,
suing or lending, said Larry Morey, deputy inspector general of the Health and
Human Services Department.

"Here we have a large-scale invasion of the Social Security system's
confidentiality," said Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., chairman of the Social
Security subcommittee.

Information from other government data bases with records on individuals - such
as the FBI's National Criminal Information Center - is also available on the
underground market. All a broker needs is the cooperation of a clerk at a
computer terminal.

Congress may revise privacy laws to increase penalties for illegally disclosing
information in the private files of individuals.

Enoff said Social Security is studying ways to improve computer security, as
well as keeping closer tabs on employees with access to files, and stressing to
its workers that unauthorized disclosure of information is a federal crime.

  Perhaps if release of information was keyed to a digital signature of the
  [clerk, this could be used to identify those persons (at SSA) selling the
  information. No mention is made of the buyers of the information from the
  broker. I guess they just get to keep the illegally obtained information.

  Now I wonder what happens when this happens in California at the DMV, and a
  copy of my digitized signature is sold?  Chuck Lins lins@apple.com]

There has been an attempt in the UN organisation World Intellectual Property
Organization, WIPO, to harmonize world's patent laws.  It seems to be that USA
is just about the only country who is pressing for "patents on all fields of
technology" while many countries oppose things like patents on software and
biotechnology.  The developing countries say that many patents are one of the
Western worlds' ways of keeping ahead in the game and keeping the developing
countries behind.

In UN, it's one vote per country so USA has not been very successful.  However,
USA seems to have more success via GATT, as Kurt Jaeger writes on
misc.int-property:

"Look e.g. on rusmv1.rus.uni-stuttgart.de [129.69.1.12] in directory
info/comp.patents/lpf-de/docs/GATT-draft.txt.Z, its a copy of the TRIPS stuff
in the GATT treaty (TRIPS == trade &lt;something&gt; intellectual property &lt;something
else&gt;).

TRIPS, the part of GATT dealing with software patents etc IS NOT under
discussion any more in the GATT, as I've been told by the german official who's
heading the german part of the EC delegation of GATT. If the agricultural
problems are solved, we'll HAVE software patents all over Europe. And biotech
patents as well, btw.  8("

&gt;Unless you assume that the pilots flying A320s are more stupid than
&gt;average, then if pilots have more crashes in A320s than other planes,
&gt;even if the cause is officially `pilot error', there must be something
&gt;about the plane that makes errors more likely.

My statistics friends would laugh at this, or sigh and shake their heads.
The proper version is "...if pilots have *significantly* more crashes...".

One must remember that COINCIDENCES DO HAPPEN.  Remember the time
some years ago when it seemed that whenever you turned on the radio,
there was another report of a DC-10 crash?  Haven't heard many lately,
have you?  What changed?  Basically, nothing.  Oh, some minor changes
were made in the aircraft and its operating procedures, but that spate
of crashes was mostly sheer bad luck.  Modern airliners very seldom
crash; the DC-10 just had a couple of bad years, with mechanical flaws,
bad maintenance, navigation problems, and (yes) pilot error all striking
down the same type of aircraft at around the same time.

It's still actually open to doubt whether the DC-10 is significantly less
safe than its competitors.  The numbers do suggest so, but they are based
on so few incidents -- compared to the enormous number of successful and
uneventful flights -- that it is entirely possible that the DC-10 has
simply had bad luck.  In military flying, with much higher accident rates,
it is not at all uncommon for the investigation of a series of accidents
to find that the failures were unrelated and the timing just coincidence.

On the whole, I think there is some reason to suspect that the A320 has
human-interface problems.  But that conclusion is based on the *details*
of the cases so far, not on just counting them.  It will be quite a while
before we have enough data on A320 crash rates to start to draw any valid
numeric conclusions about whether it really crashes unusually often.

I too experienced strange behaviour with Feb 29 dates.  A Windows 3.0
newsreader I have been prototyping using Borland C++ 2.0 has been happily
chugging along for a number of weeks without hassle.  Then (of course) it
locked up for no apparent reason.

Tracing the program revealed that during the parsing of "Date:" headers, when
it called the "mktime" function to convert the dates to the Unix date/time
format, it locked up.  I haven't delved deeply into disassembling the code for
"mktime", so I don't know the exact cause of the problem, but the call was
very quickly replaced with an alternative version of "mktime". :-)

So, some of these problems; at least on PC architectures; may be attributable
to bugs in the run-time libraries of Borland C++ and possibly Turbo C++ also,
rather than to the authors of packages that use the run-time libraries.

Shortly after this electronic license agreement showed up inside OSF, 
we received a missive from our attorney asking in no uncertain terms
that we not execute the license (and revoke it and dispose of the  
software if we had).  The major problem revolves around the fact that
the technology is export controlled.  The original posting stated:

&gt;    4.   You can't send RSAREF outside the United States, or give it
&gt;         to anyone who is not a United States citizen and doesn't
&gt;         have a "green card." (These are U.S. State and Commerce
&gt;         Department requirements, because RSA and DES are
&gt;         export-controlled technologies.)

The problem is that the intuitive meaning of this paragraph is misleading.  The
intuitive meaning is that you must not intentionally do something that
explicitly transfers the software to someone who should not have it (for
brevity, call this individual a `restricted person').  Unfortunately, the
actual restriction includes unintentional acts, and acts of omission (didn't do
something you should have).  An example could be include putting the source
files on a system to which a restricted person has access (unbeknownst to you).

If something goes wrong, the government may come after both you and your
employer (by holding your employer responsible for your actions).  At the very
least, anyone contemplating putting this software on one of their employer's
systems should run the license past the appropriate lawyer.  There are other
more mundane reasons for a lawyer to say no, such as needing to formally verify
that RSA really is who they say they are.

The RISK here is that the quasi-public distribution mechanism being set up by
RSA may well be inappropriate for export controlled software.  This is not like
the copyright laws; people go to jail for violating export control laws.

Disclaimer I: This post is a statement about the export control laws; it has
nothing to do with my views about how distribution of this software should (or
should not be) controlled.  If you've ever wondered about the restrictions that
export control laws place on information interchange and technology transfer,
you now have a concrete example.

Disclaimer II: Nothing in this post should be relied on as legal advice.  If
you think you might have a problem, go find a real lawyer.

It is not public, but at least one large software company does put in some
integrity checks in its software.  While this isn't Virus protection, it is a
step in the right direction.

I wonder if a more technical term like "Transportable Boot Sector Modification
Programs" would engender the same amount of popular press.  Question: How many
people are going to start wearing gloves when they use their computers?

It is also interesting that an MSDOS Virus is getting this attention.  Macs 
are actually more vulnerable since the passive insertion of a disk will cause 
the execution of a procedure whereas you must execute off the disk in order 
to run program on it.  I presume that the larger number of PC users and, 
perhaps, more of a history of exchanging programs contributes to the spread.

The infection is actually worse in object-oriented systems since objects are 
active elements (i.e., they come with methods and behaviors.  One can argue 
that any object IS a kind of Virus that comes with its executable code and 
relies on the local environment to give it life.  Dealing with issues like 
this is what delays seemingly good ideas.  In fact, over 25 years ago, there 
was to be T access in Multics.  T stood for "Trap".  When you attempted to 
access a segment with Trap access, a trap routine, provided by the segments 
owner would be run.  Of course, it would have to be run in the owner's access 
domain with the user protected from bad behavior though the trap procedure 
would also be executing in some form of the user's environment.  No surprise 
that T access didn't make into the (relatively) secure production system.  
But the thinking raise issues of mutually suspicious subsystems generating 
various theses.  One indirect result is the ring architecture of the 386. The 
moderator and other readers can contribute many more details to this history.

By being naive, the Mac was able to implement a very user-friendly feature.  
A smart disk allows one to insert a disk and let it install itself.  Only 
etiquette demands that it should ask permission before starting.  The Mac 
also naively implemented bitmap fonts on a fixed size screen.  Scaleable 
fonts weren't even imagined by most users.

So which is right -- the Multics approach of implementing a feature after it 
is somewhat understood or the Mac approach of doing what makes things easy 
for the user and then fixing it up later.  Novell implemented a remote file 
system by patching into DOS in a way that 3com didn't.  As a result, people 
bought Novell's product and Microsoft has to accommodate them.  Cellular 
phones with their lack of security are another example.  Conversely, all 
electronic devices brought onto airplanes are, for some reason, suspect.  
Apparently turning them on at a security point exorcises the daemons...

In the case of viruses, we might achieve a balance of terror by hanging a few 
creators (chosen by lottery) by their typing fingers and hoping the problem 
abates.  Some firewalls will be added to software.  The alternative of 
creating truly secure software is possible -- just prevent naive users from 
getting near computers.

I wish to apologize for the extremely poor wording of my original article.  The
point I was trying to make was that the Michaelangelo virus does NOT attack
Macintoshes, Amigas, SUN workstations, UNISYS mainframes, etc. etc., but the
radio program made no mention of any such distinctions.

I used the phrase "MS-DOS clone machines" to mean IBM PC-compatible computers.

&gt;That's a pretty amazing feat, since to do this, ...

Unfortunately, it is no problem at all since Michelangelo is a BIOS virus (no
it doesn't infect the BIOS, it uses it) and this is present and essentially
standardized (what makes a PC "100%" compatable) in every Intel box that is
able to boot DOS.

The virus uses Intel iapx80x86 assembly language but only uses BIOS interrupts
not MS-DOS interrupts (my FixMBR does also which is why it can repair "invalid"
disks but needs DOS to load the program).

The important fact is that when a PC frst loads absolute sector 1 from a disk,
it is already, courtesy of the BIOS, a fully functioning computer with the
ability to address all of its peripherals. It is just not yet a MS-DOS (or
PC-DOS, or OS/2, or Unix, or...) computer yet. The original Flight Simulator
and many DOS 1.0 programs (the ones you had to boot from the floppy but were
unreadable by DOS) were examples of BIOS-only programs.

Unfortunately, except for a few of us -and many virus-writers 8*( -this seems
to be a "lost art". 

The problem that Michelangelo has stems from things it expects that are
characteristics of DOS and are not necessarily true:

1) That absolute sector 7 on the fixed disk is unused
2) That memory marked in software as "unavailable" by the BIOS will not be used

Neither assumption is necessarily true under Unix though it is usually (1)
that causes Mich (or Stoned or ...) to fail on a Unix platform by making it
unbootable.

BTW IMHO any damage that results from Michelangelo may be laid directly at 
the feet of the OS vendors for Intel based platforms (and this includes
UNIX as well as DOS) who do nothing about "rogue programs" at the BIOS level 
(over 50% of all reported infections last year)

Ten bytes in IO.SYS (or the boot record, or the MBR like my stuff) are all that
is necessary to find every MBR infector that I have come across including
Brain, Yale, Aircop, Stoned, Evil Empire, Bloody, and many others including
the Michelangelo.

The question is: if we do not take steps now to eliminate these viruses, 
what are we ever going to do about the really nasty and professional (the
Michelangelo is very buggy &amp; "crude") viruses that I know could be written ?

I wish there was some way to stop the media from spreading such bad advice
as resetting the clock to circumvent the Michelangelo and other date virus
strains. Don't they know the virus is still there and can become more 
widespread if it isn't removed? =Steve=

On Wednesday, 04-MAR-92 Channel 4 TV in the UK broadcast a program concerning
the difficulty of testing complex software systems - specifically the reactor
shutdown system for the Sizewell B Pressurized Water Reactor that is currently
under construction.

Nothing very new was said; it was the usual mix of nuclear industry suspicion
of people's intentions when requesting information and people's concern with
living in the same country as a nuclear power plant whose safety system cannot
be properly tested.  The angle that the program's producers had choosen
to highlight was that it is software based and we have not figured out how
to test (reliably) 100,000 lines of code.

The best bit was an implication that Nuclear Electric (the builders) had an
inkling of the scale of the effort required to test the system properly and
their attitude was that it would take so long and cost so much that it was
obviously not practical :-)

In the course of the program we saw many screens purporting to show "computer
programs"; a selection:

	o   A .newsrc scrolling by (comp.risks makes a guest appearance!)
	
	o   A UNIX directory listing

	o   What looked like an abbreviated PostScript program

It seems that the risks associated with the untestability of complex software
systems are beginning to be recognised by the layman.  The message that the TV
program gave me was of the concern of people outside the (software) industry
that we do not know how to guarantee the reliability of our products.

The licensing of Software Engineers was not mentioned once.

The city of Los Angeles was recently graced with the world premiere of the new
opera "Kullervo" by Aulis Sallinen, a talented Finnish composer.  At the open
dress rehearsal, I noted that the score seemed to include some synthesized
sounds, which I later confirmed by an inspection of the orchestra pit.  The
synthesizer used was a Yamaha DX-7 II, which aficionados will recognize as an
already-obsolete instrument which is no longer manufactured.  I suspect that
Mr.  Sallinen (who appears to be in his 60's) is completely unaware that in
twenty years it is going to be nearly impossible to acquire a working DX-7 to
duplicate the sounds he intended.  Perhaps synthesizer manufacturers will
recognize this problem and include a backwards-compatibility mode, but more
probably works written for live synthesizer performance (I seem to remember
that "The Phantom of the Opera" uses a couple of synthesizers) are going to
have to compromise on timbral quality.

It's already well-nigh impossible to duplicate the sounds of the old analog
synthesizers with modern digital ones, but so far this problem hasn't affected
mainstream classical music (rock and jazz have a double advantage, both because
recordings dominate in listening to older works, and because flexibility in
performance is not only accepted but expected).

This all gives a whole new meaning to the "original instruments" school of
classical performance.  I wonder if I could interest Christopher Hogwood in
building a collection of DX-7's? :-)

On our Internet gateways, we run a variety of security monitors.  Among other
things, these detect attempts to connect to services that are generally of no
legitimate interest to outsiders.  But the alarm that went off the other day
was a bit different; the services contacted weren't the usual targets.

The answer turned out to be fairly interesting.  It seems that a university 5
timezones away was installing a new network management system.  This program
was, it seems, self-configuring -- it went out and tried to discover the
topology of the network.  The *WHOLE* network, as best I can tell.

I wonder how many sites were probed -- and didn't notice -- before I alerted
the administrators.

There are all sorts of other implications, of course.  For one thing, I don't
know if I was being told the truth, though I have little reason to doubt it.
And such a comprehensive network map can be used to commit all sorts of
mischief.  But as far as I know, that didn't happen this time.

Quoting from: ALPHA ARCHITECTURE TECHNICAL SUMMARY (Dick Sites, Rich Witek) in
comp.arch:

"Alpha is also unconventional in the approach to arithmetic traps. In contrast
to conventional RISC architectures, Alpha arithmetic traps (overflow,
underflow, etc.) are imprecise -- they can be delivered an arbitrary number of
instructions after the instruction that triggered the trap, and traps from many
different instructions can be reported at once.  This makes implementations
that use pipelining and multiple issue substantially easier to build."

... and to use safely?

However, the next paragraph does provide what I would classify as a sop to
DEC's technical conscience by stating:

"If precise arithmetic exceptions are desired, trap barrier instructions can be
explicitly inserted in the program to force traps to be delivered at specific
points."

&gt; "Information brokers" will pay Social Security employees $25 for a
&gt; person's earnings history and then sell the data for as much as $300.

In that case we had better on the watch for the enterprising congressperson who
can do arithmetic and who notices that the SSA could go into the retail market
itself, sell 200,000,000 records for $60B, and close next year's budget gap.
				
The number seems high; one wonders whether $300 is the market price for an SSA
record selected at random, or for selected records in the Iacocca-and-above
class.

The ending of my last message should have read "it's *not* as much of
a coincidence as you might think" -- here it is in it's corrected form:

I don't doubt that there were human errors as this particular piece of mail
tried to make its way from the bank to my house.  However, I think you are
wrong about the seven characters being "one piece of odd coincidence." A
significant fraction of Ithaca's population is made up of students (probably
more than 1/4, but less than 1/2), and students move frequently.  If you have a
common last name it is pretty likely there's someone else with a similar last
name who's also a student and lives in the neighborhood.  And there are lots of
street numbers in the 100 to 300 range in the areas where students live!

I looked at the student phone book and picked two common last names, Chen and
Smith, and found 2 Chens that live at a house numbered 109 and two Smiths that
live at a house numbered 210 in the Collegetown area.  They all live on
different streets and have different first names.  I don't know if these
particular examples would involve the same mail carrier, but I'm sure there are
examples that do.

So it's not as much of a coincidence as you might think! That's why I think
one or two more characters for the hash code would help.

As the other person Christine mentioned who's had similar problems with mail
forwarding in Ithaca, I have a hard time attributing the problem to "odd
coincidence."  I received occasional misforwarded mail (including, at one
point, a COD delivery notice) over a period of about six months.  As was the
case with Richard Chang, the person's 7-letter key matched mine, but the names
and addresses were clearly different.  I would write "incorrectly forwarded" on
the front of each and put them back in my mailbox.  I sincerely hope they all
eventually reached her; I never saw them again.

I had moved from Ithaca to Schenectady and back -- some of the mail forwarded
made the round trip.  Ever wondered whether "Return address requested" is
attended to?  The answer's yes -- I got a credit card bill with her name and my
address on it!  The last straw was an envelope from a local community college
with my name and address handwritten on the outside and a loan form with her
name and address on the inside.  So not only did the postal employee not check
that the names/addresses matched, but neither did the recipient of the
forwarding information.  The addition to the key of one letter from either the
first name or the street name would have avoided the problem in my case and, by
quick perusal of the phone book, several others.

Ithaca is a university town so naturally there are certain times when a large
number of people move at once.  This would seem to imply that it is especially
important that we have a reasonable forwarding process.  This one doesn't
behave quite reasonably enough for me.

	Now I know why the post office for greater metropolitan Selinsgrove,
Pa. (all fits quite comfortably in one zip code) included one stray letter in
my mother-in-law's forwarded mail when she stayed with us for a while last
year.  It may also explain why my income tax refund was returned to the IRS
about five years ago.  Still, considering how much mail is handled, and the
large number of customers the post office serves, this seems to be a rare
error.  Much more common, in my experience, is getting mail intended for the
family at the same street number, one street away, and I believe that is mostly
'operator error', because the letter carriers sort that themselves, by hand.

Perhaps it's worth noting that this is one of those situations where
adding redundancy to quality control -decreases- quality in what I like
to call the "Kitty Genovese" effect.

I first noticed this in one of W. Edwards Deming's books.  For each
inspector one adds in series to a process, the greater the likelihood
that a defect will go unnoticed.  It works something like this:

With a single inspector, she knows that the next person to check the
item she's inspecting is the customer.  If something goes wrong, she
is the one to take the blame.

With two inspectors, each relies on the other to inspect, so his
inspection is somewhat less thorough.  Also, if a defective unit gets
through, the inspectors share the blame equally.

With 100 inspectors, almost no inspection at all is done;  each thinks,
"Surely with 99 other inspectors a defective unit will be caught!"  As a
result, all but the most glaring defects get through.

I counted three "inspections" in the mail handling process described;
sorting by the mail carrier, typing in of the seven-digit code, and
checking of the name by the person whose job it is to affix the yellow
change-of-address stickers.

By coincidence, the New York Times has just run a pair of articles on the
subject of repetitive stress injuries.  I've enclosed substantial extracts from
the two articles.  Speaking personally, I find that I have more trouble with my
wrist when I'm very tired to start with.  (I'm very tired right now, and I
almost didn't prepare this message because my tendonitis is acting up again.)
A wrist rest helps me immensely.  Conversely, too much mouse activity is
problematic, since I don't have effective support for my wrist then.  Typing on
too high a surface -- such as a regular desk, as opposed to a typing table --
is a sure-fire recipe for trouble (again, for me).  It's even worse if the desk
has a sharp edge I have to avoid.  Most important -- I've learned to listen to
my hands.  If I'm starting to feel pains, it's probably a good day to catch up
on journal articles, rather than to start writing a paper.

EPIDEMIC AT THE COMPUTER: HAND AND ARM INJURIES, by JANE E. BRODY
c.1992 N.Y. Times News Service
   Work-related injuries, long the plague of those who do heavy manual labor,
have become a scourge among white-collar workers, too.
   Experts say hundreds of thousands of office workers are being disabled each
year in an epidemic of motion-related damage to the hands and arms that is
costing the nation many billions of dollars annually.
   The problem is expected to worsen in the current recession as businesses
demand greater output from fewer employees and workers ignore symptoms for fear
of losing their jobs.
   Over the last decade disorders caused by movements repeated many thousands
of times a day, long a plague on assembly lines and in processing plants, have
invaded the once low-risk environment of the office worker along with the
computer.
   Computer operators spend many hours in the same position doing the same task
without breaks or variation, giving no time for stressed tissues to recover.
   Over time, this behavior can induce crippling changes in the sensitive
tissues of the wrist and hand.
   High rates of injury have been reported among data entry workers, telephone
operators and newspaper reporters and editors who work for many hours a day
typing on a computer keyboard.  ...
   People with the disorders, which can sometimes be permanent, can find
themselves unemployable or forced to change careers. Favorite sports
activities, housework, carrying groceries, or even holding a coffee cup may
become difficult or impossibly painful.
   The disorders have many names -- repetitive stress or repetitive motion
injuries, cumulative trauma disorders, of which carpal tunnel syndrome is one,
and most recently, work-related musculoskeletal disorders, the designation of
the World Health Organization.
   But it all boils down to damage caused principally to tissues within the
hand and arm by seemingly innocent actions that are repeated perhaps thousands
of times each work day, like typing on a computer, cutting meat or poultry or
etching glass.  ...
   The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons estimated in 1984 that the
problem cost the nation more than $27 billion a year in lost wages and medical
care, an amount that could well have doubled by now since there has been more
than a doubling in reported cases.
   Dr. Marvin J. Dainoff, a psychologist who is the director of the Center for
Ergonomic Research at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, has called repetitive
stress injury the ``occupational disease of the 90s'' similar to the asbestos
crisis of the 1980s.  ...
   ``Those with problems that are caught early can expect to recover in a few
months,'' said Dr. Emil Pascarelli, director of ambulatory care at [St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center]. ``But workers with severe injuries can take a
year or more to get better.''
   In some parts of the country, workers diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome
are often treated with surgery to reduce pressure on the nerve that is
compressed by swollen or enlarged tissue passing through the wrist.
   While some surgeons say the procedure is remarkably helpful to 60 to 80
percent of patients, other experts say it is abused by doctors who do not try
more conservative remedies first. Carpal tunnel surgery is now the second most
common operation performed in this country.  ...
   But repetitive motion disorders received only a flicker of expert attention
until they began striking white-collar workers and especially newspaper
reporters, who had been all but immune to the job-related injuries that other
laborers have endured for centuries.
   Some of the rise in cases is widely attributed to increased
recognition of the problem and a new willingness to report it.
   Dr. Laura Punnett, an ergonomist and epidemiologist at the University of
Massachusetts at Lowell, said ``historically there's been lots of
underreporting'' of these disorders. As she explained, ``Many workers did not
recognize the problem as being job-related; others who did worried about losing
their jobs if they reported their injuries.''  ...
   A common experience of workers in America who report hand and wrist injuries
to their employers is to find themselves suspected of malingering.
   Employers' doubts are bolstered by the fact that victims of repetitive
stress injury take longer to recover and are less likely to return to work if
they have filed worker's compensation claims, according to a study of 28,000
workers conducted by Dr. Gary Franklin, a neurologist who serves as medical
director for Washington State's Department of Labor and Industries.
   Franklin also noted that the disabilities suffered by many workers were
``out of proportion'' to measurable abnormalities in their wrists, a widely
acknowledged finding that has prompted Nortin M. Hadler, a rheumatologist at
the University of North Carolina, to dispute whether the problem is real.
   Hadler maintains that musculoskeletal activity that is ``reasonable,
comfortable and customary and which can be repeated without undue distress,''
such as typing on a computer, is unlikely to result in tissue damage.
   Others, like Silverstein, report that although dissatisfied workers are
prone to exaggerate their injuries or discomforts, she found in studying
workers with problems at Newsday that the most devoted and talented reporters
typically suffered the most.
   ``These are high-production people who don't listen to their bodies,''
Silverstein said. ``They don't stop working when they start hurting. The same
with musicians. It is the high-performance people who are at highest risk of
musculoskeletal disorders. And one could hardly accuse musicians of seeking to
get paid without working, since they don't.''
   In a seven-industry study of factory workers, she also found no differences
in overall job satisfaction and in views about work in general among employees
afflicted with hand-wrist disorders and those who were not.
   Still, she and Franklin agreed that psychological and social factors can
make work-related muscular stress worse by increasing muscular tension.  ...
   Among the physical factors Dainoff lists as raising a worker's risk of
hand-wrist disorders are these:
    High rates of repetition of the same action. A computer operator who types
60 words a minute can make 18,000 keystrokes in an hour.
    Awkward or unnatural posture while working. The ideal position of the wrist
is flat and straight, which positions the hand level with the arm and extended
in a straight line from it. Those who work with hands bent up, down or to the
side risk damage to the tissues in the wrist.
    Use of excessive force while working. In Silverstein's factory study,
workers who had to use high force and a high rate of repetition had 29 times
the rate of hand-wrist disorders as workers using low force and a low rate of
repetition.
    Lack of adequate rest periods or recovery time. Experts estimate that hands
should be relieved of repetitive motion for at least 15 minutes every 2 hours
to reduce the risk of injury.
   ``Try telling that to a reporter writing against a deadline,'' Silverstein
remarked.
   People who work on computers, which do not require much force to
operate, may nonetheless fall victim to repetitive stress injuries.
   Dainoff explained that in many computer-reliant offices like newsrooms,
almost every activity is done with the keyboard, including writing, editing,
taking notes, searching for information and sending messages.  ...
   Some computer-based jobs are ``the sweatshops of the 90s,'' said Dr. John
Kella, a musician and biomechanic who directs a rehabilitation and retraining
program for injured workers at the Miller Institute in New York.
   He pointed out that computer keyboards are unforgiving and many operators
press the keys too hard, causing an almost imperceptible kickback as the
fingertips hit the keyboard's rock-hard bottom.  [In my own personal opinion,
keyboard feel has gone vastly downhill since the days of the IBM Selectric
typewriter.  --smb]
   His colleague, Pascarelli, likened it to dancers performing day after day on
a concrete floor. ``Eventually, they are going to get injured,'' he said.
   The injuries that he treats are often not ``classical'' syndromes with
readily identifiable pathological changes in structures of the hands and
wrists.
   Some, perhaps a quarter of those complaining of symptoms, have clear cases
of carpal tunnel syndrome.
   Some have tendinitis, an inflammation of the tendon that passes through the
wrist, and others have tenosynovitis, an inflammation of the sheath around the
tendon. But many fit no recognized classification.
   Dr. Lawrence Fine, an occupational medicine specialist for the National
Institute of Occupational Safety and Health in Cincinnati, said: ``Yet these
people are in a lot of pain and are forced to take time off from work. It's
hard for me as a physician to say it's all in people's heads, especially when
the frequency and severity of the disorders abates when the risk factors are
reduced.''
   Even when a rational remedy is applied, the workplace setting can sometimes
cause it to backfire.
   Silverstein gave on-the-job exercises to workers in a dental floss
manufacturing plant.
   A year into the program she found no improvement in the rate of repetitive
stress injuries because the workers, forced to meet production quotas, had
worked harder to make up for the time lost during their exercise sessions.

COMPUTER USERS' INJURIES ARE OFTEN PREVENTABLE
By JANE E. BRODY
c.1992 N.Y. Times News Service
...
   Researchers who have analyzed the conditions that seem to lead up to
hand-wrist problems and clinicians who treat them have identified factors both
within and outside the workplace that when properly adjusted can help prevent
hand-wrist injuries.
   Dr. Marvin J. Dainoff, director of the Center for Ergonomic Research and a
professor of psychology at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, insists that
physiologically sensible use of the computer starts with the user's chair.
   A well-designed chair not only helps protect your back but also reduces
strain on your shoulders, neck and arms and ultimately your hands.
   Most experts recommend a chair that allows you to adjust the height of the
seat and the tilt of the back and possibly also of the seat. An adjustable
table may also be necessary for people who are very tall or very short.
   You should be able to sit with your feet flat on the floor (or on a
footrest), your thighs at right angles to your torso, your arms and hands
parallel to the floor or perhaps slightly elevated, your head erect and your
eyes looking slightly down (about 15 degrees below the horizontal) to see the
screen.
   To minimize stress, the chair should support your lower back and should
swivel and roll on casters. To allow for relaxation of muscles and shifts in
working postures, the seat back should be able to tilt backward to an angle of
15 degrees or more from the vertical.
   The desirability of arm rests is a matter of debate. Some experts suggest
they can aggravate wrist problems and encourage poor posture if the arms are
rested on them while typing. Others laud their usefulness as a resting place
when not typing.
   Next comes the surface on which the computer keyboard rests.  When sitting
properly in your chair, you should be able to type with a flat wrist. Avoid
bending your wrist up or down or twisting it sideways when you type.
   If the keyboard is very wide or deep, learn to lift your hand to reach
outlying keys instead of trying to stretch your fingers to them, which distorts
your wrist position.
   While typing, avoid resting your wrists on the edge of the work surface; to
reduce pressure on the wrists, consider using a padded wrist and palm rest in
front of the keyboard. Keep fingernails trimmed; long nails force you to extend
your fingers to hit the keys.
   Try to avoid other potentially wrist-damaging activities when you are not
typing. Dainoff cautions against moves that bend the wrist, especially if force
is involved, like pushing a heavy door, opening jars, holding a telephone
handset at an angle or resting your head in your hand.
   Also think about home and recreational activities that might aggravate a
sore wrist, including excessive use of a kitchen knife, playing a musical
instrument with a distorted wrist, skating with the hand bent up at the wrist
or pushing a power mower.
   Use your whole hand (not just thumb and forefinger) and minimal force when
gripping, grasping or lifting an object.
   Take frequent brief rests while typing. Switch to another activity that uses
the hands differently. Do not use more force than necessary to hit the keys.
When taking notes or writing an original work, avoid holding your hands in a
tensed ``ready'' position when waiting to type.
   Do exercises that strengthen hand and arm muscles and improve circulation in
the upper extremities, like squeezing a handgripper and swimming. When typing,
try to rely more on the larger, stronger muscles of the arms and shoulders to
reduce strain on the wrists and hands.
   When detected and intercepted in their early stages, hand and wrist problems
are relatively easy to reverse. Experts caution against trying to work through
pain, since that will only make the injury worse and could result in
irreversible damage to the nerve that passes through the wrist into the hand.
   Therapy may involve analysis of your typing technique and retraining,
adjustments in your office furniture and keyboard, physical conditioning and
the use of wrist splints at night to prevent abnormal wrist positions during
sleep.
   Dr. Emil Pascarelli, director of ambulatory care at St.  Luke's-Roosevelt
Medical Center in New York, who established a hand clinic to treat injured
keyboard users, said that anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen, do not seem
to work well in treating work-related injuries to the wrists and hands.
   He also maintains that surgery, which has become a very popular remedy
nationwide, should be considered a treatment of last resort, when more
conservative measures seem unable to relieve the problem or when the nerve is
becoming scarred or is degenerating.

&gt;From: Michael Travers &lt;mt@media.mit.edu&gt;

Toronto, Canada:

Archbisop George Cram enjoys a banana once in a while, but he's not the kind of
primate that ape researchers had in mind.  The University of Wisconsin's
Regional Primate Research Center sent Cram, primate (senior archbishop) of the
Anglican Church of Canada, a questionnaire while preparing an international
directory of primatology.  The envelope was addressed to "George Cram, Primates
World Relief and Development Fund."

The Reverend Michael Ingham, secretary for the senior archbishop, suggested in
a letter of reply that "primates in your study are perhaps of a different
species.  While it is true that our primate occasionally enjoys bananas, I have
never seen him walk with his knuckles on the ground or scratch himself publicly
under the armpits," Ingham said.  "There are a mere 28 Anglican primates in the
whole world," he said.  "They are all males, of course, but so far we have had
no problems of reproduction."

The research center's director, John Hearn, promised to strike the church from
a computer database and added in a letter to Ingham; "In our zeal to develop a
comprehensive directory, we have strayed on this occasion from the arboreal to
the spiritual."

MEMO From: John Bartlett [WITH PERMISSION TO RISKS]

I'm sitting on an American flight to Dallas working on a presentation for 
tomorrow and I can't believe what I've just been told. A flight attendant  
came over and politely said that it was ok to use my portable (Compaq LTE) on 
the plane but that according to a new regulation, I would not be able to use 
my mouse (Microsoft ballpoint)!  I of course thought she was joking but 
apparently according to a new regulation only portables with a built-in 
mouse  are allowed. She actually showed me the regulation which specifically 
states that mice with umbilical cords can't be used because of interference 
with flight navigation systems.. This basically limits the use of mice to Mac 
Powerbooks and a few obscure portables. Using Freelance without a mouse is 
just about impossible.  I tried to argue that there wasn't any difference 
between a mouse connected with a cord and one that is internal. The flight 
attendant spoke to the captain in this instance let it go but all should be 
aware of this new American policy when flying.

Bargain Harold's, a local discount retail chain has just been petitioned into
receivership by its creditors.  160 stores across Canada will likely be closed.
There are several RISKS related reasons for this situation:

- new management spent $15M on store refurbishment and on a computerized
  point-of-sale system with centralized inventory management.  This was
  $7M more than was authorized by the companies creditors.

- the companies immediate financial difficulties are being blamed on 
  several factors including undetected errors in the new management
  information system.  Apparently this system was incorrectly predicting
  gross margin on sales and profits.  Based on this incorrect information
  management built up excessive inventories and were unable to reliablely 
  predict the company's annual profit.  A profit estimate of $500K on
  Oct 2 was changed the next day to a estimated loss of $3-4M.  The
  projected loss grew rapidly over the next few months (currently $20M).

Details on the reasons for the MIS system failure are not yet available.

I have not seen the Channel 4 TV program and cannot comment on the angle taken
in that presentation.  However, the impression I am getting from this forum is
that the only protection mechanism for Sizewell B is the 100,000 lines of code
software system, about which we could reasonably be concerned.

I would like to point out that I have been led to believe that a secondary
protection system exists that also has the capability of shutting down the
reactor and that this secondary system is a more traditional hardware based
system.  Further, I have been told that these two systems are independent.  So,
before we raise concerns over the safety of Sizewell B, can we have all the
facts relating to the protection mechanism and not just the worry over the
software?

I snagged this one from the alt.folklore.urban group, but it doesn't seem to be
a legend, but rather a risks illustration.  There are already lots of cars out
on the road, where the new owner has never bothered to file the change of
ownership (why you should always go with a buyer to re-register the car).  But
a junkyard?  How many states don't have any provision for the owner declaring
the car dead, but rely on a possibly unscrupulous junkyard to send in paperwork
(and/or plates)?  Having sold a junked car myself, once, I wondered about
whether the change of title would actually be sent in, or if there was a black
market for plates.  (My understanding of California law is that sending in the
"I've sold it" slip to the DMV does not actually modify the computer records on
the car.  That must be done by title change.  I have no idea what the procedure
may be in other states.)

Also, it brings up the issue of identity, when a car is "salvaged," and the
only witness who can establish an identity for the driver is a camera.  In a
manned pullover, the cop asks for a driver's license and checks it against the
registration, and if the owner isn't in the car, that person had better have a
good story.  There is no hope of catching a person who is operating a vehicle
illegally if the only enforcement is robotic.

      Ghost Car Speeding? Photocop Snaps Auto `Retired' 8 Months Ago
      By Stephen Hunt, The Salt Lake Tribune [last month sometime]

Susan Johnson laid to rest her 1984 Toyota Tercel eight months ago.  The car
had 200,000 miles on it.  When it quit running in June, she sold it to a
wrecking yard for $50.  She was sure she'd seen the last of it.  

But according to a traffic ticket Ms. Johnson received in the mail last week,
the car has been resurrected and is speeding about the streets of West Valley
City.  The ticket says Photcopy -- a computerized ticketing system that snaps
pictures of speeding carss -- caught the car traveling 47 miles per hour in a
35 mph zone on Jan. 10.

Since the car was not even running last time she saw it, Ms. Johnson is
wondering how it could be breaking speed laws.  "I was so surprised," she said.
She believes someone must be using her old license plates, which were left on
the car when she sold it.

According to Utah law, license plates are to be returned to the state Motor
Vehicle Division when a car is sold.  However, once the title has been signed
and delivered to the new owner, the previous owner is no longer liable,
according to the DMV.

Ms. Johnson was to appear today in West Valley City 5th Circuit Court to deal
with the ticket.  There, she will be allowed to see the photo and, she hopes,
prove her innocence.

Photocop uses radar, a computer and a camera to snap pictures of speeders that
show both the car's license plate and the driver.  "I hope it's not someone who
looks like me," Ms. Johnson said.

Photo radar has become a controversy at the Legislature.  Two bills regarding
the device are before lawmakers.  One would limit the use of photo-radar to
school zones only; another would ban it altogether.

Opponents say Photocop smacks of Big Brother.

Imagine That!

forgers.

One interesting item they mentioned in passing was that some new Dutch
banknotes have a barcoded serial number, supposedly as a means of detecting
forged notes, which would have a duplicated, or unused serial number. Whenever
a batch of notes gets back to the central bank all their serial numbers are
checked by computer.

The RISKS of this are pretty obvious. Cash will no longer allow anonymous
transactions. It would be a simple step for ATMs to make a record of the serial
numbers of all notes they issue to each customer.  It would also be simple and
'logical' for stores and supermarkets to use their bar code scanners to check
the serial numbers of notes they receive (in case of forgery).

The Police could also check the numbers of notes they confiscate in connection
with crimes. Then citizens would have to explain why a bank note they were
issued by an ATM at 08:31 on 1/2/99 was found on the person of a drug dealer at
11:20 on 1/2/99, while no stores have records of that note being spent in the
intervening hours: "If you did not spend the money at an authorized retail
outlet, what did you do with it, sir?"

Barcoded bank notes was a pretty obvious step, but it seems to me that the
unpleasant civil liberties consequences to us all far outweigh the benefits of
catching a few forgers.

Safeway stores in the Washington area (and perhaps other areas) recently
introduced a "Frequent Shoppers Club".  By filling out a form which includes
various demographic and financial information, you get discounts (typically
10%) on a few sale items each week (i.e., 10% below the price offered
non-members).  There's no cost to join the club.

Safeway is obviously trying to build a database of buying habits which can then
be resold to advertisers for targeted advertising.  Many people are up in arms
about "invasion of privacy".  Safeway has a program now where every time you
use your frequent shoppers card, you're automatically entered in a mini-lottery
(to encourage use of the card).

What strikes me as curious is that people don't seem to realize that the RISK
is already there.  With UPC scanners coupled with check cashing cards, there's
already the opportunity to gather and correlate the information for a large
fraction of the population.  Are there any laws which prevent the grocery store
from selling that information?  The check cashing application forms don't
preclude the store from doing whatever it wants with the non-financial
information.  Are there any instances of stores which actually do the
correlation and resell the information?

I'm also curious what reactions have been to these sorts of programs in other
parts of the country/world.

The obvious solution to the DX-7 dilemma is to sample the patches used in the
performance using a sampling synthesizer.  Of course, something is lost in the
process (especially if the timbre is modified dynamically).  You could always
sample the entire performance, of course, but then you may as well just roll a
tape.

The band Pere Ubu seems to have left its old Moog synth (knobs and patch
cords and all) behind on the last tour, but not before sampling it into
a slightly more modern synth.

The 6-Mar-1992 San Jose Mercury News has an article about this on page 5A. The
article is titled: "White House wants consumers to pay bill for better
wiretaps."  According to the article, the Justice Dept. is worried that "the
widespread use of digital transmission, fiber optics and other technologies"
make it difficult for government agencies to intercept transmissions.  The
Justice Dept.  is proposing a bill which would direct the FCC to "devise rules
to give law enforcement agencies access to conversations for court ordered
wiretapping."  Phone companies would then be required to follow the rules.  The
bill would also authorize the FCC to permit the phone companies to increase
rates to cover the cost of implementing the rules.

The proposal has been discussed with Sen. Ernest Hollings, chair of the Senate
Commerce Committee which oversees the FCC.

I've had a few second-order thoughts about the matter.  

0) The Justice department seems to want to ensure that there is some place in
the system where the signal can be easily turned into sound.  It does not seem
to prohibit individual people from encrypting their messages.  It just means
that the phone company needs to provide a tap.

1) Centralized phone tapping doesn't necessarily mean less privacy.  I can
imagine a huge bureaucracy at the local phone companies' tap center filled with
mean clerks who would demand to see the proper forms authorizing the taps.
"No, I'm sorry Officer. You didn't submit 44/22-G that authorizes the recording
of conversations from another state that are forwarded to a third state by a
central routing office without being delivered to the phone in your
juristiction.  A 44/22-F authorizes only cross-county juristiction expansion."

Now each police department probably has its own set of mikes and tape recorders
and can place them as it wishes.

2) I don't necessarily believe that the above will happen.

Recently introduced legislation may be of interest to RISKS readers.  S. 2198,
the Intelligence Reorganization Act of 1992 and HR 4165, the National Security
Act of 1992, essentially give responsibility for all comsec to the National
Security Agency and for all information security to them also.  This, of
course, would completely reverse, existing structure which has just been in
place for a couple of years, and apparently take much responsibility away from
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the Dept. of
Commerce and put it (back) at NSA in the Defense Dept.

If enacted, this would have important implications for export control and
crypto policy, which are of interest to many RISKS readers.

I spent the day today clearing many viruses.  In the last week xxxx and I have
cleared over 80 Michelangelos from ....  Also, we have cleared many Cascades,
New Zealands, Joshis, and others.  Easily over 120 infections in the last week.

You may have heard that just changing the date is an adequate defense; it is
not.  You may have heard that not using the computer that day is a defense; it
is not.  You may have learned many things; almost all of them untrue.  All
anyone needs to know is that Michelangelo is a very widespread virus.  It is
destructive.  It can be removed only by using proper procedures.  It is
completely manageable and removable.

Procedures:

Detect the virus (Use any commercial or other package that is up to date)
Cold Clean Boot (Turn off PC, insert DOS Startup notchless diskette, 
  turn on PC)
Copy first track into memory
Copy partition table from virus (sector 1) into partition table of original 
  (sector 7) in memory
Copy original over virus in memory
Zero the copy of the original in memory
Write the result back to the first track.

As you can see, nothing magic, just plain old careful procedure.

Anyone who leaves a diskette in their boot drive by accident when they boot 
should have their wrist slapped.

In <A HREF="/Risks/13.21.html">RISKS-13.21</A>, jcav@midway.uchicago.edu writes about his local news
station omitting to mention that the Michelangelo virus only affects
MS-DOS machines.  I submit that this really isn't much of a problem, for
the following reasons:

   1. MS-DOS users are actually affected by the virus, so in their case,
the report was correct and useful.

   2. Macintosh users have such a frightening virus problem already that
there are very few left who don't routinely disinfect their machines.

   3. Everyone else is either sophisticated enough to understand the
situation, or has a MIS department to call and get straightened out by.


A more serious problem is the entire area of media handling of
Michelangelo.  Why is this particular virus getting almost
saturation-level coverage in the media?  Is Michelangelo really any
worse than Stoned, 1701, Jerusalem-B, or any of the other MS-DOS
viruses that have been circulating lately?

Even worse, will people assume that once they have scanned their disks
for Michelangelo, that the threat is over?  After all, the fuss has
quieted down.  Why should it be necessary to do it again?

Brian Randell describes how the Alpha uses imprecise arithmetic traps, and
speculates that it's a risk to program correctness.  With all due respect, I
disagree.  Based on my experience with imprecise interrupts on the 360/91, lo
these many years ago, I would classify imprecise interrupts as more of a hassle
when localizing faults, rather than any risk to the program's correct behavior.
That is, the interrupts -- which typically signified erroneous program behavior
-- still happened, and still caused the program to abort.  But it took rather
more debugging effort to figure out which instruction caused the trap.  Unless
one is relying the interrupt handler to perform the appropriate fix-up -- a
technique that I regard as far more risky and non-portable than imprecise
interrupts -- correct programs should not behave any differently.

He also describes the barrier instruction as a ``sop to DEC's technical
conscience''.  Not so.  Its purpose is to help the programmer identify the
offending instruction.  And compilers can (and were able to) generate such
instructions on appropriate boundaries.  I recall vividly, 20+ years later,
finding that a zero- divide fault took place 11 instructions after the
offending divide, and after the divisor register had been overwritten with a
non-zero value.  But it had to be that instruction; there were only two divide
instructions in the entire program, and the other referenced a still-intact
constant.

If there is a danger here, it's from the hardware design itself.  Pipelined
architectures imply parallelism, of course, and that's harder to get right.
But the hardware designers seem to do a better job which such things than do
the software designers...

In <A HREF="/Risks/13.25.html">RISKS-13.25</A> (Thursday 5 March 1992) Brian Randell writes about the new Alpha
RISC architecture and comments on its imprecise arithmetic traps.

Those of us who ever programmed the IBM System/360 Model 91 under OS/MVT (or,
I'd imagine, other OSes) will recall that it, too, had imprecise interrupts, in
large part because it provided (limited) pipelining and multiple issue of
arithmetic instructions.  I don't recall the details -- it has been a long time
-- but as I recall it could overlap integer and floating point compute
operations, and perhaps did multiple floating multiplies in parallel.  In any
case, the careless programmer could easily get the dreaded 0C5 ABEND, along
with a generally useless dump, when one of the parallel operations failed.

IBM, in their infinite wisdom, did not provide a Trapb instruction to allow the
programmer to force precise interrupts -- at least, I don't recall any such
instruction.  Instead, if you couldn't guess what was wrong by looking at the
code, you could carry it to a different System/360 model (like the Model 75)
that didn't provide the parallelism and get a precise interrupt.

What's neat about the Alpha design is, of course, that you can get precise
traps when you need or want them, at some performance penalty, but you can go
blazingly fast when you don't need that precision.  Compared to other ways of
addressing the problems implied by a pipelined multi-issue architecture, the
Alpha approach seems rather clean and clever to me.  But then, I may be biased,
and I'm not an experienced computer architect.

In <A HREF="/Risks/13.25.html">RISKS-13.25</A> (so-called), Brian.Randell@newcastle.ac.uk seems alarmed at the
notion of imprecise delivery of instruction exceptions.  I was similarly
alarmed when I first heard of them ...  twenty-plus years ago, with the IBM
System/360 model 91.  (I'm not claiming the 91 was the first such
implementation, simply that is was the first in my personal experience.)

It is only sometimes useful to identify "the" instruction which blew
up; usually a coarser localization will do.  The imprecise-exception
architectures I know of all provide an instruction which acts as a
barrier, with the promise that no exception delivered after the
barrier can be due to any instruction fetched before the barrier.  The
360-91 used "BR 0,0": a "no-op" in the form of a pipeline-draining
conditional branch.  Compilers inserted this instruction at strategic
locations like subroutine prologues and epilogues, or (if requested)
between segments of code generated for different source statements.

Imprecise exceptions make it difficult to write trap handlers which
fix up the results of failing instructions.  I have written such
handlers, but have never found them satisfactory -- the "correct" fix
is too context-dependent to be dealt with by such a low-level
approach.  Error detection and correction work much better in the
higher levels, and imprecise instructions don't make the superior
approach impossible or even difficult.

To all who sent in reports, many thanks.  A brief report on today (and
recent past) sightings:
 
New Zealand - our two best contacts evidently did their job well, and
had clean shops.  Other areas reported a "detection rate" (in advance of the
deadline) of 10% in some areas.
 
Japan - MITI had stated earlier in the week that Japan would not be
hit as it didn't use MS-DOS much.  MITI, and seven other companies, reported
hits today.  (MITI only reported one.)
 
China - announced hits in spite of official claims of "about 10"
reported occurrences.
 
Poland - earlier in the week was reporting detection rates of as high
as 25%
 
Germany - reported heavily hit by CBC, conspicuous by the absence of
reports from Vesselin.  Too busy?  :-)
 
South Africa - reported by CBC to have had 1300 hits.
 
US - New Jersey Institute of Technology reported to have cleaned 2400
of 3000 computers earlier this week (est. cost = $60,000, mine)
   - largest oil company in Houston, and 200 small to mid sized
businesses (est. cost for recovery of computers, assuming backup, $2M, mine)
   - eastern university reporting a couple of hits
 
Canada - major metal supplier "tested" for the virus by playing "Michelangelo 
roulette" (setting date ahead to Mar. 6) late last night, lost that machine
and cleaned up the rest.  Two Baptist churches reported hit in the Vancouver
area.  Local school board found a copy on one machine, tested on old machine,
did not trigger, figured Mikey was a hoax.  (Any bets the test machine was a
really old XT?  Wonder if they got hit and are now lying low.)  UofA reports
one hit (good work, Tim), NRC reports four disks cleaned.
 
In other news:
 
McAfee is quoted as saying clocks on machines that triggered on Thursday (a
fair number of reports of that) were set ahead by "accident".  No one is 
reporting the significance of the leap year.
 
A number of reports of users playing Michelangelo roulette, including one that
lost a full 170M hard disk (170 "shelf feet" of printout, gone).  Another found
the virus, tried to disassemble it with DEBUG, and triggered it.
 
A number of reports of CLEAN and the NAV Special Edition "damaging" disks and
partitions.  No report of the fact that NAV Special does not check for any
other virus.  (CPAVSE checks for some "Friday the 13th" families, at least.)
 
Very few reports of the upcoming Thursday the 12th, Friday the 13th, Saturday
the 14th, Maltese Amoeba next week.
 
Story of the year:
 
One user supplied a copy of a detection program to his sister, who found the
virus at the radio station where she worked (in Quebec).  He called the
corresponding station nearby, and offered to scan their computers.  They turned
him down, stating they were sure they did not have the virus.
 
This morning, they powered up and lost the hard drive.
 
 
Sorry for typos and terse style, trying to keep up and get reports out at the
same time.

... I suspect that we will detect and eliminate far more copies of other
viruses than of Michelangelo.

The sense of urgency generated by Michelangelo's trigger date (I received calls
right up to midnight on the 5th) has resulted in the purchase, use, and, I
hope, permanent installation of a great deal of anti-virus software.  How many
more copies might we have eliminated if our advice had focused on infected
diskettes as much as it did on infected machines.

Unfortunately, we have not stamped out viruses.  We will have such an
opportunity again.  I suggest that the next time we have the public's
attention, we focus on diskettes.  It is diskettes that hold the majority of
the copies of viruses and it is on dikettes that they are most persistent.

Later in his posting, Joe Abernathy asks for reports of Michelangelo.  I expect
those to be sparse.  (Joe, add Hoyt Limousine of New Canaan to your list (I got
that report as a customer, not as a consultant)).  I think that the estimates
of the number of copies that Michelangelo achieved in a year were generally
exaggerated, and the purge more effective than I would have hoped.  I do not
begrudge the bold and brave entrepreneurs that gave us the software their
sales.  I think that the press coverage was at least partially motivated by a
spirit of public service.  But by any count, the security costs of Michelangelo
will be much higher than the cleanup, and mammoth by any measure.

	As the hype surrounding the MichelAngelo virus reached a peak, Norton
released a 'special' version of its virus utility (free of charge) to the
public. This special version was limited to check and remove the MichelAngelo
virus. Unfortunatly for myself and many others who received this software, it
turns out to be more dangerous than the virus. If you use the norton utility to
remove the virus from a harddrive with more than 1 partition, you may very well
lose all but the first partition. I believe this may have something to do with
using alternate filing systems. We lost 3 40 meg partions(d:,e:,f:). I have
heard as many reports of people losing partitions due to Norton as to
MichelAngelo. Beware of the undocumented 'features' of the Norton virus utility
:(

| Even worse, will people assume that once they have scanned their disks

| quieted down.  Why should it be necessary to do it again?

Worse, the media blitz left out information that caused companies to lose time
due to unnecessary fear of the virus.  One of our customers refused to bring
up his computer on Friday out of fear of the virus; he knew enough to know it
was an Intel 386-based computer, therefore it "must" be vulnerable.

The computer in question was an Altos Computer Systems, Inc. 386/2000.  It
is completely incompatible with MS-DOS and does not possess a BIOS --- it has
a bootstrap loader/monitor and self-test facility in ROM, and nothing else.
If someone were to attempt to boot an MS-DOS diskette in it, it would read
track 0, not find the information required by the 386/2000, and reject the
boot attempt without executing any code off the floppy.  And even if someone
managed to fake a 386/2000 signature, the first attempted BIOS call would
cause an immediate dump into the monitor with an undefined interrupt.  And an
attempt to access the disk controller directly would find nothing whatsoever,
as the disk controller is accessed entirely differently.  For all that it's
the right processor, the Micheelangelo virus ad as good a chance of infecting
a Macintosh as it did this system.

Other customers on 386-based Series 1000 and 2000 machines were also worried,
although none took it to quite the lengths that that one customer did (a phone
call was sufficient to reassure the others, although some of them waited until
noon to call).  I didn't hear about any calls from users of Altos 8086 or
80286 machines, which are also incompatible.

So how many other companies needlessly lost the use of their computers?  The
RISKs of a computer virus are not limited to the systems it infects.

   2. Macintosh users have such a frightening virus problem already that
   there are very few left who don't routinely disinfect their machines.

I can't imagine where you got this idea. While perhaps 1000 or more viruses
affect DOS, there are exactly 10 known viruses affecting Macs (plus one that
affects only Ataris in Mac emulation mode), No known Mac viruses are explicitly
malicious like Michelangelo.  While new DOS virus strains appear at a rate of
several per week, the last new Mac virus appeared after a hiatus of almost two
years.

To say that Mac users have a "frightening virus problem" is utterly
irresponsible. The popular press, in giving the impression that all computers
are susceptible to DOS viruses, is not much better.  Perhaps Macintosh users do
take better care of their machines, but I imagine it's because it's easier to
do so.

This is in response to John Bartlett's post concerning mice employed on a Lap
Top during a flight.  John is mistaken in saying that there is no difference
between an internal mouse and one connected via cord.

Depending on whether the cord is shielded properly and how the connection
is made to the PC the unit can act just like an external antenna for all
the RF noise that the computer is capable of generating.  The computers
themselves have probably been qualified with specific I/O devices to 
comply with FCC class B standards concerning RF radiation.  Further, 
American probably has determined that flight instrumentation can safely handle
that level.  It has also probably been determined that some mice on 
some systems do indeed result in radiation from the unit above Class B
levels that could be harmful thus the flat-out ban.  They don't do
it by manufacturer type(to hard to enforce).

Does anyone know if this is an FAA ban or an American Airlines Policy?

Would God that there were no difference.  (I will keep my mouse concealed.)  Of
course, there is: the mouse cord may act as an antenna, effectively

    John Bartlett is mistaken if he thinks that "there wasn't any difference
between a mouse connected with a cord and one that is internal."  Mouse cords
do something besides pass signals along: they RADIATE electromagnetic energy at
the frequency of the microprocessor clock which, being essentially a square
wave, can include powerful harmonics well into the UHF bands.  This is still a
concern even if the mouse cable is shielded because the laptop's ground is not
common with the airplane's.
    As an apprehensive passenger, I'm pleased that American identified
this hazard before it caused damage.
    Fortunately my old Toshiba doesn't have a mouse.

   Alpha arithmetic traps (overflow, underflow, etc.) are imprecise...

Nothing new here.  This is standard practice in high-performance computer
designs, going back as far as the IBM 360/91 of the early 1970s.  It's not a
RISK because any trap is guaranteed to happen before the first use is made of
the result of the arithmetic operation.  (In this case, that means the first
use of the register that was the destination of the instruction in question.)

The only practical difference between imprecise and precise exception is that
you can't report the PC of the offending instruction when imprecise.

&gt;Alpha arithmetic traps (overflow, underflow, etc.) are imprecise -- they can
&gt;be delivered an arbitrary number of instructions [late]

Imprecise interrupts have been around for a long time.  I wrestled with them on
a 360/91 in about 1970.  The /91 could execute instructions out of order if
there weren't interferences among them, but didn't keep enough state to
unscramble the mess if one of them failed.  There were barrier instructions but
they slowed the machine down so much that they were almost never used except at
statement boundaries in some debugging compilers.

In practice when you got an imprecise interrupt, your job aborted with a code
of S0C0, pronounced "Socko!"  You could catch the interrupt, but it was so hard
to arrange to repair an overflow (even if you used barriers, the interrupt
would usually give you the address of the barrier instruction, not the one that
failed) that nobody did.  Instead, they inserted tests and prescaling to make
sure that interrupts would not occur.  I opine that if anything, imprecise
interrupts encourage more correct software since you know that you can't
recover from errors.

Actually, the 360-91 used 'BCR mask,0'
where the 4-bit value in "mask" **had** to be non-zero to drain the pipeline.
                                              ^^^^^^^^
If requested, IBM's PL/I compiler inserted 'BCR 15,0' as the first instruction
generated for each PL/I statement, thus limiting any imprecise interrupt
to a single PL/I statement.

Andrew Tannenbaum posted a message about the risks of using a computer to
generate tones which would help a person to spell twenty (20) words correctly
in two (2) minutes.  I have a friend who utilized his Sharp Wizard hand-held
computer/calendar/etc.. to win at various sports trivia lines.  He used this
technique to win a substantial prize from one of these trivia lines which then
ended up in litigation.  One of the points brought up by the lawyers for the
1-900 operator was (erroneously) that he had done exactly what Andrew discussed
-- using a computer connected to the phone to generate the tones of the correct
response.  The lawyers contended that such a technique removed some of the
element of skill from the contest and invalidated the prize.

It becomes interesting to me when you attempt to discern where the utility of
either a electronic or paper resource ends (supposedly at least a paper
reference of sports trivia in the case above is allowed) and the use of
automation for "beating the system" begins.  If on-line repositories of
information are used to augment a persons ability to perform some task, then is
the "skill" of the person performing the task any less?

&gt;One must remember that COINCIDENCES DO HAPPEN.  ...

I believe that this is fuzzy thinking. Airplane crashes in general are the
result of multiple failures; only if _everything_ goes wrong do you lose a
plane. Thus you can argue that any single crash samples a large number of
things going wrong. To wit, when the first DC-10 crashed with a dropped engine,
airworthiness inspectors found potentially lethal cracks in the engine mounting
of something like 70 other aircraft.  In two cases no one could quite figure
out why the engine hadn't fallen off already.  (And note, btw, that if not for
a) the pilot being untrained in this particular kind of disaster and b) the
design flaw of misrouted hydraulic lines, dropping an engine wouldn't have been
a big deal.)

Air crashes are the tail of a wide distribution in failures, nonetheless when
you start getting _any_ numbers up in that tail, it should lead you to worry a
great deal about where the median may be drifting. This raises an interesting
point for designers of both hardware and software: when you get into
very-high-reliability systems, how many of the failures are due to problems
whose rates have been specified and characterized, and how many are do to
completely unanticipated, unanalyzed features of the design?

My sister also encountered a variation on this problem.  While a grad student,
she lived in a house with several other students.  As is common for students,
the residents of this house move very frequently.  When she moved away from
this place herself, NONE of her mail was correctly forwarded.  When whe
enquired about this, she found that a former resident of the house had a
similar last name (Griffin as compared to Griffitts), and that there was a
forwarding notice still in effect for this other unknown person.

The post office's hashing function was completely unable to
distinguish between the two forwarding orders.  When my sister finally
managed to get her own forwarding implemented, she began receiving Ms.
Griffin's mail.

She was repeatedly told by post office employees that this problem was
absolutely unfixable within their procedures.

This is so absurd I should consider submitting it to rec.humor.funny.  My guess
is a lot of companies put plugs on anyway and the law finally caught up - I
just can't imagine it any other way.

         The British Plug In (San Jose Mercury News, 2 Feb 1992)

  Britain has just announced that makers of electrical appliances in that
country must begin to attaching plugs to the ends of electrical cords.
  Britons, for we don't know how long, have been required to buy plugs and
attach them to their new toasters, irons and electrical what have yous.
  But now the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, citing its
research into the matter, says it was surprised to learn that "it is common
practice everywhere else in the world to sell electrical goods with a plug
attached."
                            [And now, a plug for the Royal Society...  PGN]

One of the San Diego off-airport parking outfits gave me a "time in" ticket
dated February 30 (you can guess the real date).  When I returned to retrieve
my car on March 6th, I was presented with a demand for $3771.00 (at $11/day,
$1/hour), to be paid before I was allowed to leave the lot.  The garage
attendant decided that this wasn't quite right, reentered the date into his
"computer", and was again told that I was to pay $3771.00.  At this point the
manager was called for help (the exit line was getting quite long).

I have a receipt here for $3771.00 for "parking".  The travel accounting people
are going to have fun with this one... :-)

The item below is reprinted in its entirety, from today's Independent, a UK
national newspaper. I do not recall any previous reports in RISKS of similar
cases of in-house "high-tech" cash dispenser robbery - but I must admit I have
not followed the stream of cash dispenser stories closely.

ROBBER 'FOILED BANK SYSTEM'

An electronics expert stole more than (pounds) 17,000 in a high-tech
robbery spree, plundering dozens of accounts from automatic cash dispensers
at banks, Paisley [Scotland] Sheriff Court was told yesterday.

Clydesdale Bank chiefs claimed their dispensing system was foolproof and told
angry customers that members of their own households must have been responsible
for making withdrawals without their knowledge.

Anthony Pratt, 32, a bank engineer, used a hand-held computer inside bank
premises to record transactions being made by customers at "hole-in-the-wall"
machines outside.  He recorded the customer's secret number and later used it
on plastic cards he made with magnetic strips.  Pratt, of East Kilbride, was
finally arrested after he took cash from a machine in Glasgow.  He admitted
conspiracy to rob and robbery. Sentence was deferred for reports until 2 April.

On reading the Proceedings of the X-15 First Flight 30th Anniversary
Celebration (NASA CP-3105, Jan 1991), I ran across a section of some relevance
to Risks.  Insertions in [] are mine.

	In 1962, a very comprehensive, but little known, study was
	initiated by Bob Nagle at AFFTC to quantify the benefits of
	having a pilot and redundant-emergency systems [this seems to
	be essentially a buzzword for "redundant systems"] on a research
	vehicle.  Each individual malfunction or abnormal event that
	occurred after B-52 [X-15 launch aircraft] takeoff for the
	first 47 free flights of the X-15 was analyzed.  The outcome
	of each event was forecast for three hypothetical models;
	one with only the pilot but no redundant-emergency systems,
	one with only the redundant-emergency systems but with no pilot,
	and one with neither the pilot nor redundant-emergency systems
	(i.e. single-string [buzzword for no redundancy], unmanned).

	[The bar chart of results shows an expected failure rate of over
	50% for the "neither" configuration, with many of the failures
	destroying aircraft.  Adding just a pilot or just redundant systems
	produces only small improvements.  Adding both takes the failure
	rate down to near zero and eliminates aircraft losses.]

	[Referring to the graph.]  The unmanned, single-string system
	would have had 11 additional aborts and resulted in the loss of
	15 X-15s.  [The actual program built only three!]  Not surprising
	is the fact that the pilot is of little value in a system
	without redundant-emergency systems.  He must have some alternate
	course available in order to be effective.  The redundant-emergency
	systems were also found to be of little value in an unmanned
	system primarily because the fault detection and switchover logic
	must presuppose the type of failure or event.  For example, few
	designers would have built in a capability to handle an
	inadvertent nose gear extension at Mach 4.5.

	[That last refers to something that actually happened to an X-15.
	Landing gear is normally designed to be extended at a maximum
	of a few hundred MPH.  Having gear extend at 3000+ MPH is a
	horrifying prospect, but the X-15 was landed safely with minor
	damage to the aircraft and the pilot unhurt.]

	Of more than academic interest was a parallel, but independent,
	study conducted by Boeing on the first 60 flights of their
	BOMARC missile, an unmanned, single-string, ramjet-powered
	interceptor.  The authors collaborated on the ground rules for
	the study but not on the actual analysis.  The similarity of
	the results [a virtually identical bar chart] is striking,
	especially when considering that the X-15 study was projecting
	from a piloted, redundant design to an unpiloted, nonredundant
	design, and the BOMARC study was the reverse...

entirety, except for the umlaut over the "a" in "Branneby", without permission.

COMPUTER SYSTEMS DEVELOPED FOR AIRCRAFT ARE BEING ADAPTED FOR USE ON THE ROAD.

Susan Watts reports

CAR FIRM FORGES AHEAD WITH DRIVE-BY-WIRE PROTOTYPE

SAAB, the Swedish car maker, seems untouched by recent controversy over
fly-by-wire aircraft, and is pressing ahead with plans for a drive-by-wire car.
Fly-by-wire aircraft rely on software controls to a far greater extent than
conventional aircraft. Three fatal crashes of the A320 aircraft have raised
fears over the safety of such systems, and how easy they are to fly.

Saab's parent, the Saab Scania Group, has experience of computer-controlled
transport, having built the Grippen fly-by-wire fighter aircraft. Its
automotive engineers have produced a prototype computer-controlled car. The
Independent took a brief test drive yesterday.  The car felt very smooth to
drive, and remarkably easy to handle, although we did only a few miles an hour.

Saab concedes that safety fears could be one of the biggest obstacles to
selling such a radical change in car design. But it predicts that by the time
the car is in production people will be more confident about
computer-controlled transport.

There is no steering wheel, but a joystick to one side of the driver. There is
no mechanical link between the joystick and the wheels a computer intervenes to
control and optimise the hydraulic steering.  The car has a back-up control
system that performs the same basic tasks as the computer, but uses traditional
electronics. This is ready to switch into action if any part of the computer
fails, or the driver hits an emergency "stop" button.  To steer, the driver
turns the joystick from side to side, and the computer translates this into
wheel movement. The car senses the driver's movements on the joystick,
translates these into the optimum wheel angles and feeds back information to
the driver by altering the response felt through the joystick. At low speeds,
for manoeuvres such as parking, a small movement of the joystick produces a
large change in direction of the wheels. At higher speeds this relationship
changes, so a larger movement of the joystick is needed to shift the wheels.

The prototype has a computer keyboard and flat-screen display in the passenger
seat, so the driver can modify the software to change the "feel" of the
joystick. Per Branneby, the Saab test engineer who heads the steer-by-wire
project, said: "I can make it feel like a go-kart or an American limousine."

The idea is that driving without a steering wheel is physically safer, because
you can fit an airbag where the steering wheel would be and avoid the crushing
injuries often sustained by drivers in accidents.

It should also be safer because the computer and hydraulics in between the
wheels and the joystick filter out "noise" from the road that would normally
make the steering wheel shake and judder such as stones in the road or gusty
winds.

Mr Branneby said drivers get most of the information they need to steer the car
by monitoring sideways forces on their seat. In the Saab car, the computer is
fed data from sensors that tell it about these forces, as well as the car's
speed and acceleration.  The car does not sense the environment it is in, so
cannot respond automatically and change its steering to deal with a bumpy or
icy road, or a skid. This is the next stage in Saab's research.

The two-litre Saab 9000 Turbo used to test the active steering has automatic
gears and anti-lock brakes and a conventional accelerator, although Mr Branneby
said these may eventually be linked to the central computer. He does not
envisage production models of cars using steer-by-wire joysticks until 2010 or
2015, although a version with active steering applied to a conventional
steering wheel may come sooner. He also said a production model would probably
have two joysticks one for each arm so the driver can swap the arm in control.

Subject: Corporate Strategies for Information Protection, Ethics and Privacy

As the Conference Program Director, I would like to invite readers of RISKS to
attend an important upcoming executive briefing entitled  

        AVOIDING MANAGERIAL LIABILITY: DEVELOPING CORPORATE STRATEGIES FOR      
        INFORMATION PROTECTION, ETHICS AND PRIVACY

        Sunday evening, April 26 and all day Monday, April 27, 1992 at Bentley  
        College, Waltham, Mass.           

        Sponsored by the Center for Business Ethics at Bentley College 
        

Managers are on the hotseat.  They are increasingly being given responsibilities
for information protection, ethics and privacy issues.  The emphasis of this
briefing will be on how managers can best respond to these challenges.  

Technological developments are intensifying protection, ethics and privacy as
business problems.  The Federal Sentencing Guidelines and other legal decisions
are defining senior managers as directly responsible for developing corporate
conduct rules and programs to deter organizational and employee wrongdoing.  The
media and public opinion are more clearly defining appropriate and inappropriate
activities.  

Managers need assistance to understand these complex issues and to select
appropriate business policy choices.  Those attending this briefing will:

        Evaluate information protection, ethics and privacy issues in           
        managerial/business terms;

        Hear successful policy choices, options and tradeoffs;

        Learn how to respond appropriately to these issues;

        Have an opportunity to network with peers from around the nationa who   
        are facing similar decisions.

John Poduska, a respected figure in the computer field, will give the keynote
address on Sunday evening.  On Monday, there will be overview presentations on
technology, law, and ethics strategies.  Joe Murphy, co-editor of Corporate
Conduct Quarterly, will give a luncheon speech on the Federal Sentencing
Guidelines.  Small interactive discussion groups will be formed to evaluate
scenario and to discuss specific strategies.  The day will end with general
sessions and idea exchanges.

The fee for this exciting day-and-a-half conference will be $300.  That includes
the program, a reception, all meals and informative briefing materials.

For further information, contact the Center for Business Ethics, Bentley
College, 175 Forest Street, Waltham, MA 02154-4705, (617) 891-2981.  Specific
questions can also be sent to me by E-mail at MCI Mail 396-5782.

The backlog is excessive, I was overly busy, and our computer systems suffered
several outages at times that might otherwise have permitted me to put out
another issue.  Sorry for the delay.  However, the backlog is mostly second-
and third-order stuff, which may or may not get included in the future,
depending.  During the previous week I think I was too permissive, so I am
likely to swing back the other way for a while.  Thanks for your patience.  PGN

[John Bartlett tells of his encounter with a flight attendant over the
regulations restricting the use of external mice (mouses?)]

Just 2 weeks ago I attended the RFI emission testing of our one of our
X terminals and where did the major emission come from?  If you guessed the
mouse then you're right.

A major source of emissions from equipment in the VHF band is the
cables.  They act as antennas, radiating whatever noise is on the circuits
that connect to them.  Mouse cables are often the worst offender since they
are rarely shielded.

So there is a very definite technological basis for this regulation but
perhaps the problem could be covered better.  I would prefer to see the
regulation require that the mouse have FCC class B or CISPR 22 class B
approval if this reduces the RFI levels to suitable levels.  If this does
not remove the problem then a new more stringent standard needs to be
developed.

But if a lower level of RFI is required, then why don't the laptops
themselves interfere with navigation instruments ? It is risky in the least
to assume that removing the mouse will turn an FCC class B laptop into a
significantly quieter device.

(By the way, leaving the mouse plugged in will most likely still radiate 
regardless of whether it is used or not.)

But there very well may be [a difference]. I have seen cases in which
*significant* interference was radiated from an external mouse cable [into a
nearly audio input, as it happened]. All it takes is the airline running into
one such case, and they will tend to ban the entire class of device. Such is
the reasoning which [correctly, in my view] led to the banning quite a few
years ago of "pin printers" on airplanes. When I would ask if I could use my
portable computer [back then it was required that you ask], the answer was
always, "Yes, but not if it has a printer on it." Seems the output drivers for
the pins radiated a lot. These days, the boogyman de jure may be external mice.
I don't doubt that they've seen at least one such case...

There is a potentially big difference.  The wire leading to the mouse could
make a wonderful transmitting antenna through which the RF soup in your
shielded computer might leak out.  Remember that it is only by the airline's
good graces that you're allowed to use the computer at all.  Electronic devices
such as computers, radios and TV's are all potential sources of RF interference.
Only radios and TVs are typically banned because of the specific way in which
they interfere with VOR recievers.  My guess is that American has traced
some interference to the use of a mouse.  Other airlines can't be far behind.

Let's find ways to cooperate before the NTSB has to put the use of a mouse as a
probable cause for an accident.  I'd rather know that the aircraft's navigation
equipment is working without interference than use a mouse.  But then I *am*
typing this on a PowerBook.

To all of you pointing out that a mouse cord can act as an antenna.  Yes, I
know it is possible, but was just passing on another's comment and didn't want
to confuse the issue by adding my own editorial commentary.

While I realize that air safety is a crucial issue, the airlines should have 
some of the burden of establishing a rational policy .  If there is a 
significant danger from mouse cords, then they should explain and 
substantiate it.  Otherwise, I'll confine all my flying to red-eyes since 
I'll have to treat airplanes as being good only for sleeping.  If I'm awake, 
who knows what damage I'd do.

On a slightly more serious note, are the electronics in airplane's all that 
fragile?  Is a laptop computer really worse than a thunderstorm?  Are 
camcorders allowed?  Handheld LCD games?  Flashbulbs?  As our electronics 
become more mobile, the airlines have an opportunity to be compete the for 
the best environment.  Some will provide travellers with better ways to work 
while travelling while others will offer an electronics-free environment for 
relaxation.  Of course, the nonE flights would mean you can't even write a 
letter home without learning how to write with a pen (remember those?)

The lead item in this week's Talk of the Town (New Yorker, 16 Mar 1992,
pp.31-32) is a letter reporting on NASA's plan to abandon the Magellan
spacecraft (which is scientifically an enormous success and which is continuing
to produce remarkable results, far beyond original expectations), in order to
save a few million dollars.  The letter makes a very compelling case for the
incremental benefits of keeping the mission going, and concludes thusly:

  Given the cost of building Magellan and getting it to Venus -- about half
  a billion dollars -- most of the NASA scientists think that to turn it off
  prematurely is penny-wise and pound-foolish.  It is the loss of a kingdom --
  more than that, of a planet -- for want of a nail.

E-470 hits new detour
(Mary George, Denver Post Environment Writer, Denver Post, 13 Mar 1992, Page 2B

The E-470 Public Highway Authority clocked another delay in its race to the new
Denver Airport yesterday when the company that wants to finish the $1 billion
tollway revealed it's having computer troubles.

A computer model, which seeks to forecast traffic and toll revenues, isn't yet
accurate enough to satisfy state transportation officials considering a $100
million loan for the highway, or financiers who would help bankroll 31 miles of
four-lane construction, said Ed Gorman, chief executive officer of Morrison
Knudsen, the company seeking to build the road.

The revenue forecasts and financial plans now have been delayed since February.
The delay is costing the company about $250,000 a month.

   [The rest of the article is about high finance, except for this last
   sentence:] 

About 3,275 drivers used the existing E-470 segment daily last month, not
enough to pay for tollway operations.

   [What I found interesting about this story was that the company was thwarted
   not because its model didn't produce the result that the financial backers
   wanted, but because they didn't trust the result.  (At least, that's the
   implication of the article; perhaps the model was declared "inaccurate"
   simply because it doesn't forecast enough revenue.)  Are public officials
   and financiers finally realizing that just because a computer model says
   something doesn't mean that it is so?   -Jeff Mogul]

   [P.S.: By the way, if they charged each of those 3275 drivers $2 each day,
   it would take 418 years to pay back the $1 billion construction cost
   (excluding several quintillion dollars of interest expense).  JM]

This morning, while on my way to deliver my 19 month old son to the babysitter,
the railroad crossing gate closed.  It opened shortly after that, with no train
having passed.

Now, this sounds like a completely benign failure mode, yes?  Not if you have a
19 month old who LOVES trains in the car!  Joshua sure got upset when no train
followed the gate's closing...

An increasing number of software manufacturers are encountering problems with
viral infections of their products. It is interesting that in an environment
where manufacturers and users are becoming more cautious, that the installation
procedure for Microsoft Word 5.0 includes directions to remove any virus
protection from your system before proceeding with the installation.

On page 23 of the latest [April 1992] issue of Scientific American is a
two-page spread from Microsoft touting their "Word for Windows" product,
including a tag pointing out how easy it is to print envelopes: "Easy.  We mean
REAL easy.  There's an envelope command right on the screen that addresses and
prints automatically."

And indeed, the envelope shown resting on top of the sample letter in
the photo is nicely addressed, with the printing all lined up and centered.

But the address on the letter and the envelope differ - some of the digits in
the Zip Code got scrambled between the address on the letter and the address on
the envelope.

[And neither Zip Code is proper for San Diego, which is the city shown in the
address.  One is in Los Angeles, and I think the other is much further north.]

What's the Risk?  Financial.  If you're going to advertise a feature, you
should at least make it look like it works.  One can't help but wonder how much
such an error affects sales.

In RISKS 13.28 Brian Randell reported a series of bank ATM robberies
involving forged magstripe cards.

On page B3 of the 17 March '92 Los Angeles Times an article by Hugo Martin
headlined "Security Upgraded At Airport" reports that Burbank airport (one of
L.A.'s smaller airports) will install an $83,000 electronic locking system to
meet FAA requirements for more stringent control of access to non-public areas.
The system will replace current key and combination locks.  Airport employees
will get badges with magstripes.  Doors will be unlocked by a computer when
authorized personnel swipe their cards through readers adjacent to the doors.
The system will allow for giving or revoking authorization on short notice, and
for conditioning authorization on time of day (or week, etc).  "The new system
also records each employee's use of a door, allowing airport officials to
determine which employees were present in a secured area at a given time."

Risks?  The usual from (IMHO) insufficiently thought-out systems.  The system
will not, in fact, provide a good record of which people were in a secured area
at a given time, because the doors aren't being changed and people can pass
through them without authorization or recordation when they're opened by other
people.  Also, it's easy to duplicate the magstripes on the cards.  A photo
with the story suggests that a combination (passcode) could be required along
with the card (it shows a card reader with a keypad) but the story doesn't
mention if this is done.

		Statement of Observations concerning the 
	Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria (ITSEC) V1.2

The Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria (ITSEC) are the result
of an initiative driven by the Commission of the European Communities. Their
current version 1.2 from June 1991 is the basis for the evaluation of secure IT
systems in the EC member countries for at least until 1993.

Although the ITSEC are quite advanced compared to the TCSEC (Orange Book) and
there have been discussions on V1.0 and V1.1, a lot of several critical points
remained in V1.2, especially aspects of possible functionalities and assurance
methods.

Therefore the Data Protection and Data Security Task Force of the German
Society for Informatics (GI) decided to issue and publish a "Statement of
observations concerning the ITSEC V1.2".  Observations, criticism and proposals
concentrate on the following issues:

(1)	Title and Scope of ITSEC
(2)	Functionality
(3)	Assurance - Effectiveness
(4)	Assurance - Correctness
(5)	Post-Evaluation Problems
(6)	Development and Discussion of the ITSEC

The full text has been posted to alt.security, misc.security and comp.security.

Hacker ordered to get mental help  (Reuter)

A computer hacker who pleaded guilty Monday to breaking into NASA computer

FBI Fear Phone Advances Will Hamper Wiretapping

Washington- The FBI, contending that rapidly developing telecommunications
technology is hampering the vital tool of wiretapping, proposed legislation
Friday that would require the industry to ensure that improvements do not
interfere with the ability to secretly record conversations.

It also proposed that consumers pick up the cost of changing current
wiretapping equipment to keep pace with new technology.

If the problem is not solved, "terrorists, violent criminals, kidnapers, drug
cartels and other criminal organizations will be able to carry out their
illegal activities using the telecommunications system without detection." FBI
Director William S. Sessions said.   [...]

At issue is the rapid move toward digital telephone communications and
fiber-optic systems in which thousands of conversations can be carried by
filaments roughly the size of a strand of human hair.

William A. Bayse, assistant FBI director for technical services, and other FBI
officals contend that the transmission of hundreds and sometimes thousands of
digital conversations over a single link prevents current wiretapping
technology from isolating conversations for recording as required under the
1968 federal wiretap law.  [...]

Other FBI offical said the expense could be passed on to telephone users at a
cost of "probably less than 20 cents an average per month."   [...]

FBI officals maintained, however, that they already have encountered
difficulties in recording digitally transmitted conversations, now used by
about 10% of the nations phones.  They declined, however, to give any examples
of such difficulties.

            [Well folks,  we may have finally discovered the long awaited
            "Killer ISDN Application", drug dealing! ;-) 

            On a  more serious note is the FBI's technology that broken,
            that it can't deal with multiplexed transmission?  You would
            think the  NSA has  sufficent technology  to do  it. I don't
            know of  ISDN phones  that come  with built  in  scramblers,
            although it  would be pretty easy to do.  I don't think this
            is what they are talking about here.

            Particulairly galling  is we  are all going to be changed 20
            cents a month to support big brother type intursions.

            This sort  of legislation  can't help  but  to  slow  ISDN's
            already glacial deployment.

            For the  ASI types  what we need now is a new session block,
            Circuit Switched  Voice, Secure(except  where prohibited  by
            law).

I find it strange that the FBI should be tapping into lines directly (I saw an
old Cagney and Lacey last night which had them sitting in a basement with a
breakout box and a tape-recorder - definitive proof of the obsolescence of US
police equipement).  Here in the UK, there is this persistent rumour that our
digital exchange has the most advance security facilities in the world,
allowing tapping of a conversation at the switch rather than on the wire.  This
means our police don't have to get their hands dirty, assuming that the Home
Secretary gives permission, and all they need to do is attach a tape-recorder
(or tape drive) to a port at the exchange.

Does this mean we can expect the sales of System X to take off in the US, as
long as the FBI give their backing?  Or are the FBI forbidden to attach to the
switch?
               cheers, ian

   systems. I'm currently working on Broadband ISDN, and believe me, when that
   will be implemented, I doubt that the FBI will even bother about monitoring
   lines due to the excess amount of information being transmitted.

The recent thread on ISDN and bugging reminded me of an interesting issue.

Some years ago I worked in Ericsson's effort on designing ISDN phones.  One of
the features we implemented was that in order to faciliate testing, the
exchange could send signals to set up loops in the terminals (this is fairly
standard) and to leave an "open end" in case deeper testing was ever needed, a
mechanism for reading or writing any data address on the terminals internal
system bus was provided. In theory, a piece of code could then be added byte by
byte to the RAM of the terminal and a patch jump applied to link it in. Not
that I think anybody would be foolhardy enough to actually do it, but in theory
it would be possible.

But one morning in a coffee-break brainstorm-session we started speculating on
what COULD be done if a feature like this were abused (say, by the FBI) and we
realized that since all the control ports of the phone were regular bus
devices, anybody who knew the address to the proper latch (easy to read if you
got hold of the system description documents), could send the instructions to
activate the microphone and connect it to a B-channel without going through all
the layer-3 protocol stuff or the phone's internal program. Just a couple of
"POKE"s and presto, the room is bugged. This would be more devious than the
"normal" kind of bugging where a line is tapped, since it would take place when
there's no phone call going on.

So as a collective act of civil disobedience the HW and SW designers got
together and put in an extra HW "AND" gate in a strategic location so that the
bitstream from the codec to the S-interface was choked unless either the
receiver was (hardware) off-hook or the "hands-free" indicator LED was turned
on. This meant that the SW had to set two latches to connect the phone to the
line but, hey, that's what macros are for... At least, if anybody were to try
and turn the phone on for bugging purposes, they would have to turn on the LED
on the front.  Hopefully this would be conspicious enough to alert anybody in
the room.

Of course, this didn't prevent bugging of a phone call, but that's impossible
to guard from without encryptation anyway. ALL exchanges have supervision
devices that can be (ab)used to listen in on conversations. Telecom
manufacturers selling to certain countries routinely get orders for far more
supervision equipment than would normally be needed. Why is not too hard to
guess.

The upshot of this is that when I read the discussions about FBI's fear of new
technology, I remembered what we did to deliberately prevent something akin to
what they want legislation to force designers to give them. Does this mean that
I'm now "Persona Non Grata" in the US? :-)

Any others out there who can think of similar "features" of the new digital
technologies? Are we (the guys who then worked at Ellemtel) the only ones to
have thought of it and tried to prevent it? Are there any others on the
list/net who have worked in the field and have stories to share?

			Call For Participation

	    INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON FEATURE INTERACTIONS
		IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE SYSTEMS

	   St. Petersburg, Florida, USA, December 3-4, 1992

			     DESCRIPTION

This workshop is planned to encourage researchers from a variety of
computer science specialties (software engineering, protocol
engineering, distributed artificial intelligence, formal techniques,
and distributed systems, among others) to apply their techniques to
the feature interaction problem that arises in building
telecommunications software systems.

The feature interaction problem has been a major obstacle to the rapid
deployment of new telephone services. Telecommunications software is huge,
real-time, and distributed; adding new features to a telecommunication system,
like adding new functionalities to any large software system, can be very
difficult. Each new feature may interact with many existing features, causing
customer annoyance or total system breakdown. Traditionally, interactions were
detected and resolved on a feature by feature basis by experts who are
knowledgeable on all existing features. As the number of features grows to
satisfy diverse needs of customers, managing feature interactions in a single
administrative domain is approaching incomprehensible complexity. In a future
marketplace where features deployed in the network may be developed by
different operating companies and their associated vendors, the traditional
approach is no longer feasible. How to detect, resolve, or even prevent the
occurrence of feature interactions in an open network becomes an important
research issue.

The feature interaction problem is not unique to telecommunications software;
similar problems are encountered in any long-lived software system that
requires frequent changes and additions to its functionality. Techniques in
many related areas appear to be applicable to the management of feature
interactions. Software methodologies for extensibility and compatibility, for
example, could be useful for providing a structured design that can prevent
many feature interactions from occurring. Formal specification, verification,
and testing techniques, being widely used in protocol engineering and software
engineering, contribute a lot to the detection of interactions. Several causes
of the problem, such as aliasing, timing, and the distribution of software
components, are similar to issues in distributed systems. Cooperative problem
solving, a promising approach for resolving interactions at run time, resembles
distributed planning and resolution of conflicting subgoals among multiple
agents in the area of distributed artificial intelligence.  This workshop aims
to provide an opportunity for participants to share ideas and experiences in
their respective fields, and to apply their expertise to the feature
interaction problem.

We welcome papers on preventing, detecting, and/or resolving feature
interactions using either analytical or structural approaches.  Submissions are
encouraged in (but are not limited to) the following topic areas:
      - Classification of feature interactions.  
      - Modelling, reasoning, and testing techniques for detecting 
        feature interactions.  
      - Software platforms and architectures for preventing or 
        resolving feature interactions.  
      - Tools and methodologies for promoting software compatibility
        and extensibility.  
      - Environments and automated tools for related problems in other 
        software systems.
				FORMAT

We hope to promote a dialogue among researchers in various related areas, as
well as the designers and builders of telecommunications software. To this end,
the workshop will have sessions for paper presentations, including relatively
long discussion periods. Panel discussions and a short tutorial on issues in
the feature interaction problem are being organized.

			      ATTENDANCE

Workshop attendance will be limited to 75 people. Attendance will be by
invitation only. Prospective attendees are asked to submit either a paper
(maximum 5000 words) or a single page description of their interests and how
they relate to the workshop. About 16--20 of the attendees will be asked to
present talks. We will strive for an equal mix of theoretical results and
practical experiences. A set of working notes will be provided at the workshop.
Papers with the highest quality will be considered for publication in a special
issue or section of a research journal.

Globex is an electronic trading system being developed by Chicago's futures
exchanges and Reuters PLC, using a 30-MIPS DEC 9420 computer at Reuters' U.S.
headquarters on Long Island.  The development is behind schedule, having
experienced repeated delays in the past two years.  A previous test in January
handled 30,000 mock trades successfully.  The latest field test on 3 Mar 1992
(with key stations in NY, Chicago, Paris and London) aborted after only ten
minutes:

  The system detected a condition in which the data ... in one of the 250 key
  stations was different from what the host computer thought it should be, and
  when that occurs, the system is designed to shut down.

[Source: Chicago Tribute, 5 Mar 1992, Section 3, article by William B. Crawford
Jr., contributed by Robert V. Binder, starkly abstracted by PGN]

The article includes the hopes for the system, the doubts expressed by others,
and the impact the failed test had -- deferring a vote on a master agreement
governing the partnership, and postponing the intended unveiling, previously
scheduled for April.

In today's Democrat and Chronicle, they had a headline "Error in math chips
away at ice storm aid" (in Rochester, New York they had an ice storm last
year).  This was for the Town of Irondequoit (a neighbor of Rochester).

They got some Federal Disaster Relief for this.
The  Federal government earlier promised 2.7 million dollars.
They really got  1.38 million.

The conclusion was "what nobody realized at the time, officials say now, is
that the total reflects a computer keypunch error."

When I first read the headline, I thought they had a bogus math chip ;-)

I know of two interesting phenomena that relate to two of your CACM Inside
Risks columns.  A full discussion of either would take quite a bit of time to
write down in full, or (probably easier) a phone call.  Therefore, I'm just
going to give you a brief description of each [...].

     The first is an example of a somewhat annoying computer pun, relating to
your 9/90 column.  This concerns Atari 8-bit computers, which were way ahead of
their time, and still are to some extent.  (I still use one for some tasks,
although I have a much fancier computer now.)  In Atari Basic, the prompt is
READY.  For a long time, I noticed occasional peculiar behavior, and I could do
some experiments to recall exactly the form it took.  Anyway, I finally noticed
that when I moved the cursor to such a prompt and hit the return key, no error
message occurred.  (The Atari has a full-screen editor.)  I thought about this,
and finally realized that the interpreter was reading this as READ Y.  Just as
in Fortran (except Fortran 90), blanks are irrelevant, so the prompt was
treated as an immediate command.  I don't think this usually caused real
trouble, but it could do so if my program had a variable named Y.

     The second phenomenon relates (at least partially) to your column on
clocks (1/91).  This one you very likely were aware of already.  I was having
my students do timing tests on programs on IBMs and clones.  This is painful
enough, just because of the absurd rate of ticks (18/sec.), but further
problems are caused by the fact that the data (hours, minutes, seconds and
hundredths of seconds) is in unsigned integer, 1-byte form.  We were using
Turbo Pascal, which is generally a useful implementation.  However, this
language has five (or six if the coprocessor is present or being simulated)
integer types, of which three are signed and two are unsigned, and all may be
freely mixed.  This causes many typing problems, worse than any built into
Fortran.  The basic problems come from the fact that when you subtract unsigned
integers, if the result is negative, the computed value becomes a positive
integer, usually a large one.  We found several different ways to get crazy
output, including some ways that the error would not be a power of two.

In <A HREF="/Risks/13.29.html">RISKS-13.29</A>, W.M. Buckley notes that the installation instructions for
Microsoft Word 5.0 instructs customers to remove virus protection before
installation.

While I don't know the particulars of Microsoft's situation, I suspect
there are two reasons:

-- Virus protection programs trap certain operations that the installation
   procedure must perform in order to install the software. For example,
   Microsoft records the customer name, organization, and serial number
   "somewhere" in the application image. Depending on how they do this,
   this may look to the virus checker as if an intruder were modifying
   the image.

-- Installing an application is a rather complex task (I am speaking here
   of the Macintosh, but I suppose this applies to other systems as well.)
   I am currently working on a Macintosh application and am budgeting
   about one week to write write a simple installation script for a much
   simpler product. Since virus protection software works by modifying
   the system image in some "secret" manner, debugging, documentation and
   customer support become expensive nightmares. The vendor is far better off
   putting more effort into manufacturing control and development.

In my own product, I'm faced with a similar problem: one of its functions is to
create, under user control, small applications. Here, too, the documentation
must warn the customer to add my application to the virus protection
program's list of "trusted" programs.

This is not necessarily a failure mode.  Among the possibilities...

1) Railroad personnel were testing the crossing gate.  This can be accomplished
in one of many ways.  The personel don't necessarily have to be immediately at
the crossing.

2) Pranksters were having fun.  Again they don't have to be immediately at the
crossing.

3) A local freight train doing some switching moves entered the electrical
block controlling the crossing activating the crossing gate.  The train then
stopped and reversed direction exiting the block, allowing the crossing gates
to open.

I just love it when people say that something failed/broke when they really
don't have any idea about what is going on.  =8^)

The REAL risk, is that these people sometimes get a lot of attention and as a
result negatively effect the reputation of reliable equipment, companies,
people, [fill in the blank]!

Railroad crossing gates coming down when no train is coming just a "benign
failure mode"?  Not necessarily: I have a friend who admits that in his (much)
younger days he would head down to the tracks near his house and close the
gates just for fun.  He reports that the drivers at the front of the lined up
traffic were very reluctant to cross the tracks when the gates went up (much to
the chagrin of the drivers just arriving at the end of the line).  They assumed
that the "failure" was that the gates went up too soon, rather than that they
went down without cause.

My friend has reformed himself now, but I've learned some interesting things
about railroad crossing gates.  The (pedestrian) gates near my house (and
presumably this is how most work) will go down when the tracks are shorted
together.  I have yet to take a voltmeter to them, however.

 In Volume 13 : Issue 29 "Peter G. Neumann" &lt;neumann@csl.sri.com&gt; notes an
article over the purported plan to turn off Magellan before it fails due to a
lack of funds.

 I suspect something like the old Viking Fund will be set up by someone. At
this funding level, simple charity might supply enough money to keep things
going. It's a rather silly way to fund a probe, but not as silly as shutting
down.

 You may recall the Viking funds striking logo: Viking with a tin cup in it's
claw.

Today's New York Times reports that the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights will
start a campaign called Witness to provide human-rights groups around the world
with hand-held video cameras, computers and fax machines.  The Reebok
Foundation and musician/composer Peter Gabriel contributed to the project.  Mr.
Gabriel said: "It's much easier for those in power to get away with murder,
torture, repression and the destruction of our environment if their actions are
not witnessed by the media and public."

While we have heard how technology contributed to the overthrow of the Shah and
kepts the world's eyes on repression by the China's leaders, I wonder if this
effort is a legacy of the Rodney King beating by police officers in Los
Angeles.  The beating was videotaped and played over and over on tv, resulting
in indictments and a current trail of police officers.  Better that legacy than
America's Favorite Videos or some other "let's video our kids hitting dad in
the crotch" or "we'll act crazy and hope that we can get on tv with the tape",
which is so popular on television today in the U.S.

&gt;From the Saab drive-by-wire report:

  "The idea is that driving without a steering wheel is	physically safer,
  because you can fit an airbag where the steering wheel would be and
  avoid the crushing injuries often sustained by drivers in accidents."

Curious.  Chrysler puts air bags on the driver side but not the passenger side.
They defend this by claiming that it's much harder to mount a bag on the
passenger side -- without a steering column, there's no suitable place for it.

&gt;From the roaring mouse discussion:

	"I would prefer to see the regulation require that the mouse
	have FCC class B ..."

PC mice are unlike those in the Macintosh, Sun, or X terminal world in that
they are usually sold as separate products.  None of the three PC laptops that
I've purchased have been offered with a mouse option (perhaps EMI problems were
a consideration.)  There is no opportunity to perform FCC testing of a PC
laptop and mouse as a single system.

There was small item in the New York Times earlier this week reporting on the 
United Airlines 747 that lost a door near Hawaii a few years ago.  The report 
has been revised to say that the door was lost due to a problem with the 
control circuitry for the door and was not due to a mechanical problem.  Hmm.

A final note on the broadcasting mice.  I do realize that any external wire

I meant to mention that my naivete itself was an example of taking technology 
advancement for granted.  This similar to using an old tape deck and going 
directly from forward to reverse. Those used to mechanical systems would stop 
in the middle and give the tape a chance to stop. Those brought up on VCRs 
would assume that the machine would be smart enough to deal the mechanical 
problems "intelligently".

Similarly, my expectations of airline communications are affected by what I
know is possible, even if it is naive knowledge.

Today's Washington Post has an article about a new Xerox software product
designed to provide remote access to a PC through a FAX.  Basically, you can
FAX a message to your PC with instructions on what you want, and it will FAX
the file(s) to a number of your choosing.  If you don't have the form handy,
FAXing a blank sheet of paper will cause it to FAX the blank form back to you.
The target market is people who travel but don't carry everything they might
possibly need...they call it a 24-hour-a-day assistant.

The product (whose name I've forgotten) is software...it works with
the hardware FAX boards you can buy.

The product sounds really neat, but the first thought that came to my mind was
security.  If I know that Jane Doe has this software on her PC, how will it
prevent me from asking for a copy of anything on her PC?  The article didn't
mention any security measures to prevent an machine from attack.

I don't have any technical product information, so this may be merely
an omission from the article, rather than a weakness in the product.

       COMPUTER SYSTEM SECURITY AND PRIVACY ADVISORY BOARD
                          RESOLUTION #1
                         March 18, 1992

The Board has examined the present status of the proposed Digital
Signature Standard (DSS) being undertaken by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  In view of:

(1)  the significant public policy issues raised during the
     review of the proposed standard;

(2)  the increasingly pervasive use of digital technologies;

(3)  the potential impacts upon the security of the
     unclassified/sensitive government community;

(4)  the relationship of the DSS to the existing NIST
     cryptographic security program; and

(5)  the posture of the U.S. in international commerce.

THE BOARD FINDS THAT:

(1)  a national level public review of the positive and negative
     implications of the widespread use of public and private key
     cryptography is required.  This national level review must
     involve the national security, law enforcement, government
     unclassified/sensitive, and commercial communities. 
     Representatives from the private sector should include both
     vendors and users.  In the next several months, NIST/NSA
     should sponsor a workshop on the widespread use of
     cryptography.  This national review should be concluded by
     June 1993.

(2)  NIST has made significant progress in resolving the
     technical issues related to the proposed DSS.  The Board
     recommends that NIST continue to seek resolution of the
     patent, infrastructure, and other remaining issues raised
     during the public comment process.  The Board recognizes
     that much of the work, and in particular the infrastructure,
     are algorithmic independent and must be continued by NIST to
     assure timely implementation of digital signature technology
     within the government.

The Board resolves that:

     The approval of the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) by the

     conclusion of the national review.

The Board agrees to continue to monitor the activities involving
the DSS and the proposed national review at future meetings.

Well, having just installed Word 5.0 this week, I can tell you the reason:
MSWord 5.0 installs things (fonts, mostly) directly into the System.  All
virus detectors I know of will at least trap/warn on this.  But the Install
program can't deal with these trap/warn windows appearing and grabbing
control while Install is trying to read from disk.

So you have to turn off your virus protection.  You may also have to
reinstall other things in your system.  In my case, the Word installation
blew away my Personal Laserwriter print driver.

As long as I'm on the subject, MSWord 5.0 represents a significant step
BACKWARD for Word, as far as I can tell.  I'm seriously thinking of going
back to 4.0 because the new interface is *so* bad.

Word 5.0 has several instances of the "the computer is doing something but
doesn't tell the user" RISK.  This, of course, causes users to repeat
inputs, thinking nothing happened the first time.  These additional inputs
are buffered and applied to the next step in the process, potentially
causing damage that is hard or impossible to undo.

The program is also significantly slower than version 4.0 (at least a factor
of two in the tests I've done).  This introduces the RISK that long-time
Word users like myself will assume that the Mac is hung and begin
diagnostic/repair actions which are inappropriate and cause bad effects.

There is more functionality than in 4.0, but a lot of it is "stupid"
functionality in the sense that the new features duplicate existing features
or do flat-out dumb things (we can discuss some other time the hilariously
wrong messages their grammar checker spits out).

A shame, really.  Microsoft does occasionally produce good products (Excel
2.2 has one of the best, most intuitive interfaces I've ever seen), but Word
seems to get worse every odd-numbered release and only better with the even
numbers.

The debate on (son of) S. 266 and on whether and how to "dumb down" computer
technology to satisfy law enforcement needs is joined in The New York Times of
Friday, March 27, 1992 with articles by William Sessions, FBI director, and
Janlori Goldman, director of the privacy and technology project of the American
Civil Liberties Union. RISKS readers with an interest (or stake) should read
these articles carefully, and consider responding with letters to the editor of
the New York Times of their own if they have anything to add.  If the technical
community wishes to be heard, it should speak up now.  (Letters to their

FBI Director William Sessions wrote an interesting op-ed piece in today's New
York Times (Vol. CXLI, No. 48,918, Fri., Mar. 27, 1992, p. A15) dealing with
the problems which federal law enforcement expects to encounter when placing
court-ordered wiretaps on data circuits.  When I read between the lines, it
sounds as if Mr. Sessions doesn't want us to use data security which employs
end-to-end encryption; perhaps other RISKS-DIGEST readers will draw different
conclusions.

[Under the rubric "Dialogue/High-Tech Wiretaps"]

			    Keeping an Ear on Crime:
			The F.B.I. Needs Industry's Help

By William S. Sessions

     Advances in telecommunications technology promise to deprive Federal,
state and local law enforcement officers and the public of the incalculable
benefits that can be obtained only by court-authorized wire-tapping.
     Wiretapping is one of the most effective means of combating drug
trafficking, organized crime, kidnapping and corruption in government.  The
Federal Bureau of Investigation does not want the new digital technology that
is spreading across America to impair this crucial law-enforcement technique.
Thus, after consulting with the telecommunications industry, members of
Congress and executive branch agencies, the Justice Department has proposed
legislation that is intended to preserve the ability of law enforcement
officers to intercept conversations of people engaged in serious crimes.
     This bill is consistent with legislation passed in 1968 after Congress
debated the constitutional problem posed by the Government's need to address
both serious criminal conduct and the individual's right to privacy.  Congress
struck a balance by passing the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act.
     That law and later amendments created the meticulous procedure by which
law enforcement officers obtain judicial authorization for electronic
surveillance.  Wiretaps can be used to address only the most serious criminal,
sometimes violent, threats facing society.  Only when a judge is satisfied that
all statutory safeguards have been met and all other reasonable investigative
steps have failed or will likely fail, are taps permitted.
     Digital technology makes possible the simultaneous transmission of
multiple conversations and other data over the same lines.  The problem is that
voice transmission will soon be replaced by an endless, inseparable stream of
electronic emissions, making it virtually impossible to capture criminal
conversations.
     The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not complaining.  As the
telecommunications industry develops digital technology, new services such as
Caller ID are becoming available to business and private customers.  The new
technology already has provided benefits for the F.B.I.--for example, it helped
solve the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
     But if digital technology is fully introduced with insufficient attention
to public safety, the effectiveness of law enforcement officers will be greatly
impaired.
     As society and technology evolve, so do government's needs and
responsibilities.  And, yes, the burden of helping to safeguard the public
often falls on those who make profits from regulated goods and services.  It is
reasonable for the telecommunications industry to come to the aid of law
enforcement.  The proposed legislation relies on it to find technical solutions
that are cost effective while permitting the developement of its technology.
Surely it can do both in a way that insures its competitiveness.
     Indisputably, there will be financial costs associated with whatever
technical solutions the private sector might develop.  These costs cannot be
measured only in dollars; consider the price society would pay if the ability
to solve complex crimes were thwarted by an end to wiretapping.  In a recent
large-scale military-procurement fraud case-- which was successful because of
wiretaps--the fines, restitutions, forfeitures and savings to taxpayers
exceeded $500 million.
     The cost to telecommunications companies would not be so substantial as to
outweigh the consequences of an inability of law enforcement to act.  But if
nothing is done soon, as technology advances and the digital systems become
more widespread, the cost of addressing the issue down the road will
undoubtedly increase dramatically.
     The proposed legislation does not expand the authority of the F.B.I.  or
any other criminal justice agency.  It simply preserves what Congress
authorized in 1968--nothing more.
     In recent years, Congress has expanded the Federal criminal activities for
which wiretapping may be obtained.  As in 1968, it must decide if law
enforcement should have this invaluable tool available.  I am confident that
congress will again support law enforcement by approving the necessary
legislation.

Speaking of rekeying the following is from the Friday March 27, 1992 in an 
article about Salomon Brother's accidental sale of a few million dollars of 
stocks:

The error crept in when a clerk at the firm, in translating the order into a

the column showing the total value of the orders into the column showing the

I have had two separate reports from people working for U.S. Government
agencies that the Department of Justice has advised them that trapping of
keystrokes is a violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and
similar privacy-related legislation.  Those who mentioned it to me seemed to
imply that the keystrokes being discussed were related to access control/audit
measures rather than worker monitoring technology.

Can anyone clarify and/or verify this information?  I would be interested in
finding out if this interpretation only applies to the Federal Government or to
private sector organizations as well?  If my information is correct, this may
mean that important information security efforts could be considered as illegal
activities.  The crunch between old laws and new technology grows daily.

The following is from Le Canard Enchaine, 25 March 1992. Le Canard Enchaine, a
pillar of the French press for 75 years or so, is a satirical and investigative
paper, with no known equivalent anywhere else.

The translation, or more correctly the feeble attempt at literal adaptation
since the Canard style is basically untranslatable, is by Bertrand Meyer, from
whom also the comments in square brackets, some of which refer to notes at the
end.

	     MAD COMPUTER CONS SUPERMARKET CUSTOMERS
             ---------------------------------------

TAPPING A THOUSAND BANK ACCOUNTS

Seeing one's bank account being repeatedly debited over a period of several
months, to the credit of a store where you have never set foot - such was the
lot of about one thousand customers of a Paris supermarket. Whenever they paid
for their expenses using their Visa international card, they were in fact
feeding - without their knowledge ... - the coffers of a clothing store, which
hadn't asked for it.  Overall, because of a computer error, more than 450,000
Francs (US$ 90,000) was drawn from these involuntary customers.

On October 14, 1991, the manager of the "Codec" [a food supermarket] on the rue
des Amandiers [in Paris] notes that his cash registers, driven by a specialized
computer program, systematically rejects all payments made by Visa
International cards. He calls the PSI Alcatel ISR company, which installed the
system and is responsible for its maintenance. In order to find out the source
of the problem, a technician [from PSI Alcatel] makes a copy of the store's
customer file into one of his company's programs [sic]. Having apparently
corrected the error, he sends the file back to Codec.

DEBITS UNLIMITED

A few weeks later, a riot or something very close to that erupts at Codec.
Dozens of irate customers storm the store's offices: their banking accounts,
which were debited normally the previous month [see note 1] after they made
some purchases at Codec, are being debited again; but this time it's to the
credit of "Gify Center" a clothing store in Nantes [a city in Vendee, on the
Atlantic Ocean, several hundred miles from Paris]. Grand total of these double
payments: 229,000 F ($40,000).

In early January 1992, the manager alerts PSI Alcatel. Answer, given without
any trace of emotion: PSI Alcatel has know about these computer blunders for
several weeks. This is because Gify Center, wondering about this unexpected
manna raining full-baked from the computer, had taken the trouble to inform
[PSI Alcatel]. As to the poor manager of Codec, being unable to provide any
explanation, he is being called a crook by some of his customers.

PSI Alcatel claims to be working hard on the problem - but to no avail since
trouble starts again in February. This time it's a store in Vannes [in
Brittany, also on the West Coast], also part of the Gify Center chain, which is
the beneficiary. Five hudred clients are affected; some of them, according to
the Codec manager, are even debited four times for the same amount. [??]

At this stage the police, being flooded with complaints, opens an investigation
and summons the poor Codec manager. Not hard to understand why: many of the
affected customers have had to pay interest penalties to their banks [see note
2], since their accounts have had overdrafts because of these repeated
payments. Others have had to pay penalties for returned checks, or have been on
the brink of having their bank cards cancelled.

COMPUTER HICCUPS

By dint of hard work, PSI Alcatel at last discovers the source of all these
computer follies. [Perhaps someone should suggest a subscription to RISKS?] The
technician, who had copied the Codec's customer file into his own program [sic
and resic, to use a favorite Canard expression] for the purpose of debugging
it, had forgotten to erase the file. A fateful mistake: every time PSI Alcatel
sold their program for managing cash registers, they were also unwittingly
selling the Codec's customer file. After that, whenever the program had been
inserted into a store's computer, it would direct the banks to debit the
accounts of the customers recorded in that file.

One piece of good news: PSI Alcatel claims to have sold this over-filled
program to no one else than Gify Center. The customers of the rue des Amandiers
Codec have avoided the worst: since Gify Center owns about forty stores in
France, that's the number of times the mad computers could have emptied their
accounts.

[End of article]


[Notes for foreign readers:

[1] The most common use of credit cards in France is as ``debit cards''; i.e.
they are tied to a bank account and expenses are automatically debited at the
end of the month.

[2] Overdraft is less of an abnormal situation in France than in e.g.  the US.
Most banks will tolerate some overdraft as long as the situation doesn't get
too serious. It's actually a fairly juicy situation for them since they charge
rather high ``agios'' (translated above by ``interest penalties''.)]

[General note: I am surprised by the relatively small amounts of money
involved.]

It's worth noting that the revision in the official story, that an electrical,
not mechanical fault was responsible, is entirely due to the persistance of one
man, the father of one of the passengers lost in the accident.  He formulated
this theory, and persued it with United and Boeing, even, I believe, got
permission to be present when the door was recovered from the bottom of the
Pacific. The new finding vindicates his stand, and without his efforts, it is
unlikely that the truth would have been found.

&gt;From the New Scientist 28 March 1992 - a follow up to "Patriot missiles misled
by `accidental' decoys" (<A HREF="/Risks/13.19.html">RISKS-13.19</A>).

The Pentagon is accusing one of its scientific critics of publishing secret
data on the Patriot missile. The scientist, Ted Postol of MIT, says that all
his information came from published sources and his own calculations.

The row began after Postol published a 50-page article on the Patriot's
performance in the Gulf War in the journal "International Security". The
article presents evidence that the Patriot missed most, and perhaps all, the
Iraqi warheads it was fired at. (New Scientist 15 Feb 1992)

Postol has worked for the US Navy and consulted nuclear weapon laboratories in
the past. He has a security clearance that allows him access to classified
information. But he says he purposely stayed away form all classified briefings
on the Patriot so that he could make his conclusions public.

On 13 March, Postol was visited by an investigator from the Defense
Investigative Service. The DIS officer wanted Postol to attend a classified
meeting to discuss where he had obtained the information for his article.
Postol refused, saying that if he did, he would really learn secret information
about the Patriot, which would prevent him from talking about it.

The investigator then informed Postol that he would have to stop discussing the
article in public anyway, because the US Army had decided that it contained
secret data. If Postol refused, he would be in violation of his secrecy
agreement with the government and could lose his security clearance.

Postol says he found his order incredible, and asked to have it in writing.
More than a week later, on 19 March, he was told that a letter was waiting for
him at the Mitre Corporation, a nearby military contractor. In a Kafkaesque
twist. the letter itself was classified, so Postol is refusing to read it.

Last week, the Pentagon disclosed that the Raytheon Corporation, which
manufacturers the Patriot, had started the entire affair. Raytheon executives
had sent a copy of Postol's article to the Army. suggesting that it might
contain secret information.

Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, tried to play down the affair last week.
He told reporters that the DIS was carrying out a routine investigation and "no
final determination has been made" on whether Postol's article contained
secrets.

A Congressional committee has taken up Postol's cause, and is investigating
whether the Pentagon is abusing its classification system to silence a critic.

  [I feel that Postol must have a point, given the rather backdoor methods
  being used to stop him blowing the whistle any more.]

The following appeared in my mailbox.  (Don't know the name
of the person who originally sent it; I was at the end of a
moderate-sized forwarding chain.)

   On Peter Ross's ABC-TV arts show on Sunday Afternoon,
   the avant garde composer John Cage was featured
   performing his 4'33".  It consists of the performer(s),
   armed with a stopwatch, sitting silently on stage for
   four minutes 33 seconds, with the music consisting of
   whatever noises come from the audience or outside the
   auditorium.  The TV performance went well, but the ABC
   was caught out by technology - a fail-safe device turns
   off studio transmission if there's more than 90 seconds
   of silence, and puts up a test pattern.  It went into
   operation three times during the performance.

Just read in a direct-mail promotional piece for Microsoft Windows 3.1:

  You may be wondering _how_ Windows version 3.1 reduces application
  errors and system crashes.  One of the most powerful additions to
  Windows 3.1 is "parameter validation."  Parameter validation means
  that when information is passed from an application to the Windows

    I don't know about the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, but
National Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Directive
(NTISSD) NO. 600, "Communications Security (COMSEC) Monitoring," 10 Apr 90
(FOUO), makes it a requirement that users of Government telecommunications
systems be notified in advance that their use of these systems constitutes
consent to monitoring for COMSEC purposes.  (No, I don't have a copy.)
 
    I'm not a lawyer (my parents are married), but I've been given to
understand that "Government telecommunications systems" means ANY computer
or network whether OWNED or merely FUNDED by the Government.  (Can you
say "nearly every system in the U.S."?  I knew you could!)  If you have
any question as to the applicability to your own situation, I suggest
you hire a member of the Legal Guild who can spell "telecommunications".
 
    F.Y.I., DISA (via DDN Security Bulletin 9123)* strongly "recommended"
that all DDN hosts insert one or the other of the following in their
"WELCOME" messages, either:
 
    "GOVERNMENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND AUTOMATED INFORMATION
    SYSTEMS ARE SUBJECT TO A PERIODIC SECURITY TESTING AND MONITORING TO
    ENSURE PROPER COMMUNICATIONS SECURITY (COMSEC) PROCEDURES ARE BEING
    OBSERVED.  USE OF THESE SYSTEMS CONSTITUTES CONSENT TO SECURITY
    TESTING AND COMSEC MONITORING."
 
         -- or, for those sites with limited bandwidth, --
 
    "USE CONSTITUTES CONSENT TO SECURITY TESTING AND MONITORING."
 
    It's my understanding that the wording of these "un-WELCOME" messages
was worked out with no little blood on the rug.
 
&gt;&gt; If my information is correct, this may mean that important information
 security efforts could be considered as illegal activities.
 
    Very true.  For example, an "alleged penetrator" (prosecuting attorneys
prefer to avoid the H(acker) word as "too warm and fuzzy") was monitored
while committing (what I'd consider to be) electronic breaking and entry.
He got off because he hadn't been warned that he was being monitored.
(This may be hearsay, but it is NOT apocryphal; I know some of the parties
involved and have suppressed the names to protect those found Not Guilty.)

Lance Hoffman's posting on Friday mentioned the New York Times Op-Ed dialogue
between FBI Director William Sessions and Janlori Goldman, director of the ACLU
Privacy and Technology Project.  Kurt Sauer posted Director Session's article;
at the risk of preaching to the choir, herewith is Ms. Goldman's reply.


Keeping an Ear on Crime: Why Cater To Luddites?

By Janlori Goldman

The Federal Bureau of Investigation says advances in the telecommunications
industry are likely to make it difficult to use its old-fashioned wiretapping
techniques to listen in on telephone conversations.  The F.B.I.'s solution, in
legislation the Justice Department is asking Congress to pass, is to force the
telecommunications and computer industries to redesign their modernized systems
to accommodate the bureau's needs.  Unfairly, the F.B.I. wants consumers to pay
for it through rate increases and higher equipment costs. The
telecommunications and computer industries both oppose a bill that would
mandate such sweeping regulations.

The proposal makes the bureau look like Luddites, the 19th century English
weavers who smashed new machines that they claimed put them out of work.
Instead of keeping up with new developments, the F.B.I. wants to freeze
progress.

It is wrongheaded and dangerous to require the industry to put surveillance
first by slowing innovation and retarding efficiency. How can the F.B.I.
justify this policy at home while the White House is wringing its hands over
U.S. competitiveness in the international market?

The F.B.I. fears that new digital technology will make it difficult, even
impossible, to listen in on conversations by using traditional wiretapping
equipment. The new technology converts voices and data into electronic
blips and reconverts the blips into voices and data near the receiving end
on high-speed fiberoptic lines.

The bureau overstates its concern. The telecommunications industry says it is
not aware of a single instance in which the F.B.I. has been unable to tap a
line because of the widespread new technology. Even the Director, William S.
Sessions, admitted in a Congressional hearing last week that no warrant has
been issued that could not be executed.

At issue is the F.B.I.'s ability to wiretap in the future. But the answer is
not a legislative fix that freezes technology. The F.B.I. is not only asking
the industry to dumb down existing software, it wants to prohibit it from
developing new technologies that might interfere with the Government's ability
to intercept various oral and electronic communications. The proposed
restrictions not only cover phone companies but also on-line computer services
(such as as Prodigy and Compuserve), electronic mail systems and bulletin
boards, and switchboards.

The F.B.I. says its proposal only seeks to preserve its legal authority to
wiretap. Actually, it wants to expand the power of the Federal Communications
Commission, which regulates the telecommunications industry, to make the
F.B.I.'s needs a priority in designing new technologies. In its legislation,
the Government threatens to impose a $10,000-a-day fine on companies that
develop technologies that exceed the F.B.I.'s technical competence.  The F.B.I.
has it backward.  If the Government wants to engage in surveillance, it must
bear the burden of keeping pace with new developments.  Last year, Congress
appropriated $80 million for a five-year F.B.I. research effort focused on
telecommunications advances.

There is a serious risk that rollbacks in advances may make telecommunications
networks more vulnerable to unauthorized intrusion. One of the industry's main
goals is to design secure systems that thwart illegal interception of
electronic funds transfers, proprietary information and other sensitive data.

The F.B.I. is not the only agency trying to block progress. The National
Security Agency has tried to put a cap on the private development of technology
in encryption, the electronic encoding of data to guard against unauthorized
use.

As the private sector develops more effective encryption codes to protect
information in its data bases, the N.S.A. worries that it may have trouble
breaking such codes in its intelligence gathering overseas. The agency is
denying export licenses for certain encryption codes, thus inhibiting the
private sector's development and use of the technology.  Congress should defeat
the proposal. Otherwise, we may be prohibited from erecting sturdy buildings if
the thick walls prevent an F.B.I. agent from eavesdropping on a conversation
through a cup pressed to a wall.

Every telephone switch I have ever encountered had the capability of monitoring
individual conversations, even when those conversations are multiplexed
together with other connections in the switch.  While my experience is not as
wide as others in the telephone field, it would seem to me that such a
monitoring capability is an essential switch design element for diagnostic
purposes, if nothing else.

Thus I do not believe that the FBI has any need for this law; they need only
take their court order to the telephone company and they will be provided with
the tap they have been authorized.

No, it seems to me that the ONLY purpose the FBI has in proposing such a law
would be so that it can make telephone taps WITHOUT the cooperation of the
telephone company.  Presumably, the only reason for not wanting the cooperation
of the telephone company is that the FBI in such cases might well not have the
cooperation of the court either - in other words, what they are asking for is
the ability to make warrantless taps.

End-to-end encryption, of course, would NOT fit this model.  Nor would it be
prevented by this law, since encryptors can be fitted to any phone without the
cooperation of the phone company.

     [Forwarded to RISKS by Lance J. Hoffman &lt;hoffman@seas.gwu.edu&gt;

The Washington Post
March 26, 1992 
Back to Smoke Signals?

 The Justice Department spent years in court breaking up the nation's
telecommunications monopoly in order to foster competition and technological
advances. Now the same department has gone to Congress asking that improvements
in telecommunications technology be halted, and in some cases even reversed, in
the name of law enforcement. The problems facing the FBI are real, but the
proposed solution is extreme and unacceptable on a number of grounds.

    Wiretaps are an important tool in fighting crime, especially the kind of
large-scale, complicated crime -- such as drug conspiracies, terrorism and
racketeering -- that is the responsibility of the FBI.  When they are installed
pursuant to court order, taps are perfectly legal and usually most productive.
But advances in phone technology have been so rapid that the government can't
keep up. Agents can no longer just put a tap on phone company equipment a few
blocks from the target and expect to monitor calls. Communications occur now
through regular and cellular phones via satellite and microwave, on fax
machines and computers.  Information is transmitted in the form of computer
digits and pulses of light through strands of glass, and none of this is easily
intercepted or understood.

   The Justice Department wants to deal with these complications by forbidding
them. The department's proposal is to require the Federal Communications
Commission to establish such standards for the industry "as may be necessary to
maintain the ability of the government to lawfully intercept communications."
Any technology now in use would have to be modified within 180 days, with the
costs passed on to the rate payers. Any new technology must meet the
suitable-for- wiretap standard, and violators could be punished by fines of $
10,000 a day. As a final insult, commission proceedings concerning these
regulations could be ordered closed by the attorney general.

   The civil liberties problems here are obvious, for the purposeful designing
of telecommunications systems that can be intercepted will certainly lead to
invasions of privacy by all sorts of individuals and organizations operating
without court authorization. Further, it is an assault on progress, on
scientific endeavor and on the competitive position of American industry. It's
comparable to requiring Detroit to produce only automobiles that can be
overtaken by faster police cars. And it smacks of repressive government.

   The proposal has been drafted as an amendment rather than a separate bill,
and there is some concern that it will be slipped into a bill that has already
passed one house and be sent quietly to conference. That would be
unconscionable. We believe, as the industry suggests, that the kind of informal
cooperation between law enforcement agencies and telecommunications companies
that has always characterized efforts in the past, is preferable to this
stifling legislation. But certainly no proposal should be considered by
Congress without open and extensive hearings and considerable debate.

&gt;...  When I read between the lines, it
&gt;sounds as if Mr. Sessions doesn't want us to use data security which employs
&gt;end-to-end encryption; perhaps other RISKS-DIGEST readers will draw different
&gt;conclusions.

I agree with your conclusions.  What I want to know, is wire-tapping really the
best way of catching criminals?  Sounds like this fellow is belly-aching
because his comfy method of listening to other peoples private lives may be in
jeopardy!

Just wait till the FBI demands that all encryption keys and routines be
registered with the FBI for 'security' reasons!

Building Communities with Online Tools
 - John Coate, Director of Interactive Services, 101 OnLIne

When people log into online communication systems, they use new tools to engage
in an ancient activity - talking to each other.  Systems become a kind of
virtual village.  At the personal level they help people find their kindred
spirits.  At the social level, they serve as an important conduit of
information, and become an essential element in a democratic society.

John was known as a Community Builder at the WELL (Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link)
where he worked tirelessly to build the WELL into a place with clearly
recognizable social cohesion.

William Gibson, well known for his "Neuromancer" (which in 1986 anticipated
what is today known as virtual reality), has a new book, "Agrippa (A Book of
the Dead)" that apparently will be available ONLY in computer-diskette form,
according to Entertainment Weekly.  

As reported in the San Francisco Chronicle (31 Mar 1992, p.D3), "Gibson plans
to infect the disk with a virus that will make it impossible to transfer the
text to paper."  

This supposed "virus" (more like a logic bomb or a confinement lock?) will
undoubtably present an interesting challenge to MSDOS crackers, antiviralists,
virtual realists, and foreign ripoffs.  If it were to run on Unix, where you
can external to the program trivially pipe the output to a file, at least the
text would be easy to capture.  However, perhaps this is really a situation in
which it is the graphical screen image that is relevant rather than the words.
Digitized sound would also make it hard to transfer to paper.

There is also the likelihood that a succession of home-grown purgated editions
might appear, with incremental changes in the dialogue, visuals, and plot line.
You don't like the ending?  You want pornographic augmentations?  Roll your own
modifications!  Tinkering is generally easier than creating in the first place.
So, the book also needs some sort of integrity lock (checksum or crypto seal
[is a sea-lion a cryptoseal?]) to provide tamper detection; however, many such
schemes can be defeated by careful modifications that continue to satisfy the
check.  But, if Gibson has come up with an interactive, interpretively
developed book that creates its own virtual reality on the screen, that could
be quite an exciting development.

  [Note: It is important not to confuse the SF Chronicle noted above with
  the other publication with the same handle, the Science Fiction Chronicle,
  although sometimes it is hard to tell the difference.]

The NSA and the Software Publishers' Association appear to have reached an
agreement that would allow some exports of cryptographic software, as long as
the keys are constrained to be sufficiently short.  The net effect is a slight
but potentially useful improvement over what was previously exportable.
[Source: An article, NSA May Loosen Curbs on Software Sales Abroad, by Don
Clark, Chronicle Staff Writer, San Francisco Chronicle, 24 Mar 1992, p.C1]

Now that NSA and RSA have come a little closer, we need to bring in BSA (the
Boy Scouts of America).  Be prepared!  Imagine, a merit badge for cryptography?

There was a report last week on CNN Headline News about the US Navy improperly
certifying radar jamming equipment for Navy jets (I think the F-14 and the
F/A-18 were mentioned).  According to the report, the Navy tested and certified
these jammers despite the fact that the equipment failed several tests or did
not meet all the criteria for certification.  As a consequence, some
congressional subcommittee or another was investigating the Navy's
certification procedures. The Navy's excuse for certifying these systems
despite the failed tests was to blame the failures on software errors,
according to the report.

The report did not mention who manufactured the radar jammers or who wrote the
software in question.

The March 23, 1992 edition of _Newsweek_ features an article critical
of research related to the Strategic Defense Initiative. The article
is titled "Safety Net Full of Holes" (pp. 56-59), written by Sharon
Begley and Daniel Glick. It contains this reassuring passage:

	"[The] Pentagon disagrees that deploying a space-
	and ground-based defense system poses significant
	technical challenges. The complexity of the software
	required to coordinate Star Wars, for instance, is no
	more daunting than programs that control nuclear
	reactors, it says."

Now we can all breath a sigh of relief. [ All typos are mine. ]

I just had to pass this one on because it was so funny/sad.  A client told me
today of a consultant who designed a menu-driven system to be used by
accountants for financial purposes.  Needing a special character to signify
"return to main menu", he chose one that "nobody uses" (his words).  The
character?  The dollar sign!

Needless to say, on the first day the software was installed, my
client got a frantic call.  "Every time I try to enter a dollar
amount, it pops me back to the menu!"

Brian Kantor notes that a monitoring capability is an essential diagnostic
element of any telephone switch, digital or analog.  He suggests that the only
purpose conceivable for a law such as the FBI proposes is to enable wiretaps
without Telco cooperation; this in turn is most likely to occur when the FBI
doesn't have a proper warrant, either.  Hence, "[W]hat they are asking for is
the ability to make warrantless taps."

In fairness to the FBI, there are other possibilities, such as when a Telco
employee is himself the subject of an investigation.  Not much, I agree, but
let's try to assume that the Bureau's motivation is pure, even if its proposed
implementation isn't.

    This makes the second time in recent months we have heard of government
initiatives to make wiretapping of data traffic easier.  Interestinly, there
are a couple of companies currently working on devices (and must admit I have
been prodding them for a couple of years) that should make it an order of
magnitude more difficult:

    For some time now, I have been concerned about tapping, particularly when
performing my daily security duties while at conferences. Currently I rely on a
"smart card" or dynamic access device for one-time passwords to avoid spoofing.
About two years ago the following thought crossed my mind:

    Years ago when maintaining  KY-26 cryptographic equipment, 
(my AFSC was 306mop0) brave souls used to bring up encrypted channels
"blind" to minimise time away from the poker game. Instead of changing 
the transmit side first and using the receive side to verify reception, 
we used to change both sides at once by taking a pre-established count 
to go "bravo india" and create a synchronized duplex connection. If we 
could communicate, we would know that it had worked (what was done if 
it did not is not disclosable but involved the butt end of a large 
screwdriver).

   Similarly, a couple of years ago I was talking to one of the major vendors
of "dynamic access control devices" about use to provide full encryption of all
traffic. Currently, the way such a system works is that when a login occurs,
the host sends out a multi-digit "challenge".  In my case, I enter the
challenge followed by a PIN into a card which then calculates a reply. I send
back the reply as a password that lets me into the system.

    What I postulated was that instead of sending the reply back to the 
host, it be fed into my laptop as the seed for encryption. The laptop
then sends a "bravo india" to the host telling it to start encryption.
Since the host knows what the reply should be, it uses that as its own
seed. If both sides are then able to communicate, they authenticate each
other simultaneously while providing full encryption of all following 
traffic.

    One of the major problems was loss of synch from line noise, but the
current crop of error-correcting modems has made such encryption not only
feasible but also easy and at whatever level (DES, RSA, ...) is desired.

Last month I sent to RISKs a copy of an article that appeared in the (UK)
Computer Weekly on 6 February which carried the headline "Experts warned CAA
before Airbus disaster". Attached is a letter, from the experts concerned,
complaining at this article. This letter was I understand published by Computer
Weekly on February 13, and has just been drawn to my attention. Despite the
delay, I suggest that it be included in RISKs, in view of the comments it makes
on the original article.

AIRBUS SOFTWARE IN THE CLEAR

We are the three BCS "software experts" who visited the CAA in January to
discuss the new draft standard for software in aircraft systems D0-178B.

We believe that it is misleading that you linked our technical visit to the CAA
to the subsequent A320 Airbus crash. There is no evidence of any fault in any
safety-critical software on the A320 Airbus crash. It is too early to know the
causes of the crash and irresponsible to imply that we were in any way trying
to "warn the CAA" about the A320.

Our concerns about the draft D0-178B are technical and relate to its inadequacy
as a basis for objective certification of the reliability of software in
airborne systems. All modern passenger aircraft contain safety-critical
software and our comments to the CAA did not relate to any specific aircraft.

The CAA received our comments constructively and readily agreed to pass each
criticism to the international team which is reviewing the draft standard.

			WAR GAMES II
			    or
	How I Learned To Start Worrying and Hate The Bomb

[posted to comp.risks; an incomplete version previously went to other groups]

   Some of my friends call me an `improbability vortex' --- the kind of person
weird stuff just naturally happens around.  Occasionally I manage to to forget
why; my life doesn't seem bizarre to *me*.  Then, something happens to remind
me...

   Wednesday, March 25 1992: a fairly ordinary day in the life of Eric Raymond,
Boy Hacker.  Shower, read netnews, phone calls, some revision on the clone
hardware buyer's guide I've been working on for comp.unix.sysv386.  Will the
top ten vendors go for my idea of a competitive "UNIX Dream Machines Bake-Off"?
Hmm...well, Swan Tech wants to sign up, that's a start.  Ah, the mail's in.

   Riffle, riffle.  What's this?  Forwarded from MIT Press.  Something about
the book, no doubt...

   The Book: if you don't know it already, I edited a lexicon called
_The_New_Hacker's_Dictionary_  (MIT Press, 1991, ISBN 0-262-68069-6).  It's
all about hacker language and folklore.  Sold 14,000 copies in its first
seven months, got rave reviews everywhere, good stuff like that.  Got my
first nut-case letter about a month back --- always heard that was supposed
to happen to authors.  Some of the fallout has been weird.  Ouch, fallout ---
*bad* choice of words.  Back to our story.

   Hm.  From ISPNews.  INFOSecurity Product News.  Eh?  Never heard of them;
sounds like some trade rag for professional paranoids.  Computer form on the
inside; addressed to ERIC RAYMOND EDITOR, THE MIT PRESS, MASS INST OF
TECHNOLOGY, CAMBRIDGE MA 02142.  I see what happened; the Press's editorial
address miscegenated with my book credit in someone's mailing-list software,
and some clerical droid at the Press didn't look at content and forwarded
a piece of mail that should have stayed in-house.

   What we've got here is, oh, yeah, must be a report from the magazine's
bingo card.  Reader service; they circle numbers, you get a bunch of product
info requests.  OK, who wants to know about my book?  Maybe I'll give them
a surprise and answer it myself.  They probably all think the book is a how-to
manual for crackers.  Damn all journalists for what they did to the word
"hacker", anyhow...

   There were four.  First one:

   DAVID CARGILL SYSTEMS A
   GUARDIAN LIFE INS
   STE 201
   888 SEVENTH AVE
   NEW YORK         NY 10106

   Oh, boring, I thought to myself.  Actually he turned out not to be; I spoke
with him, later, and the guy turns out to be an old UNIX hand who, when I
explained what the book is really about, cheerfully expatiated on Cargill's
Theory of Fat Electrons.

   See, Con Edison sucks its line current out of the big generators with a pair
of coil taps located near the top of the dynamo.  When the normal tap brushes
get dirty, they take 'em off line to clean up, and use special auxilliary
taps on the *bottom* of the coil.  Now (sez Cargill) this is a problem,
because when they do that they get not ordinary or `thin' electrons, but the
fat'n'sloppy electrons that are heavier and so settle to the bottom of the
generator.  These flow down ordinary wires OK, but when they have to turn a
sharp corner (like in an IC via) they get stuck.  This is what causes computer
glitches.

   I laughed, said "You sound like a man who wants to hear about {quantum
bogodynamics}" and directed him to the on-line version of the book at prep.
Back to our story...

   Next guy...

   BRADLEY H EDWARDS  SEC SPE
   SECURITY-SAFETY
   CONSULTS
   PO BOX 536 
   TOPEKA            KS 66601

Well, the phone number attached to this one was out of service.  Security
Specialist, eh?  For sure he's got the cracker/hacker bug on the brain.  Then
my eyeballs tripped over the third address

   PAMELA D MILLER CHIEF
   USSPACE COM
   STOP 4
   J2C/SS0-C
   CHEYENNE MTN AFB  CO 80914

and I went into the mental equivalent of TILT TILT TILT.  Now, any of you who
ain't congenital idiots raised in a rain barrel somewhere on the butt-end of
nowhere will already have decoded that address to "U.S. Space Command, Cheyenne
Mountain Air Force Base".  Yeah, that's right.  NORAD; the big tunnel complex
under the mountain from which they be plannin' to fight World War III if it
ever goes down.  Huge walls of blinkenlights, 30-foot-thick blast doors,
"We could tell you, sir, but then we'd have to kill you", the whole weird trip.
Cornpone accents with their fingers on the pulse of the Apocalypse.

   Oh, *man*, I said to myself.  I have to talk to this woman.  I haven't
forgotten the nationwide media flap after _War_Games_ came out.  You remember,
that silly movie where the kid with the voice-controlled IMSAI (snort) cracks
into NORAD's computers and accidentally damn near starts a nuclear war?  God
damn; I'll bet the plot of that sucker is seared into the collective psyche of
every security officer at Cheyenne Mountain, they probably screen the video
every couple months just to keep the newbies on their toes.

   What kind of hideous Federal heat could land on me if PAMELA D MILLER has
hacker/cracker confusion on the brain?  I imagine some steel-eyed amazon in a
blue suit exuding grim determination to Nip This Menace In The Bud.  *Bad*
scene for a guy who is, after all, better known in some circles for practising
witchcraft and stone anarchist-loony politics than for The Book.  Yiiiii ...
visions of sinister limos and Men In Black pulling up to my front porch.  "We
want to ask you a few questions, sir."  So I called my editor Terri and Guy
Steele (credited coauthor) and told them all the proceedings so far.  Nervous
laughter all around.  Lugubrious jokes.

   I need to convince this woman and her unknown masters that I'm a *harmless*
lunatic.  Time to track PAMELA D to her lair. (Yes.  Think of her that way,
Pamela D., like one of those impossible anonymous synthetic blondes in an
upscale skin magazine.  "Well, I'm into sailing Sunfishes and I really like
kids, you know?".  Good.  A *much* less threatening mental tableau.)  I limber
up my phoning fingers and call the number blazoned above her address.

   &lt;click&gt; &lt;sputter&gt; "NORAD operator ten.  What extension?"
   Gulp.  "Uh, I'm trying to reach Pamela D. Miller?  I got a product
information query from her."
   "Do you have an extension, sir?"
   "Um, no I don't.  Just this number.  And her address." I reel it off.
   "Try the base locator at Peterson, sir.  554-4020."
   "Thanks", I said, and hung up."

   Ohhh-kay.  NORAD for sure.  Hail Eris! PAMELA D's hanging out somewhere
under a couple of cubic miles of rock, likely in some cramped little office
with 1950s-era furniture and walls painted institutional puke-green.  And an
old-style black phone. (How long has it been since you've seen a black phone?)
(Trust me, this is what the military version of bureaucratic rabbit warrens
looks like.)  Or maybe at some gleaming console watching telemetry from all
those KH-11s we're supposed to pretend don't exist.  Hah.  Heads up, Pammy;
constructive chaos is about to enter your life.  All hail Discordia!

   This is about where things started to get really Kafkaesque.  The base
locator is their directory information desk.  I ask for Pamela D. Miller's
extension and get 3247 (remember that number).  I call it.  Some guy who sounds
exactly like Andy Griffith answers: "&lt;something unintelligible&gt; Morrow", I
say I'm looking for Pamela D. Miller and he says "You want 3427".

   O.K.  I call 3427.  Busy signal.  Bummer.  The thrill of the hunt having
took hold, I feel rather frustrated.  I go off and do other things for fifteen
minutes or so --- polishing the draft rules for the Dream Machines Bake-Off.
I call again.  Busy signal.  Bummer again.

   Lunch, some code-bashing, and about six or seven cycles of this later I
begin to suspect evil things.  Either this woman spends more continuous time on
the phone than your average Hollywood lawyer or I've got a wrong number.  Or
she doesn't actually exist.  In your typical government agency she could have
died with the phoneset in her hand in 1974 and nobody'd have got around to
noticing it was off the hook yet.  On the other hand, *somebody* had to fill
out that product-bingo card.

   On my next try, when the operator says "Busy, sir." I explain that the
number's been continuously so for several hours, and this seems unlikely.
   "I'll check for an alternate.  &lt;pause&gt;  Try 3052."
   Right.  No one answers at 3052.  I hang up and answer some email.  I try
again.  No answer.  Again, fifteen minutes later.  No answer.  Oy vey.  Isn't
this where I got on?

   So I try 3247 (the *original* number) again.  Busy.  Foo.  I call the base
locator people again and explain that there appears to be some confusion in
the air.  Is it 3247 or 3427?  And what's with this 3052 jazz?
   "I have 3247 listed, sir.  I'll double-check.  &lt;pause&gt; It says 3427 on
her card."  Silence.
   "Well, which is it?" I say.
   "3427.  But it says 3247 on the roster."
   "Well", I say with enormous gentleness, "don't you think you ought to
consider *fixing* it?"
   The silence of blank incomprehension on the other end.  Never ask a droid
to exceed its programming; it wastes your time and annoys the droid.
   I hang up.  And try 3427 again.  Busy... 

   A few cycles later I conclude this isn't working; it's time to drop back
and punt.  I consider everything I know about bureaucracies, call the locator
people and confidently ask for the US Space Command main administration number.

   "Um, there doesn't seem to be one, sir.  Oh, wait, you can try this one."
She gives out with a string of numbers.
   "Can you transfer me?"
   "Stand by."  (...only in the military)
   &lt;click&gt;
   "AF Space Command."
   I go into my spiel about PAMELA D. and her inquiry and her address.
   "Uh, that's a Cheyenne Mountain address. Can't help you with that."
   "Um", I said, "this *is* US Space Command?"
   "No sir, this is AF Space Command.  Separate organization.  We're on the
base; they're under the mountain."
   "Two *separate* Space Commands?" I said. "Why two?"
   I can't tell you what he said, because I didn't understand the resulting
freshet of bureaucratese.  A couple of requests for clarification just got
me in deeper.  I caught something about "functional separation" and strings
of building numbers about as intelligible as so many Egyptian hieroglyphs.
   Struggling my way out of this verbal morass, I said, "Well, where do
I go from here?"
   "Lemme see if I can send you over to someone that'll help", he says,
and gives me another number.

   It's mid-afternoon now and I'm starting to lose it.  Fifteen hundred miles
from these people and I feel as thoroughly trapped in their maze as though I
was physically under that bloody mountain.  Theseus with no Ariadne and a
nuclear-security Minotaur lurking around the next bend.  (I like my mixed
metaphors shaken, not stirred, thank you.)  PAMELA D, where are you?

   But I call this guy's number and get the most human-sounding voice yet.
"Base information", it says.  Young, female, black, rather pretty if that lilt
isn't out of sync with her looks.  Quite a change from the depersonalized
midwestern/southern whitebread twangs I've been hearing.  She listens
sympathetically as I recount my tale of woe.

   "Well, let's see what I can do for you."  &lt;pause&gt;  "That's strange.
I have no listing for a Pamela Miller."
   If there were any justice in the world there'd have been eerie, sinister
music on the soundtrack just then.  Slowly building towards the Moment of
Discovery.  Wait for it.  At the time, a slight but definite premonitory
chill ran down my spine.
   "Well.  Does this mail code mean anything to you?  J2C/SSO-C?"
   "Yes sir, it means she's in J2 section."
   "O.K., what does J2 do?  What does that say about her job?"
    Long pause. "She's in intel, sir."

   Jangling chords and screaming brass from the unseen orchestra.  Oh, *great*.
All the paranoid fantasies that'd been slowly graying out as I threaded my way
through the labyrinth sprang back to full and colorful life.  The
*intelligence* group.  Better and better.  I thought about buzzing Guy and
asking him if he was on good terms with any of his overseas relatives.
 
   "A spook!" I said, and laughed rather hollowly.  "No wonder I've had trouble
reaching her.  What do I try next?"
   Perhaps ominously, the woman did not elect to contradict my choice of
terms.  "I'll see if I can reach anyone at J2 who knows her", she said.  Long
pause.  Long, long pause.  Background noises; people coughing, murmured
speech, file doors banging.
   Finally, anticlimax.  "I found her. That's 2nd Lt. Miller, sir; I don't know
why she'd have "CHIEF" after her name.  Her extension is 3433, but she's on
detached duty and won't be back till Monday."

   And there you have it.  It's 2:39 the following morning and I look like
an out-take from the "Nightfly" cover --- but if I disappear mysteriously,
y'all will *know* where to start.

			TO BE CONTINUED...

(Interlude, Friday morning.  My father reads an uploaded version of the above
and asks if I intend to post it.  Upon learning that I already have, he soberly
advises against offending the entire U.S. Air Force.  "After all," he observes,
"they could drop a smart bomb down your chimney."  Gee.  Thanks, Dad.)

Monday morning, March 30th: Once more into the breach --- and Pamela D. Miller
is real!  Got her first time.  Neither amazon nor bimbo, of course, but a
bright and generous-minded lady with a sense of humor.  And a *1st* lieutenant
now.  She turns out to be (no less) chief of computer security at NORAD; and
(mirabile dictu) she *knows* the difference between a hacker and a cracker.
*Vast* sigh of relief --- no snatch teams in my future and I can unstop my
chimney now.

She was hip enough to laugh when I told her something of my travails last
Wednesday, laugh harder when I told her the title of this posting, and
hardest when I volunteered to autograph her copy of TNHD with an inscription
reading "I will not start World War III.  I will not start World War III.  
I will not start World War III...."

She's not allowed to have a direct phone line, much less an Internet address
(think about it) so this mini-epic is going to have to go to her by snail-mail.
But I've been invited to tour NORAD and (yes, it is possible) visit the War
Room if I'm ever out Colorado way...

				---

RISKS moral.  Gotta have a RISKS moral for this story.  Well, there are a
couple.  The trivial one is, watch out for aliasing problems if you ever edit a
book; we've only got one word for several different kinds of `editor', and that
high-level difference may not be visible to computers or the clerical help.

A less trivial one is "Don't be paranoid; it encourages paranoia in others.".
I had fun writing the above; I've always enjoyed the mad-genius-on-speed style
as practised by Robert Anton Wilson, Tom Robbins, Hunter Thompson at. al. ---
but if Lt. Miller were that wiggy or I'd really approached her with The Fear
dripping from my every vocal overtone, things could've got ugly (hah! little
did she suspect that I kept her on the phone only long enough for my insidious
infrasonic acoustic virus to escape from her earpiece and set up *sinister
resonances* in any nearby electronic equipment...)

The least trivial of all is that *human* networking is still our most effective
tool for some important kinds of risk reduction.  Mutual trust, when you can
establish it, is the best security.  You guess; am I more or less worried now
about the risks inherent in having something like NORAD exist, having got
a little acquainted with Lt. Miller?  Are *you* more or less worried after
reading this story?  And, which is the real point, does this posting make it
more or *less* likely that someone with the requisite skills would actually
try to crack NORAD?

When I read that

	"[The] Pentagon disagrees that deploying a space-
	and ground-based defense system poses significant
	technical challenges. The complexity of the software
	required to coordinate Star Wars, for instance, is no
	more daunting than programs that control nuclear
	reactors, it says."

I certainly breathed a sigh of relief.  Having had a look at both types of
programmes, I am comforted by the impression that the Pentagon employee who
stated that opinion had never seen either type of software.

	The NSA and the Software Publishers' Association appear to have
	reached an agreement that would allow some exports of cryptographic
	software, as long as the keys are constrained to be sufficiently
	short.  The net effect is a slight but potentially useful
	improvement over what was previously exportable.

Umm -- according to the NY Times article on the subject, things are
actually a bit murkier.  The details of the algorithm are supposed
to be secret.  (How long that will work is debatable, of course.
In fact, it isn't even particularly debatable; I think we know the
answer.)  Naturally, a number of folks are quite upset about that
aspect.

	Now that NSA and RSA have come a little closer, we need to
	bring in BSA (the Boy Scouts of America).  Be prepared!
	Imagine, a merit badge for cryptography?

Actually, they do have one.  Or rather, Way Back When, the Cub Scouts had a
something or other in cryptography.  Being innocent of the distinction between
a ``code'' and its key at the time (and for that matter, of the distinction
between a code and a cipher), I persuaded the Powers That Were that I had
fulfilled that requirement *25* times, by coming up with *25* different Caesar
ciphers...

Just an opinion - I think financial competitiveness is far more important than
not being able to read crypto to the US at this time.

I can purchase an RSA on a smart card from Phillips in the EC, but I cannot
sell a slower RSA for the PC to people in EC.  What this seems to say is that
they can have it, but I can't sell it to them - or in other words - they get
the money from our research!!!

And then there is the old wire tapping thing.  As far as I am concerned, it is
the FBI's business to find a way to read my mail if they care to, but it is not
my job to help them do it.  That's why I use an RSA whenever I want to send
something private.

          Which brings me to the newest development at ASP.  We have decided to
do all further crypto development oversees.  This is because if we do it here,
it's against the law to export it, but if we do it there, we can still import
it and sell it here.  Any such policy, if it is to be effective, must also
restrict import - otherwise, the financial motivations will move all crypto
oversees.  This is of course happening.  Want an example?

          At the 5th virus conference, the people from the EC cheered when they
heard that virus defenses are export controlled.  In my case, my EC competitors
get a 6 week advantage over me in everything they do, because each new version
has to go through paperwork at the US government that takes this long.  As a
result, I have moved my further virus defense development to the EC.  They get
the money in stead of the US getting it, but I get a smaller piece of a bigger
pie, which earns me more money in the long run.

          How long will it be before we give up the little leadership we have
in information protection?  Not long!  All over the EC and in the far east and
in Australia, there are research groups forming at universities for computer
security researchers.  They get funding and tenure, and even publish articles.
In the US, there is lip service, and a few universities offer a course or two,
but you cannot find more than 2 experts at any US university!

          So I think the real risk is that in the name of maintaining national
security, we are giving up our leadership in security!

                    Have a nice day - FC

I just listened to a local radio station talk show concerning proposals
to use nuclear weapons to change the orbit of asteroids heading towards the 
earth, and while the discussion was factual, it poses a long term risk on
science in this country. The discussion was by the radio commentator and a
physicist from a local university. The general tone of the show and the
facts presented were:

1. Neither took the threat very seriously and were very flippant about the
whole process.
2. Rationale for such proposals seemed to be the large number of
(unemployed?) nuclear scientists needing a new threat to work against
since the Soviet threat is disappearing.
3. Congress held a hearing on the potential for such a collision with an
asteroid.
4. NASA held two workshops to discuss this problem.
5. There is a non-zero probability of such a collision actually
happening.
6. The last big collision of an asteroid with the earth was about 65
million years ago, anything that large is probably already known, we
will have several near misses first before any collision, giving from 
several decades to several centuries advance warning before such a 
collision.

The risk here (besides the obvious one of having the earth blow up)? 
There is a lack of knowledge by the public on risks, 
safety, and the costs and tradeoffs of increasing safety (and decreasing 
risk), especially given the flippant tone of both radio commentators. 
It was probably reasonable for Congress to hold such a hearing
since the potential damage would be catastrophic. It probably was
reasonable for NASA to hold a workshop to discuss the risks of such a
collision and potential solutions. Given the extremely small probability
of such a collision and the high costs of preventing it, the process
should have probably stopped there. However, it is important for the public
(and scientists and Congress, even) to at least study such issues.
The next time some issue like this comes up, there may be a tendency
to dismiss it before there is any scientific discussion of its reality.

I am writing a book about software bugs.  Today I was working on a chapter
featuring development disasters.  The royalty statement for a previous book
arrived.  It is several days late, in a big envelope with a glossy brochure and
a form letter that begins:

"Dear Author:

"We are very pleased to provide you with your royalty statement for the current
period.  This new statement is enhanced in form and content and is the initial
statement generated by the recently implemented Simon &amp; Schuster Royalty
Accounting System."

The letter ends:

"Any major system implementation involves a transition and refinement period.
We anticipate that you may have issues that require attention, and we are
prepared to address your concerns in an expeditious manner.

If you have any questions, please call our Royalty Department toll free
number..."

The check is made out to Lauren Carter.  Carter?  From Wiener?
How did they do that?  It's not even close!

I called the toll-free number.  A human -- an agreeable and intelligent one --
is still in the loop at 5:30 P.M. EST.  He promises to straighten it out.
But the first thing he says to me is, "You wouldn't believe how much
they spent on this system!"

Sometimes life is too perfect.

   [Look for Lauren's Trip Report on the panels and invited talks at
   SIGSOFT '91, which is just going to press in the ACM SIGSOFT Software

   the proceedings of that conference are out as SEN vol 16 no 5, December

Below is the full version of a letter I have sent to various agencies and
representatives in New Hampshire.  In summary, some person was stopped for
traffic violations, and gave a false name and address and no other personal
identification. The violations were unpaid and unchallenged and so were
recorded in the given name without that person's knowledge.  License suspension
proceedings were initiated, but notice was sent to the false address since the
Department of Safety had updated their computer records with the erroneous
information.  Eventually, the innocent person was stopped and arrested for
driving without a license.

An open letter to the Department of Safety, police officers, judiciary, and
legislative representatives of New Hampshire

Dear People:
                         
A few months ago, an acquaintance of mine was stopped by a police officer for a
traffic violation.  According to a check of their driving record, their license
had been suspended, so the officer arrested them.  It turns out this person had
been the victim of a fraud, and the Department of Safety, the police, and the
courts made mistakes which compounded the consequences.  The charges have been
dropped and the Department of Safety records partially corrected, but court
records remain in error, and there are lessons to be learned from this
incident.  (I will not name the victim here, but appropriate parties, such as
officials who wish to correct records, can get this information by contacting
the author.)

Fraud occurred on three prior occasions, which the Department, the police, and
the courts failed to catch.  Some person was stopped for traffic violations.
This person apparently did not present any identification to the police officer
who stopped them, but they gave a misspelling of the victim's name as their own
and gave the address of a relative of the victim as their own address.
(According to New Hampshire statutes, a person stopped for a traffic violation
need not have their license with them but is supposed to present their driver's
license at the peace officer's office within 24 hours.)

On three occasions, this person must have failed to present identification
within the allotted time, yet there was apparently no follow-up investigation
by any of the officers involved.  The records of the violations were sent to
the Department of Safety, which accepted them as correct in spite of the fact
that there was no physical evidence at all that the person owning the affected
records was in fact the person at fault.  The Department matched the misspelled
name with that of our victim and updated their database with the new, incorrect
address.  The violations were placed in the victim's records.  Further,
proceedings were begun to suspend the victim's license.

Notices about the violations and the suspension proceedings were sent to the
incorrect address, where it was ignored.  It seems to me to have been unwise to
ignore official letters rather than forward or return them.  I guess that
because they were arriving at the incorrect address, they might have been
presumed to be spurious and unimportant.  Regardless, the fact that they were
ignored is not in any way the fault of the victim.

There are several lessons to be learned.  It is improper to place damaging data
in a person's record when there is no supporting evidence -- no record of
violations should have been placed in the victim's record nor should any court
have made a finding of guilt until there were actual physical evidence.  There
was no driver's license, no signature, no fingerprint, no match of vehicle
records, no photograph, and no witness who knew the person.  Even the police
officers who made the stops could testify only that the person said they were
the victim, not that they actually were.  As a society, we must recognize that
if we rely on databases to provide important information, then we are assuming
a great risk if incorrect data enters the database.  There must be rigid
controls to allow only accurate information into the database.  Without these
controls, the database cannot be considered accurate, and it is wrong to rely
on it.  An insecure database is not a proper basis for making arrests or
otherwise penalizing human beings.

Another lesson is that the Department and police officers should be wary of
fraud.  When a person fails to present proper identification within the
allotted 24 hours, this must be followed up by investigation.  It must not be
followed up by mechanically completing the paperwork to record a violation.
Justice requires evidence and due process, and mechanical processing of
violations provides neither to our citizens.  Further, when a person fails to
present identification during a traffic stop, the officer should secure some
other evidence of their identity, perhaps by taking a photograph for later
examination.

Finally, there is a lesson to be learned about database records and privacy.
Although the Department of Safety keeps these records, we should not consider
the Department to be the owner of the records.  Each record is owned by the
person whose record it is, and the owner has a right to know what is in the
record and when changes are made.  The owner has a right to control their
record to ensure that it is accurate.  In this incident, the Department
accepted a change to the records without checking with the owner to verify the
change.  This is like a bank allowing anybody to walk in and sign a new
signature card for your account and then letting the person withdraw funds from
your account.  That is a serious flaw.  Whenever any change is made to a
person's record, the Department should send a complete notice to that person.
When the change includes an address change, the notice should be sent to the
former address.

I would also like to add that I am appalled that any court, magistrate, or
other judiciary official would make a finding of fault against a person not
only without evidence but also without properly serving notice to that person
at their true address.  Such administration of traffic laws is a travesty that
subverts basic principles of justice in this country.

There is one good note.  After the arrest, a letter was sent to the Department
of Safety requesting correction of the mistakes.  The Department responded
extremely quickly -- by phone the day after the letter was placed in the mail.
This is typical of the wonderful service the Department usually provides; they
are to be commended for doing an excellent job on the whole.  I only hope the
Department can provide the same quality of service in preventing mistakes like
this from happening in the first place.

On the other hand, the Attorney General's office has not acted so responsibly.
The victim has managed to identify the guilty person and locate a witness to
the fraud, yet the Attorney General's office has refused to become involved.


                      Recommendations

I call upon the Department of Safety to rectify its record-keeping procedures
so that records cannot be altered without the knowledge of their owner and that
incorrect information is detected.

I call upon police officers to be wary of fraud, to follow up with
investigation when identification is not presented, and to regard their
statements on official documents and to courts as testimony.  On this latter
point, observe that a police officer who has not examined identification cannot
truthfully testify that they witnessed a certain person committing a traffic
offense.  The most they can testify to is that they witnessed somebody claiming
to be a certain person committing an offense, and this distinction should be
made clear in all official documents and court testimony.

I call upon judiciary officials not to make any finding of fault unless there
is physical evidence and to ensure that the rights of our citizens to due
process and to confront their accusers are fully protected.  In particular, no
judiciary official should accept the presentation of a summons to an
unidentified person as proper service of a summons.

I call upon the elected representatives of our citizens to ensure that the
above tasks are accomplished.  This state and this country are sorely lacking
in data protection laws.  Every day, citizens become further bogged down in a
morass of databases containing information about them they cannot examine,
control, or correct.  People are steadily losing the ability to control their
own lives.

You, our representatives, must fix this.  You must protect people from
wrongdoing by faceless bureaucratic machinations, and you must ride herd on the
enforcement and judiciary branches of our government to ensure that our rights
to due process and fair trials are protected.

             			Sincerely,
  				(signed)
  			    	Eric Postpischil

&gt;&gt;     Unfortunately, correct.  The situation is roughly analogous to having
&gt;&gt; to post signs saying that there are TV cameras monitoring your condo.

I must be misunderstanding you.  The building I'm in (the student center at
MIT) has a bank branch and a grocery store.  Both have cameras, and neither
have signs announcing them, I just checked.  Neither conceal their cameras.  Is
a condo special?

&gt;&gt;     Very true.  For example, an "alleged penetrator" (prosecuting attorneys
&gt;&gt; prefer to avoid the H(acker) word as "too warm and fuzzy") was monitored
&gt;&gt; while committing (what I'd consider to be) electronic breaking and entry.
&gt;&gt; He got off because he hadn't been warned that he was being monitored.

So, if someone breaks into my house, and I managed to follow him around, and
watch him steal stuff, is that information not admissible in court because I
never tapped him on the shoulder and said "don't mind me, I'm just watching
you"?  Should I have a sign on my apartment announcing that "By entering these
premises, you consent to the possibility that the owner might actually watch
you and file charges if you are breaking and entering."?

Subject: In-Re: Re: U.S. Dept of Justice Rulings about Keystroke Captu
 
Apparently my dry wit was a tad too desiccated, sorry.  Condos _do_ have some
special laws (a condo fee isn't rent nor is it a mortgage payment), but
surveillance isn't one of them.

I was giving a deliberately absurd, but all too real, example.  There _ARE_
legal requirements relative to surveillance; what depends on where you are and
what/who you're "surveillancing" (if "there ain't no word that can't be
verbed", then such verbs can certainly be gerunded, right?).

Here, you may have a vacation-behind-bars-ish requirement to post 
such a sign; there, there may be no LEGAL requirement, but you post 
a warning to get a better return on your effort and scare off the 
badguys; (and everywhere, the Communication Cops want to get into 
your knickers?).
 
&gt; So, if someone breaks into my house, and I managed to follow him ...

If you do as you said, it's your word against his, and assuming he left no
physical evidence, I doubt that you'd even get the case to court.  Of course,
if you made the alleged burglar so nervous that he tripped on the throw-rug,
_YOU_ could be prosecuted under the anti-"deathtrap" laws.  (You did know that
you can't leave a deadfall inside your doorway, didn't you?)  By the way, I
wrote "prosecuted", not "convicted", but the way that juries are "instructed"
these days, I wouldn't rule it out.

&gt; Should I have a sign on my apartment ...  &gt; 
 
Given the current crazy state of our laws, it wouldn't hurt.  Let me point out
that I didn't write this mess!

I guess I'm getting cranky in my old age (54).  But I grow weary of the
energetic youngsters (regardless of age) who want to patent every new
toy - even if it ain't new!  Like "...the first ever machine independent
benchmarks..." hyped in one computer magazine; turned out they were
NOT comparable between PC's and Mac's, nor DOS and UNIX-like hosts;
i.e., one could not compare results, to help in a purchase decision.
NOW *that's* REAL independence!  (Not to mention that I was doing
machine independent benchmarks in 1967-68.)

Apple's claims about "look and feel" of the icon/mouse interface should
be faced down, in federal court, by a consortium of IBM, AT&amp;T, H-P, etc.
who graciously concede the icon/mouse interface to Apple - IF (and only
if) Apple will abandon the keyboard and command line interface, on the
ground that the plaintifs (IBM et al) got there first.

Imagine using any computer, without a keyboard, and without command lines,
even short ones - like single characters.  Pretty tough.

Now, I'm not picking on Apple.  (I use a Mac II.)  It's just that their "look
and feel" suit has gotten more press than most others.  Squelching it once and
for all might make other frivolous suits more rare.

Excerpted from TidBITS#114/01-Apr-92, source: BackData, info@backdata.com

   [Discussion of problems with existing backup systems deleted.  People
   either don't do them or don't do them well.]

   So the BackData guys realized that the best possible option is for
   all the data on your hard disk to be backed up automatically at
   night to another physical place. Short of hiring elves, the only
   way to do this is via modem, but with some of the current high-
   speed modems and sophisticated pieces of software out there, they
   figured that it would be possible with a bunch of Macs and a lot
   of storage devices.

   ....In terms of software, you just need AppleTalk Remote Access and
   Retrospect 1.3, which can back up any volume mounted on its desktop.

   I haven't tried this yet, but the theory is that at some point in
   the middle of the night one of their backup Macs calls your Mac
   (which had better be on). A simple macro ensures that all your
   volumes are mounted read-only on their systems, and then
   Retrospect goes to work, backing up only the files that have
   changed according to specific selectors that you set up
   previously. This allows you to avoid backing up your System file
   all the time, even though it will almost always be marked as
   modified whether or not you've added any fonts or sounds. Once the
   backup is done, another macro copies the catalog file to your hard
   disk (so you can see what was backed up), dismounts your volumes,
   and disconnects the modems to finish the process.

   Retrieval is a slightly stickier issue. Essentially, the process
   works in reverse, with one important exception. You call them and
   make sure your DAT tape is in the drive of a Mac at a certain
   phone number. After your Mac calls the storage Mac, you then run
   Retrospect over the remote connection....

   I expressed some doubt about the reliability of cobbling together
   these off-the-shelf programs, and the BackData folks admitted that
   they're in the process of writing several dedicated programs that
   will automate the process much more cleanly, one for DOS and one
   for the Mac. Their programs didn't sound as though they'd be as
   flexible as Retrospect, but would work much more cleanly over the
   phone lines, especially with restoring data. Interesting concept
   this, and one which could eventually go national with an 800
   number. It's basically a form of insurance, but one which could
   save a lot of important data in the event of disaster.

   [Summary of costs deleted.  Initial startup fee (includes hardware)
   and hourly connect fee during backups.]

The risks are numerous.  Among them:  granting "late night" dial-in access to
home and office PC file systems, physical and electronic security at the remote
site, authorization for backup restores, and backup data being held by a
commercial company that lives on profits and is vulnerable to bankruptcy or
hostile takeover.

I saw Bob Frankston at the coming-out party for PBS's new series, "The Machine
that Changed the World" that begins next Monday, and we both thought you should
consider posting it to the Risks Forum.  Perhaps it is risky not to see how our
industry is being popularized for the mass media.  In any event, credit for the
following -- this was passed on to me by my brother, who works at DEC.  P.S.
Another risk: the title of the series is the same as that of a recent book
about the _auto_.

PBS COMPUTER SERIES

The Machine That Changed The World 
 
On Monday evening, April 6, 1992 at 9:00 PM EST, and on successive Mondays
until May 4, PBS will present "The Machine that Changed the World," 5 programs
on the history of the electronic computer and its impact on society.

Produced by WGBH Boston (makers of NOVA) and the BBC, and with major funding
provided by ACM and Unisys, the series highlights the fifty year revolution in
computing and information technology -- a revolution that is still going on.

Beginning with World War II research and the ENIAC, which was co-invented by
J. Presper Eckert and the late John Mauchly (a founder of ACM). "The Machine
that Changed the World" follows the unpredictable course of information
technology from the room sized data processing centers of the 1960's to desktop
personal computers of the 1980's to virtual reality of the 1990's, describing
events that have altered society in profound and totally unexpected ways.

Check your local PBS listings for broadcast times on the
following Monday evenings:
 
o April 6 - "Giant Brains", covers the wartime events that led to the 1946
debut of ENIAC, the world's first general purpose electronic computer.

o April 13 - "Inventing the Future", examines how the computer rose from
obscurity to become the engine that powers business throughout the world.

o April 20 - "The Paperback Computer", explores how computers became small,
affordable and easy to use.
 
o April 27 - "The Thinking Machine", focuses on the most ambitious goal of all
- creating a computer that will vie with humans in intelligence.

o May 4 - "The World at Your Fingertips" looks at the social revolution wrought
by computers - and the price we pay.

In article &lt;1992Apr3.062551.7306@sequent.com&gt;, jjb@sequent.com (Jeff Berkowitz)
&gt; [...]
&gt; The article states "...this particular Patriot battery had been
&gt; running continuously for about 100 hours...[and]...had built up
&gt; a timing lag of 0.3433 second."  This timing error was sufficient
&gt; to shift the "range gate" enough to cause the system to disregard
&gt; the Scud.
&gt;
&gt; My "comp.realtime" question: what algorithm in the Patriot system
&gt; would cause an ABSOLUTE time variation like this to change a
&gt; relative computation, like the predicted course of the incoming
&gt; missile?

I just received my copy of the US General Accounting Office's "Report to the
Chairman, Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight, Committee on Science,
Space, and Technology, House of Representatives: Patriot Missile Defense -
Software Problem Led to System Failure at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia" (phew!)

Since I can't find a copyright notice on it anywhere, I'll quote the
appropriate paragraph:

"The range gate's prediction of where the Scud will next appear is a function
of the Scud's known velocity and the time of the last radar detection.
Velocity is a real number that can be expressed as a whole number and a decimal
(e.g., 3750.2563...miles per hour).  Time is kept continuously by the system's
internal clock in tenths of seconds but is expressed as an integer or whole
number (e.g., 32, 33, 34...).  The longer the system has been running, the
larger the number representing time.  To predict where the Scud will next
appear, both time and velocity must be expressed as real numbers.  Because of
the way the Patriot computer performs its calculations and the fact that its
registers are only 24 bits long, the conversion of time from an integer to a
real number cannot be any more precise than 24 bits.  This conversion results
in a loss of precision causing a less accurate time calculation.  The effect of
this inaccuracy on the range gate's calculation is directly proportional to the
target's velocity and the length of the the system has been running.
Consequently, performing the conversion after the Patriot has been running
continuously for extended periods causes the range gate to shift away from the
center of the target, making it less likely that the target, in this case a
Scud, will be successfully intercepted."

Interestingly, when the Israelies were running their Patriot systems, they
studied the heck out of them, and noticed this problem after merely 8 hours of
operation.  (8 hours corresponds to a range-gate shift of 55 meters; 100 hours
corresponds to 678 meters.)  They sent this data back, and the Americans
responded with something like, "This was designed for the European theater,
where it would be run for a few hours before being moved.  Who in his right
mind would run a system continuously for eight hours?  Or more?"  They did
write a software patch to fix the problem, but it took two weeks to arrive in
Saudi, because of transport difficulties.  It arrived the day after the
failure.

I found Eric Raymond's account of NORAD telephone indirection amusing but not
at all unusual -- I recently encountered a more elaborate runaround in dealing
with the county bureaucracy that manages the bus system here.  Eric is lucky
that he did not get the treatment that we used when I had an office at C.I.A.
headquarters.  There we answered the phone with "Hello" and, unless the calling
party immediately named a person who shared the office, we were programmed to
hang up without another word.

As one who helped design the initial computer system that went into the
Cheyenne Mountain facility, and who much later provided some input to the
screenwriters who wrote "War Games," I will assert that there is less there
than meets the eye (and imagination).  That facility was intended to integrate
and control a number of other so-called command- control-communication (C3)
systems, but suffered from the same fundamental design flaws as its
predecessors.  (See my C3 series in RISKS that I suspended two years ago, but
that I intend to resume as soon as I get time.)

Let me acknowledge that the Cheyenne Mountain facility is not totally useless.
If a nuclear holocaust does occur and if the evironmental security systems
there function as advertised, the residents of that hole may have an
opportunity to repopulate the Earth after a time.

Fortunately, the even more elaborate and senseless proposal to develop a
successor system, dubbed the Strategic Defense Initiative by Ronald Reagan, now
seems to be fading away despite attempts to revive it as a Killer Meteorite
Initiative.

and he said:

	the virus-loaded thingie does or will soon exist, but it's certainly
not his next novel; in fact, it's a couple of thousand words that he refers to
as "the text," and it's poetry, accompanying "a bronze booklike object" that
weighs a bunch and contains etchings by Dennis Ashbaugh and a diskette with the
Gibson poem;

	the poem, if the software works the way it's intended to, will
self-destruct after a single reading ("but you can videotape it");

	this is all aimed at the art collector's market, and I get the
impression Gibson's part in it occurred as a favor to the artist;

	in re the draft dodger matter--he was never actually drafted but went
to Canada to evade the possibility; he says he would not claim the moral credit
that goes with being an actual draft dodger.

Brian Kantor's article about the zip codes being wrong on the addresses used in
an advertisement for a text processing package brought to mind another faked-up
advertisement that is potentially much RISKier - in COMPUTER LANGUAGE there is
a recurring advertisement for a software product that uses a compound bow with
an arrow as its illustration. Perhaps the intent is to indicate that the
product is high-tech, accurate, powerful, and easy to use (all of which might
be said of compound bows), but if you look closely you notice that the arrow is
on the wrong side of the bow, and could not possibly be actually nocked on the
bowstring. If the bow was loosed in this configuration, the most likely result
would be embarrassment on the part of the operator, but if the arrow were to
partially catch the string, it could do considerable damage to the operator
and/or anyone else around. The target, however, would not be exposed to
significant risk of being hit... and if I was the intended target of the
advertisement, I have to say that it was rather wide of the mark...

To put the risk more succinctly, it is important to get the details right in
your advertisements: people who notice lack of attention to detail in 
advertisements may well assume that this is indicative of the product as well.

I had assumed a couple of recent items would have been answered by someone
more informed than I but, since they haven't, let me offer my bit ...

Security v. Xerox Corp.'s PaperWorks

The March 30, 1992 issue of _InfoWorld_ (p.37) shows the top couple of
inches of the form that one uses to request stuff.  Right below a 'Please
do not write above this line' header is a SECURITY block. It has 26 boxes
across the page with a letter A-Z above each.  Soo, there is something ...

Imprecise Interrupts

As surprised as I was to hear that DEC's ALPHA chip may not return an interrupt
tagged to the instruction that caused it, I was even more concerned by the
subsequent discussion that seemed to imply that, since an IBM mainframe did
this years ago, it is probably OK.  As far as I know, the Unisys (Burroughs) A
Series has been pipelining in its higher-performance machines for years but it
has always reported an interrupt against the instruction that caused it. This
is despite, I believe, the possibility that it may have over a dozen
instructions concurrently in the pipe.

Not being a hardware person, I am left wondering: is it possible to properly
manage inter-instruction dependencies in the pipeline without being able to
track an interrupt to the instruction that caused it?  Wouldn't it be necessary
to track the offender so that one could determine the dependent instructions
that will also need to be cleaned out?  The bottom line is that just because it
has been done before doesn't mean it is OK to keep doing it (c.f. MicroSoft
Windows 3.1: just because NOT checking parameters has been done before doesn't
mean they should keep doing it!).

In <A HREF="/Risks/13.27.html">RISKS-13.27</A>, andrew@frip.wv.tek.com says "the only practical difference
between precise &amp; imprecise exceptions is that you can't report the PC of
the offending instruction when imprecise". I think this is overoptimistic:

To implement the default (denormalizing) mode of IEEE754/854 underflow
handling, most systems trap on underflow, and let the trap-handler
do the denormalizing. This becomes difficult in an imprecise-exception
environment, when the original operands may already have been overwritten
by the time the exception occurs (even if the "offending" instruction
can be determined).

Since a system that breaks IEEE defaults is obviously one that breaks
IEEE, this seems a real issue.

Over the past 5 years our little division has used the Premis accounting
software package.  About 3 years ago, Xerox bought our company, and has kind of
left us be our own little company.  We continued to use Premis software.

Last fall Xerox started cutting back, and was thinking of rolling our
accounting into Xerox's accounting, so we stopped paying support to Premis for
the software we were about to stop using.  Changes happen and our office moved.
During the move, the accounting PC lost its battery that saves the cmos ram
(its an original IBM AT).  Once I found what drive type it had, and reset the
date and time, and got everything running, the accounting guy tried his
software.  Well the software now says we are not licensed.

Thinking a simple phone call was all that it would take to get the license
going again, the Premis folks informed us there would be a fee, including all
the months of support we didn't pay for, but were still using (their
assumption).  Then when pressed, they claimed the software license was
"non-transferable", and since Xerox is now our company name, the software must
be re-licensed (Xerox had been sending them checks for most of 3 years, and
they never complained).

A more wizardly PC guy who works here looked at things, and found the Premis
software was on its own non-DOS partition, and the original Premis floppies
only contained a DOS program that can load this non-DOS partition.  The backup
procedures used here only backup DOS partitions (Premis charges extra for the
backup program, so someone decided we would use our own backup program).

Maybe these aren't risks, but they sure are dangerous to people not computer
wizards, in that no one had informed anyone that this was really special
software (non-DOS), using non-standard hardware (cmos ram), in ways not
intended.  What if some new piece of software had needed the same cmos ram to
store its license.

&gt;Finally, there is a lesson to be learned about database records and privacy.
&gt;Although the Department of Safety keeps these records, we should not consider
&gt;the Department to be the owner of the records.  Each record is owned by the
&gt;person whose record it is, and the owner has a right to know what is in the
&gt;record and when changes are made.  The owner has a right to control their...

It is a gross over-simplification to assert that because a record is
about me that I "own" it.  While I clearly have an interest in it, and
while the holder may have a responsibility to me to protect that
interest, that interest may be far short of ownership.

Ownership may be defined as the exclusive right to use.  This is the
definition that we usually have in mind when we talk about chattels.
With regard to real property, such ownership may be granted by the
sovereign and subject to eminent domain, but the definition still works
reasonably well.  Ownership of information is similar in that most of my
rights, for example copyrights, are granted by the sovereign or the
legislature.  Information is different in that some use of it by others
may not infringe my rights or intent.

However, if we were to use this definition of ownership and if we assert
that that ownership automatically or by default rests with the data
subject, then we would expect that all use of personal data would have
to be by delegation of the subject owner's rights.  Clearly this is not
the case and the driving license record and the driving license itself
are good examples to prove the point.

If under this definition I were the owner of my driving license record,
then the state would be able to use it only under a license from me.
Clearly that is not the case.  The record and its uses are authorized by
law.  It is kept at state expense for a legitimate state purpose.  While
some state laws do make explicit mention of the rights of the subject of
the data, most are silent.  None suggest that the state uses the record
at the sufferance of the subject.

Other examples are less clear.  A copy of the pay record is kept by the
the employer to fulfill his legal obligations to the employee, the
employee's bargaining agent, the state, and the owners; many of these
obligations he could not meet in the absence of such records.  They are
kept at his expense for a legitimate purpose.  While it may well be that
his right to keep such records is granted by the employee as part of the
employment agreement, I am not aware of any such agreement that speaks
explicitly to the issue.  Perhaps more to the point, I am not aware of
any challenges to the rights of employers to keep such records.

While equity and fair information practice both clearly suggest that the
employee has a protectable interest in the record, such interest would
appear to be far short of "the exclusive right to use."

Balancing the rights and interests of record keepers against the rights
of record subjects is a complex issue.  It will eventually be clarified,
and perhaps even codified, at law.  To date the law is mostly silent.
In the presence of such silence I suppose anyone can assert what he
would like to be the outcome as though it were fait accompli.  I would
suggest that it is less than helpful, perhaps even destructive, to do so.

Reply-To: pedregal@cs.umass.edu

Daniel Dobkin offers a justification for the FBI's reasons to demand an ability
to wiretap without Telco cooperation. (This follows the reasoning by Brian
Kantor, carefully avoiding its disputed last step.)  Dobkin says:

&gt; In fairness to the FBI, there are other possibilities, such as when a
&gt; Telco employee is himself the subject of an investigation. 

I find this extremely naive.  If to investigate a Telco employee one must stay
outside of Telco COs and such, there is a serious security problem at Telco
regardless of other technical issues.  The other side of the coin (misuses of
such capabilities) has been discussed already.

I agree with Kantor that any conceivable (legal) wiretap can be carried out
with Telco's cooperation.  This is enough, and it has been well argued that
more than this (i.e., what the Bureau demands) poses risks both on civil rights
and technical perspectives.

The risks of the good-natured remark by Dobkin are the assigning of (pure)
"motivation" or moral qualities to (in this case, government) institutions, and
forgetting Occam's razor: Telco wiretapping is sufficient, effective, and
cheap. Why more?

I read William Session's piece in the NYT on why the FBI wants to maintain the
ability to tap phones and I think he makes good points.  If we want to defend
cryptography and electronic privacy, I think we need to argue that privacy is
not just a philosophical shield used by child pornographers and drug dealers.
It is an essential tool that normal people need to protect their interests. I
wrote this down in an op-ed piece on Senate Bill 266 (the one that would ban
encryption) that didn't see light. Rather than re-invent the squeal, I'll just
send it along.

Everyone knows the problem with postcards. The mailman hands over the mail and
says, ``Too bad about your brother. Paid all that money to go to ski in
Switzerland just to break his arm on the first day.'' Right now, the Senate is
considering an anti-crime bill that effectively requires all communication to
be as easily readable to government officials as postcards. The reason, they
say, is that drug dealers and other criminals are using secret codes to do
business. The sad truth is that the bill will hardly deter criminals. If
anything it will make their lives easier by making it impossible for American
companies and citizens to keep anything confidential.

The point of Section 2201 of Senate Bill 266 is to prevent people from using
secret codes. The practice is not widespread now because people communicate
with paper and sealed envelopes are enough to do the trick. In the coming years
more and more letters and documents will travel electronically and in
electronic communication, encryption is the equivalent of an envelope.
Although you can't write sealed with a kiss across it, you can make still make
sure that no electronic postmaster is perusing your love letters. There may be
no seal, but the banks and other businesses can use encryption to keep
financial statements confidential.

Although the language of the bill makes it more a non-binding resolution than a
real law with teeth, it specifically asks that all manufacturers of
communication equipment ensure that the ``plaintext'' of a message is easily
available to the state. No one knows what this will entail, but there is the
real danger that the executive branch might make regulations based on these
non-binding wishes of Congress.  In any case, any piece of communication that
can be read by the government can also be read by 16 year old hackers or more
importantly, foreigners companies spying on their American competitors.

The problem, in the eyes of the bill's authors, is that computers make it too
easy to jumble a letter or a ledger record into incomprehensible mess of
seemingly random noise. Only the person with the correct password can resurrect
the file. The government is worried that this computer power will be a
tremendous hindrance to investigations. They won't be able to find produce any
evidence of wrongdoing because everything will be encrypted in code.

While this may be a problem, it's nothing new. Criminals have been using secret
codes since the beginning of time. One of the classic cliches of Hollywood is
the doublespeak of gangsters. One asks, ``Did the shipment of tomatoes come in
yet?'' The other responds, ``Yes, and they will cost you 10,000 bananas.''
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow made the encryption technology of the American
revolution famous when he set it to rhyme. ``One if by land, two if by sea, and
I on the opposite shore shall be.'' Although there weren't any computers
involved, the message got through.

It is easy to create an innocuous system that doesn't look like a code. When a
major New York jeweler was caught evading sales tax by sending empty boxes to
addresses out of the state, the police found that they were making a little dot
next to the illegal entries in the books. When Elliot Ness brought Al Capone
down for tax evasion, he got the bookkeeper to decipher the cryptic entries in
the books.  Would prohibiting encryption stop this behavior? Hardly. What's
another law when you're already taking on the IRS?

Almost by definition, this bill will touch sensitive subjects. If people
consider something a private matter, they usually have a reason for feeling
that way. There may not be a right to privacy specified in the constitution,
but many feel that there should be strict limitations on the bounds of
government. In a sense, requiring all messages to travel on the equivalent of
postcards isn't much different from getting a search warrant for every envelope
in the country.

But, the people on the other side of the spectrum who feel that ``privacy'' is
just a philosophical shield for suspicious activity should be just as wary of
the bill. Criminals are notorious for using confidential data to defraud. My
credit card company assumes that if I tell them my account number and the
billing address over the phone then I am probably who I say I am. But when
every bill or letter must be readable by the government, who knows which
criminal will find a way to discover my credit card number and billing address?
Companies won't be able to protect themselves or their customers with
encryption.

This bill should alarm any business with trade secrets. Encryption is to
computers what locks are to filing cabinets and security guards to the front
door. The Soviet Union, France and Iraq, to name just a few, already devote a
substantial effort to stealing American non-military technology. It doesn't
make sense to prevent business from protecting themselves.

The fact is that individual people are the best guardians of their own
information. Privacy is not just an important legal tradition-- it is also a
good crime deterrent. The police will always dream of listening to the hidden
thoughts of the criminals, but gaining the ability to scan every letter in the
country won't make a difference.  Even the stupidest crooks know enough to not
to spell out their plans on a postcard.  The rest of us who have completely
legal secrets, though, will be left with no protection by Senate Bill 266.

	This being daylight savings day, a programmer down the hall at another
firm and I got onto a discussion of time related programming errors.  He
related two very interesting real-life errors that I thought you all would be
interested in.

	Both of these programming failures were discovered when he worked at a
race and sports book (ie gambling hall).  These both happened in Las Vegas, and
the names and places are not being posted to protect the guilty from shame. :-)
For those not familiar with how sports books work:

	Basically the book takes bets on sporting events, and horse / dog
races.  Bets are PLACED up to a particular point (usually start time), at which
time that event is CLOSED.  After the event is over, the winner is POSTED.
Bets are then paid based on the posted winner.  The computers (of course), have
safety features to prevent you from placing a bet after an event is closed.
The closing and posting is done by a single person, who spends all day watching
6 or 7 TV's.  Of course, the system keeps an "accurate" audit trail with regard
to the times that items are entered.

 	At a local book they were using a system that was designed for horse
races, but instead they were using it for dog races.  Now Nevada law says that
betting stops when the first horse enters the gate (minutes before the race is
over), but dog races are not closed until a few seconds before the gate opens.
Dog races are also fast, taking ~30 seconds.  The difference in time span is
crucial, because the system originally only recorded the time in HH:MM, since
seconds were not crucial for a long horse race.  Because of this, a race could
close, start, and be posted, all within the same minute.  This meant that you
could sometime place a bet after the game was over, and the computer would
still accept the bet.  (REAL MONEY)

	At another book, the employees managed to cheat the system for about
three months.  It was obvious to the auditing department that some cheating was
going on, but all the computer records were clean, but it was equally obvious
that everyone on the floor was ripping the book off.  They way it worked was
this:

	When a game started in New York at 7PM (ATLANTIC COAST TIME), they
would close the game at 7PM (PACIFIC COAST TIME).  Everybody in accounting
assumed that the computer tracked the times in the proper time zone for that
game, because that's how the employees were using it.

	Eventually someone asked one of the programmers, and found out that all
times were supposed to be in local time, and well.....

P.S.  The book that discovered these two bugs never bothered to
report them to any of the other books using the same software.   :-(

I have recently run into a problem with the X400 protocol that could I believe
kill e-mail as we know it. Remember when messages used to be conveniently
queued? Well, if the X400 is "congested" it sends a (long) rejection message
(which does *not* include the original message!)  back to the originator.  Just
imagine a conventional mailing service where the delivery man who has too much
to carry just sends back a note saying "I threw your mail in the trash".

I also understand that the whole problem comes from charging arrangements
between PTT's - no one want to pay for storage so reject the messages when
busy, don't send them back (but remember to charge for the rejection message).

I'd love to be corrected on this! If I'm right, e-mail could just die.  I've
already given up using it other than at weekends from here to Germany.

          My computer must be slow ...  I still haven't gotten a copy of the
risks posting I made several days ago, but I've gotten several computer mail
postings from around the world about the posting.  I guess information posted
to risks gets to the EC before the US.

          Yes [to a query], you can print what I said in risks elsewhere, but I
can't imagine why you would want to.

          Someone in the EC thought (I think) that I was complaining about the
EC's policy.  Not so.  I was complaining about the US policy that you can't
export the DES or RSA, even though you can buy it cheaply everywhere you have
to get approval for export.  There's even a public domain version of the DES
(source in C) widely available in the US.  (I would post it on risks, but I'm
afraid that risks might then export it).  It seems that US law permits me to
publish my source code for the RSA and export that, and if you have a scanner,
you can read it into your computer legally.

          I think I am now leaning toward publishing the illegal-to distribute
portion of my system on paper and shipping it in the manual.  Then you only
have to type in the expression (defun encode (x) (mexpt x e n)) to implement
the RSA on your system.  After all, it is legal to sell software that does very
fast modular exponentiation with unlimited precision!  if the default version
of encode is (defun encode (x) x), it doesn't violate US law because it doesn't
encrypt!!

          As to doing the development in Israel, I understand you can get very
inexpensive mathematical expertise in Israel, and according to recent rumors,
you can sell in volume to China from there, but on the other hand, the total
effort of developing the cryptosystems requires only a few hours of relatively
non-expert programming time.  You can still do the theory in the US and export
it on paper.

          By the way, the source code for one of the cryptosystems I am not
allowed to export without permission was published in Computers and Security
(the IFIP journal), so I understand that my competitors are using the algorithm
already.  I guess it's alright to have my competitors sell my cryptosystem in
the rest of the world as long as I can't.

In the article "Bad data allowed to enter driver database and used as basis for
arrest" in <A HREF="/Risks/13.34.html">RISKS-13.34</A>, Eric Postpischil described the problems that resulted
when public officials put false data into their databases.  The problem of
false data finding its way into interacting databases and spreading throughout
them and becoming hard to completely eliminate, as you don't even know all the
places it may have reached, is already real, and can be expected to get worse.
Mr. Postpischil correctly indicates that a person should be reviewed as the
owner of his or her data in a public database and be advised of changes and
able to make corrections.  However, the public databases are only a tiny
fraction of those containing records on you.  Most of them are private, the
owners regard the information as proprietary, and would never accept the
expense of notifying the subjects of changes.  So what can be done to protect
people from bad data ?

The answer that I would propose for consideration is that the great nightmare
of science fiction, an authoritative official database, may be in fact the only
way to protect ourselves from all the little brothers spreading information
about us. If an such an authoritative database existed, any other database that
used information on you that was contradicted by the authoritative database
would expose it's owners to liability.  They would therefore have to assure
that before any data was used it would be checked against the central database.
If some bad data was circulating about you, it could be stopped with one update
to the central record, and if that failed, you would have a clear case of
negligence, and a much better chance of collecting damages if the falsehoods
did you any harm.

I don't propose that this database list all the facts about you, though some
people might prefer that it carry very complete data. It would include only
a)the information that you gave it, and b) information that was placed there as
the result of a contract, court case, or other legal action.  The subject of
the data would have full access to the information and the right to require
corrections.  There would probably be a fee involved for each piece of
information posted ( usually paid by the subject, though in some cases by
others or by public agencies, and possibly only covering a certain period of
time ), but corrections would be free.  It would generally only involve data
you need to protect yourself from falsehoods.  In most cases this would only
involve offering appropriate identification of oneself and documentation of the
data, but when facts are disputed the entry might require a court to decide the
facts and authorize the change.

I've no firm idea on how such a thing would be set up.  I don't expect it soon,
because of the cost and because of continuing fears of such centralized
information.  But as there is already a massive amount of decentralized
information about us out there, the owners of which are not accountable to us
though they can have devastating impacts on us, it seems to me that a
centralized, accountable record is a desirable thing, and that the lack of one
puts us more at risk than the creation of one.

  [The silly parts of the above opinions are wholely my own; any intelligence
  that crept in was probably borrowed. None of it reflects the position of my
  employer.                         Steven S. Davis ( ssdavis@dpsc.dla.mil )]

While I was in the air back to SFO from Washington yesterday morning, the
Oakland CA en-route traffic control in Fremont had a major snafu, seriously
snarling West-coast and Pacific Ocean air traffic from 8:40am PDT, for two
hours.  Outgoing flights were delayed more than incoming flights.  The backup
system requires manual handshaking where otherwise the system would handle
handoffs automatically, so there was some element of risk involved.  However,
the outage of the one center did not directly impact safety.  Required
separations between planes were increased to 20 miles for landings and
departures, instead of 3 miles, and the net effect was a return to leisurely
pace of the 1950s.  The cause of the failure is not yet known, although it was
thought to be a software problem.  [Some details can be found in, Traffic
Control Center Failure Snarls Airline Flights, By Jack Viets, San Francisco
Chronicle, 9 April 1992, front page]

The Army acknowledged on 7 April 1992 that its glowing claims of success were
based on faulty data and indicated it is now certain that the missile
``killed'' roughly 10 Iraqi Scud warheads out of more than 80 fired at Israel
and Saudi Arabia, although the actual number could be greater.

[Source: A front-page article by George Lardner in the Washington Post, Army
Cuts Claims of Patriot Success: Reduced Figures on Missile's Precision During
Gulf War Are Issued, 8 Apr 1992.]

Also, see the earlier item on MIT Professor Theodore A. Postol's article and
its aftermath, discussed in <A HREF="/Risks/13.32.html">RISKS-13.32</A>.  Postol was on Fox TV early on the
morning of the 7th, prior to the Army briefing, discussing the Patriots.  He
suggested that 10% was much closer than the 80% previously claimed, and that is
actually conceivable that NO direct kills were actually achieved!]

In Risks 13.34, an article describing an alleged remote backup service, began:

&gt; Date:   Thu, 2 Apr 1992 11:07:48 PST
&gt; From: Robert_Ebert.OsBU_North@xerox.com
&gt; Subject: Backup over the phones?

&gt; Excerpted from TidBITS#114/01-Apr-92, source: BackData, info@backdata.com

The article mentioned some of the obvious risks involved and subsequent
issues of Risks contained follow-up articles.

However, in TidBITS#115, the author mentioned that TidBITS#114 was the April
Fools issue and all of the content was fictional.

Not getting an April Fools joke might be more of a risk in on-line documents
because often they are not read until some time after the first of April.
(Of course there can be a similar problem with hard copy media - I get 
several magazines whose April issue arrives in late February or early March.)

Subject: Risks of too-subtle April Fools Jokes (Backup over the phones?)

<A HREF="/Risks/13.34.html">RISKS-13.34</A> (Friday 3 April 1992) carried a submission from me forwarded from
TidBITS#114/01-Apr-92 about Backing up Macs and PC's over the phone.

TidBITS#115/06-Apr-92 carried the following notice:

  To quote from the excellent movie "Spinal Tap," "it's a fine line
  between clever and stupid." I may have fallen off that fine line
  in writing TidBITS#114, because despite a few clues and hints, the
  fact that it was indeed our annual April Fools issue appears to
  have gone generally unnoticed. Almost everything in that issue was
  false - though often entirely possible and even intensely
  desirable - with the exception of the IBM marketing move (which
  was strange enough to be an April Fools joke), and the Dolch
  projection panel (which I used to make the last article more
  believable). Sorry folks, if I threw you for a loop.

So, there you have it.  I don't consider myself to be terribly gullible, but I
was taken in.  [I didn't have this problem with any other April jokes... I
don't think.  But then, most of the ones I got were substantially more
obviously jokes than this.  Xerox is *not* going to lease it's newly acquired
buildings in Palo Alto to the Mariott hotel chain, and an "Amusement park for
Silicon Valley geeks" requiring "magnetic badges built into pocket protectors"
is *not* going to be opened on the neighboring land at Page Mill &amp; Foothills.]

In any case, apologies all around for spreading what turned out to be false
information.  The backup scheme described seems entirely plausible, and even
lucrative.  Looking over the rest of the TidBITS digest, I suppose there are
clues to be had... in retrospect.  In comparison to the rest of the silliness
that the rest of the net goes through every April, TidBITS was the height of
subtlety.  Ah, well, whatever it takes to relieve those tax-time blues, I
suppose.

The IBM marketing move (from TidBITS#114/01-Apr-92):
  Ralph Amundesen wrote with some interesting information about IBM.
  Evidently, IBM is so worried about OS/2 that the company has
  expanded its battalion of salesbots by drafting the entire
  company. I don't know if this will go as far as dark-suited IBM
  folks out pounding the pavement ("Excuse me, Ma'am, may I come in
  and demonstrate what OS/2 2.0 can do for you today?"), but all
  344,000 employees are in it for fun and prizes.  It's a step up
  from grade school, but IBM employees could win medals, IBM
  software, IBM hardware, or even cold hard cash. I sure hope they
  don't stop in here since I don't have 30 MB free under SoftPC to
  test it. Sheesh, wouldn't you think it would be easier to just buy
  a few TV spots like Microsoft is doing?

The Dolch projection panel (from TidBITS#114/01-Apr-92):
  Interestingly, Dolch Computer Systems just released a color LCD
  projection panel that can double as a stand-alone screen for a
  mere $8500.

We experienced a shattering computer error during a German election this past
Sunday (5 April). The elections to the parliament for the state of Schleswig-
Holstein were affected.

German elections are quite complicated to calculate. First, there is the 5%
clause: no party with less than 5% of the vote may be seated in parliament.
All the votes for this party are lost. Seats are distributed by direct vote
and by list. All persons winning a precinct vote (i.e. having more votes than
any other candidate in the precinct) are seated. Then a complicated system
(often D'Hondt, now they have newer systems) is invoked that seats persons from
the party lists according to the proportion of the votes for each party. Often
quite a number of extra seats (and office space and salaries) are necessary so
that the seat distribution reflects the vote percentages each party got. 

On Sunday the votes were being counted, and it looked like the Green party was
hanging on by their teeth to a vote percentage of exactly 5%. This meant that
the Social Democrats (SPD) could not have anyone from their list seated, which
was most unfortunate, as the candidate for minister president was number one on
the list, and the SPD won all precincts: no extra seats needed.

After midnight (and after the election results were published) someone discovered
that the Greens actually only had 4,97% of the vote. The program that prints out
the percentages only uses one place after the decimal, and had *rounded the
count up* to 5%! This software had been used for *years*, and no one had thought
to turn off the rounding at this very critical (and IMHO very undemocratic) region!

So 4,97% of the votes were thrown away, the seats were recalculated, the SPD got
to seat one person from the list, and now have a one seat majority in the parliament.
And the newspapers are clucking about the "computers" making such a mistake.

Defense Loses Bid to Present Animated Videotape Depicting Baton Blow
By Linda Deutsch, Associated Press Writer

   Simi Valley, Calif. (AP) The judge in the trial of four officers accused of
beating a motorist refused Tuesday to let jurors see an expert witness's
animated videotape recreating the first baton blow.  Superior Court Judge
Stanley Weisberg said he wasn't convinced that the tape, created by a
biomechanical engineer with the help of a computer program, was scientifically
reliable.  ``It would lead the jury to think it must be accurate ... that it's
true because the computer shows it,'' Weisberg said. ``Just because it's sold
in software stores doesn't make it reliable.''  However, the judge said the
witness, biomechanical engineer Carley Ward, could testify on the limited issue
of how much force is produced when a baton strikes a human head and how much
damage would be done.
   Officers Theodore Briseno, 39, Laurence Powell, 29, Timothy Wind, 31, and
Sgt. Stacey Koon, 41, are on trial in the March 3, 1991 beating of Rodney King.
A bystander's videotape of the beating led to a nationwide furor over police
brutality and inflamed racial tensions in Los Angeles. King is black, the
officers are white.
   Ms. Ward testified outside the jury's presence that Powell, in a test
conducted by her, exerted 1,500 pounds of pressure when swinging a baton in a
``full power swing.'' Prosecution witnesses have said he struck King's head in
such a manner.
   If King was struck with that force, Ms. Ward said, she would have expected
more injury than the broken facial bones he suffered.  She said her experiments
striking the heads of cadavers at such velocity produced brain injuries.
   Michael Stone, Powell's lawyer, said he would need time to determine if he
wanted to call Ms. Ward, given the limitations imposed by Weisberg.

In <A HREF="/Risks/13.34.html">RISKS-13.34</A> various people wrote about cryptography.  The following shows
how it already used by terrorists.  On Saturday 4th April the British newspaper
the Guardian reported that all the leaders of the Basque separatist
organisation ETA had been captured in a police raid in France. (ETA is a
terrorist organisation in Basque, Spain which want independence from Spain.
They have killed many over the last 10 years.) The leaders must have found out
several minutes before the raid, as they tried to find matches to burn
documents they had in their possession.  Failing, they torn them up and flushed
them down the toilet instead. (It is not stated whether the police recovered
them.) The interesting part however, is that the police captured a computer (PC
or laptop) from the ETA some time ago (more than 18 months if I remember
correctly) but they have, to date, not been able break the code which was used
to decrypt all the information. I suppose this must be a worst case scenario
for intelligence organisations such as the police etc.

The US policy on export of crypto, while silly, is not quite as silly as Fred
thinks.  He thinks that it is silly to discourage export of pure information in
one form while tolerating it in another.  In fact, that is not quite true.

While once embargoed, (indeed NSA asserted that mere discussions of crypto were
"born classified") publication of cryptographic information is sufficiently
like protected speech for its prohibition to raise constitutional issues.  (You
and I would likely agree that the law should not distinguish between the media
of publication.)  However, this is not the only reason that print publication
is tolerated.

The government tolerates "publication" of crypto in hardware encapsulation
because replication is very difficult.  Likewise, the same information on paper
appears to them to be safer than on machine readable media.  While information
printed on paper can be readily copied, the procedure must be in machine
readable form before it can be used.  While, as Dr.  Cohen suggests, one can
scan information from paper into a computer, the government sees this as
undesirable but tolerable.  This is only one of the silly parts of this policy.

Nonetheless, any use of crypto has the potential to increase the cost of
intelligence gathering, and less important, reduce the effectiveness of law
enforcement.  While the government understands that it will not be completely
successful, it believes that it has a responsibility to resist whenever and
wherever it can.

History tells us that intelligence gathering is expensive in any case.  It also
tells us that we are better at gathering it than we are at using it.
Nonetheless, it is a dangerous world.  If you believe, with the government that
cheap intelligence gathering is a high value, support the government policy.

The Director would have you believe that mere use of ISDN, much less secret
codes, is inhibiting the ability of the government to enforce the laws against
terrorism, drugs, and organized crime.  If you believe that the use of
commercial crypto by criminals is wide-spread, if you believe that law
enforcement should be cheap and easy, and if you believe that law and order are
values that are superior to individual freedom and privacy, then support the
government policy.  Otherwise, resist it.

If you believe that international electronically mediated trade and commerce
require codes that both parties can trust, then you may wish to join FBC in
resisting this silly policy.  If you believe that international trade and
commerce are more important than efficient intelligence gathering, then to the
extent that you believe that, you have an obligation to resist.

FBCohen@DOCKMASTER.NCSC.MIL has posted comprehensive criticisms of US policy
regarding export of cryptosystems.  In a word or two, he shows how absurd it is
that an American could develop a cryptosystem abroad and both sell it both
abroad and import it to the US without violating US export laws.

Surely spooks from NSA, FBI, CIA, Commerce, and others (Oops, does Commerce
have spooks?  It wouldn't surprise me) read Risks-Digest.  Why, then don't we
have an authoritative, or at least an informed rebuttal to his postings?  Is
this, after all, a partisan political decision that has not been made on the
bases of what's best for US competitiveness but but rather of what best
fulfills some hidden agenda?

C'mon, someone, speak up!

The 23 March 1992 issue of Aviation Week focused on automated cockpits with
9 articles on the subject. Very interesting reading.  The most interesting
quotes were in the article "Pilots, Human Factors Specialists Urge Better
Man-Machine Cockpit Interface".

Near the end of the piece, Anthony J. Broderick, associate FAA administrator
of regulation and certification is quoted several times. Quoting AW&amp;ST:

  Although there are "no real, fundamental changes needed" to certify advanced
  hardware and software under development by major airframe manufactures, there
  is a need "to develop procedures that will establish certification standards
  for a level of safety" when using such systems, he said. ....  The agency's
  [FAA] experience base, in addition to rules established by the RTCA --
  formerly know as the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics -- that
  governs design standards for software and hardware used in automation
  equipment, provides an acceptable means to certifying systems as they are
  developed, according to Broderick.

Glad to know we don't need to worry about this anymore!

Summary: When is a picture of an exhibit evidence?

&gt;From _The Cincinnati Enquirer_, date missing from my copy:

    A judge's distaste for clutter is pushing Cincinnati's federal
  court into the high-tech world.
    When a securities case comes to trial soon in the courtroom
  of federal district Judge Carl Rubin, reams of exhibits will be
  computerized and displayed on eight computer monitors.
    ...
    The alternative is rows of cumbersome file cabinets lining
  the walnut-paneled walls of his courtroom for weeks on end.
    "And I hate that," he said.
    ...
    With the push of a few buttons, the courtroom deputy can
  display the exhibits on three color monitors in front of the
  jury box, and on screens stationed before the judge's bench,
  witness stand and lawyers' tables and podium.
    ...
    Computerization also may cut down on trial time because
  lawyers can change exhibits without carting posters and
  papers around the courtroom.

   [The newspaper photo shows a monitor displaying the front and back
   of a bank check, signatures and all.  "I saw it on the computer,
   so it had to be real...."]

Risks of academic cheating by computer

There is an academic cheating brouhaha this semester at the university where I
work which is brimming over with computer risks.  I am not privy to the details
of the case, but here is a summary from the published accounts.

This university has an Honor Code governing student cheating which is a source
of much school pride.  Students agree not to give or receive aid on schoolwork
and as a result the university can function without the burden of proctored
exams.  Alleged violations of the Honor Code are taken before the Honor
Council, an elected student body which has the authority to dole out
substantial punishments.  Honor Council cases are publicized in the form of
anonymous abstracts which mask the identities of all parties.

Enter the computer: Earlier this semester, two students were accused of
colluding on a homework assignment which was done and handed in via one of the
university's academic computer networks.  Their TA noticed that portions of the
two students' homework were identical, down to the initials of one of the
students.  Network officials were asked to examine backup tapes for the period
of time in question and produced evidence which supported the theory that
"Student B" had sent homework to "Student A" by electronic mail immediately
before Student A turned it in.  The students argued that they were innocent and
were the victims of a frame-up by an unknown "User X" who they alleged had
gained access to their accounts.  The Honor Council refused to accept the "User
X" theory and convicted both students.  Student B's conviction was later
overturned partly on the basis of further evidence supplied by network
officials which suggested that Student A committed the acts of cheating alone
by logging in to Student B's account.

Although officially the case is closed, it is the subject of much heated debate
in the student newspaper and local Usenet newsgroups at the university.  Both
students continue to maintain their innocence and their supporters have rallied
around the slogan "Free Student A".

Computer risks seem to surround this case on all sides.  A few which
come to mind:

-- The risk of cheating by computer in the first place.  While academic
cheating is as old as academia, the computer can make it, like so many other
things, easier than ever before.

-- The risk of frame-ups.  While the Honor Council appears to be satisfied that
the computer evidence substantiates real cheating in this case, it is clear
that a person with access to one or more users' accounts could at least cause
them a major nuisance and possibly succeed in framing them of cheating.  With
the penalties involved going as high as academic suspension from a school which
costs thousands of dollars per semester, this is no light matter.

-- The complexity of evidence in cases of computer cheating.  Honor council
members were quoted in the student paper as complaining about the new and
bewildering kinds of evidence they are asked to consider in computer cheating
cases, and critics of the Honor Council have complained about the dangers of
being judged by people who are not users of the systems involved and don't
thoroughly understand them.

-- The burden on system administrators.  The network official who provided the
bulk of the evidence estimated that he spent a full week gathering and
analyzing it.  Since the case came up, the local academic network has extended
the period of time it keeps daily backups before recycling them.  How much data
is it reasonable to keep, and to pore over, in order to provide evidence in
cases like this?  I don't know of a way to determine a firm answer.

-- The danger to trust and to openness.  Both the university's Honor Code and
the tradition of open exchange of information within the computing community
are threatened by cases like this.  Must students be kept in a "padded shell"
to prevent computerized cheating?

 In <A HREF="/Risks/13.34.html">RISKS-13.34</A>, a new PBS series on computers was mentioned. These 5
programmes have already aired some weeks ago on the BBC in the UK. I have seen
all 5 and regard them as excellent. Their coverage of the historical material
was the most accurate and even handed I have ever seen. Their coverage of risks
issues is also exemplary. I could seriously use them in undergraduate teaching
and did not regard them in any way as "technopulp" for the masses.

 There is the probability that some of the programmes are "tailored" to the
home audience. I have experienced this before with other WGBH/BBC
co-productions. This highlights some interesting assumptions often made with
regard to TV programmes. If the programmes are in our field we assume them to
be "technology for the masses", whereas the masses, having seen it on TV assume
the fact presented in the program to be true. Further, if the programme is
aired around the globe, or around the nation from more than one TV station we
assume everyone shares the same programme we do.

 Do they tell the people in Cambridge (either one) that they invented the
computer and at the same time tell someone in another time zone that it
was invented by a little old lady from Novosibirsk? Are we being manipulated
by global telecasting on an Orwellian scale? Who can tell? Not easy is it.

&gt;Perhaps it is risky not to see how our
&gt;industry is being popularized for the mass media.

Perhaps, but I've seen three out of the five programmes and was quite
impressed with the factual accuracy.

&gt;Another risk: the title of the series is the same as that of a recent book
&gt;about the _auto_.

Erm, the Americans must be using a different name. Over here the TV series was
called "The Dream Machine."

&gt; The answer that I would propose for consideration is that the great
&gt; nightmare of science fiction, an authoritative official database, may be in
&gt; fact the only way to protect ourselves from all the little brothers spreading
&gt; information about us.

I disagree with this, or rather, think it should be an extremely last resort.
I think promulgation of inaccurate information should be legally treated as a
form of libel, with legal recourse for those who do it.  Currently I understand
that there is very little legal recourse for someone who suffers from
inaccurate information in this manner, and so little incentive to eliminate it.

Has anyone heard of or have evidence of a failure in a safety-related or other
critical or security system where the developers claim they "did it right",
e.g. they used good software engineering practices during development and had a
good SQA program, and in particular, where they have identified common-mode
failures in N-way redundant systems in hardware or software?

Lin, You might look at the following paper:

    Correlated Events.  Proceedings of COMPASS '91.  IEEE 91CH3033-8, pp.5-8.
    This paper notes the 1980 ARPANET collapse, the 1990 AT&amp;T long-distance
    collapse, and a bunch of telephone system outages, and considers seemingly
    weak-link failures that actually arose because of multiple-fault modes.
    It also notes the some further references that might be useful to you.

The new `Daily 3' numbers game slated to begin today in California was
postponed at the last moment by state officials concerned that the game might
have been unfair.  The problem was discovered only on Wednesday (8 Apr 1992),
and diagnosed the following day.  The final test indicated that the quick-pick
pseudorandom number generating algorithm was biased.  After a quick-fix
programming change, the game is now scheduled to start next Monday.
[Source: San Francisco Chronicle, 10 Apr 1992, p.A21]

   [I suppose this will inspire a new research area -- Byzantine Pseudorandom
   Number Generators, in which 3n+1 PNGs are required to guarantee correct
   behavior in spite of n malicious or arbitrarily malfunctioning PNGs.
   I heard on 1 Apr 1992 that Les Lamport has been asked to apply to the State 
   of California for a research grant on this topic.  But he was skiing (or
   Byzantining?) in Nevada.  PNG -- oops, I mean PGN]

London Ambulance Service continues to have software problems with its emergency
dispatch system.  The new 1.1M-puond system (being developed by Datatrak and
Systems Options, with Apricot hardware) crashed on its first training session.
Last year, an earlier system failed two major tests, and was scuttled; the
Service sued the vendor (BT subsidiary IAL) and subcontractor (CGS).  That
system had costs escalate from 2.5M pounds to 7.5M pounds, and was supposed to
have been ready in the summer of 1990.  Another system for south London's
nonemergency calls crashed in its first week, in April 1991.

On 7 Feb 1992, an operator inadvertently switched off a screen, losing four
emergency calls.  On one occasion, the details of a call were lost; the caller
called again half an hour later and was told that the details had been lost (by
the computer), and an ambulance was dispatched.  The patient later died,
although ``it is not proven that there was any link between the delay and the
death.''

The National Audit Office has issued a report blaming ``unreliable computer

cervical and breast cancer, which reduces the chances of successful scanning,
and so contributes to the deaths of 15,000 women in England each year.  The
software is developed by Family Practitioner Services in Exeter.  The report is

     Drug Offender Faces Murder Rap 

   PATERSON, N.J. (AP)
   A drug offender under house arrest killed another man after a computer error
enabled him to break his electronic anklet and leave the house, authorities
say.  Tony Palmer, a 21-year-old who had been serving a three-year sentence,
was charged with fatally shooting Vernon Major, 19, last week.
   The electronic surveillance system sets off an alarm if the prisoner moves
more than 150 feet from a transmitter or breaks the bracelet or anklet.  The
alarm sounded and a printer in Trenton placed an asterisk by Palmer's name, but
the information was not transmitted to a computer monitored by parole officers,
Corrections Department spokesman Jim Stabile said Wednesday.  The printout also
is checked, but 700 names move constantly on that line, Stabile said.

         Inaccurate

The Department of Justice's Central Address File, which will be used to record
and preserve the names and addresses of aliens and their representatives in
deportation proceedings, was reviewed by the General Accounting Office.  The
File is not yet fully implemented but initial reviews indicate problems.  The
General Accounting Office report (Jan. 23), covering a review of only four
field offices, estimates that 22 percent of the records of the names and
address of aliens involved in deportation proceedings were inaccurate. GAO
believes that for ALL offices, some 12 percent of aliens may not be able to be
notified about their deportation hearings due to inaccurate names and addresses
under this system.

The Justice Department indicates plans to revise its current procedures.
However, it isn't clear how they are going to achieve 100 percent accuracy in
notification, which is essential when a deportation matter is at stake.  Not
appearing at a hearing can mean that individuals will lose their rights under
the law, since it can and will be assumed that they were notified as required
by law and/or did not let the authorities know when they moved.  Recently, the
U.S.  has drastically (and often unfairly) restricted appeals and other
protections in many deportation and political asylum cases.  The result has
been shameful incidents, including the deportation of Haitians who are now
being threatened upon return to their country of origin.  Data entry problems
will simply reinforce those governmental decisions, resulting in automatic
deportation orders when persons do not show up for their hearings. Reliance
upon the computer as an essential part of this critical process *without other
forms of notification and review of agency procedures to ensure appropriate
protection of applicants* will cause great problems.

For once, the New York Times had something intelligent to say on this
matter in its lead editorial the other day.  If astronomers are really
convinced that the Earth-crossing asteroid impact threat is serious,
would they be willing to take observing time away from other programs on
*existing* instruments and devote it to the search?  Oh, well maybe it's
not THAT serious! :-)  (The NYT stylebook forbids smilies, but if they
ever used one, it would have been right there.)  If the asteroid search
is less important than anything telescopes are being used for now, the
taxpayers might be forgiven for suspecting that this proposal has more
to do with creating work and facilities for folks who've chosen to build
their careers around space based interception issues than it does with a
sensible and properly prioritized approach to protecting the planet.

The RISK here is our old favorite: institutional and career imperatives
are capable of improperly driving public policy unless we keep a
watchful eye out.  Most people trust "astronomers" and "scientists" to
tell us what is really important in that mysterious realm out there.
When they trot out diagrams and photos, we naturally tend to accept
their conclusions.  But it ain't necessarily so.  (I am not saying
anything is fundamentally wrong with the process, though, since public
inquiry like this very discussion tends to weed out errors.)

A minor correction might be in order on the posting about the problems and
risks of "monitoring for astroidal risks".
  The (widely believed) event of 65 million years ago was probably the last
"stream clean most of the planet" size event, actual estimates of large
(nuclear explosive level) collisions are for much smaller time scales such as a
few thousand years apart for megaton size to once per million years for objects
capable of devestating medium sized countries.  Still hypothetical but with
some evidence is that a medium sized sea strike triggered or contributed to ice
age.  There are a couple of examples of visible "smallish hits" in last few
thousand years such as "Arizona's Meteor" crater.  Of significance (and I am
sure done a disservic by the media) it that one of the Nasa's proposals is
simply to find and track these smaller but not harmless objects which are also
of a scale that would be currenly feasible to deflect.
   I don't recall the exact numbers but the explosive power of a meteorite
(because of velocities range) range through equivalence in mass to power of
high explosives.... as such a small objects of nickle iron are equivalent to
lower nuclear range.  A 20 meter chunk could be Hiroshima scale, a 100 meter
chunk, megaton scale!!!!

Like Brian Kantor (yo, dude) I'd be surprised to hear that there are many
phones which can't be tapped at the end office switch.  From reading the
Sessions piece and other accounts I think what the FBI really wants is to place
taps from their office in Washington (or perhaps from say, Colorado, to save on
toll charges) so that they won't have to spend the staff effort to actually
visit a CO.  Instead, they'll just type a few keys and have the datastreams
associated with calls from or to certain numbers duplicated and copied to their
equipment.  This capability will save them money and effort, reduce the chance
that targets will learn about taps by suborning telco personnel, enable them to
place many more taps, and just maybe increase the incidence of unlawful
(warrantless) tapping.  Of course, I am surprised that Sessions thinks the
American people will want to pay higher phone bills in order to help the FBI
tap their phones.

Could use of "non-standard" or uncommon compression techniques to facilitate
high-speed data transmission also be undesireable for the NSA/FBI?  Use of
experimental/modified "coding" of data for purposes of compression could make
data just as inaccessible as if it were encrypted for purposes of security..
Should we expect laws against use of non-standard data compression to succeed
laws against data encryption?

On top of the patent problems related to data compression techniques, could
this provide a killing blow for non-corporate research into coding/modelling?

(I may have used "compression" &amp; "coding" in a slightly more interchangeable
way than experts in the field would like - do not hesitate to correct me, but
please accept my apologies in advance..)

Seeing the praises for the TV series in RISKS, I must add that while what was
shown was well done, I did notice that the one BIG OMISSION in the
"conventional" histories of the business was also omitted from the show. That
is the pioneering work in Iowa in the 1930s (about 1937) by Atanasoff, a
physicist, who built a working machine that did perform calculations using
vacuum tubes. I recall that he actually won a patent suit against Univac, which
had been claiming patents on the basic idea of programmable (?) electronic
computers. So why doesn't he get the credit that is his due? Perhaps he needed
a better public relations department!

Out of respect for John V. Atanasoff's efforts with the ABC Computer, "The
Machine That Changed the World" has been very careful to avoid the term "first"
in speaking of the ENIAC computer.  Generally, we refer to it as the first
"working" electronic computer.

However, the decision NOT to include Atanasoff's computer in the series was
made only after a great deal of consideration.  There is much debate about
Atanasoff's machine -- did it ever really work?; could it be considered a
"programmable, digital, computer" as we defined the computer for the purposes
of our series?; how does one weigh the pronouncement of a judge against the
opinion of the majority of the computer community (including historians)
regarding Eckert and Mauchly's place in computer history versus Atanasoff's?

Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that the series (with its inevitable time
constrictions) can only focus of those machines that influenced further
development in the field.  With that criteria, we could not justify spending
the large amount of time that would have been necessary to tell the Atanasoff
story.  In addition, some authors claim that Mauchly "stole" the idea from
Atanasoff is unproven and without Mauchly to tell his side, we felt that
exploration of this part of computer history would only lead to the dead end of
inconclusiveness.

We understand and appreciate the controversy regarding Atanasoff, but feel that
our decision was correct.  In the words of Sir Francis Darwin (in 1914): "In
science, the credit goes to the man who convinces the world, not to whom the
idea first occurs.

By Don Clark, c.1992, San Francisco Chronicle, 7 March 1992

    Michelangelo claimed relatively few victims Friday, leaving experts to
debate whether news media over-hyped the computer virus or performed a useful
service by warning the public to take precautions.  The virus apparently
destroyed data in a few thousand personal computers around the world, far short
of expectations. Researchers had estimated that the destructive software
program had spread to anywhere from 100,000 to 5 million computers out of about
80 million IBM-compatible machines worldwide.
   Most large businesses and institutions heeded the headlines and used special
software to inspect and clean their personal computers before Michelangelo's
birthday March 6, when the virus was set to go off. But some individuals and
small businesses did not and came to regret it.
   One of them was Bill Permar, a Sausalito accountant who turned on his
computer to find that Michelangelo had destroyed the contents of two large disk
drives containing his clients' tax data and other records. Although he had
backup copies of that data, he was still struggling with his computer late
Friday.  ``I thought it was a lot of media hype,'' Permar lamented.
   Michelangelo, written by an unknown prankster last year, caught the public
imagination for several reasons. The program is among the most destructive of
the more than 1,000 viruses in existence; when activated, the virus writes
random characters over data on a personal computer's hard disk, making recovery
almost impossible without backup copies of files. The program spreads through
the exchange of floppy disks.
   The widespread publicity over the March 6 deadline led to a drawn-out
countdown on television, radio and in newspapers.
   Some computer professionals think Michelangelo did a good deed by making
millions of people aware of the danger of viruses. The state of California, for
example, spent most of this week checking its thousands of personal computers
for Michelangelo. Only one infection of that virus was found, but the check
turned up other viruses on numerous machines.
   On the other hand, some said the coverage may have unduly caused public
hysteria and could inspire other pranksters to develop destructive programs.
``I'm sure there are a dozen kids right now saying, `I bet I can top that,'''
said Joseph Pujals, the state's information security manager.
   Michelangelo's typical victims include New Salem Baptist Church in Kennesaw,
Ga.; Vigil Printing, a small firm in Chicago; and Save the Whales, the Venice
(Los Angeles County) nonprofit group. Save the Whales lost its membership list,
correspondence and a newsletter that was about to be printed.
   Patricia Hoffman, a Santa Clara virus expert, said she had confirmed reports
of 125 small U.S. businesses affected. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
confirmed that Michelangelo hit four of its 250,000 computers nationwide.
   Other countries were hit harder. Some 750 to 1,130 personal computers in
South Africa reportedly were plagued by Michelangelo because of the widespread
use of a bootleg version of the operating system used on IBM and compatible
machines. Forty-eight companies or institutions were hit in Australia, 25 in
Hungary, 10 in China and eight in Japan, Hoffman said.
   Many victims were loath to admit that they did not take action, a possible
factor in the low number of Michelangelo victims reported.  ``They were
warned,'' said Martin Tibor, a San Rafael data-recovery expert. ``If they got
hit, it will be arrogance or stupidity.''
   One Bay Area public school with up to 20 stricken computers called Tibor but
would not let its name be used, he said.
   Some experts hope that Michelangelo will hasten the development of modified
operating software that make it harder for viruses to be created and
transmitted. ``Some folks are working on it,'' said Peter Neumann, principal
scientist in the computer-security group at SRI International in Menlo Park.
``We need something on the order of a Chernobyl before people will wake up.''
   There is little doubt that the virus hype was great advertising for
companies that specialize in selling virus-detection software.  Symantec Corp.,
based in Cupertino, said it gave away 250,000 copies of a free program tailored
to get rid of Michelangelo.
   Friday, Symantec was logging about 33 Michelangelo-related calls per hour,
with about 5 percent of those people claiming that their data was destroyed.
   Another controversial topic is the effectiveness of anti-virus software.
Some people claimed such programs did not work. ``There are a lot of really
ticked off people,'' said John McAfee, a noted virus expert who runs a Santa
Clara firm that sells anti-virus software. ``I think we're going to see some
massive fallout in the anti-virus community.'' Manufacturers of anti-virus
programs blamed the problem on the fact that customers failed to buy updated
versions of the software that included protection against Michelangelo.
   McAfee was criticized by some observers for suggesting that millions of
computers had been infected. Friday, he estimated that 10,000 computers lost
data worldwide.

A computer failure at a Federal Reserve Bank data center in Los Angeles shut
down computers for 12 hours on Friday, 10 Apr 1992 (payday) during the
processing of debits and credits for about 90 banks, credit unions and S&amp;Ls in
California and Arizona.  The unprocessed tapes were flown to San Francisco, but
the data for at least 15 institutions were still not going to be processed
until Monday.  Some bounced checks were expected as a result of the missing
payroll deposits.  [Source: an article by Kenneth Howe, San Francisco

St. Petersburg, 13 April, TASS

    By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lev Frolov: St. Petersburg has begun issuing
credit cards to business people and bankers in an attempt to protect bank
deposits from thefts.  Unlike their western analogues, new plastic cards use
holographic coding instead of traditional magnetic strips, which ensures 100
per cent guarantee from illegal withdrawals.  The SPACARD system of credit
cards developed by local specialists is part of the computer network "LEK
TELECOM," which will include banks, insurance companies, exchanges and
brokerage offices in Russia and other commonwealth states.

       [ENSURES 100 PER CENT GUARANTEE, eh?  And of 
       course no one would ever misuse the computers...]

Community College.  Although the changeover is expected to cost $50,000,
college officials say that greater expenses have arisen from confusion and
omission of the two-year school from state and federal college registries.

According to college president Charles Mader, CCFL often gets short-changed by
computerized listings that identify it as "Community College of the Finger."

Marc Horowitz (marc@MIT.EDU) questions the requirement of warning condo
tenants about security TV cameras and the observation of someone committing
an illegal act.  It would probably be best if someone with more than a
"Perry Mason" knowledge of law would answer this.  But as I understand it, a
person cannot have a audio- or videotape used against them unless the person
either knew that the tape was being made at the time the crime was committed
or the taping was done after a warrant was obtained based on probable
cause.  My guess is that prior knowledge followed by a deliberate illegal
act or confession against interest constitutes consent.  I don't fully
understand this, because this doesn't seem to uniformly apply - there was a
case recently where a man was a victim of gay-bashing on his front lawn, he
captured it on videotape without the attacker knowing it, and the tape was
used in court.  I think the law says that without a warrant, one of the
involved parties must have knowledge, with law enforcement agencies never
being considered an "involved party".

Anyways, applying this to the issue at hand, a person electronically
monitoring a login session in an automated manner would be treated the same
way - without prior knowledge of the monitoring or a warrant, the evidence
couldn't be used.  If a user was on at the same time, issuing commands and
determining from the result that something illegal was happening, then that
user could act as a witness.  But if a user sets up automated monitoring,
then there are grounds for contesting it as illegal search and seizure.

I'm disturbed by the tenor of the entire debate about phone tapping, privacy,
and such.  The general approach seems to be based on the idea that government
is not to be trusted, ever, with anything.  Nothing government says is to be
believed.

Let's take the FBI "phone tapping" proposal.  Everyone is absolutely sure
that no technical changes are needed to tap any phone.  The little the FBI
has said contains no detailed information, so it's hard to tell exactly what
they have in mind.  But I submit that there is a clear instance today in which
it would be difficult to insert an authorized tap.  Suppose a company has a
PBX, and the FBI has a court order to tap the line of the president of the
company.  Since the technicians running the PBX are employees of the company,
the FBI can't work through them.  Hence, they must go to the Telco side of the
PBX.  Unfortunately, calls coming out the PBX side need carry no identifying
information about the calling extension - many PBX's are set up to return some
fixed billing number for the whole company.  So:  It's easy to tap ALL calls
coming out of the company - but how to you fulfill a court order allowing you
to tap only those of the president?  Do you really want the outcome to be
that, in this case, the FBI is allowed to monitor ALL calls from the company?

Then there's the matter of "people shouldn't pay to have their own phones
tapped."  The lack of rationality in this argument is astonishing.  It's
like the argument:  "Don't bill the taxpayers for the S&amp;L bailout - let the
government pay for it."  If the FBI were to pay for the taps, where do you
think its money would come from?  Would you rather have the funding hidden in
an anonymous budget paid for out of general revenues, or out there for all to
see?  Object to the amount of money involved; object to this as a way around
a "no new taxes" pledge; object to the very principle of the FBI EVER tapping
phone conversations - but stop believing that government can give you some-
thing for nothing.

I submit that the right way to approach these issues is to first decide what
authority we consider it desirable and proper to grant the FBI and other
government agencies, then consider the effect of technological choices on their
ability to exercise that authority.  Here's an example: The much-argued
proposed requirement that carriers have the capability to provide the
government with the cleartext of encrypted messages.  Suppose we decide that
the current approach to tapping is correct: Upon presentation of appropriate
evidence, the FBI is authorized to tap a line from some point on.  Note that
they cannot require the telephone company to record calls on the theory that
they might later get a warrant to listen to them.

We can retain exactly this policy in a carrier-provided encryption system by
requiring that the carrier, upon receipt of an appropriate court order, record
and provide to the FBI all session keys created for the person being tapped.
Unless a person was being tapped, the carrier would be under no obligation to
record the keys; in fact, it should probably be obligated NOT to do so, just
to avoid a temptation to implicitly expand the tapping authority.

It is quite true that people can use encryption devices outside of the
carrier-provided system, thus rendering any aid the carrier can provide to
the FBI useless.  But there's nothing new here - that can be done today.

Any decisions about security and privacy must start with one fundamental
decision:  Whether we wish to provide privacy and security THROUGH LAW, or
whether we wish an absolute security and privacy INDEPENDENT OF LAW.  The
working bias I see in virtually all submissions on these subjects is toward
the latter approach.  I would urge those who take this approach to examine
their assumptions.  Do they, for example, take the same approach to other
kinds of protection provided by the government?  Do they believe, for example,
that we should banish policy departments and arm ourselves for our own
protection against criminals, since some police have been shown to be corrupt?

Fuzzy-Mitsubishi: Mitsubishi motors to use fuzzy logic to make cars safer
(Tokyo, 9 april 1992, kyodo)
   
    Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said Thursday it has developed a new automobile
safety feature that incorporates fuzzy logic chips to help reduce driver error
and fatigue.  Company officials said the system, called the Intelligent and
Innovative Vehicle Electronic Control System (INVECS), uses fuzzy logic to
control automatic transmissions, four-wheel drive and four-wheel steering
systems, traction control systems, and electronically controlled suspension
systems.
    Fuzzy logic is a mathematical technique which, like human logic, deals with
imprecise data that could lead to many solutions rather than one.
    The new transmission system automatically downshifts gears to improve
braking when the car is going downhill or when moving uphill shifts to a higher
gear to eliminate sluggishness, the officials said.  Currently, such shifting
decisions must be made by the driver.  Traction control systems will adjust
engine power to handle flat, uphill, and downhill roads, while four-wheel drive
controls vary the torque ratio between front and rear wheels to match driving
conditions.  The new four-wheel steering system moves the rear wheels in the
opposite direction of the front wheels to enhance low-speed steering maneuvers.
The new suspension system, which involves a sensor fitted to the front of the
car body, improves riding comfort by adjusting the car to height differences in
the road and lateral movement in the suspension system.
    The officials said Mitsubishi plans to introduce the new safety system in a
future car model.

&gt; Could use of "non-standard" or uncommon compression techniques to
&gt; facilitate high-speed data transmission also be undesirable for the NSA/FBI?

In my CACM article "Application of Splay Trees to Data Compression," CACM 31, 8
(Aug. 1988) 996-1007, I pointed out that many compression algorithms have
cryptographic applications.  Adaptive model based compression algorithms start
from an initial model state that converges as the data stream presented.  The
initial state of the model can be used as a key, and I proposed a trivial way
to do this by throwing the key string at the model used in the compression and
expansion programs prior to using those models to compress or expand data.

Here's the cryptographic algorithm, spelled out in painful detail:

    Encrypt:                      Decrypt:
      Initialize-model              Initialize-model
      for each ch in key loop       for each ch in key loop
         update-model(ch)              update-model(ch)
      end loop                      end loop
      loop                          loop
         get(ch)                       uncompress-and-receive(ch)
         compress-and-send(ch)         update-model(ch)
         update-model(ch)              put(ch)
      end loop when ch=eof          end loop when ch=eof

The above cryptographic algorithm works with my splay-tree-based codes, it
works with Whitten Neal and Cleary's arithmetic codes, and it can even be fixed
to work with such non-model-based adaptive compression schemes as LZW.  Of
course, some compression algorithms will make better encryption schemes than
others, but I am aware of only a small amount of research on this.

It is worth noting that although most compression algorithms can be trivially
modified to make them serve cryptographic purposes, I know of no attempt by the
US government to limit the export of such code.

I recently had two experiences with the telephone systems that leave me
wondering if anyone knows what they are doing.  I tried to make a call from a
pay phone outside a restaurant in Sunnyvale, CA, using my calling card.  The
call wouldn't go through.  The operator (from an alternative phone service)
said that their computer showed I was trying to make a call from a correctional
institution.  I guess to avoid toll fraud, prisoners aren't allowed to make
calling card calls.
 
In my next phone bill, (from an alternative phone service) there was a billing
on my calling card for two calls made from Ada Mich.  I've never been there and
so had the charges deleted and changed my pin number.  However after looking at
the numbers listed, I found one was to a friend in San Jose.  I now believe
that the alternative phone service's computers somehow read some local calls as
being made from Ada Mich.
 
What I'd like to know is how I can get all my calls misread so my phone bill
will be cut in half?
 
However, even though this seems amusing, it makes one wonder just how
inaccurate the alternative systems are.  If they make these screwups, how many
more do they make that are not detected?

AT+T finally caught on, but they really didn't make the point very well.
The "friends and family" database being built by that other phone
company will no doubt be sold so that when collecting a bill I will be
ab;le to dial in and find your relatives and friends - in case you skip
town.  When I market something to you successfully, I will be able to
claim your name when marketing to your friends and family.  You can
think of a lot of other examples of how this database might be abused.

          It is somehow deeply offensive to me to be solicited to give
the names of my friends and family in order to save money.  I almost
feel as if I am selling them out - literally!  Tell me what birth
control you use, and I will give you 10 bucks.  Tell me how you have sex
with your wife and I will give you 20!  But be careful - I may get you
arrested for having illegal sex!

          I have an idea - How about royalties on all data stored in databases.
If you keep data on me, I want you to pay me a dime per 80 bytes of info.  If
you sell it to someone else, I want 20% of gross as royalties.  If it is
inaccurate, I want to sue for damages.  This would of course be the best way to
control databases.  After all, why shouldn't I be able to sell you the right to
keep info on me.  This would also clarify the relationship - I own all
information about me, and you have to pay me to use it.  If you don't keep
accurate info, you are responsible for it - financially!  To make certain it's
right, you have to get my approval for its use.  No waivers permitted, and no
including this stuff in other agreements.  Otherwise it will all be put into
the standard contracts and people will hardly know it exists - but even that
would be better than the current situation.

In <A HREF="/Risks/13.38.html">RISKS-13.38</A> Dave Marvit (WGBH Associate Producer) writes that there is
nothing Orwellian in the multi-versioning of TV programmes, and "The machine
that changed the world/The dream machine" in particular. Contrariwise, I feel
that there is some element of "Newspeak" involved in the programmes to (I
quote) "reflect the interests and knowledge of the different audiences".  When,
for example, I see documented in programmes such as this "locals" such as Clive
Sinclair and Joe Lyons Tea Shops I begin to wonder whether items about
Bletchley Park Collossus, Manchester MADM, Cambridge EDSAC and other UK
contributions to history are also there "to reflect the interests and knowledge
of the different audiences". I can extend this analogy to imagine that the WGBH
transmission reflects local Massachusetts "interest and knowledge" and is in
some minor way different from the West coast and Central US transmissions for
the same reasons. These programs can then be shown to local undergrads and
every graduate will believe that "their" alma mater made *the* contribution to
world development, because they saw it on TV. If this is not the Orwellian view
of history then its pretty damn close.

 We are drifting away from computer risks here, so let me attempt to bring the
discussion back on track. If I applied my paranoid imagination to the Risks
mailing list itself I can easily ask the same question. How do we know that the
items we receive in the UK on Risks are the same that arrive in the US?  We
don't, and in fact they are not the same. There are local UK postings to Risks
readers that do not go to the US list. I can imagine for you an implementation
where Risks articles from the US are put through a "jive" filter before going
to the UK readership and vice-versa all UK contributions to the US list go
through a "biffa" filter. This would have the effect of making each country
think the other one was filled with yokels with a expletive filled vocabulary.
Luckily for us, Risks is also published in paper form which helps to
authenticate many of the contributions.

 For those of you who are interested in these things, there is a US court case
over the changing of TV programmes to "reflect the interests and knowledge of
the different audiences". It involves the first US airing of "Monty Pythons
Flying Circus" by a US network. The networks made "minor" changes to some
sketches (removing some expletives) for a US audience. The python team sued and
won, on the grounds that the changes substantially damaged their reputation.
PBS, as the US readers now know, eventually broadcast Python in its
unexpurgated form (BBC logos and all). Thanks should go to PBS for rendering
this public service.

 I hope readers don't think I'm trivialising the issue, or unnecessarily
attacking reputable programme makers. On the contrary I think these issues are
ones we should be aware of. We should "question" the media, and ensure that
makers of exemplary documentary programmes such as "Nova/Horizon" do not cross
that fine line between truth and ratings or history and Newspeak. When in the
US I showed my support of WGBH at pledge time.

In Risks 13.37, Fred Gilham, responded to a proposal ( in Risks 13.36 )
that an authoritative central database would provide protection against
the spread of inaccurate data through different databases.

&gt;... I think promulgation of inaccurate information should be legally
&gt;treated as a form of libel, ...
&gt;                                -Fred Gilham    gilham@csl.sri.com

That libel laws should be revised to take in to account libel by false inputs
into databases is undeniably true.  The problem with sole reliance on such laws
to protect people against false information is threefold.  It requires the
wronged person to file suit each time the false data is promulgated, it does
not set in place anything to stop further promulgations ( clearly, it's better
to prevent damages than to collect them ), and it does not provide any
protection to the operators of databases.  Though my proposal emphasized the
protection of people from the information in databases, I do not think it is in
the public interest to impede the dissemination of correct data, which I fear
successful libel prosecutions would, if they resulted in punitive damages
sufficient to be a deterrent. The central database, once a correction were
placed in it, would reduce further spread of the false data while greatly
simplifying any actions for promulgating false data that still became
necessary. It would also clarify the responsibility of the owners of databases
to check for false information while providing a way of doing so. The database
operator who has diligently checked the data received ( this would include
checking the central database, but would not exclude other reasonable means of
checking for errors ) should not be subject to the punitive damages that a more
careless operator would richly deserve.

I have just learned from (senior and middle level) administrators at our
campus, Cal. State U., Hayward, that serious consideration is being given
to electronic exchange of academic transcripts between universities (actually
between all levels of colleges, from community colleges on up).  Our campus
is apparently examining vendor information on such products, and I am told
that San Jose State is actually involved in a pilot project (? alpha test ?)
on this.  
	I have been able to get virtually no technical information from the
administrators involved, except that discussion of such a process has been
going on for some time among university admissions officers nation-wide and
that there is even a recent (or proposed) ANSI standard (in X12?) on the
matter.  I am also told, naturally, that there are real products out there
under development to implement such interchange.
     The system seems fraught with risks to me, especially since universities
form a much more heterogeneous (even anarchistic) community than, say, the
banking community.  My fragmentary information also indicates that there
have been made (or are being made) some possibly strange design decisions.
For example, it is reported that the products -- or the standard -- only
allow 3 digits for a "course number" field; since our campus has traditionally
used 4 digit course number, this would require renumbering the whole campus
in order to participate is such a system.
	Perhaps my main question is what sort of authentication/integrity
mechanisms are to be used in such a system. the proposed new DSS? something
DES based? something ad hoc?  Will it require universities to purchase
special hardware, or will it be software-based?
	I think this issue may be of interest to a number of RISKS readers
and that some of those readers may have good information to provide about
what is being developed for transcript interchange.  I, for one, would be
very interested in hearing more on this topic.

 Microsoft's new version of Windows includes an "enhanced" version of the
SmartDrv disk cache utility.  The primary enhancement is the addition of a
write-behind write cache.  The RISKy part of this is that the default for the
program is to enable the write cache on all hard drives; this is what the Setup
utility suggests as the "preferred" configuration!  Now, maybe I'm paranoid,
but it seems to me that this is going to cause LOTS of problems for naive users.
I'm especially worried because I don't believe that most casual users are going
to bother reading through the documentation to find the little notice that
says (on page 540):
 
   CAUTION  Check that SMARTDrive has completed all write-caching before you
   turn off your computer.  To make sure this has happened, type SMARTDRV /C
   at the MS-DOS prompt.  After all disk activity has stopped, you can safely
   turn off your computer.

Personally, I think Microsoft has an incredible amount of confidence in the
stability of 3.1, and in the diligence of the casual users; the decision to 
make this the default mode of operation was, in my view, ill advised.

The October 1991 issue of the New York University Law Review contained a note
titled "Rethinking Adoption: A Federal Solution to the Problem of Permanency
Planning for Children with Special Needs".  On the front cover of the journal
and in the table of contents the note was listed with the word "abortion" used
in place of "adoption".  The correct title appeared on the note itself. Editors
apparently only discovered the error when the received their advance copies,
although it was also pointed out to them in a letter from Supreme Court Justice
Harry Blackmun -- one of the authors of Roe v. Wade.  [From: The National
Jurist, March 1992, page 4]

One of our local NPR (WBUR) stations had, in its morning news report, a story
about a company that was developing a new twist in the application
of voice recognition technologies. [I don't include the name of the company
as I wasn't taking notes, and wouldn't want to needlessly slur the
wrong company, or even the right one by my errors of recollection.]

Their goal is to develop a system that would be able to recognize not the
words, but who the speaker is. The applications they envision would include
control of parolees and those under house arrest, as well as the replacement of
PINs. This is how they envision their system working:

	o The person who is to be monitored goes physically to the office
	  doing the monitoring and records a set of words.
	o When the time comes for the person to be monitored to report in,
	  they make a phone call to a computer system.
	o Caller-ID identifies who is supposed to be calling and
	  their alleged physical location.
	o The system presents random challenge sentences that include some
	  of the words used in step one. (One example: The purple television
	  is exciting. "Television" and "exciting" would have been recorded.)
	o The system then isolates the pre-recorded words, compares the
	  vocal characteristics and identifies the speaker.

Interesting concept. The company was quite proud that they had taken what has
been a serious problem with voice recognition (voices are so different) and
turned it into a technological advantage. It was asserted that a number of
state correctional departments are interested in this as a replacement for the
electronic bracelets that are now sometimes used to monitor house arrest and
that have been discussed at length in RISKS.

The news report indicated that this system would be secure, as the comparison
of vocal characteristics is not fooled by normal voice mimicry. It was also
felt that, while parolees, for example, could be compelled to speak silly
meaningless sentences into the phone, it might not be possible to do this
generally so as to replace PINs.

This system seems so easy to defeat that I feel I must be missing something.
When you go to record your words, bring your own micro-cassette recorder
so that you've got an accurate list of the challenge words. Record and
digitize them in your home personal computer. When time comes to report
in, have your computer call their computer. Their challenge system seems
quite structured (it already knows who you are supposed to be from the
caller ID), so program your machine to wait for the challenge sentences.
Recognize the right words from the list of the ones you've prerecorded,
and synthesize a response based on replaying the challenge sentence,
inserting your prerecorded words as necessary.

This technology is likely not within the reach of  your average parolee, but
should this system be used to authorize large financial transfers, the risk of
fraud should be obvious.

New York state's legislature is currently debating a proposal that would
require Medicaid recipients to carry a photo ID and to be fingerprinted.  While
I think the proposal has a number of risks, for example amputees could
experience _another_ cutback...

Seriously, this week's _Legislative Gazette_ (Apr 6 '92) amusingly demonstrates
the risks of leaving politics to the politicians.  Here are some of the
insights:

  Sen Hollings of NYC says between $150 million and $2 billion is
  wasted by fraudulent individuals.  (Talk about ballpark figures)

  Hollings: "It scares me to think of all the people that could have
  benefited from this money."  (Well _some_ of those medicaid recipients
  are frightening.  :-)

  Republicans claim a similar system in LA saved the state $5 million
  in the first year of operation. 
  With the electronic system, an individual places two fingers on a small
  flat screen.  A computer then compares the fingerprints to those already
  on file.

  Sen Farley of Schenectady said it didn't hurt, it wasn't messy and it
  took just a few seconds.  (If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing
  to fear.)

  The system costs LA $2 million a year, but Farley says the cost doesn't
  compare with the savings (!?!).  He estimates that New York could save
  $16 million a year.

So there you have it, a system that will catch somewhere between 11% and 0.8%
of the total fraud for the bargain price of $2 million a year plus the setup
fee.  Shouldn't we have a better estimate if we are going to measure the
benefits of the system?

Further, I wonder how much saving can be attributed to the effectiveness of the
system and how much is due to the perceived effectiveness of the system.  There
is this "scarecrow" effect that may not last in the long run.  Perhaps some
people will find work arounds.  Perhaps New York should install a fake
fingerprinting system with fake computers and fake databases at a lower cost
and still get the same savings.  Plus none of the civil liberties risks...

But no, this is not science, it is politics.  
...fraudulent individuals wasting billions

A while back I called a number of local insurance agents, getting quotes for my
MR-2.  During each call I made sure the agent knew 1) the MR-2 is an undiluted
sports-car and 2) I have a clean driving record.  (These are not mutually
exclusive, though you will never get an insurance underwriter to admit it!)

Prudential Insurance quoted me a good rate ($430, vs. my current $620).  I
spent a lunch hour with the agent as he provided me an official quote from a
worksheet program, signed a contract and paid the initial installment.

This worksheet program required the agent to specify insurance pool, type of
vehicle, driver(s), mileage, etc.  It even asked if my car was sheltered at
home and/or work.  This was definitely _not_ a program an agent cobbled
together in his spare time.

Over a _month_ later I finally received my permanent insurance policy,
including a demand for much more money.  $690 (total), to be precise.
Prudential quickly agreed that all of the information I provided was correct --
it simply took them a month to notice that the agent had placed me in the
incorrect insurance pool.

There was absolutely no indication in the quote worksheet program that new
clients with MR-2s would not be accepted into the specified insurance pool --
it was 'assumed' the agent would know that.  Unfortunately my agent only
recently started working for Prudential and did not know MR-2s fell into this
category.

At the current time, Prudential is insisting I pay the new amount despite being
quoted a lower rate with accurate information.  For now, I'm left paying more
for insurance than I was with my previous insurer.

Meanwhile, I am filing a formal complaint with the state's Insurance Commission
and Attorney General (was this bait-and-switch?), to say nothing of telling
everyone within earshot about my experience.  Prudential's legal expenses, in
responding to these complaints, will almost certainly exceed the insurance
premium.

The moral of the story: if you use a computer to determine contractual prices,
if there are any 'gotchas' they should be explicitly noted by the software.  I
could accept Prudential changing the quoted rate if I mislead them about my
driving history -- but not due to their failure to conduct business in accord
with their own (internal) underwriting standards.

   &gt;change the orbit of asteroids heading towards the earth

About 25% of the risk is due to comets.

   &gt;4. NASA held two workshops to discuss this problem.

One of my co-workers, Dr. Brian Tillotson, attended one of the workshops, and I
am working on a contract for the NASA guy who is responsible for this stuff
(John Rather, NASA Asst. Director for Space Technology), although what I am
working on is another subject (Laser power beaming).

   &gt;6. The last big collision of an asteroid with the earth was about 65 mill...

Don't forget about the Tunguska impact in 1908, and the impact that caused
Meteor Crater about 25,000 years ago.  We have lousy statistics on
Earth-approaching asteroids in the 1-km size class (smaller than the supposed
dinosaur killer, but still in the multi-gigaton of TNT energy class.  There is
expected to be on the order of 1000 of these, but we know of about 50 or so.

As for the risks/benefits:

In the past a large sudden explosion could happen and not much consequence
beyond the immediate damage from the impact.  Today, with early warning
satellites in orbit, a meteorite impact could look suspiciously like a nuclear
explosion.  If it happened to be a sensitive military or political location
that got hit, it could touch off a war.  Even a kiloton impact (which would be
much more common than a big one), could have this effect if it landed in the
wrong place.  So there is value in being able to detect incoming rocks and warn
people beforehand, even if you can't deflect/destroy it.

Another side benefit, is getting good orbits for all these objects for later
asteroid mining.  The ones that come near the Earth are the ones that
potentially are easiest to access for mining.

Long period comets are not mappable the way asteroids are, since they come from
the depths of the Oort cloud, way beyond Pluto.  They do make themselves bloody
obvious when they get to the inner solar system, so finding them is not the
problem.  Fortunately they have the consistency of a mudball, so blowing them
away with a nuke is relatively easy.  An iron-nickel asteroid, on the other
hand, is a much harder problem to deal with.  It is structurally harder and
more difficult to vaporize.  The issues of how to deal with these are more
challenging.  For now, the recommendations to upgrade the search for asteroids
seems a fairly small cost to address a fairly small risk.

In a real emergency (comet discovered heading right for Earth, impact in 2
months), you can be sure that a nuke would get mounted on whatever rocket is
handy in very short order and launched for an attempted interception.  You can
get a lot done if you work around the clock.

I don't know much about the laws in this area, but I have been following the
Rodney King trial, where no-one involved knew they were being taped.  Does the
admission of this evidence set a new precedent?

If such evidence can be used against you, the obvious risk is that your
privacy can be invaded on a massive scale in order to obtain the evidence.
Of course they can invade your privacy already, they just can't use the
results as evidence ;-) unless they've done their paperwork.

It would appear that permission, knowledge, or other prior information is not
necessary for the use of taped materials in many cases, nor is it necessary for
the person making the tape to be an "involved" party.  A perfect example is
playing itself out in the Los Angeles area right now, where the infamous
"Rodney King" beating trial is drawing to a close.  The most important evidence
in the trial has been the videotape made by an uninvolved person living across
the street.  One would assume that the police involved did not have knowledge
of the taping at the time of the event.

The following article appeared in The Daily Californian, an independent
newspaper distributed at UC Berkeley, April 14, 1992:

NO CLASSES FOR UNDECLARED IN TELEBEARS LIMBO

  UC Berkeley sophomore Erica Oliver is caught in a registration Catch-22.
Oliver says Tele-BEARS, the new registration-by-phone system heralded by
students and administrators as a faster, more efficient way to get classes,
won't let her enroll at all.  The system will not place Oliver in the
lower-division classes she needs to declare her major because she will be a
junior next fall, but won't allow her to enroll in any upper division classes
in her major because she hasn't declared it yet.

  "It makes me feel very frustrated," Oliver said.  "I just can't figure out
why in the world I'm paying this university if I can't get any classes."

  The phone-in system, initiated on campus last fall by a test group of 4,200
graduating seniors, guarantees students up to the maximum number of units their
college allows.  But the system doesn't guarantee students will be able to get
into classes they need in order to declare or fulfill major requirements.

  "Being a Junior, it's kind of late for not fulfilling the major
requirements," Jorge Garza, acting associate registrar, said of Oliver's
predicament.  Garza said he recommends to students in situations similar to
Oliver's to talk to an advisor about getting into the prerequisite classes.

  But Margaret Distasi, director of student advising in Campbell Hall, said it
may be difficult for undeclared students to get classes because major
departments may reserve courses for declared students by prohibiting undeclared
students from enrolling.  Garza said students will simply have to declare as
soon as possible in order to register for classes.  "This is going to force
students to process their paperwork (for declaring) faster," Garza said.

  Garza said his office sent out more than 5,000 letters to students last fall
offering a Tele-BEARS training session to inform students about how to prepare
themselves for using the system.  Only 39 students attended the session.

  But on its second day of use by the whole campus, Garza said the registration
process is going fairly smoothly.  "Most students are getting classes even if
they're not the ones they want because they haven't fulfilled certain
requirements," Garza said.  Tele-BEARS is scheduled to take 85 calls every 15
minutes during its operational hours, which Garza said would register the
entire student population in 10 days.

  [End of Quote]

This phone-activated registration system seems to avoid many of the risks that
others have remarked on for similar systems at other universities.  Each
student is assigned a PIN unrelated to the student ID number.  Each student has
several possible time periods in which to register spread over the 10 day
period.  We won't know until it is through how many students will miss their
time slots or otherwise fail to register properly, but the written information
seems pretty clear and complete.

What are the RISKS here?

For one thing, they thought they had done a large-scale test of the system by
having over 4000 students use it last semester.  The flaw was that by limiting
the test group to graduating seniors, they didn't test any number of
complications that may only occur for undeclared students, freshmen, transfers,
part-time students, those changing majors, etc.  Repeating a simple test many
times is not the same thing as showing that a procedure is flexible enough to
handle the full spectrum of real-world inputs.  They might have done a much
better test by having 400 students from a range of departments and classes use
the system rather than 4000 all from one class.  (Of course, selecting students
for the test at random might have been even better; by deliberately choosing
some from every major, they might well have forgotten to test undeclared
students.)

The second risk is less obvious.  At the same time they replaced mail-in
registration with the phone-in system, they changed the algorithm by which they
assigned classes.  Like many universities, Berkeley has difficulty offering
enough sections of certain classes to satisfy demand.  In the past, little
checking was done to see whether a student was eligible to take a requested
class.  Now, many departments can limit registration in certain courses to
students who have declared a major in that department.  Apparently, they also
now limit the ability of 3rd-year students to take lower division classed as
well.  Here the new method of ACCESSING the registration system is being blamed
for a problem that could just as easily have arisen in the old one.

A third risk is best exemplified by the final quote from Garza.  He appears to
have changed the definition of successful registration from "getting the
classes you want or need," to "getting any classes at all."  It is hard to tell
whether this is a case of retroactively changing the goals of a project to
match the accomplishments, or whether this is just the way registrar's office
droids see the problem of registration.

I don't understand what the objective of such transfers would be, since most
schools require authenticated paper copies of such documents before acting on
them in any serious manner (such as admitting a student). The risks associated
with restricting access to those authorized (not only to see any transcripts,
but also to see specific transcripts - of designated individuals) seem quite
high.

On another aspect - the course numbering system - let me relate our experience
at the University of Minnesota with computerized academic record keeping. Such
records were kept by hand (pen and ink!) for longer than any one of us would
believe. Then about 15-20 years ago they decided to install a computer to do
the job. Before the change we had courses with identifiers that contained both
letters and numbers, and some with one but not the other. For example, non-
credit courses just had letters ("Math T" was remedial trig). And sequence
courses had the same number with letter appendages (EE 30A, 30B, 30C). But then
someone announced that the computer could only handle four-digit course numbers
and we went through a long transition. This entailed conversion booklets working
in both directions, and confusion among faculty who were used to advising the
students based on the old numbers. After about three years it wore off. In EE
we did obtain an advantage from the conversion - I suggested that we renumber
so that the course number also indicated the sub-area within EE (thus computer
related courses have numbers x350-x399 or x850-899, where x=3, 5, or 8). Why
the x restriction? Well, nobody on campus is allowed to use numbers starting
with 2, 4, 6, 7, or 9. And 0 and 1 correspond to no credit and lower division
material, which doesn't include computers. (A long digression, but perhaps
interesting to others... I think that the difficulty of conversion, etc. makes
any "standard" that doesn't encompass ALL course numbering systems worthless.
BUT that assumes that the access control and authentication issues are also
satisfactorily resolved!)

Yes, it is true. The American Association of Collegiate Registrars and
Admissions Officers (AACRAO) has a committee on SPEEDE (nifty eh!) for
developing a national standard format for exchanging student transcripts over
networks.

I agree with Bill Nico that the undertaking is fraught with risks but so
is a trip to outer space. The important question is as Nico asks later
what controls are being built in? I hope Bill is aware that grades can
be obtained in several institutions over the phone even today.

The controls are no small matter because under the Family Education
Rights Privacy Act (FERPA - Buckley Amendment) Universities must obtain
written consent of the student before disclosing private records such as
transcripts. I have seen this rule applied even when the person
requesting the records is a parent of the student concerned.

I am also sure that a RISKS spotlight on this subject will help improve
the controls in the system.

&gt;&gt; [...] PBS will present "The Machine that Changed the World,"[...] 
&gt;&gt; Perhaps it is risky not to see how our
&gt;&gt; industry is being popularized for the mass media.

Very true, I think.  For example, in the very first program, I was
interested to find out that Turing had established that anything a human
can do, a computer can do. 

Of course, on the other hand, a PBS series a year or two ago included the
interesting fact that Searle had established that computers could never have
true understanding.

&gt; Their coverage of the historical material was the most accurate and
&gt; even handed I have ever seen.  Their coverage of risks issues is also
&gt; exemplary.  I could seriously use them in undergraduate teaching and did
&gt; not regard them in any way as "technopulp" for the masses. 

Hmmmm.  I've only seen the first one so far, but it really seemed to fall prey
to the common risk of many popularizations and simplifications of "scientific"
results.  A few other examples of the kind of thing I'm thinking of from
physics: quantum theory "proves" that Zen Buddhism or Taoism or
whatever-"eastern"-ism is correct after all, chaos theory is the explanation of
QM effects, the uncertainty principle arises because observers affect the
observed.

The problem is that in simplifying and dramatizing and analogizing ideas
for presentation to "the public", much of the actual information is
squeezed out, and incorrect factoids creep in as replacement.  It isn't
at all apparent what can be done about it, but it seems to me to be both
commonplace and quite RISKy. 

Mind you, I don't disagree that the series is "historically accurate",
and I have no problem recommending it, if you watch it with a large
grain of salt to hand.  But it seems to me to be too quick to
oversimplify complicated issues (such as the Turing bit above, and the
reason binary encodings were eventually settled on, and many more).

A few things shot by in last night's presentation that struck me as
surprisingly pseudo-techno (rather than thoroughly techno, as most of the
content of the programs have been).  The most amusing was in the discussion of
"higher level languages," during which a FORTRAN program scrolled by.  It
looked like FORTRAN in form, but close inspection revealed lines of code like:
       151=15+1
An interesting assertion, but I suspect that even FORTRAN 66 compilers would
reject it (rather than causing the booster rocket to fly off course, etc...).

Somebody had to do a whole lot of typing to create the "program."  T'would have
been much easier to use a real FORTRAN source (but of course this would
introduce other RISKs that have been oft-discussed in this forum).

In Risks 13:39, Brian Tompsett says:

	PBS, as the US readers now know, eventually broadcast Python in its
	unexpurgated form (BBC logos and all). Thanks should go to PBS for
	rendering this public service.

Alas, PBS have (at least partially) stopped doing this. Last year's rerun of I,
Claudius had previously broadcast scenes cut from it (this was hinted at, but
not spelled out, in Alistair Cooke's introduction). WNET (my local big PBS
station) claimed that they presented the program the way it was given to them
by WGBH. Paradoxically, WGBH's retail offshoot (Signals), in its advert for the
videotapes of the series, claims that ``this is the original, uncut, British
production, including some scenes not shown in the PBS broadcast''.

I have noticed that the ``same'' programs shown on the BBC and on PBS often
have cuts, usually relating to sex scenes, when they are broadcast in the US.
I, too, showed my feelings about the issue at pledge time, by *withholding*
support, and telling the stations exactly why I was doing so.

&gt;  For those of you who are interested in these things, there is a US
&gt; court case over the changing of TV programmes to "reflect the
&gt; interests and knowledge of the different audiences". It involves the
&gt; first US airing of "Monty Pythons Flying Circus" by a US network.
&gt; The networks made "minor" changes to some sketches (removing some
&gt; expletives) for a US audience. 

Actually, this isn't quite true.  ABC (the network in question) SAID that all
they were going to do was remove expletives.  In reality, they were editing
three 30-minute shows down into one 68-minute show, allowing some 24 minutes
for commercials (i.e. they removed almost 25% of the material.)  They deleted
sketches, rearranged the order of some of them, etc.  ABC did not make minor
edits--they performed major surgery.  It's sort of like going under the knife
for an ingrown toenail and emerging minus one leg.

&gt; 				The python team sued and won, on the
&gt; grounds that the changes substantially damaged their reputation.
&gt; PBS, as the US readers now know, eventually broadcast Python in its
&gt; unexpurgated form (BBC logos and all). 

Yes, well, the changes *did* substantially alter the content of the program,
and make the group appear to be less funny than they were.  (For reference, see
the excellent book by Robert Hewison, "Monty Python: The Case Against", ISBN
0-413-48660-5.)

In the case of "The Machine That Changed The World", imagine trying to fit
commercials into it, say at 8 minutes per half hour.  (That seems to be close
to the going rate here in the States.)  Again, you'd have to lose about 1/4 of
the program.  I'd worry if they made edits because they don't want to offend
"Mr. and Mrs. America".  [... SLIGHTLY IMMODERATE BUT LIKELY EXAMPLES DELETED

The Intercept law proposed by the FBI is in need of the full support of the
cyberspace community but requires some additions that are disturbingly absent.
The proposed amendment to the Communications act of 1934 is necessary to
perpetuate an essential capability of law enforcement to protect the public
from crime and particularly to protect the privacy of individuals whose
personal information is communicated.  However, it has serious shortcomings
that must be corrected that I hope organizations such as EFF and CPSR can
address that are needed to protect all the stakeholders from unauthorized use
and misuse of the interception capability.  Clearly, access and usage security
controls are needed.  In addition, recording of all intercept activity is
needed for audit and evidential purposes.  Finally, only the FCC rulemaking
proceedings should be kept secret that would aid and abet unauthorized persons
to abuse the capability to use the intercept capability for bad purposes; some
detailed information about the auditing and safeguarding must not be revealed.

The providers and PBX operators probably require the interception capabilities
anyway for maintenance and line quality testing.  However, my suggested
additions would help ensure that interception for whatever reasons would not be
misused, and abusers could more effectively be prosecuted.

There has been a lot of debate about whether a person can be videotaped (or
audiotaped) without consent.  The quick answer is it depends.  Of course you
can videotape people or objects if they are in the public view -- they have no
legitimate expectations of privacy.  Just look at The Star or other tabloids
that routinely photograph people on the streets.  There are limitations,
however.  There is a common law tort of interference with or invasion of
privacy, as well as exploitation of a person's likeness for financial gain.
(Suppose the "Coppertone" girl decided to sue).  From a Fourth Amendment
standpoint, a videotape in a public place is not an "unreasonable search or
seizure."

Videotapes in PRIVATE places are another matter.  Because they enable the
government to see what otherwise cannot be seen, and therefore impart
information to the government, they MAY constitute searches in Fourth Amendment
terms.  NOTE that the search (e.g., the videotaping) MUST entail some state
action -- be performed at the behest of law enforcement.  No state action -- no
fourth amendment violation.  (This does not prevent a private suit for
interference with privacy, however).  There is an exception recognized in Katz
v. United States.  That is, what Katz called the "invited ear" exception.  You
ALWAYS run the risk that the person you visit is videotaping you.  (OR, in
Katz, audiotaping you).  This has led to the development of the law of
one-party consent.  IN GENERAL, one party to a conversation may consent to its
being recorded.  Exceptions exist in many jurisdictions for TELEPHONE
conversations where the state law may require two party consent.

If the law always required two-party consent to video/audio recording, imagine
the effect on -- for example -- television news.  No more undercover recodings
-- no more 60 Minutes.  No more panoramic sweeps (consent from all the
pedestrians??).

Finally, in the electronic environment things are even more screwy.  Telephone
calls are covered by privacy laws, FCC regulations, wiretap and surveillance
laws, warrant requirements and the like.  Electronic communications may also be
covered by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Privacy Protection
Act, and (a la Steve Jackson) the First Amendment.

The turgidity continues.

I would like to address what Jerry Leichter &lt;leichter@lrw.com&gt; said in
<A HREF="/Risks/13.39.html">RISKS-13.39</A>. I agree with what he said about the ability of the FBI and other
police authorities to tap into phone conversations being curtailed by the
advances in technology. What I disagree with is that this is a bad thing. It
seems to me that if tapping a phone conversation is difficult and expensive and
the funding for such efforts comes out of the budget of the police agency
involved, then it is far more likely that such tapping will be used with
restraint, than if using it is cheap and easy.

If anything I'm worried that technology is going too far in the other
direction. I suspect that the major cost of any phone tap isn't the cost of
placing the tap and recording the conversations, but in paying people to listen
to them. It isn't collecting data that is expensive, but analyzing it. With the
advent of computer voice recognition in the next few years, it is quite
possible that this cost will decrease drastically, maybe by an order of
magnitude or more as the technology improves.

As the saying goes, government is a dangerous servant and a terrible
master.  A prudent citizen will try to ensure that powers of government
are strictly curtailed and a close eye is kept to make sure these powers
are neither abused or exceeded either through malice or an excess of zeal.

I keeping asking myself, how is the FBI proposal different from one that would
require audio and video surveillance equipment be placed in every home at the
expense of the home owner? Even if there were strict controls to make sure the
equipment was never used without a court order, I doubt that most people would
approve of it. What if the FBI required me to not seal my envelopes, since it
would inhibit their ability to surreptitiously read my mail? It's not so much
that idea that they want me to pay for it, it is the idea that want me to pay
to give them capabilities that I'd be willing to pay for them NOT to have.

As for Mr. Leichter's police analogy, it is rather flawed. A better question to
ask is should we forego the right of self-protection, because some criminals
misuse the technology involved and always trust that the government will be
able to protect us and will never oppress us? Some people think so, but I'm not
one of them.

The debate over the FBI's proposal to ensure wiretappability of digital phone
technologies largely misses the point. This is especially true for Jerry
Leichter's recent comments.

I think it is reasonable to ask whether any proposed restrictive legislation
will be effective in its intended purpose.  If the answer is "no", then it is
entirely pointless to debate the merits of a bill's goals, no matter how
desirable they may seem.

I submit that the FBI's measure will ultimately prove ineffective, for one very
simple reason: user-provided end-to-end encryption. Like it or not, it is only
a matter of time before most criminals routinely use it to thwart wiretaps.
Encryption is uncontrollable because the encryption-specific parts of a system
can be implemented entirely in software if necessary. It need only use cheap,
readily available generic computer hardware that cannot be practically
controlled in a modern industrial society.

The means to protect textual communications from wiretapping are already
readily available. All it takes is a sufficiently motivated user. Someone, say,
with good reason to fear an FBI wiretap.  And before long the generic hardware
necessary for secure voice communications will be just as cheap and widespread.

Eventually, the FBI's wiretap facilities will be effective only against those
few remaining criminals too stupid to encrypt.  And they could also be quite
effective against those law-abiding companies and individuals who, instead of
providing their own cryptographic privacy, blindly trust whatever "safeguards"
(legal and/or technical) are supposedly in place to prevent their misuse.
Quite frankly, after the Nixon years it's hard to have much faith in legal
safeguards, and I know too much about telco technology to have much faith in
technical safeguards.

Most readers of this list are highly computer literate, so these may seem like
obvious statements. But they are apparently not so obvious to many in
government policymaking positions. Our real problem is how to educate these
people about the nature of cryptography, why it will be impossible for the FBI
to maintain its precious "status quo", and to begin thinking about how they can
*realistically* deal with the future instead of trying to force a return to the
past.

We urgently need to get these people to understand the following:

1. The use of cryptography by criminals to thwart wiretaps is inevitable in
anything remotely resembling a modern free society.  You don't even want to
contemplate living in a state with truly effective ways to prevent the private
use of encryption.  So we might as well promote, not restrict, the widespread
use of encryption so that law-abiding persons can benefit from it as well.

2. As the utility of the wiretap decreases, law enforcement will have to rely
other ways to collect evidence. Informers, for example, or testimony compelled
under grants of immunity.  Eventually the government might even have to
consider abandoning its attempts to penalize certain types of behavior that
consist largely or entirely of communications or the mere possession of
information.

Unfortunately, our government's historical inability to accept the inevitable
without a long, wasteful and futile fight does not give me much hope that we'll
avoid one this time.

	I submit that the biggest risks in dealing with a system that allows
single point phone tapping can be better addressed in questions far more basic
then of trusting the good intentions of any agency itself.  Rather we might
first examine:

	1) The number of lives and total value of all information  to
           be entrusted to such a system.
	2) The ability of such an agency to protect the proposed
	   system from misuse by outside forces.
	3) The social and monetary costs including the risks generated
	   from proposed system vs that of the former system .

	So even if one fully trusts the intentions of an agency we might not
sleep better knowing that we have in effect put up a big sign saying to all
would be criminals "in order to save you time we have placed all are eggs in
this basket right here"...

James Zuchelli seems surprised that he would have calls billed by Alternate
Operator Services companies from places he's never never been.  The practice is
known as 'Splashing', and arises from the arrangements among smaller long
distance carriers and operator services companies.  His call was presumably
handled by an operator company in Ada, Michigan who were unable to determine
the true point of origin of the call.  They would bill the call to a calling
card as being from their location to the actual called number.  Congress and
the FCC do not seem to feel that this practice was one of the benefits intended
to follow from the break up of the Bell System, and seem to have initiated
proceedings to ensure that all calls will be billed based on the true point of
origin.

The FBI/encryption/privacy debate has been interesting. Obviously the FBI will
only be successful in interpreting data from wiretaps if they can manage to
stay abreast of technology. The usual file archiving and compression schemes
are meant to be easy to use, so any reasonbly aware user will recognize from
file naming conventions what decompression techniques to use.  They could
become the basis for encryption schemes, but it seems reasonable to suppose
that they would tend to have signatures that a knowledgeable spook could
recognize fairly easily.  In the same way, the FBI would have to keep abreast
of technology and learn to use any widely used speech compression technology.
ISDN makes end to end encryption of speech a little easier than it once was,
since speech is readily available for manipulation in digital form at either
end.  However, it's possible to compress digital speech from the 64K bit/sec
rate ISDN normally uses to rates as low as 2400 bit/sec with some loss of
fidelity, and that would allow a digital stream to be encrypted and transmitted
on a fairly ordinary analogue line.  Any digital switch would allow the FBI to
wiretap such a call, but it would take them a good deal of effort to make sense
of it.

Ultimately it seems unlikely that laws against using encryption will deter
people who are already breaking more serious laws.  They will affect people
with legitimate needs for privacy such as protection of trade secrets and
financial information.  Restrictions on American trade will clearly not apply
abroad, and can only work to the disadvantage of American (free?) enterprise.
The FBI may wish for simpler times, but in the long run it seems like they'll
have to heat their buildings with Crays and learn to be as good at cryptography
as the bad guys.  After all, the first working electronic computer may have
been Colossus, which was built to do cryptography.

&gt;I'm disturbed . . . .  The general approach seems to be based on 
&gt;the idea that government is not to be trusted, ever, with anything.  
&gt;Nothing government says is to be believed.  

Many of us do feel that the history of government lies on issues large and
small preclude believing what government tells us without substantial
additional evidence.  Sure, there are many good people in government, and many
useful functions performed by it.  But we really do differ from you in having
enough concern for civil liberties to willingly, even enthusiastically accept
some inefficiency and some additional crime in return for stronger guarantees
of privacy and freedom for the great masses of people who are basically decent,
including ourselves and our friends.

&gt;Let's take the FBI "phone tapping" proposal.

Many of us, while tolerant of occasional phone-tapping under a difficult-to-get
court order, might prefer no phone-tapping at all to tapping under
easy-to-obtain court orders or widespread tapping of any sort.

&gt;Do they believe ... that we should banish policy [sic] departments 
&gt;and arm ourselves for our own protection against criminals ... ? 

We might not advocate the abolition of police departments because they have not
yet become that extremely corrupt.  But for other reasons -- including the
physical inability of even a large police force to provide protection at the
level that could assure everyone's safety from assault, burglary, rape, and
murder -- we certainly support possession of firearms by adult citizens,
perhaps even required possession and required training.  This threat of
self-defense would produce a far greater reduction in violent crime than any
law could.

The risks issue, as I see it: I'm happy to assume the (perceived small) risk
that my neighbor will shoot me, in place of the (perceived much larger) risk
that either a criminal will attack my family and friends while we are
defenseless or that at some future time only a fully armed population could
save itself from a would-be-totalitarian government (either home-grown or
invading).  It is no accident that the Soviet Union's first action after taking
over Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland was the seizure of privately owned
firearms.

Attached is a copy of the FBI's proposed law which would prevent telephone
companies and PBX operators from using equipment which would inhibit the
government's ability to perform wiretaps.  This was uploaded to the Well by
Mike Godwin of the EFF.

   102nd Congress
   2nd Session
                      Amendment  No.
                      Offered by M.

1.   SEC. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES
2.   (a)    The Congress finds:
3.      (1) that telecommunications systems and networks are often
4     used in the furtherance of criminal activities including
5     organized crime, racketeering, extortion, kidnapping, espionage,
6     terrorism, and trafficking in illegal drugs; and
7       (2 ) that recent and continuing advances in
8     telecommunications technology, and the introduction of new
9     technologies and transmission modes by the telecommunications
10    industry, have made it increasingly difficult for government
11    agencies to implement lawful orders or authorizations to
12    intercept communications and thus threaten the ability of such
13    agencies effectively to enfore the laws and protect the national
14    security; and
15      (3) without the assistance and cooperation of providers of
16    electronic communication services and private branch exchange
17    operators, the introduction of new technologies and transmission
18    modes into telecommunications systems without consideration and
19    accommodation of the need of government agencies lawfully to
20    intercept communications, would impede the ability of such
21    agencies effectively to carry out their responsibilities.

1   The purpose of this Act are:
2      (1) to clarify the duty of providers of electronic
3   communication services and private branch exchange operators to
4   provide such assistance as necessary to ensure the ability of
5   government agencies to implement lawful orders or authorizations
6   to intercept communications; and
7      (2) to ensure that the Federal Communications Commission,
8   in the setting of standards affecting providers of electronic 
9   communication services or private branch exchange operators, will
10  accommodate the need of government agencies lawfully to intercept
11  communications.

12    SEC. 2.    Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended
13   by adding at the end thereof the following new sections:
14       "Sec__.  GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS
15       "(a) The Federal Communications Commission shall,
16    within 120 days after enactment of this Act, issue such
17    regulations as are necessary to ensure that the government
18    can intercept communications when such interception is
19    otherwise lawfully authorized
20      "(b) The regulations issued by the commission shall:
21        "(1) establish standards and specifications for
22         telecommunications equipment and technology employed by
23         providers of electronic communication services or
24         private branch exchange operators as may be necessary
25         to maintain the ability of the government to lawfully
26         intercept communication

1          "(2) require that any telecommunications
2         equipment or technology which impedes the ability of
3         the government to lawfully intercept communications and
4         and which has been introduced into a telecommunications
5         system by providers of electronic communication
6         services or private branch exchange operators shall not
7         expanded so as to further impede such utility until
8         that telecommunications equpment or technology is
9         brought into compliance with the requirements set forth
10        in regulations issued by the Commission;
11         "(3) require that modifications which are
12        necessary to be made to existing telecommunications
13        equipment or technology to eliminate impediments to the
14        ability of the government to lawfully intercept
15        communications shall be implemented by such providers
16        of electronic communication services and private branch
17        exchange operators within 180 days of issuance of such 
18        regulations; and
19         "(4) prohibit the use by electronic communication
20        service providers and private branch exchange operators
21        of any telecommunications equipment or technology which
22        does not comply with the regulations issued under this 
23        section after the 180th day following the issuance of
24        such regulations.
25    "(c) For the purposes of administering and enforcing
26     the provisions of this section and the regulations

1      prescribed hereunder, the Commission shall have the same
2      authority, power, and functions with respect to providers of
3      electronic communication services or private branch exchange
4      operators as the Commission has in administering and
5      enforcing the provisions of this title with respect to any
6      common carrier otherwise subject to Commission jurisdiction.
7      Any violation of this section by any provider of electronic
8      communication service or any private branch exchange
9      operator shall be subject to the same remedies, penalties,
10     and procedures as are applicable to a violation of this
11     chapter by a common carrier otherwise subject to Commission
12     jurisdiction, except as otherwise specified in subsection
13     (d).
14     "(d) In addition to any enforcement authorities vested
15     in the Commission under this title, the Attorney General may
16     apply to the appropriate United States District Court for a
17     restraining order or injunction against any provider of
18     electronic communication service or private branch exchange
19     operator based upon a failure to comply with the provisions 
20     of this section or regulations prescribed hereunder.
21     "(e) Any person who willfully violates any provision
22     of the regulations issued by the Commission pursuant to
23     subjection (a) of this section shall be subject to a civil
24     penalty of $10,000 per day for each day in violation.
25     "(f) To the extent consistent with the setting or
26     implementation of just and reasonable rates, charges and


1      classifications, the Commission shall authorize the
2      compensation of any electronic communication service
3      providers or other entities whose rates or charges are
4      subject to its jurisdiction for the reasonable costs
5      associated with such modifications of existing
6      telecommunications equipment or technology, or with the
7      development or procurement, and the installation of such
8      telecommunications equipment or technology as is necessary
9      to carry out the purposes of this Act, through appropriate
10     adjustments to such rates and charges.
11     "(g) The Attorney General shall advise the Commission
12     within 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, and
13     periodically thereafter, as necessary, of the specific needs
14     and performance requirements to ensure the continued ability
15     of the government to lawfully intercept communications
16     transmitted by or through the electronic communication
17     services and private branch exchanges introduced, operated,
18     sold or leased in the United States.
l9     "(h) Notwithstanding section 552b of Title 5, United

21     General or his designee may direct that any Commission
22     proceeding concerning regulations, standards or

   DIGITAL TELEPHONY AMENDMENT
   (report language)

Significant changes are being made in the systems by which communications
services are provided.  Digital technologies, fiber optics, and other
telecommunications transmission technologies are coming into widespread use.
These changes in communications systems and technologies make it increasingly
difficult for government agencies to implement lawful orders or authorizations
to intercept communications in order to enfore the laws and protect the
national security.

With the assistance of providers of electronic communication services, these
technological advances need not impede the ability of government agencies to
carry out their responsibilities.  This bill would direct the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) to issue standards ensuring that communications
systems and service providers continue to accommodate lawful government
communications intercepts.  The regulations are not intended to cover federal
government communications systems.  Procedure already exist by which the
Federal Bureau of Investigation amy obtain federal agency cooperation in
implementing lawful orders or authorizations applicable to such systems.
Further, there would be no obligation on the part of the service providers or
any other party to ensure access to the plain text of encrypted or other
encoded material, but rather only to the communication in whatever form it is
transmitted.  It is thus the intent and purpose of the bill only to maintain
the government's current communications interception capability where properly
ordered or authorized.  No expansion of that authority is sought.


   ANALYSIS

Subsection 2(a) and (b) would require the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) to issue any regulations deemed necessary to ensure that
telecommunications equipment and technology used by providers of electronic
communications services or private branch exchange operators will permit the
government to intercept communications when such interception is lawfully
authorized.  The regulations would also require that equipment or technologies
currently used by such providers or operators that impede this ability until
brought into compliance with the regulations.  Compliance with FCC regulations
issued under this section would be required within 180 days of their issuance.

Subsection 2(c) provides that the Commission's authority to implement and
enforce the provisions of this section are the same as those it has with
respect to common carriers subject to its jurisdiction.

Subsection 2(d) would give the Attorney General the authority to request
injunctive relief against non-complying service providers or private branch
exchange operators.

Subsection 2(e) provides civil penalty authority for willful violations of the
regulations of up to $10,000 per day for each violation.

Subsection 2(f) would permit the FCC to provide rate relief to service
providers subject to its rate-setting jurisdiction for the costs associated
with modifying equipment or technologies to carry out the purposes of the bill.

Subsections 2(g), (h), and (i) require the Attorney General to advise the
Commission regarding the specific needs and performance criteria required to
maintain government intercept capabilities, require the FCC to ensure that the
standards and specifications it promulgates may be implemented on a royalty-
free basis, and authorize the Attorney General to require that particular
Commission rulemaking proceedings to implement the Act be closed to the public.

Subsection 2(j) provides definitions for key terms used in this section.

On April 13, 1992, Chicago experienced the closest thing to the "Chicago Fire"
this century.  It is not news to most people now that the forty to sixty miles
of century old freight tunnels underneath the "Loop", or main downtown area,
were flooded on that fateful day.  It appears to be caused by a recently
installed bridge piling that breached the tunnel where is passes under the
Chicago River.  When built, these tunnels were used for transporting coal,
newsprint, and many other items on an electric railway.

The risks to computing were/are significant.  Although no longer used to
transport freight, they are now used as conduits for communication cables
(fiber, etc) that connect together the city's main business district.
Furthermore and more damaging, the tunnels connect the basements of numerous
buildings which are now flooded.  These flooded basements are home to telephone
and electrical equipment, most of which were disabled for days.  The loss so
far to the city is easily over $500M and expected to exceed $1B.

But the main reason that I submit this message to risks is more to do with a
classic design flaw of any complex system, in this case, a city: Chicago has a
single point of failure.

A software bug in a crucial FAA computer, one that programmers had identified
and had planned to fix Friday, acted up Wednesday morning before they could get
to it, shutting down the computer and disrupting Northern California air
traffic for about 2 1/2 hours.  A spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration said a back-up computer system immediately kicked in and that
while departing flights were held back at many airports, no planes in the air
during the shutdown were ever endangered. [San Jose Mercury News, 9 Apr 1992]

The Oakland Air Route Traffic Control Center in Fremont CA had receivers for 12
of its 50 radio frequencies go dead on 17 April 1992.  The partial outage
lasted for about 1.5 hours and delayed 36 outgoing flights from San Francisco
(up to 27 minutes), 7 from Oakland, and one from San Jose.  The reason was
undetermined.  [Source: San Francisco Chronicle, 18 Apr 1992, p.A13]

Subject: Potentially disastrous bug in MacInTax
Summary: MacInTax miscalculates tax data

  [Forwarded to RISKS by nick@dcs.edinburgh.ac.uk]

    [NOTE from the moderator: I have no way to confirm this bug report but

There is a recalculation bug in MacInTax which can lead to income not being
reported. The problem occurs when opening a previously saved tax data file.
MacInTax often and reproducibly fails to correctly incorporate certain types of
income (1099-Misc, for instance). This can lead to IRS audits and penalties,
since income reported on the return and income reported directly to the IRS
don't match.

The work-around for the problem is to force a recalculation of the income
entered into MacInTax, by unchecking and rechecking the Routing Information box
of at least one of the affected 1099s in "FORM 1099: Miscellaneous Income
Statement".

ChipSoft is aware of the bug, but prefers to call it an inadvertent inaccurate
recalculation problem.

Also, even though this is not 100% reproducible, make sure you save you return
before selecting "Open Notes..." from the Windows menu, or La Bomba may make
tax time even more taxing.

SRI just issued an errata sheet on the new telephone directory.

* The parking lot and road overlay on the building graphic was printed upside
  down, with North and South reversed.  It sure looked strange.

* The Office of Corporate Compliance was erroneously listed as the Office of
  Corporate Complaints in the list of FREQUENTLY USED PHONE NUMBERS.  Perhaps 
  they know something I didn't.  I didn't think the correct listing would be
  frequently used, although the erroneous one might.

The Massachusetts Turnpike handed out a nicely printed flier the other day,
advertizing their maintenance plans (and trying to get some PR, no doubt).
This flier included the sentence "Since the initial turnpike was opened to
traffic in 1957, billions of vehicles have traveled over the 135-mile road and
its 260 brides [sic], and these facilities are showing the ravages of time and
traffic."

This example is just cute -- but representative.  In the inefficient old days,
so many different humans were involved in the process ending with typesetting
that typos like this almost never made it into print.

We have made editors, spelling checkers, grammar checkers (all of which allow
that typo to happen).  How are we going to get back the level of checking we
had when it took 5 different people to get something printed?

 From the BBC Radio 4 programme "Punters" broadcast this morning 16th April 92.
An item was about the long time callers have to wait for the London Ambulance
Service to answer the phone after an emergency call (999). The programme
mentioned several cases where callers waited up to 15 minutes for the central
Ambulance control room to answer the phone. During that time the BT (Phone
Company) operators are handling the call. The operators tell of hearing people
die on the other end of the phone while the ambulance station plays a recorded
message "please hold all lines are busy and we will get to you as soon as
possible".

 A spokesman for the Ambulance workers union (NUPE) claimed that the cause was
due to a combination of undermanning and the implementation of a new
computerised call handling system.  He accused the computerised system of "just
losing calls in the system". He also claimed the number of deaths in north
London became so acute that the computer system was withdrawn. A spokesman for
the Ambulance service indicated that they are going through the normal number
of "teething troubles" that one gets when introducing any new system or
techology, and no one had anything to worry about. When the system was working
properly in about 6 months all calls will be handled within 30 seconds. At that
point we can rely on a computer system that is 100% reliable and safe.

 [Moving off of computers here] When Challenged about the long waits for calls
to be answered, he agreed that they were occurring. He said that the Ambulance
service must run like any other business and compared it to the Bus and Rail
services. He pointed out that he could no more be expected to answer all the
calls at peak times than those other services could. The phrase "businesses 
operating economically and efficiently" was mentioned more than once. He also 
blamed the public for calling them too much and clogging the lines. 

 In the light of my recent comments on the media let me note that this program 
was probably prepared in the wind up to the recent General Election and held
in the can as being too "political".

 My worries: there is a chance that some computerised systems will not be seen
as safety critical, but rather as mundane and ordinary. This might be
particularly the case (where in the UK) there is a movement to stop some public
services being seen as "special" and to run them like "any other commercial
entity". No special care will then be taken in their commission.  Others may
make other interpretations. I found it hard to document this in a politically
neutral way.

In the middle of a long, thoughtful post on the proposed FBI wiretap bill, Phil
Karn made a point which I think can stand some elaboration.  In social as well
as physical systems, there is no action without equal and opposite reaction.

In considering the cost/benefit of *any* law which trades off a loss of
privacy and personal freedom against the suppression of criminal activity,
we need to evaluate the countermeasures available to criminals.  Often,
these countermeasures render the law ineffective --- so that honest people
are left to suffer only the costs and never see the anticipated benefits.

The proposed wiretap bill clearly has this defect.  The facilities the FBI
wants to mandate can be defeated with inexpensive end-to-end encryption
devices.  Thus, supporters of the bill can only maintain their position
and the FBI's advantage by intending to ban such encryption devices.

I don't propose to address the damage to our civil liberties that would entail
just now, nor the dangerous precedent it would in turn set, except to opine
that I would *far* rather live with whatever percentage of criminal activity
wiretaps could theoretically suppress than with the potential for systematic
governmental mischief implied by wiretaps and encryption bans.

The argument I prefer to make here is that a ban on encryption devices would
itself have the same *pragmatic* defects as the wiretap bill.  Prohibition
does not work; criminals would still use and sell encryption devices, and
only the honest would be exposed to government error and malice.

It is all too easy to imagine the wiretap bill as the beginning of an
action/reaction spiral in which each further encroachment upon the liberties
of honest people is `justified' by criminal adaptations to the last one.

If you consider this implausible, take a moment to consider the disastrous
histories and perverse effects of gun control and the "war on drugs".  We
have seen this cycle before.  Let's not start another one.

Your article to RISKS suggests that the FBI's proposed legislation to provide
unsecure hooks in telecommunications equipment is necessary to prevent serious
crime.  Could you explain to the readers how such legislation will help the FBI
intercept calls that are encrypted at the transmitting phone and decrypted at
the receiving end, which one would assume serious criminals could easily equip
themselves with?

If it can, then I buy your point.  If it can't, then one has the clear
possibility of abuse without the clear possibility of utility in the most
serious cases.

Thanks for your inquiry.  Criminals' use of crypto is a separate problem from
the intercept issue.  It was addressed by the ill-fated DOJ-sponsored Senate
bill S266.  Easily obtained crypto products will provide a new absolute right
of privacy of communication that will obviously be used by some
criminals--probably the worst ones.  However, the court-ordered intercept will
still be of great use for clear text criminal communications.  I have
interviewed over 150 computer criminals and find many of them to be pretty
dumb, lazy, and not very careful some of the time.  For example, consider how
dumb Gotti and his pals were to have their conversations compromised even when
they knew the Feds were intensely investigating them.  Therefore, I conclude
that there will still be many communications among and from suspected criminals
in the clear for which the intercept capability will be valuable.
                                                                      Donn

Computer hackers slick at credit card fraud, say police
(by Bruce V. Bigelow and Dwight C. Daniels, Copley News Service)

   SAN DIEGO An electronic web of young computer hackers who use high-tech
methods to make fraudulent credit card charges and carry out other illegal
activities nationwide has been uncovered by San Diego police.
   The informal underground network has been trading information "to further
their criminal careers," said Detective Dennis Sadler. The hackers know how to
break computer security codes, create credit card accounts and make fraudulent
credit card purchases, among other things, he said.  "These kids can get any
information they want on you. Period," said Sadler, who works in the San Diego
Police Department's Northern Division. "We didn't believe it until it was
demonstrated to us."  As many as 1,000 "hard-core" hackers across the United
States have shared such data, Sadler said, although it's unclear how many have
actually used the information to commit crimes.  "It's been going on for at
least four years," he said. He estimated that illegal charges to credit cards
could total "millions of dollars."  Computer criminals "don't go out and charge
a thousand dollars every day," Sadler said. "But they have the access and the
means to do it any time they want."
   A crucial break in the case occurred late March, said Sadler, when an
out-of-state hacker was picked up in San Diego and agreed to cooperate with
police and the FBI.  Detectives brought the hacker to a San Diego computer
store that has provided equipment and technical assistance to authorities,
according to a source familiar with the investigation.  Sadler refused to
discuss details, however, saying that the investigation is continuing. Scores
of arrests are pending nationwide, he said.
   In recent months, the investigation has led to two arrests in Ohio and the
seizure of computers and related material in New York City, the Philadelphia
area and Seattle.  Yet, Sadler said, those cases represent only an "offshoot"
of the main investigation.
   A San Diego hacker who was questioned by authorities says the case appears
to be as big as "Operation Sun Devil," a continuing federal investigation into
computer crimes that prompted raids in San Diego and 11 other cities almost two
years ago.
   Typically, fraudulent credit card charges are racked up by computer
criminals who illegally gather detailed information from computerized accounts
on file at credit reporting agencies, banks and other businesses.
   Electronic trespassers can use a credit card holder's name, address and
other personal information gleaned from account files to fraudulently verify
purchases, a crime known in hacker vernacular as "carding."  Such methods make
catalog purchases by telephone a cinch.  Smooth-talking hackers have even
acquired haircuts and meals by verifying their credit card purchases with
personal information, Sadler said.  "There's one kid who bragged about using
the same credit card number for eight months," Sadler said.  The hackers have
learned how to break personal security codes for automatic teller machines,
Sadler said.  Further, using computers, hackers can employ a variety of
techniques to obtain long-distance telephone access codes and illegally make
telephone calls without paying.  "People don't realize what's going on out
there," Sadler said.  "If you did, you'd shred your credit cards."
   MasterCard International reported total losses of $381 million from credit
card fraud of all types worldwide in 1991, according to Warner Brown,
MasterCard's director of security and fraud control in Los Angeles.
   Losses at Visa International amounted to $259 million in 1989, about
one-tenth of a percent of Visa's worldwide sales volumes, said Gregory Holmes,
a Visa spokesman in San Francisco.
   American Express has a policy against revealing the extent of its fraud
losses, a spokeswoman said.
   No figures are available on how much credit card fraud is committed by
hackers.  "I wouldn't even hazard a guess," said Spencer Nilson, who publishes
a bimonthly newsletter in Santa Monica, Calif., about the credit card industry.
   Customers don't learn about a fraudulent purchase until they get billed, and
any overcharges are disputed for three to six months, Nilson said.
   At least part of the investigation is focused on credit information gathered
illegally by computer from Equifax Credit Information Services, a credit
reporting agency based in Atlanta.
   "We're still in the process of investigating, and we're working very closely
with San Diego police," said Tina Black, an Equifax spokeswoman.  The company,
which provides credit information to lenders, is notifying consumers whose
accounts were compromised, Black said.  Equifax suffered no financial losses
itself, and Black could provide no information about possible losses to
consumers.  "Right now, it looks like only a few," probably fewer than 25, she
said.
   Equifax disclosed in February, however, that a different group of hackers,
including two teen-agers from Kettering, Ohio, had infiltrated its computer,
using an Equifax customer number and password code to obtain credit information
and bill-paying histories of Midwestern consumers.  The two juveniles, who were
not identified, face federal and state charges stemming from the computer
break-in, said Kettering police spokesman Jeff Caldwell.
   Equifax computer experts are checking to determine if computer trespassers
created phony consumer files in the agency's mainframe computer.
   Equifax, one of the nation's three largest credit bureaus, had revenues of
$1.1 billion in 1991 and possesses a database of about 170 million credit
files.

[Brochure] FOR SALE: DATA ABOUT YOU

(From a sales brochure distributed in 1990 by Nationwide Electronic Tracking
(NET), an information-brokering company located in Tampa, Florida.  Last
December the FBI identified NET as the center of a nationwide organization that
illegally obtained and sold information, stored in government computers, about
private individuals.  According to the FBI, NET paid employees of federal
agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Secret Service,
to procure records from various computer networks that are easily accessible to
thousands of government workers.  The accessed networks included the FBI's
National Criminal Information Center, private credit-reporting systems, and the
Social Security Administration's computer database, which holds personal data,
employment histories, and salary information on about 200 million Americans.)

In our complex, fast-moving society, information is a constantly changing
resource.  Every day billions of records and documents, containing information
on millions of people, must be revised and updated.  Sorting through it all for
the one particular bit of information you need can be time-consuming and
expensive--a frustrating series of false starts, dead ends, and legal barriers.
Unfortunately, getting reliable information, and getting it quickly, can often
mean the difference between success and failure.

Nationwide Electronic Tracking (NET) can get the information you need--when you
need it.  NET is a high-speed, computer-based telecommunications network,
designed to gain instant access to difficult-to-obtain "confidential"
information from more than 1000 sources nationwide.  Credit-bureau reports,
Social Security searches, electronic cross-directories, and criminal,
motor-vehicle, and driving records are just a few of the kinds of information
NET can obtain faster than the competition.

1.	What is your title?

2.	What type of work does your organization do?

3.	Does your organization currently monitor computer activity?
	(Yes/No)

a.	If yes, what type of monitoring does your company do (e.g.,

5.	Are you for or against monitoring?  Why/why not?  Think in
	terms of whether it is ethical or unethical ("ethical" meaning that it
	is right and "unethical" meaning it is wrong) for an employer to
	monitor an employee's computer usage.  In your response, consider that
	the employee is allowed by the company to use the computer and the
	company currently monitors computer activity.

6.	If your company monitors employees, is it clearly defined in
	your company policy?

7.	In your opinion, does the employee have rights in terms of
	being monitored?

	How do you handle situations in which the employee takes offense at
	being monitored?

10.	What measures does your company use to prevent misuse of
	monitoring in the workplace?

11. 	If an employee is caught abusing the monitoring tool, what would
	happen to that individual?  If your company is not using any form of
	monitoring, what do you think should happen to an individual who
	abused the tool?

12. 	Is it unethical to monitor electronic mail to determine if the
	employee is not abusing this company resource (e.g., suppose the

Well, you sure don't need a computer to make typos.

1562 - Geneva bible Matt. v, 9 reads:
       "Blessed are the placemakers: for they shall be called the children
        of God."        ^^^^^^^^^^^  (oughta be peacemakers)

1653 - Cambridge printer screws up I Cor. vi, 9:
       "know ye not that the unrighteous shall inherit the Kingdom of God?

1691 - Barker &amp; Lewis in London printed a bible with the seventh commandment,
        "Thou shalt commit adultery."
       (they were fined 300 pounds and went out of business)

1702 - London firm prints bible with Psalms cxix, 161:
       "Printers have persecuted me"  (should be "Princes..."

1716 - First bible printed in Ireland has John v, 14 as:
       "sin on more" (instead of sin no more)

Things might have improved since then.  But maybe not... 

     [No.  Now it would be "Blessed are the pacemakers."  By the way, Pete
     Mellor &lt;pm@cs.city.ac.uk&gt; sent in a further collection, not included here,
     but suggested that this subject be moved to rec.humor.  I agree with him.
     No more typos unless really RISKS relevant, e.g., life critical.  PGN]

The state of affairs in the UK with the banks over "phantom" withdrawals from
ATMs is still unresolved. However recently the Abbey National PLC have suffered
a spate of thieves driving up with a JCB and removing completely the ATM from
the branch office. The last one got away with about 60,000 pounds. They strike
at about 4am and they normally have stolen the JCB as well from a local
building site. (By the way any puns made on the basis that the Abbey National
was once a building society are too "awefull" to mention.)

As a user of another ChipSoft product, I am not surprised. 

_TurboTax_ provides absolutely no way to indicate that a distribution from a
retirement plan that was rolled into an IRA, yet is shown as taxable in the
1099's, should not be taxable income, other than changing the data on the 1099.

This is not the more serious error. Unknown codes on the 1099's cause
_TurboTax_ to lose track of income that really should be taxed. There is a
warning notice (shown without the "*" that marks "serious" problems), but none
of the codes that _TurboTax_ DOES know about cause it to handle this
information properly. The only apparent solution is to delete the offending
1099 and enter the numbers in a fake w-2.

Is this a risk of computers, though, or a risk of the overly complex tax codes,
which cause some less than competent accountants to report sales of stock as
"self-employment" income, which TurboTax quite happily calculates
self-employment tax on? Or is it truly a risk of computers, and software
authors who assume that nobody needs anything but codes 1-7 and A-B defined for
1099's?

One year when April 1st fell on a Sunday, the UK national Sunday paper The
Observer carried a story about a proposed new method of operating London buses
without drivers. Each vehicle would be fitted with a video camera in the cab,
and the images would be relayed to a control centre where, with the aid of a
computer control system, one controller would "drive" up to seven buses
remotely, sitting in front of a bank of monitor screens on which the view of
the road ahead of each bus would be displayed.

I was a bit cross when I got to the end of the article and realised that I had 
been taken in. However, having seen some of the serious proposals for 
"drive-by-wire" cars, I think that maybe I was being too hard on myself! :-)

One point not made by Brian Tompsett in his contribution was the problem of a
single event generating multiple calls. The controller stated that often a
single accident in central London could generate 30 calls to the control room.
Each one of these needed to be screened, as until this is done, no one can know
if the call is new or old. With eleven staff on duty, it is no surprise that
the system fails to cope, as the operator must stay connected to the caller
until it is confirmed that an ambulance has been despatched to the scene. With
this sort of system, any problem can quickly overcome the reserves in the
system and thus leave the new callers "trapped" talking to the BT operator, who
is listening to the recorded message.

The computer system should allow for faster despatch, but again the problem is
the number of vehicles available at the time. The solution of many more
operators does not solve the problem when costs are constrained, so what is
needed is a method of clearing through the calls fast to get rid of the
duplicates. I am aware of this myself, having recently called the Fire service,
having seen a car on fire, and not been the first caller. However I needed to
call, because I could not tell if anyone else had reported the problem, and I
did not want to ignore it in case everyone else had ignored it too.

Many risks, and in such a short announcement; I quote from our local Johnnie's
Foodmaster grocery-chain store advertisement:
 
  Charlestown, MA (April 27th, 1992)--Foodmaster Supermarkets is pleased to
  announce a new electronic payment system to be used for making purchases at
  three Foodmaster stores.
 
  Foodmaster is excited to be the first in the area to offer this new service
  to its customers.  Any customer who has a Yankee 24(R), BayBank or X-Press
  24(R) [ATM] Card can utilize this system.  The customer at the point of
  checkout simply passes their card through the magnetic reader located at the
  checkout and punches in their secret I.D. number and the transaction is
  automatically processed.
 
  Foodmaster is pleased to be working in conjunction with Yankee 24, BayBank and
  Manta Systems, a division of BUYPASS [a sad play upon words].  This new
  service will be available in...stores in the month of April."
 
Although the language carefully and slightly hints otherwise, I assume the 
service is optional (or perhaps the copy writer is prophetic).  The usual 
obvious risks apply, such as PIN protection (both external and internal), sale
to others of both the customers' names and/or their buying-habits and multi-
bank information (remember the Denver supermarket note a few RISKS issues 
back?), etc.  However, there is now a new twist: banks, _never_ tiring of 
riding herd on their yet-to-succeed debit-card pursuits, are now putting this 
pressure on with attractions via one of the consumer's most vulnerable 
points, viz., the basic staple of food.  I wonder if supermarket check-cashing 
will shortly become more "complicated"....

It seems rather frightening that the FBI needs to be able to monitor the
telephone conversations of any individual in the nation at any time.  In their
zeal to protect us from criminals they seem to be intent on being able to snoop
without warrant or reason.
 
Further, from my reading of the bill, encrypted messages could be included in
the list of forbidden technology.  Wouldn't this please the NSA?
 
Has the FBI done any type of study that shows there is a wholesale use of the
telephone system by criminals or is this merely a smoke screen to enable the
federal police to have the ability to monitor any individual or group at any
time.
 
What happens when non-governmental persons learn of the access techniques.  If
the entire nation's phone system is set up so it can be tapped, then no
conversation can be considered secure.
 
This proposed law sounds like a terrible abuse of power by the FBI. Until they
can show some valid reason for having the ability to tap every conversation in
the country this bill should be tabled.
 
Furthermore, from what I have read over the years, the equipment is already
available to enable the government to tap any phone anywhere whenever they want
to.

The alternate phone company was located in Texas.  They assumed that it was
toll fraud call and credited me for the calls.  Michigan Bell said that my
local phone company (Pacific Bell) would have to investigate if it was a
fraudulent call.  Pacific Bell said they wouldn't do anything about it.
 
I got the number where the calls were billed from, from the alternate carrier
and tried to call it, but the call would not go through.  A Michigan Bell
operator said the phone booth was set up to only send calls out, no incoming
calls would be accepted.  She said that *** a nationally known company is
located in Ada and one of their employees probably made the call, but offered
no explanation as to why someone who might have stolen my card number would
only make two calls.
 
When I pointed out that public phones that won't take incoming calls are
usually located in high crime areas, the operator seemed surprised.  I got the
feeling that there are a lot of fraudulent calls made from Ada.
 
If I ever can find out exactly what happened I will relay the info to Risks
Forum.

Subtitled: Risks of Quote without Comment

<A HREF="/Risks/13.38.html">RISKS-13.38</A> quotes AP from Paterson, NJ, that a drug offender under house
arrest killed another man after a computer error enabled him to break his
electronic anklet and leave the house.  The risk in such a posting, without
some sort of qualifying comment is to seem to endorse the notion that society
should not use electronic, computer-controlled house arrest systems because the
"prisoners" can break away and commit murder.

At some point in our evolving history, we need hard information (hard to
come by?) comparing the risks to society of electronic house arrest vs

	1. having to set some prisoners free because the jails are full;

	2. cramming more prisoners into fixed-size jails, thus ensuring their
           everlasting rage and resentment, fixing forever what mental ills
           brought them there in the first place so that, when they finally
           serve their sentences, they'll kill someone with probability one;

	3. taxing law-abiding citizens ever more heavily to build more jails to
           house the criminals, thus increasing everyone's resentment levels,
           pushing more "over the edge," creating yet more criminals.

If our interest in the failure of electronic house arrest monitors is purely
scientific/technical, if such postings are made only so that we can discuss how
to make such systems more robust and less susceptible to overload, then, once
in a while someone should say so.

Well, I may have overreacted, but I think it needed to be said.

                             [An old item.  I meant to run it sooner, when 
                             it was timely, but it is still relevant.  PGN]

In Germany, early warnings and high press activity helped to avoid data loss
on March 6, 1992. From the German CERT's (Computer Emergency Response Teams,
as installed by German Information Security Agency, GISA, similar to US centers
as organised by CMU), including MicroBIT Virus Center, Technical University
of Karlsruhe (Christoph Fischer), Virus Test Center, University of Hamburg
and GISA itself, the following figures have been given:

    - Between Jan.1st and March 5, 1992, about 1,000 cases of Michelangelo
      had been reported to one of the centers. Roughly estimated, about one
      third each came from individuals, small enterprises and medium to larger
      enterprises. As a rough estimate, these 1,000 reports (mostly via
      telephone asking for advice after detection) represent about 5-10,000
      PCs.

    - On March 5, 1992, the first accident was reported to VTC; a local 
      enterprise followed some press advice to change the date. In order to 
      avoid March 6 the next day, they changed the date to March 6 at afternoon
      of March 5, evidently without checking for Michelangelo. After some reset,
      Michelangelo hit one PC. Moreover, there were rumors that some PCs had
      suffered from Michelangelo as Feb.29 1992 was not available on their PCs.

    - On March 6, 1992, about 50 cases were reported in the 3 centers; apart
      from individuals, small enterprises called but no large ones. This low
      figure may be slightly too low as telephone lines were busy most of the
      time with media asking for recent data; in VTC, we had even a TV team
      waiting for accident reports to come in.

&gt;From the media point ov view, the warning was inadequate as nothing happened.
This view was assisted by some "experts" such as Chaos Computer Club that the
press reports and warnings were essentially advertisements for Hannover fair's
next week beginning CeBit (world's largest exhibition in IT), and to assist
antivirus industry. CCC's representative Mr. Steffen Wernery even argued that
the virus should not been named "Michelangelo" but after one warner (myself),
and that the only 100 viruses (sic; in VTCs database, we presently have 1,200
viruses) are no real danger!

&gt;From the warner's point of view, the warning was successful as it probably
avoided accidents. But as is usual since ancient times, the messenger is
punished for the warnings - I was even asked whether I received more
invitations for lectures etc (I did not).

After we first informed the public (German press agency, DPA, end-of-January),
VTC received more than 6,000 telephone calls (as recorded by university
telephone computer), most of them asking for general antivirus advice.

MicroBIT (Christoph Fischer) and VTC both (Morton Swimmer) produced and
distributed (free-of-charge) special aNTI-MICHelangelo programs easy to use
which also detect and diagnose possible variations of date (not yet detected).
When we informed the public (via DPA etc) about availability of NTIMICH (on
Friday 21, 1992), we received about 18,000 diskettes with prepared envelopes.
My students copied 14,000 diskettes (they even found viruses on some diskette
sent, esp. Stoned, Michelangelo), the rest being copied and distributed by
Siemens-Nixdorf (SNI) which kindly assisted us. All diskettes were sent back
until Wednesday March 4, 1992. Moreover, NTIMICH was available from FTP,
mailboxes, BTX and even from some radio/TV stations. In addition, a German TV
magazine (1st channel: WISO, specialized in economic and social features) dis
tributed 100,000 copies of McAfee's Scan at low price (2 DM) via consumer
organisation's offices.

As a SUMMARY, this was probably the first time that many users and enterprises
had prepared some data backup and practices some antivirus methods.
Consequently, many other virus (Stoned, Cascade/170x, Jerusalem/Isreali/Friday
13) were also detected and eradicated. Moreover, public attention was drawn to
inherent insecurity of PCs.

Some CONSEQUENCES will follow: some users who bought PCs with installed
Michelangelo or on some diskettes (mouse, VGA drivers etc) think of prosecuting
the resp. dealers. Some PC dealers (and hopefully some software houses) have
installed improved methods of quality (e.g. virus testing on golden master).

Many now ask for improved LEGISLATION to prosecute virus authors. This will be
very difficult as those countries with presently most productive virus
factories (Bulgaria, Taiwan, Former Soviet Union) lack any legislation about
copyrights or computer criminal acts. For US and European prosecutors, it will
be impossible to prosecute the (probably Taiwanese) authors of the original
Michelangelo virus (detected in Australia 1990, with a text on Michelangelo's
birthdate replacing the usual Stoned text) or those (probably European) authors
which updated the original version not to contain any detectable text (this
version now found in Europe, USA and Africa was detected in March 1991 in
Sweden and Netherland; both countries have no adequate legislation).

Message-ID: &lt;PHILG.92Apr17153231@orion.ai.mit.edu&gt;

In the decades to come, every American computer user who purchases floppy disks
will pay a tax.  Most of the money collected will go to record companies owned
by foreigners, notably Sony, Philips and Matsushita.  Congress, after receiving
substantial campaign contributions from the recording industry, has decided
that Americans are criminals who don't want to pay for CDs.  Therefore digital
audio media such as DAT tapes and writable optical disks will be taxed and the
money handed over to record companies and artists.  Just as consumer DAT and
8mm video tape have become the standard high-capacity backup media for
workstations/minis, it is likely that writable optical digital audio disks will
replace today's magnetic floppy disks.  Sony and Matsushita own two of the
largest record companies in the US and would get the most money from this bill.
Two years from now, every time American users of IBM computers make a backup,
they'll be paying a tax to help out IBM's Japanese competitors.

Additional reasons to dislike this bill are varied.  It will be illegal to sell
consumer digital audio recorders in the US that can make digital-to-digital
copies after one generation.  You'll pay a tax on your shiny new Japanese
machine, you'll pay a tax on the tape and when you try to assemble a recording
of your own music, all you'll get is a big flashing "you are a criminal sign."
You'll have to spend $5,000 on a "professional" machine in order to gain any
real benefit from the new products.  Congress is creating a new government
bureaucracy to administer the tax collection from Americans and subsequent
distribution to foreign-owned record companies.  Manufacturing digital audio
equipment will now require hiring a lawyer to wade through over one hundred
pages of legal requirements and technical specifications, thus hindering small
American companies in competing with large foreign ones.  Finally, now one
seems to have considered whether this will "promote the progress of the arts",
which is the constitutional justification for expanding copyright.  Since the
money is distributed linearly according to sales, only the biggest record
companies and most popular stars will get any significant money.

You can stop this bill from passing.  Congress is sticking it to us because the
recording industry paid them and they don't think anyone will notice.  CSPAN
and most newspapers haven't covered this issue at all because the bill has
dozens of co-sponsors and is therefore considered non-controversial.  If a
Congressman gets even a few letters regarding this bill, which he's probably
hardly thought about at all, it might be enough to make him think that
subsidizing Japanese computer vendors isn't such a great idea.  The bill is
going to be voted on in about two weeks.  It is called the "Audio Home
Recording Act of 1991" and is S-1623 in the Senate and HR-3204 in the House.

                         FME '93 SYMPOSIUM
                "INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH FORMAL METHODS"

                 Sponsored by the Commission of the
                     European Communities (CEC)
                 Organised by Formal Methods Europe

The first FME Symposium will be held at Odense Technical College in Denmark,
during the week of 19 to 23 April, 1993. It is being organised by Formal
Methods Europe, as the successor to the last four VDM symposia, to promote the
interests of users, researchers and developers of precise mathematical methods
in program development.

The last few years have borne witness to the remarkable diversity of formal
methods, with applications to sequential and concurrent software, to real-time
and reactive systems, and to hardware design.  In that time, many theoretical
problems have been tackled and solved, and many continue to be worked upon.
Yet it is by the suitability of their industrial application and the extent of
their usage that formal methods will ultimately be judged.  This symposium will
focus on the application of industrial-strength formal methods.  We encourage
all papers to address the difficulties of scaling their techniques up to
industrial-sized problems, and of their suitability in the work-place.  Papers
should discuss techniques that are formal (that is, they have a mathematical
basis), and that are industrially applicable.  Papers tackling theoretical
issues are much encouraged, providing that they contain a justification of the
practical advantages that follow.

Full-length research papers, industrial reports, proposals for tutorials and
tool demonstrations are solicited, particularly in the following areas:

 * Practical use                  * Case studies
 * Tools                          * Linking formal and informal methods 
 * Comparisons of formal methods  * Proof 
 * Concurrency                    * Real-time and reactive systems 
 * Refinement techniques          * Object orientation 
 * Secure systems                 * Safety-critical systems 
 * The development process        * Education and technology transfer 

1 October 1992: Submissions
    - Full, original research papers (6 copies, 12pt, single spaced, max 20pp)
    - Industrial usage reports (6 copies, 12pt, single spaced, maximum 10pp)
    - Proposals for tutorials (half day, maximum 50pp of notes)
    - Proposals for tool demonstrations (with hardware/software requirements)

   Proposals for tools demonstrations should be send to the
   organising chairman, while all other proposals should be send
   to the programme chairman. Industrial usage reports do not
   need to conform to usual standards for academic papers.

The following is quoted in its entirety, from the 23 Apr 1992 issue of The
Independent, a "quality" UK National Newspaper. Its discussion of how an Royal
Air Force Sea Harrier managed to bomb a Royal Navy aircraft carrier is entirely
speculative, offering either a computer malfunction, or failure by the pilot to
press a button as likely causes. However I find the statement that "offset"
bombing practice relies on a simple button press to ensure that the ship towing
the target does not itself become the target both interesting and worrying, if
true.   Brian Randell

  `ARK ROYAL' WAS BOMBED BY RAF HARRIER PILOT
  By Christopher Bellamy, Defence Correspondent

The Royal Navy launched an inquiry yesterday into how a Royal Air Force pilot
bombed its most modern carrier, Ark Royal, on Monday, missing the intended
target by 500 yards.  Navy sources said that one of the two RAF pilots flying
with the Royal Navy during the exercise had applied to transfer to the senior
service.  It is not clear if the incident will affect that move.

The Ministry of Defence said such an accident had never happened before but
refused to speculate how the Sea Harrier 1 from Ark Royal missed the target
towed behind the ship and, according to the MoD, put the bomb through the
flight deck. Six sailors were hurt, one seriously, and five were still in the
Royal Naval Hospital Haslar, Portsmouth, yesterday.  However, it is almost
certain that the plane was practising an attack using the "offset" procedure.
It is possible that the RAF pilot of the Navy plane failed to press the button
to switch from a reference point - the carrier - to the target. "Offset" is
used where the target may be difficult to see, but its position relative to a
clear reference point is known.

The practice bomb has the same flight characteristics as a real one but carries
only a small explosive charge to mark where it lands. The charge exploded
inside the carrier, starting a small fire.  Under the offset procedure, the
plane's computers make the calculations needed to adjust the bomb's trajectory
from the "false" target to the real one.

The Sea Harrier pilot lines up on the ship from about five miles and 250
feet above the water. Flying towards the ship he then tells the computer to
attack the "splash target", towed 500 to 1,000 yards behind, while still
flying at the ship. The attack must be carried out from the beam, or the
computer software will automatically prevent bomb release. At the optimum
height, speed and distance the computer tells the pilot to pull up and
release the bomb.

Paul Beaver, publisher of Jane's Defence Weekly, said: "It does rely on the
pilot to press the button to switch from the mock target to the real one."  On
Monday, the button may not have been pressed or the computer may have
malfunctioned, and the bomb went into the reference point - Ark Royal - instead
of into the target.  The practice bomb hit the carrier about one third of the
way aft of the ski-jump and slightly to port, reportedly penetrating the flight
deck and exploding in the mess deck below.  But Mr. Beaver said he was "very
surprised" to hear the bomb had penetrated the flight deck. At that trajectory,
he said, it was more likely to have bounced off - unless it went into the
ship's side.

Network Wind Profiler Severely Damaged

A wind profiler in OAR's Wind Profiler Demonstration Network (WPDN) was
severely damaged by several shot-gun blasts late last week.  On March 28, just
before sunrise, two men and one woman were pheasant hunting in southern
Nebraska [and] came across the McCook wind profiler and mistook it for an alien
spacecraft.  Frightened, they fired a number of shots damaging the profiler
antenna and the electronics shed.  Furthermore, a Forecast Systems Lab (FSL)
technician who was in the shed conducting routine system checks was taken
hostage by the hunters.  After being held captive for nearly two hours, the
technician's partner arrived and explained to the hunters what the profiler
really was.  The hunters then fled and so far, they have not been apprehended
by law enforcement officials.  Profiler damage is estimated at $150,000.

     - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = -

A profiler (developed in the building where I work) is a phase-array radar
which "looks" nearly straight up.  The basic model can determine wind direction
and speed from the ground to about 50 mb (around 20km, at a guess); a recently
developed enhancement can also determine air temperature up to the tropopause.
They are used in a manner similar to weather balloons, but provided hourly
summaries instead of 12-hour reports.  (They operate continuously, but the data
is rather noisy).

I've never seen an actual profiler on the ground, but the models and artist's
conceptions show a flat rectangular grid.  Coworkers describe it as a
"construction junkyard", or "flat pipes" held about 4 ft above the ground.

Of course, those of us in the mountains have a very low opinion of
plains-dwellers.  Several meteorologists on a "storm chase" last year reported
on Kansan walking up to them (on the side of the road) and asking "Is that a
tornado?"  What he thought the large funnel cloud a few miles away was, if not
a tornado, nobody has every figured out...

My company has just sent out in an internal magazine a comment about the @std
function in LOTUS 1-2-3.  From this I gather that the @std function in both
version 2.2 and 3.1 uses the number in the sample (n) and not the number in the
sample - 1 (n-1).  Version 3.1 has a second macro to use the correct value.
Version 2.2 manual comments that the @std should only be used on large samples.
The comment in our magazine defines small samples as less than 30.

Two things arise from this. 1) Just how much work has been done by people using
1-2-3, who have not realized the "error", and 2) why have two versions of the
macro, when the correct one works for all samples.  (my guess is that if the
original incorrect version was changed, users would worry about the different
answers obtained after the change, even though the answers would now be
"correct".)

Moral: You should never trust blindly answers from any statistical package on a
computer, unless you know the formula used by the package.

  From: Ralph Nader, Washington, DC
  Date: April 16, 1992
 
  Summary: Your help is needed to secure an amendment to pending cable
television legislation.  The amendment would create a mechanism to organize
local Cable Consumer Action Groups (CCAGs) to represent the interests of
consumers directly before regulatory and legislative bodies.  This proposal is
an innovative way to create countervailing power to some of the large corporate
interests that control our information infrastructure, and it is a model that
is highly relevant for users of voice and data network services.  Readers are
asked to sign a letter to Congress supporting this amendment.  Action is needed
very soon.  Respond to Jim Donahue, Teledemocracy Project (Internet:
0002633455@mcimail.com)
 
 
Dear citizen:
 
As you may know, congress is currently considering cable television
legislation.  Every television consumer should be concerned about the outcome
of this legislation, and particularly citizens who are concerned about the
future of information technologies.  The current fiasco with the cable industry
is an important example of the management of information technologies for the
benefit of a few corporate monopolists at the expense of the many.  Today
nearly all americans are confronted with a monopoly provider of cable video
signals, who not only has total control over what you can receive, but also
what you pay.
 
Over the next 15 years we will see a rapid convergence of information
technologies.  Soon it will be possible to transmit voice, data, and video
signals over the same fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure.  The fight
over who will control the content of information that flows over that
infrastructure, and how it will be priced, will define who can send and who can
receive information in digital form.  As the use of modern technologies
increasingly makes it easier to meter the consumption of information products
and services, the gaps between the information rich and information poor will
continue to grow.
 
The current battle over the regulation of the cable television industry is an
important step in a more general battle over the control of our information
infrastructure.  This is a battle over power and wealth, and also over
democratic values, competition, and enlightenment.  Will we harness our great
new information technologies to promote a diversity of sources of information,
or will these technologies be used primarily as vehicles for narrowly focused
commercial interests, exercising monopoly power?
 
     CABLE CONSUMER ACTION GROUPS (CCAG) AS COUNTERVAILING POWER
 
A number of consumer groups have asked Congress to adopt an innovative proposal
to help cable television subscribers organize to represent their interests.
Notices describing local Cable Consumer Action Groups (CCAGs), which would be
independent and democratically controlled local organizations, would be placed
in the cable companies billings.  The notices describe the purposes and goals
of the group and solicit funds for membership. The CCAG would be required to
reimburse the cable company for the incremental costs of inserting the notice
in the bill, so the cost would not be a burden to the cable company or its
subscribers.  These local subscriber consumer groups would then monitor the
policies and practices of the cable company, and represent consumer interests
in regulatory and legislative proceedings and with the cable companies
directly.
 
The cable industry is extremely active politically, contributing millions of
dollars to candidates for political office and spending millions more in
lobbying activities before legislative and regulatory bodies.  In the absence
of something like the CCAG, important public policy issues are debated in an
extremely unbalanced way.  The CCAG is a modest but important step in
addressing a very corrupt system that regularly tramples on the rights and
interests of consumers.
 
Among the groups that have endorsed this proposal are:
     
     Center for Media Education
     Consumer Federation of America
     New York City Commissioner of Consumer Affairs
     Public Citizen
     Teledemocracy Project
     U.S. Public Interest Research Group
 
HAS IT BEEN TRIED BEFORE?
 
This proposal is based on the highly successful Citizen Utility Board (CUB)
model, which has represented ratepayers in several states.  The most successful
CUB, in Illinois, has 170,000 members; its advocacy has saved consumers some $2
billion over the past several years.  Other CUBs exist in Wisconsin, Oregon and
San Diego.  We want to see this innovation used nation wide in the cable
television industry.  (Of course, it may well be a model that has applications
to other telecommunications issues.)
 
WHAT YOU CAN DO

The CCAG proposal was included in H.R. 4850, but was deleted by a voice vote
(in contrast to a recorded vote) in the House Subcommittee on
Telecommunications and Finance.  The bill is now in the full Energy and
Commerce Committee, where committee supporters will seek to restore the
provision through an amendment.  We are asking you to send us an email message
giving permission to use your name in a letter to Congress supporting this
amendment. If you are willing to do so send the following information to the
Teledemocracy Project (internet: 0002633455@mcimail.com, or fax 202-234-5176).

Dear Chairman Markey:
 
We are writing to support your "consumer representation" amendment to H.R.
4850, the cable re-regulation bill. It is imperative that new cable legislation
provide a mechanism that gives consumers a stronger voice in regulatory and
legislative debates.  This amendment is ideal because it brings citizens into
the regulatory process at no cost to the government or the cable industry.
 
Who in Congress can deny the unfairness of a system where the owners of cable
monopolies can use subscriber revenues for lobbying purposes while consumers
are left powerless and unrepresented?  This is only a small step toward curbing
the monopolistic power of the cable television industry. We urge the House
Energy and Commerce Committee to include your consumer representation amendment
in the cable bill.
 
Sincerely, ...

A tax on clarinet reeds would hit only musicians and reed makers (and
indirectly music fans); a tax on gasoline hits just about everyone.  A tax on
computer media, ostensibly aimed at music consumers, would come to hit everyone
because of the simple fact that computers are spreading through society faster
than a nasty joke through a frat house.  A tax on computer media will soon be
as general a tax as one on gasoline.  I don't think there's any RISK to
computer users in such a tax, except at the same level as the risk to
automobile users in a fuel tax.  The tax is objectionable because it's a
general tax for the specific benefit of an unworthy few; and because the
legislators responsible for it perhaps do not understand the full effect of the
proposed law.  The only REAL problem is that uneducated people are yet unaware
of the fact that while 1/4" audio tape and IBM 5081 punch cards were distinctly
different, in the modern digitally-recorded computer-processed "information
age" it is impossible to distinguish between musical and textual and graphical
storage media.  At worst, tax avoidance schemes based upon artificially
differentiating music media and computer media would add some cost, a little
less than the tax itself would, to computer media, and generally reduce the
economic efficiency of all digital technology industries.

Yesterday while driving through GA, my Cellular Phone rang.  Since I was
roaming I was not expecting a call.  When I answered it, it was a recording
welcoming me to Bell South Mobility and offered instructions on using there
service.  I have had this happen before and did not think anything about it.
Though today I started to think.  If the cellular phone company could sense
that I had come into there area, they could track my movements all over the
country on a carrier by carrier basis.  They might even be able to track me
with in a city/area by which antenna was picking up my signal.

Right now the risk is rather low, but its something to think about.

	There seems to be a strange idea that has been floating around in some
of the recent postings on comp.risks: namely, that video tape records of your
actions necessarily belong to you and their use in a trial as evidence is an
invasion of your privacy.

	Events that happen in public places are public knowledge and not
private.  While recordings (video or otherwise) can not necessarily be used for
profit by a third party, they are public and may be distributed and used as
evidence.  Anyone is allowed to see and to tell about what they see in a public
place (such as the street corner on which Rodney King was assaulted).  That
retelling may include using aids such as a video tape.

	Things get somewhat more interesting when talking about a camera
mounted somewhere and run without an operator.  Then the viewing analogy does
not hold as well.  In those cases, judging by common practice, there may be
some principle in the law dealing with the likelihood of knowing that you are
witnessed.  When there are people standing nearby, you know that likelihood is
great.  Locations that have video-tape surveillance tend to have signs advising
patrons of that fact.

	Hope this is of some help when talking about privacy and videotape.  Of
course, the definition of a public place can get muddy but in the case of the
Rodney King beating video this is not an issue.

The main thing that bothers me about this bill is, why is it needed?
I work for a major vendor of central office switching equipment, and
I see absolutely no reason to enact such a law.

At the CO/PBX hosting the line it will always be possible to 'listen' to any of
the terminals off that line.  This is required for ensuring the equipment is
working.  I cannot concieve a system where this would not be a requirement.

Looking at the proposed law that was reproduced in a previous issue of RISKS,
it appears that what they are asking for is the ability to capture the bit
stream from any terminal.  No more, no less, it specifically excluded the any
responsibility for the telco to unencrypt anything fed to the terminal.

The bit stream from any terminal is available at the CO.  It has to be,
otherwise it would not be possible to identify which terminal to route the
return bit stream to.

Puzzle-box patent abandoned

23 Apr 92 15:50:55 GMT
</i><PRE>

Readers of risks may remember that in mid 1991 I posted a message describing a
"puzzle-box" idea, for which I had lodged an Australian provisional patent.
[See <A HREF="/Risks/12.06.html">RISKS-12.06</A> and .07.  PGN]

The idea was to place some kind of hardware "puzzle" between computers and the
safety-critical/trusted devices they control so as to reduce the likelihood of
accidental activation in the case of a failure of the computer or the
interface. To activate the critical device, the computer would have to send out
a complicated sequence to "solve" the puzzle.

The posting created quite a fuss for the following reasons:

   * People thought that it was covered by prior art.
   * People thought that it was too simple to be worthy of a patent.
   * People were concerned that it could be applied to software.
   * People thought that the idea would never work because of
     single point software vulnerabilities.

Except for the last criticism, which was provably (by construction) incorrect,
all of these criticisms were valid, although perhaps not as valid as many
thought. I was mailed quite a lot of claimed examples of prior art, most of
which held some similarity, but none of which hit the mark until I heard about
a satellite that had been sent up in the 1980s which had exactly what I would
call a puzzle box in the form of a linear shift register puzzle that was
protecting a rocket motor (or something equally as important). I never managed
to formally obtain the details of this example, but if it was true, it was bang
on. As it happened, it didn't matter, as all the hate mail put me off the
patenting idea anyway.

Later on in the year I happened across a friend who said that he had been
involved in a missile project some years ago that had used some sort of "puzzle
box" in between a controller of some kind and a firing mechanism. Apparently,
on occasions during lab tests, the computer was not able to fire the puzzle
box, and so they would call in a technician who had a box with a bouncy switch
that just happened to reliably generate the firing sequence... So much for
protection!

Anyway, there are three main points that I want to make. The first is
that I have completely abandoned the puzzle box patent. My reasons:

   * I don't want to own a patent that most people seem to hate.
   * Although I have not formally checked it out, I have heard of
     at least one convincing prior art example (the satellite).

The second point is that because my patent has been formally registered in
Australia, and publicised, there can be no chance of anyone else successfully
sustaining a similar patent. Even if the idea had never actually been written
down previously, it is now definitely prior art. (Those who are paranoid about
my intentions will be pleased to hear that the provisional patent application
has now actually expired so I now can't resurrect the patent, even if I changed
my mind).

The third and by far the most important point, and the one likely to be of most
interest to risks readers, is this. Despite the huge barrage of mail that I
received claiming prior art, almost none of it was in safety critical
applications. People claimed particular forms of protected memory, clock chips,
even Unix passwords, as prior art, but very few people provided examples from
trusted systems.

One of the reasons why I lodged the patent in the first place was because I
wanted to use the patent to draw attention to the puzzle box idea. I was
involved in safety-critical systems for a year and a half, and during that time
I didn't hear of any explicit puzzle box mechanism being used in any
safety-critical system. Most of the systems that I saw attacked the interface
problem using a battery of non-puzzle-box techniques such as output delay and
sampling, multiple processors, and analog voting schemes.

So my question is this: Are puzzle boxes a widely known and used technique in
safety-critical applications, or are they not? If they ARE in use, then I am
surprised because I haven't heard much of them, and in particular, they didn't
turn up in the prior art barrage, even though the patent, and my presentation
of it in comp.risks, was entirely directed towards safety-critical
applications. If they are NOT in use then I think that it is important that the
safety critical community become more aware of them, as they can provide a much
needed extra layer of protection. My experience working in the field was that
there was too much emphasis placed on the software, and not enough on simple
physical checking systems or human procedures that could reduce the criticality
of the software. It would seem a shame if my patent, defeated by hate mail and
clock chips :-), does not impact on its intended safety-critical audience who
are in a position to use puzzle boxes to save lives. If you agree, please join
me in disseminating the idea in the safety-critical software community. The
defunct patent, which describes the idea, is a 38K ASCII text file that can be
retrieved by anonymous FTP from:

   Machine   : sirius.itd.adelaide.edu.au  [129.127.40.3]
   File      : pub/compression/puzzlebox_provpatent

My thanks go to all those who were involved last year,

Ross Williams, ross@spam.adelaide.edu.au

From the Honolulu Star-Bulletin's "Streetwise" column, 27 April 1992:

Time change leaves stoplights out of sync (By David Oshiro)

Here's a story on how the clever machines that run our lives are sometimes too
clever.

Three weeks ago, most of the mainland switched to daylight savings time.
Unbeknown to city transportation officials here, a microchip controlling
traffic signals on Kalanianaole Highway contained a program written on the
mainland that contained an automatic conversion to daylight-saving [sic] time.

So, *voila*!  On Monday, April 6, the timing for peak traffic hours kicked in
an hour earlier, throwing signals off.  Signals that were changing in
200-second cycles began to change in 185-second cycles.

It was only a 15-second difference, and it only lasted an hour, but that was
enough to mess up morning rush-hour traffic [which is pretty bad on this
highway].

City workers, however, were able to figure out the problem and fix it that day.

A city transportation official said that there was no easy way to test that
chip in advance, to see it [sic] would have worked properly when the switch to
daylight-saving time occurred.

This past week I was at a Microsoft Technical Seminar (read "boasting session")
and saw an interesting promotional piece.  Although longer than a normal ad, I
suspect it is planned to use the "playlet" for some kind of media presentation.
The "plot" is that Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet is so easy to use, and has so
many "labour saving" features that two dolts who have forgotten to put together
their presentation are able to do so in a one minute elevator ride to
"executive territory".

Other than stylistic aids, the primary function promoted is an "extension"
function which will "forecast trends".  With so much spreadsheet use being
devoted to business plans and cash flow projections, the attraction of such a
function is obvious.

However, the ad immediately triggered an alarm.  The feature is introduced, in
the ad, by the fact that the executive "wants to see ten percent growth".  The
original figure is $1000, so the user fills in the next column as $1100.  No
problem.  Then the extension feature is brought into play, and I mentally
follow along with the arithmetic.  The next column should say $1210.  But the
spreadsheet fills in $1200.  The fourth column should be $1331, but instead is
filled in as $1300.  Ah, to the numerate person, the reason is obvious: the
function is not a geometric "ten percent growth" but an arithmetic adding of an
additional hundred dollars each time.

To the numerate person, obvious.  To the general public?  How many of the
"average" business computer users would even notice?

The RISK of this particular choice of "extension" algorithm might not be all
that important.  However, it points out the increasing addition of "aids" in
computerized systems, and the need to note carefully the use that the using
audience is likely to put those aids to.  Business computer users, in my
experience, tend to want to think in "percentage" figures (eg. annual growth).
A simple "adding" function for forecasting will not give them the "correct"
answer appropriate to their mental model.

Small though this RISK might be in this instance, we have seen this same
principal at work in situations with much higher stakes.

The 20 April 1992 issue of DM News, a direct marketing trade publication,
reports that within the past two weeks, Metromail and Donnelly Marketing (two
of the very largest mailing list companies) were approached by the FBI which is
seeking mailing lists for use in investigations.  Other mailing list firms also
received feelers according to the story. "Neither of the identified firms would
discuss details, but one source familiar with the effort said the FBI
apparently is seeking access to a compiled consumer database for investigatory
uses."

"The FBI agents showed 'detailed awareness' of the products they were seeking,
and claimed to have already worked with several mailing list companies,
according to the source."

Metromail, according to the article, has been supplying the FBI with its
MetroNet address lookup service for two years.  The FBI said that the database
is used to confirm addresses of people the FBI needs to locate for an
interview.

This marks the first time since the IRS tried to buy mailing lists in 1984 that
a government agency has attempted to use mailing lists for enforcement
purposes.

In a separate but related story in the April 24 issue of the Friday Report, a
direct marketing newsletter, the RBOC's are teaming up with other firms to
develop white page directories on CD-ROM.  For example, US West has a joint
venture with PhoneDisc USA of Marblehead, Ma.  The article states that the
company offers lists failing mailing list enhancements to law enforcement
agencies.  [NOTE: an enhanced list means the names and addresses were matched
with a marketing database and additional demographic information was added to
the list from the marketing database].

&gt;Are call loggers a problem when you give your password to a mail retreival
&gt;system form a hotel or an office.  Is there a hacker market for this info?
&gt;Finally how prevelant is this problem in various parts of the world?

Many hotels detail your phone bill and include the phone numbers you called
during your stay.  How often does the hotel phone system capture your
MCI/Sprint/AT&amp;T calling-card number (which you touch-toned into the MCI,
Sprint, or AT&amp;T computer), too?

I can easily change the PIN on my voice-mail system; changing the PIN on my
calling card requires a call to the long-distance carrier, and possibly a new
card - something the long-distance carrier isn't going to want to do too often.

I had the same experience myself recently.  But, in addition to instructions,
it was also a telemarketing call by the local carrier!  Since I use my cellular
phone as a contact line for technical support and am always expecting calls (I
subscribe to a nationwide switching service), I was rather angry that they used
my time on the line like that.  Especially since it was during a driving
rainstorm while I was on the Interstate in the hills of northern Kentucky!  I
called *611 and told the person on the line to get me off whatever list I was
on to get this unnecessary greeting and unwanted telemarketing.  I haven't been
bothered since, but I don't know if my call got me off any "list".

Not only *could* the cellular phone company track one's movement "all over the
country" (although with great difficulty and expense using today's switches),
it is an active industry goal for the next generation of technology.  "Call
Delivery" -- making your phone ring when someone dials your number, regardless
of your geographic location and serving carrier of the moment -- is an integral
part of the standard being developed for interswitch communication (EIA/TIA
IS-41).  It is also seen as a key to making Personal Communication Networks
(PCN) work.

What happened to you in Georgia is the result of a feature known as "autonomous
registration", by which the serving switch instructs a mobile unit to register
(i.e. transmit its identity information including mobile phone number and
serial number) as soon as radio contact is established (as indicated on the
mobile's handset display by the "service light" or "service bars").  When the
system detected you were a roamer, it placed a call to your phone and played
the recorded greeting for your edification (although I don't know BellSouth's
policy, it is quite unlikely you were charged for this call).

Furthermore, Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) services are also seen as highly
desirable by a significant subgroup of wireless communication users (truckers
and victims of car thieves come immediately to mind).  There are companies that
claim to be able to determine the position of a mobile unit in a cell site to
within 100 feet using only the received 800 MHz radio signal, but the
technology is unreliable and expensive.  The more popular solution is to marry
a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to a cellular phone or other
wireless terminal, but this is both proprietary and also expensive.

As long as the user retains the ability to "disappear" by turning the phone
off, I see the benefit as outweighing the risk in this form of network
tracking.  I squirm a lot more when I read about "beacons" placed in every car
for automatic toll collection and vehicle monitoring, because these specialized
systems exist solely for the purpose of tracking and accounting (NOTE: does
anyone really expect there to be an "off" switch on such a device?).  It's one
thing to choose to be tracked, and quite another to have an "Eye in the Sky"
checking up on you...

INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS (IEEE)

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers is the world's largest
technical professional society. Founded in 1884 by a handful of practitioners
of the new electrical engineering discipline, today's Institute is comprised of
more than 320,000 members who conduct and participate in its activities in 147
countries. The men and women of the IEEE are the technical and scientific
professionals making the revolutionary engineering advances which are reshaping
our world today.

The technical objectives of the IEEE focus on advancing the theory and practice
of electrical, electronics and computer engineering and computer science. To
realize these objectives, the IEEE sponsors technical conferences, symposia and
local meetings worldwide; publishes nearly 25% of the world's technical papers
in electrical, electronics and computer engineering; and provides educational
programs to keep its members' knowledge and expertise state-of-the-art. The
purpose of all these activities is two fold: To enhance the quality of life for
all peoples through improved public awareness of the influences and
applications of its technologies; and, to advance the standing of the
engineering profession and its members.

The IEEE, through its members, provides leadership in areas ranging from
aerospace, computers and communications to biomedical technology, electric
power and consumer electronics. For the latest research and innovations in the
many diverse fields of electrical and electronics engineering, industry and
individuals look to the IEEE.

                  COMPASS '92  June 15-18, 1992
                      About the Conference

COMPASS is an acronym formed from COMPuter ASSurance, the subject of this
conference, the seventh of a series that began with COMPASS '86. According to
its charter, "The purpose of COMPASS is to advance the theory and practice of
critical systems through the medium of scientific and engineering meetings and
publications. The organization, under the IEEE, is dedicated to the study of
critical systems, especially those using digital computers or other new
technologies."

Critical systems are defined as systems whose failure could cause injury, loss
of life, or significant property loss or damage. Such failures may be failures
of commission, doing what should not be done, or of omission, not doing what
should be done. Critical systems have failed in the past. Radiation therapy
machines have killed cancer patients; industrial robots have killed workers;
spacecraft have been destroyed; and, hackers have vandalized and/or stolen from
information systems. The goal of COMPASS is to find and publicize ways to
prevent unacceptable failures of critical systems.

COMPASS expresses the idea of "Pointing the Way" and of "encompassing" many
technologies and technical disciplines. The logo, a variation of yin-yang
overlaying a compass rose, symbolizes both of these ideas.

COMPASS '92 has adopted the slogan "Building The Right System, Right." This
expresses the need for the developers of critical systems to rigorously define
the right requirements and ensure that they are satisfied, resulting in systems
that function as intended.

The sponsors and organizers of COMPASS encourage you to participate in future
COMPASS activities. Contact any member of the conference committee or the
conference board for more information.

  Stephen S. Cha, Charles H. Lavine, and Jeffery C. Thomas, Aerospace
  Corporation, El Segundo, Ca.

  This tutorial surveys various software safety techniques proposed in
  literature or currently in practice. Following an introduction to software
  safety concepts, several industrial software development examples will be
  examined. The tutorial concludes with a discussion on formal methods and
  future research directions.

12:45 p.m.     Lunch

2:00 p.m.      Tutorial 2: "Interlocks-A Safety Engineering Tool"

  Phil Sedgwick, Control Systems Analysis, Newport, RI

  This tutorial introduces INTERLOCKS, a methodology and PC-based tool, that
  graphically describes and simulates the operation of computer system
  controls.  INTERLOCKS, in use by the DoD, employs a graphic language familiar
  to hardware and software engineers-simple AND and OR logic. The result for
  safety engineers is an INTERLOCKS network that models and simulates the
  hardware, software, and operator events that are prerequisite to critical
  function initiation.

Here's a switch -- someone hoping the blame can be put on the computer.

           Computer Problem Cited in Crash of F-22 Prototype
                         by Barton Gellman
                 Washington Post, April 30, page A3

   A computer software problem probably caused the weekend crash that destroyed
the only flying prototype of the F-22 Advanced Tactical Fighter, the Air
Force's top general said yesterday.  Gen. Merrill A. "Tony" McPeak, Air Force
chief of staff, told House Armed Services Committee panel that it will be good
news for his top-priority weapon program if an investigative panel confirms
what he calls his speculative explanation, because a software flaw is
"relatively straightforward" to fix.  [...]

   Lockheed Corp. test pilot Tom Morganfeld, by this account, had just refilled
his fuel tanks in preparation for a test of supersonic flight characteristics
when he learned of a break in the telemetry link that sends performance data
from the aircraft to the ground.  The supersonic test was cancelled.  Already
airborne, the F-22 was too heavily laden to land safely, and so Morganfeld
began a series of high-speed, low-altitude passes over the runway to burn
excess fuel.  On the second pass, Morganfeld lost control.  Videotape of his
last seconds in the air shows that he retracted the landing gear and ignited
his afterburners at roughly the same time, and the plane's nose immediately
began porpoising out of control.  The F-22 crashed, burst into flame, and slid
8,000 feet -- well over a mile -- before stopping.  Morganfeld escaped with
minor injuries.
   McPeak's theory of the crash said the combination of reduced drag from the
retracted landing gear and increased power from the afterburners meant that the
plane needed far more "slab authority" to control the aircraft.  In other
words, the F-22's control surfaces had to be raised and lowered more sharply.
But on modern fly-by-wire aircraft, a pilot has no direct control of the
physical movement of the flaps.  Morganfeld's commands were interpreted by a
computer- controlled servo-motor that continuously made thousands of
calculations to adjust the controls, much as anti-lock brakes do on late model
automobiles.
   McPeak said he believed that "something in the logic of the fly-by-wire
flight control system" failed to move the control surfaces far or fast enough
to keep up with the pilot's commands.  If an Air Force investigative panel
bears out McPeak's hypothesis, according to experts, it will rule out far more
serious problems with the aerodynamic stability of the plane during the
critical "flight regine" of a landing approach.  But McPeak acknowledged he
does not yet have all the facts.

The _Austin American Stateman_ and _The Daily Texan_ report that an employee of
the University of Texas College of Engineering used a password belonging to a
dean to misappropriate about $16,200 from March 1991 to February 1992.  The
dean reportedly gave the employee the password, in violation of university
policy.  The employee resigned when confronted; no charges have yet been filed.
Neither the dean nor the employee were identified to the press.

The funds were earmarked for travel fellowships for recruiting students from
other universities; the employee awarded fellowships to UT students who were
not eligible to receive them.  UT police would not comment on whether the
employee directly benefitted from the misappropriation.  The improper payments
were discovered accidentally when a student wrote to thank the associate dean
of recruiting of the College of Engineering for the College's generosity.
According the dean of the College, "That student didn't do anything wrong.  He
just came to the dean's office for assistance and he got some."

The employee had access to about $300,000.  The university is auditing its
records to determine whether improper payments were made in prior periods.
Legitimate awards were made from the same fund during the same period as the
improper ones.  The College of Engineering is tightening its security
guidelines (no details given).

&gt;From New Scientist 18 April 1992

Patriot: The missile that missed

While defending the performance of the Patriot missile last week, US
Army officers reduced their estimates of how many Iraqi missiles the Patriot
hit during the Gulf War. The army now believes that the Patriot successfully
intercepted 24 missiles out of about 85 attempts. But it has "high
confidence" in only 10 attempts.

Even as the Pentagon renewed its defence of the Patriot's record, new evidence
cast additional doubt of its credibility. The congressional General Accounting
Office revealed that the army's earlier estimates of the Patriot's success were
wildly optimistic and were based on over=hopeful assumptions. For instance, if
the army could not find an impact crater from a Scud warhead, it assumed that
the Scud had been destroyed by a Patriot. Yet some army units on the scene
never bothered to look for craters, says the GAO.

The Congressional Research Service, in a separate analysis of classified
Pentagon data, concluded that most of the army's evidence was weak.
Steven Hildreth of the CRS says that he is only convinced that one Patriot
missile actually destroyed a Scud warhead.

During the Gulf War, President Bush announced to cheering crowds the Patriot
had "intercepted" 41 out of 42 Scuds that it was fired at. General Robert
Drolet defended Bush's statement at last week's congressional hearing, saying
that "intercepted" meant only that "a Patriot and a Scud passed each other in
the sky".

The army has abandoned an investigation of Ted Postol, the professor at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has been among the Patriot's
strongest critics (New Scientist 28th March). Postol had been accused of
using classified data in an article he published that was critical of
the missile's performance.

[It is very good news, if Ted Postol has been "cleared" and that no action will
be taken against him. However the double speak "intercepted" by this article
leaves me worried to say the least. Most people will believe the "successes"
and thus expect great things to happen. When such over-sold systems fail, it is
the scientists, who get the blame and the world starts to reject their
achievements instead.]

&gt;  Summary: Your help is needed to secure an amendment to pending cable
&gt;television legislation.  [...]

Hmm, is this in risks because of the risks of cable monopolies to consumers or
because of the risk of Ralph Nader :-)

Unfortunately, this effort makes the false assumption that cable is a monopoly
which needs to be regulated.  Cable is in no way a monopoly, and the most
effective way to control cable costs has been shown to be competition (rates
are much lower in areas with 2 cable providers).

Mr. Nader's effort is, as expected from his political philosophy, an attempt to
create a "consumer" group and force cable companies to promote it before their
customers.  These consumer groups would pay to have information sent to the
consumer, but only "incremental cost" (e.g. the cost of an extra sheet of paper
in your cable bill rather than having to pay their own postage).

These groups would lobby regulatory bodies and legislatures.  This is
apparently needed because regulatory bodies and legislatures are bought and
paid for by the cable companies and so we need another organization to
represent the citizen.

Of course, there's no reason why a consumer group can't be started by
interested individuals and lobby the appropriate bodies -- many such groups
exist today.  This proposal is an attempt to subsidize such groups, not
financially but by legislating reduced cost access to consumers.

This proposal reminds me of (Ralph Nader prompted) "public interest research
groups" which have been started on many university campuses.  When they started
their group at the University of Colorado, they promoted themselves as a
consumer protection group, out to protect the average person (e.g. somebody
stupid and gullible) from big business.

The problem is that rather than being funded like any other campus group, they
proposed that all students be required to pay their fee (about $2.00), then
about 4 weeks after the start of the semester, well after tuition and fees had
been paid, students could apply for a refund of the fee if they didn't want to
pay it, finally receiving the refund several weeks after applying.

This method was desired because it provided the group the highest income (much
higher than voluntary checkoffs).  Of course, this method plays on the same
apathy that they deplored when businesses tried something similar, but the
hypocrisy wasn't noticed.

Easy Reach 700 gives each subscribers a Unique Phone Number that remains
unchanged for the lifetime of the subscription, and that indirects to wherever
you want the call to be received.  The caller does not know the receiving
number or its location.  The service begins on 15 June.

The subscriber can call the assigned 700-xxx-yyyy number, followed by a 4-digit
PIN, then 1#, and then the number to which calls are to be routed.  This can be
done from ANY touch-tone phone (assuming compatible tones, which -- I have
noticed -- is not always the case among clone-phones).  The subscriber may
choose to assign up to 19 different passwords to would-be callers, where the
absence of a password blocks the call indirection.

Perhaps the system will be smart enough to detect systematic attacks such as a
denial of service from a computer dialing your number, running through as many
of the 10,000 possible PINs as necessary until the right one is found, and then
forwarding your calls off into space.  I suppose you would want automatic
calling number identification to detect who is attacking.  (I presume that it
would indicate the original caller, and not the 700 number!)

Of course, following our discussions of schemes for tracking people (such as by
cellular phone IDs), Easy Reach could be misused as an interesting database of
your presumed whereabouts...

I brought up the subject of cellular phone tracking in a short note to RISKS a
year or so ago and learned that locating a given phone within a sector having
an area of a square mile or so is part of normal operations.  All that is
needed to track a given phone, whether or not it is in active use, is to save
this information in the same way that billing data is saved.

Furthermore, a civil liberties lawyer with whom I discussed this issue believes
that as things stand in the U.S., law enforment authorities may collect and use
cellular phone tracking data without a court order, unlike tapping telephones.
They would presumably need the cooperation of the cellular phone company in
order to do this without a large investment, of course.

My opinion is that cellular tracking data should be accorded the same
privacy protection as phone taps.

Wouldn't it be cheaper, simpler, and less intrusive to use Skytel-like
satellite pagers to notify people that they have a call?  It would work like
this:

You cellular phone contains a satellite paging receiver and antenna.  When
someone calls you, the switch has the paging satellites transmit your code and
the connection id number all over the world.  Your phone receives this info,
recognizes that it is meant for this phone, puts the connection id into a
buffer, and rings.  If you pick up the phone and press the "answer" button, the
phone transmits the connection id on a standard connection request frequency.
The connection id encodes the origin of the call, so the switch at the
recipient end can route the call.  You can only be tracked when you answer the
phone.

Since a pager id + connection id need only be about 80 bits long, one
voice-grade satellite channel would be able to handle at least 800 calls per
second.  125 voice grade channels would handle the entire U.S., if every
individual had a cellular phone and received about 10 calls per day.  (Note
that the address of the pager would include the channel it listened to.)

I was talking to my mother yesterday about a new device that she had installed
in her car, required by the insurance company in order to insure the car at
full value.

The device tracks the location of the car with sufficient resolution to even give
driving speed. My father called up the service to "test it out", and they said where
my mother was driving, as well as indicating that she was driving 30 in a 35...

If she did not get this locating device, her insurer would have only insured
the car at up to 50% of the car's value.

She didn't know anything about how this data could be disclosed; she hadn't
really thought about it.

The risks should be obvious.

Fatal delays shut down ambulance computer

London Ambulance Service has shut down its new L1.5 million 999-call computer
system and launched an inquiry into failures that have led to fatal delays in
emergency services reaching patients.  In a catalog of errors, the capital's
ambulance service has admitted defeat and agreed not to implement a second
phase of its computer system. But a spokesman said the delays were "not a
system problem but human error".  ...

Already the LAS was under severe pressure to resolve the sofware problems
following the death of a 20-year-old diabetic, Kerrie Swannell, on February 7.
Miss Swannell died cardiac arrest shortly before the ambulance arrived, an hour
after it was called. It was said that calls had been lost when a visual display
unit was turned off by mistake.  ...

The computer-aided dispatch system (CAD) was introduced in January in
south-west London, and despite the "lost 999 calls" was extended to the
north-east of the capital on February 25. Mr Barber says the system crashed for
90 minutes every day for more than a week.  ...

I used to be a public safety dispatcher in California (police, fire, AND
ambulance), and all I can say about the current performance of LAS is that it
would have gotten our entire staff sacked.  Fifteen minutes to answer the
phone at a safety critical service is completely, totally, absolutely
unacceptable.  Our standard was no more than 30 seconds, and generally by the
second ring, with arrival of the ambulance at the scene often coming within 5
minutes of the first call.  Even that is almost too slow, because you can lose
heart attack victims in four minutes.

With eleven people on staff, even 30 calls on the same incident can be handled
in a couple of minutes if the staff have a suitable display system available.
Once the incident appears in the queue, subsequent calls are a matter of
establishing the nature and location of the report (15-20 secs) satisfying
yourself that it is indeed a repeat report, and letting the caller know that
help is coming. (Another 10 secs, tops!)  Except for absolutely GROSS
mismanagement, I can see no reason for such horrible response times as are
regularly reported for LAS.  Such a service must be held to a performance
standard commensurate with the seriousness of its task and assigned sufficient
resources to meet that standard.  I think it's safe to say that letting people
die on the phone would not meet a reasonability check for ambulance service
performance...

My wife works at a major department store.  This weekend, she was called upon
to translate for two non english speaking customers who had been detained for
suspicion of passing counterfeit money.

The two young men had made a small purchase (some socks) and paid with a US $50
bill.  Something about the bill (or perhaps the men) did not seem "right" to
the clerk, and so the men were detained for more than an hour.  The police were
called, and their wallets were searched for more evidence of counterfeiting.
[I don't know whether or not the search was made with permission.]  The men
spoke and acted innocently, and were confused and afraid by the proceedings.

It was determined that the bill in question was one of the new bills that are
designed to *prevent* counterfeiting.  Several other stores in the area were
contacted in order to make this determination.  The new bills have metallic
threads woven into them, have a plastic "id stripe" in the paper that is
visible when held up to the light, and have some design modifications.  [My
info from a "Nova" episode entitled "Making Money"]

I took a look at some new $100 and $50 bills at the local Credit Union, and
they do look and feel different from the older bills.  Additionally, the
printing on the new bills looks rather poor, with green ink from the back
"leaking" through to the face and much evidence of black ink being absorbed
into the paper creating blur lines.  [It's somewhat like the output from my
DeskWriter on cheap paper!]  It is, however, only marginally worse than the
printing on a $20.  Perhaps the spotty printing helps to authenticate the
bill--color copiers either do not have the problem or also blur the "colored
threads".

aThe men were eventually freed, and advised to "use $20 bills in the future."
Some expired (but not forged) documents turned up as a result of the search
were confiscated from one of the men.  No attempt so far has been made to
inform the rest of the store clerks of the different bills.  It is disturbing
to note that not much publicity has surrounded the issuing of the new bills.
Neither the store personnel, the city police, nor the tellers at my bank knew
anything about them, and if it hadn't been for the Nova episode neither would
I.

While it may be risky to publicise anti-counterfeit measures, it seems more
risky to hide the information from those who need to determine the legitimacy
of the cash.  During my interaction with my bank teller I was also making a
withdrawal, and was offered one of the $50 bills... I opted for $20s instead :)

The FBI is probing an electronic funds transfer scam that nearly cost First
Interstate Bank of California $70 million.  A bogus request was made late last
year to transfer the funds from `one or more accounts' at FIBofC to `one or
more accounts' at other banks over the automated clearing house network.  The
request was made by computer tape, and apparently came with authorization forms
and a signature -- possibly forged -- from a bank client.  FIBofC apparently
approved the transaction without validating its legitimacy, although this is
not an uncommon practice.  The bogus transaction was detected only because it
caused an overdraft.  This was the largest fraud attempt in the almost 20 years
of the automated clearinghouse.  The network handles transfers up to $100
million, and carried about 1.7 billion transactions last year.  [Source:

LABOR PAINS, 1 YEAR LATER by Gail Collins (Excerpted from NY Newsday, 4 May 1992)

  (Good morning. This is the Empire Blue Cross computer. If you have a problem
  with your insurance claim, press one to speak to a powerless employee. Press
  two if you would like to vent your grievance to a tape recorder.

  (If you are not calling from a touch-tone phone, hang on until you get
  discouraged and give up. (Beep).)

OK, not the true tape recording. The true tape recording is less upfront. But
it does yell: "I did not hear your response!" if it feels you are slow in
pressing the appropriate button. Empire Blue Cross is the biggest health
insurer in the state, and owner of one of New York's most infamous
bureaucracies.  Every day, innocent citizens fall into its maw.

"They'll never let you speak to a supervisor," said Michael Jacoby, another
embattled customer. "They say: 'This is not a supervisor problem. ' "

I met Jacoby back in February, when he told me about his suspicion that Empire
Blue Cross did not believe in the existence of twins.

At the time. Jacohy was in his 11th month of fighting over $5,000 in doctors'
fees connected to the birth of his twin daughters, Ashley and Brooke.

"I think they're discriminating against people with multiple births," he said.
"My wife met somebody who had triplets. They were having the same problem.
Basically, when the computer looks at the claims, it only looks at the birth
date. It throws out the second child as a duplicate bill." Empire Blue Cross
totally rejected this theory. "It must be a glitch. It's definitely not related
to twins," said Michael Costa, a spokesman for the company. Meanwhile, the
insurance company's lowly clerks were confirming Jacoby's suspicions. "It
happens all the time." said one. taking time out from her duties in keeping
Jacoby away from any person with authority to solve his problem.

Jacoby got no satisfaction, but lots of correspondence. And it did seem to
buttress his theory about twins. There was a lot of documentation about
payments for Ashley's treatment. But Brooke appeared to be a computer
nonperson.

The twins were approaching their first birthday. The computer overpaid one of
the pediatricians, while stonewalling the neonatologist who treated the girls
when they were premies at North Shore University Hospital. "Our doctor was
threatening to send the bill to a collection agency," said Jacoby.  Actually.
the neonatologist and her staff were understanding.  It was the doctor's
computer that was losing patience.

Jacoby sought help from the [New York] state Department of Insurance.  "It will
take a month," a woman at the state agency told him. A month later, there was
no response from Empire Blue Cross.

"What do you do now?" Jacoby asked.
"We send a second letter."
"Then what do you do?"
"We send a third letter."
"Then what do you do?"
"After the third letter, they have to respond. It's the law."

After the third letter, the agency did indeed get a response, from Linda
Gummer, who holds the exalted title of Empire Blue Cross Executive
Correspondent.

"Our claims processing system does have difficulty in distinguishing between
one patient and another if both patients are covered by the same policy, have
the same sex, birth date and are treated by the same doctor on the same date,"
she reported.

Translation: Our computer can't do twins.  

"We shall see to it that our Customer Service area is alerted once again to
this situation and that training... is reinforced."

The neonatologist got her money - just in time for the twins' first birthday.

"Now they're sending me benefits for using the North Adams Ambulance Service,"
Jacoby reported recently. "That's someplace in Massachusetts."

Subject: AFS tokens expiring
Organization: School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon

This morning from about 11:30 am to 1:00 pm users who attempted to access afs
files located on PEACH.SRV would get back an error saying that their token had
expired. This anomaly was caused by the fact that PEACH's clock was an hour
behind, so newly aquired tokens presented to its fileserver appeared to have a
start time in the future and thus were rejected. The problem was fixed by
manually resetting the time

The clock got so far behind due to the following series of events:

A process on PEACH was writing a file into AFS which was larger than the AFS
cache on that machine. This caused the in-kernel AFS cache manager to
continiously print the message :

   " PEACH vmunix: afs: cache too small: flushing active file"

Since this message was being written to a 300 baud hardcopy console at a high
interupt level, it was causing significant delays to the rest of the system.
One of the results of these delays was that clock interupts were lost, and
another was that 'ntpd' was not given a chance to run and fix the time skew. By
the time the process acausing the problem finished the time skew was too large
for ntpd to make adjustements, thus manual intervention was required.

Well, it didn't take very long for the FBI's proposed new rules to be defeated
by the marketplace... this is an excerpt from an AT&amp;T newsbrief (quoting
Reuters).

        *** SECURE PHONE -- AT&amp;T said it introduced a new line of secure 
        telephone equipment intended for business use.  The model 4100, 
        the first product in the 4000 Series, is designed to protect 
        domestic and international voice and data communications.  The 
        company said that in the past, a secure telephone meant 
        sacrificing voice quality, and the model 4100 offers voice quality 
        comparable to a non-secure phone. [Reuters, 5/6]

I saw a 6 or 7 second video clip of this crash on a TV news program early last
week.  This video was shot from around the threshold of the runway, look
towards the rear of the aircraft as it (fortunately :-)) flew away from the
camera.  During this sequence you could see massive (subjective term) up and
down movements of the all-moving horizontal tail surfaces as the pilot (or the
computer?) tried to stabilise the aircraft.  As far as I can recall the gear
was up for the duration of this sequence.

Odd that the software should be seen as a possible cause of the crash, when
it would seem (to me) that this is exactly the sort of situation where it
should have helped, assisting the pilot in managing a heavy aircraft flying
close to the ground by compensating for extreme pilot input...  humm, more or
less what the General said, but with a different emphasis!

I though most aircraft could dump/vent excess fuel, you don't have to be at low
altitude to do this, do you?

Wow!  What an advertising coup.  If you weren't on their database before the
request, you certainly are now.

And you can provide them with your SSN (without a privacy statement!), and your
spouses' name, and a copy of a current bill ... from anyone will get you your
record.

And if the business that sent the bill isn't a TRW customer, I would project
that they will receive some advertising literature on how TRW can help their
business.

Some other risks --- someone could set up a "favored" credit rating by using a
false address on a short street.  e.g.-My street has 7 houses {1-6, 8}; I could
invent 7 (in the range) or 11 (a typo for my # 1); I could send a false bill to
myself; and I could use a SSN.  This could allow me to establish a potentially
false credit information base for fraudulent use.

The Associated Press reports today from Crosby, N.D, that farmer Harlan Johnson
who was expecting a $31 check from the U.S. Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service received instead one for $4,038,277.04. Dale Ihry, head of
the agency's office in North Dakota said that their computer program
occasionally picks that particular amount and prints it out on something,
although this is the first time that it was printed on a check. The farmer
returned the check the day after.

It's wonderful how the agency seems to accept the bug as an act of God.  Looks
to me instead like an act of off-by-one indexing into an inappropriate memory
location...

The following excerpt is taken from shortwave radio magazine _Monitoring
Times_, May 1992 issue:

  Does anyone have the correct time?

  When subscriber Fred Latus ... came in at 5 a.m. to "open up" station WKTV-TV
  ...  he felt something was amiss with the clock - an ESE NBS Master Clock
  receiver, locked to WWV's time signal.  Not having time to check it, however,
  it wasn't until a second engineer arrived and asked why the digital clock was
  one hour fast, that it hit him.  [...]

  "Having had problems with our receiver and antenna the past few months, we
  thought it could be our problem.  By eight a.m. I had reset the system twice
  and it still was in error."

  "About 9:15 a.m. I finally got an engineer at WWV, just coming on duty at 7 a.m.
  MST." ... Keeping Fred on the phone while he checked the computer, he came
  back to report that, sure enough, a "3" had been entered instead of a "4" for
  the month starting Daylight Savings Time.

  ... The United States had been on Daylight Savings Time for about nine
  and a half hours a month early and only half a dozen people caught it!

Since the rule for determining the start of daylight savings time is so simple
(in the US), why isn't there an easy way to describe the rule, rather than
punching in a date every year (as would seem to be the case).

  [... It is not trivial, however, because any program older than a few
  years will get the shift wrong!  The switchover used to occur on the LAST
  Sunday in April, and now is on the FIRST Sunday.  PGN]

In a story by Ralph Vartabedian on page D-12, Friday, 8 May '92,
the Los Angeles Times reported [brutally condensed by M. Seecof]:

GAO Says C-17 is Riddled With Computer Problems

The McDonnell Douglas C-17 cargo jet is plagued with serious computer hardware
and software problems, resulting in part from shortcuts taken by the company
... according to a General Accounting Office report obtained Thursday.

The GAO report is the first public finding that the C-17 has serious
computerization problems, though Air Force documents have hinted before that
the computer system lacks adequate capacity and that its development has fallen
behind schedule.

The GAO report asserts that the software ... has been ``a major problem...''
It found that the Air Force wrongly assumed that the software portion of the
program would be low-risk and ``did little to manage its development or oversee
the contractor's performance.''

The C-17 is the most software-intensive transport aircraft ever developed.  The
report said the aircraft has 19 different on-board computers, using 80
microprocessors and functioning in six different computer languages.

The GAO found that the Air Force ``made a number of mistakes,'' including
underestimating the size and complexity of the task, waiving many Pentagon
standards for software development and awarding a contract to McDonnell that
gave the firm control over software.

McDonnell officials declined to comment on the GAO report.  But the report
notes that both the Air Force and McDonnell concurred with its findings.

  END OF STORY.  Mark Seecof asks: has anyone seen the report itself?  I'd like
  to know in what way it was a mistake to give McDonnell-Douglas control over
  software development for a plane it was building?

Walter Reed Army Medical Center has a $1.6 billion computer system intended to
streamline health care in the U.S. military.  It has gotten low marks from
WRAMC personnel, who attribute bungling of prescriptions, patient-care records,
and doctors' orders to software glitches.  One doctor said that use of the
system increased his workload by up to two hours per day.

The system had been used for two years for admissions and general
record-keeping, but the problems began when laboratory and pharmacy orders were
incorporated.  One doctor stated that his name was linked with patients he had
never seen.  Another noted that access to narcotics was not secure.

About half of the 625 doctors do not use the system for in-patient lab orders,
although most do use it for radiology and pharmacy orders.

Subject: Microsoft advocates killing of Jews
Date: 29 Apr 92 23:24:20 GMT

Hey everyone!!  Did you know that Microsoft is advocating the killing of Jews
in New York City?  I sure didn't!  But it's true!  I read it in the paper!

Get ready for a whopper.  Once again the news media proves that it doesn't
know the first thing about computers.  The entire story, retransmitted 
without permission, is below, as it appeared in today's New York Post.

For those who don't know, the Post is a tabloid paper, where the entire front
page is one huge headline.  So, screaming out at millions of New Yorkers this
morning was the headline, "PROGRAM OF HATE".  Above the headline is a photo
of one of those old PC green-screen displays, with "NYC" = &lt;skull&gt; &lt;Star of
David&gt; &lt;thumbs-up sign&gt; superimposed on the screen.  Above that is a 
subheadline, "Millions of computers carry secret message that urges death to
Jews in New York City..."

So, without further ado, here's the story:

ANTI-JEWISH CODE LURKS IN POPULAR SOFTWARE, by Don Broderick

 One of the world's best-selling computer programs contains a secret
anti-Semitic message apparently urging death to Jews in New York City.
 A computer consultant discovered the diabolic message while installing
Microsoft's new Windows 3.1 software for a client yesterday.
 The consultant was testing a mailing-address use of the program when he
noticed the letters "NYC" had been replaced by a hateful message - a skull
and crossbones, the Star of David and an approving thumbs-up symbol.
 Microsoft strongly denies any hidden message.  Others disagree.
 "There's no way it could be a random coincidence," said Brian Young, a
friend of the consultant, who does not wish to be named.
 "It's pretty scary.  I was pretty shocked by the whole thing."
 Computer owners who use Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word or any other Microsoft
program containing a print font named "Wingdings" can duplicate the
anti-Semitic message by typing the letters "NYC" on their screen.
 Microsoft said "Wingdings" was designed by Bigelow and Holmes, an outside
vendor, and denied that Microsoft intentionally designed the secret message.
 Prof. Charles Bigelow confirmed that his company provided the symbols, but
insisted that Microsoft made the final "mapping" decisions assigning his
symbols to specific keys on the keyboard.
 But a senior Microsoft spokesman said the charge that the fonts contain a
hidden message is "outrageous."
 "It's like saying that if you randomly type out characters on a keyboard to
spell 'Satan', you can do that, but it's incredible to say that there's
anti-Semitism in Microsoft or one of its vendors," said Charles Hemingway.
 But Young, who discussed the matter with other computer consultants, isn't
so sure it's just a coincidence.
 The "Wingdings" font contains no letters - just 255 symbols.
 Young calculated the odds of three letters of the alphabet being combined
with 255 symbols, and said he found that the odds of obtaining the message 
were less than one in a trillion.
 "It's mind-blowing," said Young.  "Somebody's responsible for this.  This
is very offensive."
 "I found it hard to believe some of the stories about the resurgence of
Nazi sympathizers - but this puts things back into perspective."
 Microsoft, based in Seattle, is the world's biggest software publisher,
with 100 million customers around the world and sales of more than $2.3
billion in 1991.
 When Windows 3.0 was introduced in 1990, customers were snapping it up at
the rate of 30,000 a week.

-- end of article

Above the story is a line of some of the various symbols in the "Wingdings"
font, with the caption:  "LOADED: When a specific font is used in Microsoft's
Windows, these symbols, which correspond to the alphabet, appear.  Type the 
letters NYC, you get the death sign, the Star of David and the thumbs-up."

So what do you all think?  Should we load up the buses and make a pilgrimage
to Redmond to firebomb Bill Gates's mansion, or what?

------- End of Forwarded Message

      [EVERY computer-mapped linguistic utterance will correspond to some
      sequence of symbols in this alphabet, so there are certainly many other
      combinations that will be offensive to someone.  For example, the word
      CYNIC will begin with thumbs-up, Star of David, and skull and crossbones,
      and end with another thumbs-up.  Two thumbs-up are not necessarily good.

The following article appeared in The Independent (do I have to keep on
explaining to RISKs readers that this is one of the "quality" national
newspapers here in the UK?) and is reprinted in its entirety without
permission.

Typically of such articles, there is only a discussion of the advantageous
uses, rather than the possible risky misuses of the device described. I smiled
wryly at the claim that "We haven't thought of a question yet which we could
not answer in our favour" - perhaps they should have asked RISKS!  :-)

Incidentally, I wonder how this device relates to the similar devices that are
being being advocated, and perhaps already used, for tagging pet dogs by
implanting a the device under the skin. (This idea was a hot topic a year or so
here in Britain, after some horrific incidents involving pit bull terriers
mauling and indeed killing children.)       Brian Randell

FIRM OFFERS "FOOLPROOF" CAR SECURITY SYSTEM, by John Arlidge

A "FOOLPROOF" car security system could be available this year. Datatag,
which uses hidden microchips to identify vehicle owners, was launched for
motor cycles yesterday and car owners could be using it this summer.

Police, ministers and insurers have praised the system, the first of its
kind offered to road users.

Hugh Chamberlain, managing director of Chamberlain Engineering, who will
head a company to be formed next week which will market Datatag for cars,
said he thought the new system was foolproof "It is a watershed. We haven't
thought of a question yet which we could not answer in our favour."

Motorists would install microchips - about the size of a 5p coin - anywhere
in their vehicles. Each chip would have a unique, pre-programmed code
number which could be "read" using a special electro-magnetic "gun" which
will be distributed to police forces around the country.

The codes would be logged on a secure police computer with engine and
chassis numbers and the owner's name. Motorists could install as many
microchips as they wanted. Five chips and registration would cost about 
(pounds) 40 - less than half the price of an alarm.

Hologram stencils which could not be removed or window etchings would warn
potential thieves that the vehicle had been tagged.

An estimated 2,500 motorcyclists are already using the system to prevent
theft and the sale of bikes and bike parts. Two hundred motorcyclists a day
are tagging their machines.

Commander George Ness, of the Metropolitan Police stolen vehicles squad,
said the system was very good. "It will help police re-cover stolen
property and will have a considerable deterrent effect on the thief." But
he added: "lt is early days. It is the front edge of technology" The new
system would not prevent joyriders stealing cars.

Mr Chamberlain, who predicted do-it-yourself Datatag kits would be on sale
by July, said microchips hidden in inaccessible places - inside seats or
down tubes - would mean that even if they could locate the chips, thieves
could not remove them without damaging the car, reducing its value.

Thieves could never be sure that they had removed all the chips and if they
tried to sell a car, prospective buyers could check if it was stolen.

Michael Jack, Minister of State at the Home Office, speaking at the launch
of Datatag yesterday praised it as "part of industry's efforts to find the
solutions" to auto crime.

&gt;From this summer Norwich Union, which insures more of Britain's 22 million
vehicles than any other company, will send leaflets to motorcycle policy
holders informing them of the advantages of Datatag.

Vehicles are stolen at a higher rate in Britain than any other European
country. More than 580,000 vehicles were stolen in England and Wales last
year and more than 913,000 thefts from vehicles were recorded. Auto crime
accounts for almost a third of all recorded crime.

Experts believe Datatag could be used to "owner code" almost any item -
from videos to antiques.

It appears that the attempted $70 million bank scam may be affecting bank
customers.  All of our employees received a phone mail message from our
corporate payroll department warning us that "due to bank difficulties", our
bank (First Interstate Bank of California) would be slow in processing
automatic payroll deposits; we could expect that deposits which normally are
made to accounts Thursday night (May 7) would not be made until Friday night at
the earliest, but would not be made any later than Saturday night. No other
reason was given.

Since this is the first delay in the nine years I have been here, I find is
*interesting* that this coincides with FIBoC other difficulties.

(It could be due to difficulties in Los Angeles, but as the bank corporate
offices are nowhere near the riot area, I consider that a remote possibility.)

I just wanted to let you know that I did _not_ know the report of hunters
vandalizing a profile was bogus.  The information posted on our bulletin board
had no originating information on it, but _did_ have a "approved by" stamp in
the corner indicating the office of the Director of the Boulder Labs had
reviewed it.

Furthermore, none of the people I discussed this with knew it was a joke
either.  At our site/floor it appeared a legitimate news report.  It didn't
even seem unreasonable, knowing some of the situations others have reported.
(The hippies who sued the National Park Service after being struck by lightning
-- while holding a metal railing on a stony outcrop in a thunderstorm -- comes
to mind).

I'll protest this on Monday.  I have no problem with April Fool's jokes (as the
original article was clearly intended) which can be identified as April Fool's
jokes, but posting an April Fool's joke a month later with no indication of its
nature is a different matter.  At least the newspaper clippings on my door,
e.g. "Mom carried 12 miles by Tornado!" are clearly from the _Weekly World
News_!

Re Dave Turner's accurate assessment of the RISK of blindly mailing private
information to an address posted in a computer bulletin board, you may verify
the earlier posting from USA Today (Money section, P.  1B, April 27 1992, Final
Edition).

Second, people have expressed concerns about TRW building a database from the
information people supply when they request their credit rpt.  The research I
have done on direct marketing over the past two years suggests that TRW won't
learn *anything* new from us if people do supply all the info they ask for
because TRW already has this AND MORE.

TRW maintains an extensive marketing database on individuals from which it
sells mailing lists.  The source of this information includes public records
(drivers license, deeds, USPS change of address information), credit reports,
and information it has purchased from mail order companies.

Names and addresses may be selected based on such factors as exact age, height,
weight or whether or not you wear glasses (from drivers license records),
information about a home mortgage (amount, type), recording date and whether or
not the transaction was a purchase or a refinance (deed/tax assessor records),
whether you are a "new mover," the distance of your move and whether it is
local, regional or out-of-state as well as the date (USPS change of address
information), whether you are a credit shopper, an active credit shopper, your
purchasing power (credit report) and whether you shop by direct mail, are a
multi-category buyer, recent purchase date, and category of purchases (e.g.
collectors, crafts, high tech, sports, etc. etc) (information purchased from
unspecified third parties).

TRW is not the only company in this business.  There are a number of 
large direct marketing firms which sell similar types of lists.  

We would all be able to exert much more control over the secondary use of our
personal information if public records came with a check-off box, allowing each
person to decided whether or not he/she wanted to received solicitations
because they bought a house or car, moved and changed their address, or got a
drivers license.  Currently you can only ask these companies not to resell your
name by writing to them directly or by signing up for the DMA's Mail Preference
Service.  This will keep your name off of mailing lists, but it's not clear if
it stops your name from moving around for those who are concerned about this.

I, and my brother, use direct deposit to avoid the risk of lost, stolen or
forgotten pay checks.  Nice deal.  Last week, the company apparently decided
he was paid a bonus check in error.  Several days after the check had been
electronically deposited to his account - and he had been notified of the
amount - they reversed the deposit and withdrew the amount.  He was not
notified the bonus was withdrawn, nor was he notified (until the overdrafts
arrived) that his account was reversed.

He is disputing the reversal of the decision to pay the bonus - and the company
and bank are cooperating in notifying the folks who got the bounced checks and
reversing the associated charges - but, it seems quite a risk to know that if
you authorize direct deposit, you are also authorizing an implicit direct
withdrawal.

Maybe I'll ask to be paid in cash!  The company is a large one and is in no
financial difficultly so the problem was human or computer-to-computer and
just left the poor worker out of the loop.   /Stu Bell

Buried in a lead article ("from News Services") about the space shuttle
in this morning's (Minneapolis) Star Tribune is the sentence:

	The spacewalk was [...] delayed for 1 1/2 hours because
	Endeavour's on-board computer made a mistake in plotting the
	route needed to rendezvous with the satellite.

I hope someone will have more information on this.

Computer Chip Get Blame

A woman who went on trial Wednesday in the shooting of three people at a Denver
homeless shelter three years ago blamed the rampage on a computer chip she said
her ex-husband planted in her brain.  Juanita Whitaker, 42, pleaded innocent by
reason of insanity in the Dec. 7, 1988, attack at the Brandon Center for
homeless and battered women.  One victim, a maid at the center, died in the
attack.

William Safire's column in the New York Times for May 11, 1992 (Page A15,
Column 1) contains a sharp attack upon the Bush Administration's efforts to
prevent the use of technology designed to allow secure communications.  The
essay is called: "Foiling the Compu-Tappers".

Here are some quotes:

   [...] You might think, with foreign economic spies intercepting our global
data transmissions, faxes and phone calls, the Bush Justice Department and
National Security Agency would be helping American businesses defend
communications from prying eyes and ears of overseas competitors eager to steal
our scientific advantage.

    The opposite is the case. In a policy blunder ranking with the adoption of
the Smoot-Hawley tariff as depression loomed, the Bush Administration sent
F.B.I. Director William Sessions to Congress to argue for a weakening of the
devices U.S. citizens use to encode and keep confidential the information our
competition would love to see.  [...]

   This is a classic case of falling off the pace of change. In the name of law
enforcement, we are making ourselves technologically vulnerable to
international criminality. To preserve the huge investment in our old
eavesdropping facilities, we are abandoning the field to modern organized
crime.

   Does anyone seriously think that state terrorism cannot afford the best
encryption and penetration software, or that drug cartels cannot buy the latest
encryption devices for their money movements? [...]

   The trouble with both our Federal law enforcement and intelligence services
is that they have become hooked on yesterday's technology.  Electronic
surveillance for cops and satellite photography for spooks have become central
to their lives; their reaction to the inexorable improvement in encryption is
to say to the world of science: slow down.

   It won't. In trying to sweep back the tide of change, King Canute-style, the
F.B.I. is the front for the intelligence community, which hates to be forced to
go back to the difficult days of running human spies. The N.S.A. (No Such
Agency) is obsolescent because its expensive eavesdropping is an offensive
weapon in the coming age of digital defense.  [...]

   Mr. Bush is on the wrong side of this issue (and Ross Perot will take
him apart on it in debate) because his mindset is toward old-fashioned
spookery and against personal privacy.

   In the end, that's what this futile scramble to stop the scrambling
will come down to: not to stop the march of progress, not to take tools
from counterspies, but to preserve business and personal privacy.

   The coming Information Age threatens to be intrusive; the individual
will be watched, examined, crowded. At the same time, to the happy tune
of "I got algorithm," the  computer-telephone complex brings us defenses
against its own intrusion.

Has anyone else noticed that the New York Times (at least the west coast
edition) seems to have lots of trouble with computer typesetting?

Yesterday they had a notice on the front page that due to computer problems,
some articles were not complete.  The issue also had a lot of articles with
headlines in the wrong fonts.  It looked rather like someone had put the paper
together by cut and paste.

Today, the pull-out quotes in Science Times were scrambled so that the
article on jury behavior had pull-out quotes from the article on crystals
in the human brain.  Made for an amusing, if accidental, editorial.

About a year back, a co-worker asked me how to re-partition his hard drive.  I
told him that this was a silly idea, considering that he had lots of space and
the partitions didn't get into anyone's way.  He just wanted to do it because
it was "better".

Anyway, after explaining that he would have to save all of the old data some
place (and suggesting that he not use millions of floppies, but instead FTP it
up to our Unix system), he went away.

About an hour later, he came back asking for PKzipFix.  I asked him why, and he
told me that PKunzip was complaining that he had a bad ZIP file.  I went over
to his desk, and after about 15 minutes of questioning, I realized what had
happened.

He had PKzip-ed each of his partitions and FTP-ed them up to the system.
Unfortunately, he did not specify BINARY mode, and so it only transferred ASCII
characters and converted CRLFs to LFs.  Since he had reformatted his drive, all
of that data was lost...

The RISK was that FTP had no warning message of the following sort:
	WARNING: Non-ASCII characters found while in ASCII mode.
I suppose that some further argument could be made that BINARY mode should
be the default (instead of the data-modifying ASCII mode)...

`Busy signal' aided an `anklet' escapee
(Newark "Star Ledger", 13 May 1992, By Robert Schwaneberg)

A Paterson man charged with committing a murder while he should have been under
house arrest was able to beat the electronic system monitoring his where-abouts
because a computer got a busy signal - and never called back.  That was the
explanation members of the Senate Law and Public Safety Committee were given
yesterday as to how Tony Palmer was able to remove the rivets from his
electronic anklet and have the tampering go undetected for four months.  In
fact, the computer at the Corrections Department headquarters in Trenton
detected the tampering on Dec. 16 and printed the information out, according to
Steven Adams, supervisor of the electronic monitoring-home confinement program.
But when the computer tried to relay the information to computer monitors
sitting just a few feet away, it got "a busy signal," Adams said. "It did not
call back," he added.

As a result, senior parole officers manning the monitors 24 hours a
day, seven days a week never knew what the computer knew - that Palmer
had tampered with his anklet and that the computerized phone calls
assuring that he was at home were worthless.

Sen. Louis Kosco (R-Bergen), the committee chairman, was incredulous at first.
"I don't accept the answers that I've gotten," Kosco said.  "How could this
have happened for four months - time after time after time?"  Corrections
Commissioner William Fauver and other staffers explained that once the computer
detected the tampering, any additional tampering would not set off new
warnings. Adams explained that the device remained in "tamper status" until it
was reset.  When Kosco realized the implications of that, he was even more
appalled. "If someone could get away with it one time, then he had carte
blanche," Kosco said. "If you can get away with it one time, you're free."

"That's what happened in the Palmer case," conceded Loretta O'Sullivan, the
Corrections Department's egislative liaison, "but it will not happen again."

Adams said parole officers in Trenton now scrutinize the computer printouts for
information about tampering, disconnected phone service or an inmate on home
detention failing to answer when called.  Anv such incident would trigger an
immediate visit from a parole officer, he said.

Other staffers said that when parole officers visit home jail inmates once a
week, they no longer rely on a visual inspection of their anklets but insert
them into a verifier, which would show if the anklets are in "tamper" mode.  By
the end of the month, Adams added, the state should begin receiving new anklets
that attach with interlocking metal bands rather than rivets.  Adams,
displaying one of the new anklets, said, "The only way this can be removed is
by cutting it off."

Sen. Bradford Smith (R-Burlington) said a "major fault" of the current system
is that even when an anklet is in tamper mode, the inmate can still use it to
check in when the computer calls to see if he is home.  Smith said that if the
device has been tampered with, that should trigger an alarm each time a call is
made to the inmate.  "The technology has got to be up-graded in some fashion,"
Smith said.  "This is just not acceptable."  The anklets and monitoring
equipment were manufactured by Digital Products of Florida, which did not have
a representative at yesterday's committee meeting at Corrections Department
headquarters.  "I think we ought to look at some other systems and see what
other companies are doing," Smith said.

Despite their apparent distress at the technical limitations of the system, the
lawmakers said the home confinement program must continue but should be
improved and become more selective about the kinds of inmates it takes.

State and county jails face severe crowding problems. It costs $12.80 a day to
keep an inmate on home confinement vs. $67 a day to keep him in prison.

"We all believe this is a very worthwhile program," Kosco said. "We want it to
continue in the state of New Jersey, but we want it to work as close to perfect
as we can make it."  Kosco said the program should be put "on hold" as Fauver
had announced last month, but added, "We don't mean stopped." Kosco said the
program should not be expanded but that as inmates come out of home detention,
new inmates should enter. As of yesterday, 642 state inmates - all within six
months of parole - had been released to home confinement with electronic
monitoring. Some counties also use electronic bracelet programs.

Kosco and Sen. John Girgenti (D-Passaic) said the state should be more
selective about the kinds of inmates it releases into the program.  "I have
problems when I read about people who were armed robbers who are now part of
the program," Girgenti said. He said drug dealers and persons with ties to
organized crime should also be ineligible for home detention.  Girgenti and
Kosco have introduced bills to restrict eligibility for home detention.

Fauver said he had canceled plans to expand the state's electronic anklet
program in the next budget year. He added that he was "still confident" about
the program but said it is better suited to county jail inmates than state
prison inmates convicted of more serious crimes.  Fauver said he was awaiting a
consultant's report on the technical as pects of the home detention program and
the procedures used in other states with similar programs.

Recently an old friend tried to call me at work, in response to a call from me.
He discovered that his moble phone on the Cellnet network would not reach an
081-966-nnnn number, while he could do so from a standard BT phone.  Being a
comms specialist, he called Cellnet, after a discussion with me.  The end
result was that Cellnet had in fact left this exchange out of their routing
tables.  It is now in!

The reason behind this is that Cellnet (although partly owned by VBT) has to
pay for any access to the BT phone network.  To prevent calls being made to
exchanges that do not exist and thus return a number unobtainable, but still
raise a charge on Cellnet, but nothing that can be charged to the customer,
Cellnet blocks such calls.  When 966 came into being, no one added the route to
make it available.

The following item is in the latest issue of Mother Jones.
Cybervirus warfare anyone?

The Pentagon has a dream: An enemy soldier is attempting to pull up vital
information on his computer screen. Suddenly, a peace sign flashes, along with
the message, "You are STONED!'' A virus has destroyed his files.
     If you can make this dream a reality, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney
wants &lt;it&gt;you&lt;&gt;! His department's Innovative Research program is enlisting an
unlikely group--computer hackers--to create strategic computer viruses that can
attack enemy systems via radio signals.  According to an official at the Army's
Center for Signal Warfare, one hacker has already been awarded a $500,000
contract for the program's production phase.
     The exact nature of the work is classified, but the Signal Warfare
official told &lt;it&gt;Mother Jones&lt;&gt; magazine that the virus project is based at
Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and described the work as "serious stuff.... Some
believe these [viruses] exhibit lifelike tendencies, reproducing themselves
like animals or plants.''
     Critics fear that the Pentagon's viruses pose a greater threat to computer
networks at home than do any potential enemies overseas. Last year, for
example, the "STONED!'' virus and several others somehow found their way into
nearly five thousand battlefield computers awaiting shipment to the Persian
Gulf.

I decided to see what other sinister secret messages were lurking in Windows
3.1's "WingDings" font.

If you type "IBM", you get a waving hand, a hand making an "OK" symbol, then
a bomb.  Obviously a reference to OS/2.

If you type "GOD", you get a hand pointing to heaven, a white flag, and a
thumbs down symbol.  Clearly Microsoft are a bunch of atheists.

If you type "MAC", you get a bomb, a V for victory sign, and a thumbs up.
Plainly inspired by the recent legal bombshell in the look-and-feel lawsuit.

If you type "UN", you get a crucifix followed by a skull and crossbones.
Obviously Microsoft knows something about the United Nations that we don't.

Another potentially interesting bit of information: In the beta-test versions
of Windows 3.1, three "dingbats" fonts were supplied -- Lucida arrows, Lucida
stars and Lucida icons.  WingDings seems to have been formed by condensing the
three into one single font.  It's interesting to note that whereas Lucida icons
had both black and white coloured hand symbols, WingDings has only the
white-skinned variety.

Following are items relating to two different newsgroups on PRIVACY.

Dennis Rears' DIGEST is purposefully on the permissive side, less stringently
moderated than RISKS; it is ideal for people who want relatively open
newsgroups.  Lauren Weinstein's FORUM will be on the selective side,
substantially more closely moderated than RISKS; it is suitable for people who
have little time, but have a vital interest in privacy.  Both gentlemen are
serious in their efforts.  I think there are many reasons for both groups to
coexist.  Perhaps one or the other will satisfy those people interested in
privacy issues who complain to RISKS that they want LESS MODERATION or MORE
MODERATION, respectively.

I hope that general discussions on privacy issues will continue to appear in
RISKS, because those issues represent serious risks.  Perhaps both moderators
will submit summaries of key discussions to RISKS for our wider audience.

Announcing the global Internet PRIVACY Forum!

The PRIVACY Forum is a moderated digest for the discussion and analysis of
issues relating to the general topic of privacy (both personal and collective)
in the "information age" of the 1990's and beyond.  Topics include a wide range
of telecommunications, information/database collection and sharing, and related
issues, as pertains to the privacy concerns of individuals, groups, businesses,
government, and society at large.  The manners in which both the legitimate and
the controversial concerns of business and government interact with privacy
considerations are also topics for the digest.

Except when unusual events warrant exceptions, digest publication will be
limited to no more than one or two reasonably-sized digests per week.  Given
the size of the Internet, this may often necessitate that only a small
percentage of overall submissions may ultimately be presented in the digest.
Submission volume also makes it impossible for unpublished submissions to be
routinely acknowledged.  Other mailing lists, with less stringent submission
policies, may be more appropriate for readers who prefer a higher volume of
messages regarding these issues.

The goal of PRIVACY Forum is to present a high quality electronic publication
which can act as a significant resource to both individuals and organizations
who are interested in these issues.  The digest is best viewed as similar in
focus to a journal or specialized technical publication.  The moderator will
choose submissions for inclusion based on their relevance and content.

The PRIVACY Forum is moderated by Lauren Weinstein of Vortex Technology.  He
has been active regarding a wide range of issues involving technology and
society in the ARPANET/Internet community since the early 1970's.  The Forum
also has an "advisory committee" consisting of three individuals who have
offered to act as a "sounding board" to help with any questions of policy which
might arise in the course of the Forum's operations.  These persons are Peter
Neumann of SRI International (the moderator of the excellent and renowned
Internet RISKS Forum digest), Marc Rotenburg of Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility (a most clear and articulate spokesman for sanity in
technology), and Willis Ware of RAND (one of the U.S.A.'s most distinguished
champions of privacy issues).

Feel free to distribute this announcement message to any interested individuals
or groups, but please keep this entire message intact when doing so.  Thanks!

                  How to subscribe to PRIVACY Forum

is:

  comp.society.privacy    Effects of technology on privacy (Moderated)

   This newsgroup is to provide a forum for discussion on the effect of
   technology on privacy. All too often technology is way ahead of the
   law and society as it presents us with new devices and
   applications.  Technology can enhance and detract from privacy.
   This newsgroup will be gatewayed to an internet mailing list.

&gt;END OF STORY.  Mark Seecof asks: has anyone seen the report itself? 
&gt;I'd like to know in what way it was a mistake to give McDonnell-Douglas
&gt;control over software development for a plane it was building?  

---flame on 

Well, since I was the Software Manager on the F-15E I can give you lots of
reasons from personal experience about why any Government agency should think
long and hard before giving McDonnell Douglas control over any software
project:

	1. Their insistence that flight-control software is not 
	flight-safety critical, since there was a hydraulic backup in 
	the F-15E aircraft.
		
	2. Refusal to perform software Formal Qualification Tests 
	prior to first flight, stating that the FQT is required only 
	on production aircraft, and F-15E-1 was not a production 
	aircraft.  FQT should be an iterative testing process, but 
	according to MCAIR, it was an acceptance test.
	
	3. Refusal to define software stored in ROM as software, 
	defining it instead as "firmware", and thus not subject to 
	formal review and testing.
	
These are just a few off the top of my head, five years after the fact.  Don't
get me wrong; I think MCAIR did a fantastic job on the F-15E.  It's one great
weapon system. But McDonnell Douglas's biggest problem on the F-15 project was,
even though they could build excellent aircraft and systems, they wouldn't tell
us government types (including this pitiful second lieutenant) anything unless
we pried it out of them with a crowbar.  And sometimes not even then, parroting
the tired line, "Out of scope [of the contract]!" This makes it extremely
difficult to get enough information to enable "organic support" (support by US
Government personnel) or second-sourcing of software after the systems are
delivered. Since the Advanced Tactical Fighter Program Office was right across
the hall at that time, every time I had a problem, I would go tell the people
writing the contracts for that program how responsive my contractor was being.
(In Air Force talk: "Check six!")

--flame off

But there may be another, more simple reason for the GAO's finding: I believe
that the US Government, not the prime contractor (MDC, in this case) has "total
system performance responsibility" for the C-17.  That is, a program office
residing at Wright-Patterson AFB has the responsibility for integrating and
testing every aspect of the aircraft, not the contractor who is building it.
Since software is the glue that holds a modern military aircraft together, this
may be why the GAO is faulting the C-17 SPO for not "controlling" the software.

Food Stamp Computer Clogs in Md. -- Overloaded System Causes Long Lines
By Retha Hill - Washington Post Staff Writer [Washington Post, 13 May 1992]

Maryland food stamp clients using a new electronic benefit system were unable
to buy groceries [on 6 May 1992 &lt;JR&gt;] after the state-of-the-art computer
system failed, causing long lines at hundreds of stores in the state.

The system, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture has said it plans to use
as a model for the rest of the coutry, became overloaded for the second time in
a month and shut down for about two hours as hundred, and possibly thousands,
of recipients tried to use their plastic benefit cards to make purchases.
Typically, the first few days of the month are heavy shopping days because that
is when clients receive benefits.

The system "reached a point where it clogged," said Helen Szablya, a
spokeswoman for the Maryland Department of Human Resources.  She said that she
did not know if other benefits that are encoded on the plastic cards, such as
welfare payments and child support, were affected.

About 31,000 Maryland residents in Montgomery, Prince Georges and Cecil
counties and Baltimore now have the cards.  Clients in Baltimore, Howard and
Anne Arundel counties are to get the cards by mid-summer, and eventually
200,000 recipients will use them.

Szablya said the electronic benefit transfer system is better than the old
method [Electronic systems are always "better", aren't they? :-) JR] of issuing
coupons to clients and said that problems are going to happen because it is the
first of its kind in the country. The system last stopped working April 11 for
about two hours.  "It's going to have a few blips.  We are happy with the fact
that we haven't had more," she said.

Shoppers and grocery store officials complained of long lines and carts loaded
with groceries abandoned as checkout stations.  Food stamp clients were given
$50 vouchers to make purchses, but cashiers had to call a toll-free number to
verify each transaction.

"We just think it's unfortunate that this happens and that it inconveniences
our customers," said Mitchell D. Herman, senior vice president for corporate
affairs for Shoppers Food Warehouse. [How true, how true. -- JR]

It is not uncommon in large companies to require an annual "payout", in which
each employee picks up their paycheck in person, displaying ID.  I think this
is to guard against payroll padding.

At the facility where I'm doing a project, all 1,500 employees received a memo 
ordering them to report to the cafeteria for their annual "peyote".  Peyote 
appeared several times in the memo, and even in the title line!  Eventually 
one of my colleagues ran "payout" through the spelling checker, and sure 
enough it suggested "peyote" as the alternative.

Perhaps the spelling checker writers are junior staff with closer ties to their
college counter-cultural days than to corporate terminology...

  About two years ago, I started getting some credit card statements a few days
late. All of them had an incorrect zip code and the post office had corrected
them by hand and resent them. I called up the offending credit card companies
and tried to correct the problem.  Two of them corrected it, one of them
couldn't/wouldn't. I eventually cancelled the card belonging to the bank that
couldn't get the address right.

  Well, for various reasons, I've taken my time in paying off the account, so I
still get statements from them, still with the wrong zip code. Apparently the
Post Office is cracking down on bad zip codes because both AT&amp;T and this
particular bank called me up this week to verify my address.

  About three months ago I finally figured out what I thought was the problem.
I live on Broadway, and my zip code is 02174. People frequently want to know if
it is Broadway Rd, Broadway St, Broadway Ln?  It's just Broadway. All of the
offending statements had my address as Broadway St, and my zipcode as 02111.
Someone's database, somewhere, mapped Broadway St. to a 02111 zip code and, if
the zip code was corrected but the street address wasn't, it would modify the
zip code again to what it believed was correct.

  So, I explained all this to the person from the bank, had her change the
street address and the zip code, and we'll see if it works.

  If anyone has any more information on this problem, I'd be interested in
hearing about it. I don't have enough time at the moment to track down which
database these guys are using. If anyone is curious, the bank is Chase
Manhattan.

This might be of some interest, as I recently was denied credit (temporarily)
due to inability of the credit grantor to verify my address.  I cleared that up
by sending copies of utility statements to the credit grantor, but out of
curiosity I took advantage of the free copy of the TRW credit report that
caused the denial.

Maybe I'm just different - I use my middle name and don't use my given first
name, and I use a PO box for as much correspondence as possible - but the
report was VERY sparse.  My address was three years out of date and they had no
info on my employer or on any of the credit cards that I customarily use.
There were NO negative reports from any of the institutions listed, and only
one neutral report.

Overall, I was fairly pleased with the lack of complete information on me -
unless it was all a ruse to lull me into a false sense of security about my
privacy.

Three credit reporting agencies exist (to my knowledge): TRW,
    Transunion (Merchants), and Holloway Credit Bureau.

Since I happen to have my credit report in hand (Holloway) which
    lists address/phone for Transunion and TRW, I called TRW
    long-distance and spoke with a representative about the free
    credit report. She gave me this number 1-800-392-1122.

The risk seems low IF you do the following rather than trusting
    some bulletin board posted P.O. Box address.

Go to a local credit bureau and get your report (~$10) or borrow
    someone's to get valid address/phone for TRW. Call and inquire.

Since this may cost a bit you could call the 1-800 number I got
    from TRW and wait until a representative comes on. The risk
    in trusting this posted phone number can be reduced by waiting 
    until a person comes on rather than trusting a computerized voice.

When questioned, the TRW representative (how knowledgeable?)
    implied that _establishing_ any kind of credit had nothing to
    do with this service. Also, a bill is not necessary ... just
    anything with the name-address linkage. Hmmm...

Seems that the risk of someone easily obtaining your credit report
    from TRW may be higher now.

Here are yet more stories concerning flight control software going wrong in
commercial passenger aircraft.  It is taken from the front page of the UK
``Sunday Telegraph'' May 17, 1992, a so-called ``quality newspaper''.  The
article is quoted in its entirety.

  Air scares over computers", Robert Matthew and Christopher Elliott.

  A spate of software errors forcing planes into sudden changes of speed and
  direction has rekindled concern about the use of computers by the aircraft
  industry.  An internal British Airways document discloses 10 serious
  incidents involving computer errors in January, including:

  - January 13, when the flight-management system on a Boeing 747-400 from
    Washington to Heathrow suddenly ordered a speed reduction of 50 knots.

  - January 26, when a Boeing 747-200 flying to Gatwick from Barbados
    experienced a sudden increase in thrust due to a software error.

  - January 27, when a Boeing 747-200 from Manchester to Islamabad suddenly
    pitched upwards.  The crew had to turn off the auto-pilot to bring the
    aircraft back into normal flight.

  Other computer errors have led to navigational deviations and to the
  auto-pilot wandering from the correct route.

  British Airways said action had been taken to rectify the problems, which did
  ``not present any threat to the safety of the aircraft''.  A spokesman added
  that the software had Civil Aviation Authority approval and had been tested
  by BA for more than 100 hours before entering service.

  But leading computer experts are worried that there is no adequate way of
  testing the enormously complex software routinely used by the aircraft
  industry.

  The British Computer Society will call this week for international standards
  on the design of safety-critical software, and for special qualifications
  from [sic] those working the field.

  Professor John Cullyer, of Warwick University, chairman of the society's
  Safety Critical Systems Task Force, said: ``We haven't for enough highly
  educated and trained checkers.  We actually know what we ought to be doing but
  we just don't have enough men and women sufficiently qualified.''

  Professor Bev Littlewood, of City University, London, has told the American
  Association for Computing Machinery that the aircraft industry could not
  substantiate claims for computer reliability."


There are couple of things that made me post this article.  Firstly, the number
of incidents - 10 in a single month with BA.  This implies that software is not
working in normal, routine, flying conditions, where you might expect the
behaviour of such systems to be correct.  There are no suggestions in the
article that "the pilot flew to low", "the pilot applied full thrust too late",
and so on, but that the systems themselves failed to perform correctly in
normal conditions.

The second is that at least some of the "software errors" were within
auto-pilot control systems (it may be all, the article is not clear - maybe BA
does not fly any fly-by-wire aircraft anyway, I don't know).  These systems
are, as I understand it, typically not used for takeoff or landing, but to fly
from A to B once airborne.  Given the number of years these systems have been
around, it worries me to think that these relatively simple systems fail at
this frequency, while fly-by-wire, with its increased complexity and the
increased reliance upon those systems for the safety of the aircraft, is now
being applied to commercial aircraft.

The third is that the software had "CAA approval", as if this is meant to make
us feel any better, and that it had been tested by BA themselves (not the CAA),
for "100 hours before entering service".  This does not seem particularly
rigorous to me!

The fourth came with the old call for qualifications for those working in
safety-critical software design; lack of suitably trained people.  Maybe the
CAA and aircraft manufacturers should be training their software personnel?

Those of you who read <A HREF="/Risks/13.46.html">RISKS-13.46</A> noted that computer software seemed to be
implicated in the crash of the only flying F-22 prototype.  A later report now
suggests pilot error.  As usual, the real causes are probably some combination
of a poorly designed human interface, software design and implementation
problems, hardware-software system response delays, and pilot problems
(training, complexity, etc.).

An AP report somewhen during 11-13 May (while I was in D.C.) had these
statements (starkly excerpted):

   A new Air Force videotape of the crash, shot from the plane's side, shows
the radar-eluding aircraft with its landing gear down as it nears the runway at
the California base.  The landing gear is then drawn back up about the same
time the afterburners go on. The plane then bucks wildly before hitting the
pavement, sliding several thousand feet and burning.  [...]
   Congressional sources, who requested anonymity, said the Air Force now
suspects that pilot error caused the crash. A final report is not expected for
several weeks after the Air Force completes its investigation.

   Air Force Chief of Staff Merrill McPeak [quoted in <A HREF="/Risks/13.46.html">RISKS-13.46</A> as hoping
that it was software, because that would be "relatively straightforward" to
fix] testified before Congress he suspected the crash was the result of a
mechanical malfunction in the plane's computer system.  "I am utterly convinced
personally that this is a very meritorious design," said McPeak [...].  The Air
Force chief of staff said he saw no need to change the program, which calls for
650 of the fighter planes to become operational in 2002.

I haven't entered this discussion because there are a lot of people with more
solid credentials, but there are some elementary points to be made. If I get my
ears pinned back, so it goes.

When something goes seriously wrong in a control system, a common result is
that the system goes unstable. The wild motions of the tail are due to
positive feedback between the control system, the pilot, and the aircraft
responses. As to what caused the instability, it can be almost anything,
software error, design error, hardware failure.

A likely explanation would be that the aircraft had some unexpected
aerodynamic characteristics in the low altitude, high weight regime that it
was flying (to be expected in a prototype aircraft, that's how test pilots
earn their pay). The result was a "PIO" (Pilot-Induced Oscillation).

One can view this as a software error since the fix is to change the software
to allow for the unexpected dynamics, or as a pilot error since he was part of
the positive feedback loop, but it is better to classify it as a design problem
since one of the goals of the design is to avoid creating a situtation in which
a PIO is possible.

I recorded the same footage and played it several times in slow motion to
observe the porpoising motion of the ship. A flash from the cockpit (assumed to
be the ejection system) could be seen at the end, just before the ship kissed
the runway.

I believe you'll find that large, rapid movements of control surfaces are a
common feature of modern fly-by-wire control systems for fighters. It is
necessary because of the complex flying modes involved, particularly on
take-off and landings, which limit control surface effectiveness. Special
[non-linear] servo modes are involved.

Such problems are likely to be exacerbated on the YF-22 which is probably an
unstable design to begin with (to achieve maximum maneuverability) stabilized
by the computerized control system.

&gt;  Odd that the software should be seen as a possible cause of the crash, ...

You can almost bet that the pilot was NOT the problem. The handful of people
who can qualify as test pilots are not the sort to make the mistake of extreme
pilot input. Many have been known to cooly report problems and symptoms in the
last few seconds of their lives.

As for software, someone observed that if buildings were constructed like
programs, the first woodpecker to come along would destroy civilization!
(Still, I would expect this particular control program to be a state of the art
example of good software..)

&gt;  I though most aircraft could dump/vent excess fuel, you don't have to be at low
&gt;  altitude to do this, do you?  

That's another problem. Suppose we suddenly reduce the flight weight of a
fighter by a significant percentage? It seems reasonable that the ship might
need to be retrimmed quite a bit after a major fuel dump, so it is probably not
prudent to do it at low altitudes.

All well designed aircraft have a fuel jettison system for dumping fuel.  Most
fuel is dumped at higher altitudes so that it evaporates before it hits the
ground; however, if your aircraft is in distress and is at a low altitude and
you are someplace isolated like the F-22 was, who cares if you jettison the
fuel.

The claim that the F-22 was doing these low altitude high speed passes to
reduce its fuel load so it could land with a greater saftey margin sounds bogus
to me.  If the aircraft was in distress these aren't the kind of maneuvers a
prudent pilot would be doing.

Also, what about the risks of speaking out of turn.  I feel Gen.  McPeak's
statements are a bit premature and could bias the accident investigators.  I
don't how many times I have gone done the wrong path in tracking down a
software problem because I was biased by the information given to me by a
software developer (who's judgement, expertise, ect. I trusted).  Moral of the
story, start at the beginning and follow your judgement not theirs.  If the
investigators were to think: Hey, let's look at the s/w and computers because
that's where the Gen. says the problem is... well you know what happens next.

Older Boeing 747 Airplanes Suspected of Diving Due to Design Flaw

   SEATTLE (AP) - The Boeing Co. should redesign the autopilot system on
hundreds of 747 jumbo jets because of a flaw that could send the planes into a
dive, the National Transportation Safety Board said.
   The board has asked the Federal Aviation Administration to order the
redesign, NSTB chairwoman Susan Coughlin said Thursday.
   The board investigated an incident in December in which a 747-100 cargo jet
rolled to the right and dove 10,000 feet from an altitude of 31,000 feet while
on a flight from Anchorage to New York.
   Stray signals told the autopilot to put the plane into a roll, according to
Coughlin, who cited tests by Canadian authorities on the Evergreen
International Airlines aircraft. It is unknown what caused the signals, she
said.
   The plane landed safely.
   The FAA will decide within 90 days whether to order the redesign, spokesman
Dave Duff said.
   ``We believe the autopilot system is safe,'' Boeing spokesman Chris Villiers
said.
   The NTSB request includes the systems on 724 airplanes delivered between
1969 and the late 1980s. A different autopilot system is used now.

Those interested in the C-17 software report from GAO can get a free copy by
calling (202) 275-6241 and asking for report IMTEC-92-48, dated May 7, 1992.
The title is "Embedded Computer Systems: Significant Software Problems on C-17
Must be Addressed."  Alternatively, call your Congressman's or Senator's
district office and ask them to get it for you from GAO.

P.S. [for PGN, but relevant here in case you try to send mail to James!] 
  [For reasons DELETED, ] messages going to PAUL@NOVA.HOUSE.GOV have
  been wafting off into the electronic ether somewhere.  We are supposed to be
  back on-line again sometime soon, but until then I've been downloading RISKS
  from the archives to try and keep up.  You'll love the C-17 report -- GAO
  says "The C-17 is a good example of how _not_ to approach software
  development when procuring a major weapons system."  It has most of the usual
  problems -- underestimated risks, failure of the customer to exert control,
  poor documentation.  Great reading material for classes in software
  development.

In today's [19th of May] issue of the "Volkskrant", a quality Dutch newpaper
there appeared an article which says that the Departments of Justice and
Traffic are studying the possibility to introduce smart cards to detect, among
other things, violations of the traffic laws such as speeding (quite common on
the Dutch highways), crossing red lights, frauds with number plates etc.  The
other things that could be controlled is whether the car owner has paid his
insurance fee (obligatory in The Netherlands), his road tax, and whether the
car has had it's yearly technical check (APK).

The system under study consists of a smart car to be attached to the car,
detectors in or near the roads and a central computer system.

The article says: "A major drawback is the possible feeling that `Big Brother
is watching you'.  By installing a privacy code, data on law violations will
only be transferred to the relevant organizations.  Another problem is the
value of information obtained by electronic means and stored in magnetic form
in court.  Currently, it is up to the judges to value the information provided
by computer systems."

The article ends with: "The organizational consequences, however, are
still completely unclear.  Of course, attention should be paid to the
protection of the system against tampering."

Risks.... obvious!!!

There has been a lot of talk on the net, (and off the net) about whether or not
it is legal or proper for a system administrator to capture keystrokes of
intruders/trespassers who are using their system to break into the systems of
others.  We all remember Cliff Stoll's exploits in "The Cookoo's Egg" where he
traced the German Hackers through LBL by keystroke capture, and then notified
downstream users that they were being attacked.

Several people (and organizations) have taken the position that keystroke
capture both violates privacy rights and constitutes illegal electronic
surveillance.  I believe that, with respect to *intruders* both these arguments
are specious.

Fourth Amendment

The principal protection against *governmental* intrusions into privacy rights
is the Fourth Amendment to the constitution which provides that:

  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
  effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,
  and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or
  affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the
  persons or things to be seized.

It is important to note that this only applies to searches performed by the
government. Burdeau v. McDowell, 256 U.S. 465, 475 (1921) even if the
government is not acting in a law enforcement capacity New Jersey v. T.L.O.,
469 U.S. 325, 336 (1985). Thus, to the extent a sysop is not a "government
agent" the Fourth Amendment is not implicated.

Also, in order for there to be a Fourth Amendment violation, the individual
must have exhibited an actual subjective expectation of privacy (Katz v. U.S.,
389 U.S. 347, 361 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring)) and society must be prepared
to recognize that expectation as objectively reasonable.  An intruder should
have neither a subjective expectation of privacy, nor should society recognize
any expectation of privacy as "reasonable."  Thus, if you break into my system,
I should be able not only to kick you off, but also to monitor what you do on
my system.

Finally, the general sanction for violation of the Fourth Amendment is
suppression of the illegally seized evidence and its fruits. Weeks v. U.S., 232
U.S. 383, 398 (1914) (federal search); Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 655 (1961)
(state search).  Thus, a private keystroke capture of an intruder would not
violate the Fourth Amendment.

Electronic Surveillance

In 1986 Congress amended the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to prohibit
the unlawful interception of electronic communications, including e-mail and
the like.  In general, the law, contained in Title 18 of the United States
Code, Section 2511, prohibits the interception of wire, oral or electronic
communications.  HOWEVER, there are several provisions which would permit
keystroke monitoring in certain circumstances.

First, 18 U.S.C.  2511(2)(a)(i) notes that:

  It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for an operator of a switchboard,
  or an officer, employee, or agent of a provider of wire or electronic
  communication service [bbs operator] . . . to intercept, disclose or use that
  communication in the normal course of his employment while engaged in any
  activity which is necessarily incident to the rendition of his service or to
  the protection of the rights or property of the provider of that service,
  except that a provider of wire communication service to the public shall not
  utilize service observing or random monitoring except for mechanical or
  service quality control checks.

While this statute is not a model of clarity, and fails to define key terms
like what is a *provider* of electronic communication service (the network
administrator? the sysop?) it appears to permit electronic interception and
keystroke capture it this is necessary to protect the rights and property of
the provider of the service.  If the intruder is breaking in to the computer of
*another* (not the provider) and the provider can easily terminate this
unauthorized use, then it could be argued that the keystroke capture is not
necessary to protect *his* property.  However, the statute uses the term
"necessarily incident to . ."  not "necessary to" and, in light of the strong
possibility of downstream liability to the provider for somehow permitting the
intruder to use his system to break into another's, a strong argument can be
made that keystroke monitoring of intruders is reasonable, prudent, and
necessarily incident to the protection of rights and property.

In addition, 18 U.S.C.  2510(13) defines a "user" of electronic
communications as:

     any person or entity who -

     (A)  uses an electronic communication service; and

     (B)  is duly authorized by the provider of such service
          to engage in such use.

Since an intruder is not authorized to use the service, he is not a "user"
entitled to protection under the statute.  Finally, while warning banners are
helpful to demonstrate a lack of authorization to use a particular system, they
are not required to demonstrate a lack of authorization any more than "No
trespassing" signs are necessary to demonstrate a lack of authorization for an
individual to, for example, break into your house. (a simplistic analogy
admittedly)

This is, of course, only part of the story.  Many states have privacy statutes,
and their own definitions of illegal electronic interception, and this does not
address potential civil liability to users for excessive keystroke capture.
However, I believe that if keystroke monitoring is accomplished in a reasonable
and prudent fashion, it would not run afoul of either the constitutional or
statutory provisions.  Let the trespasser beware!!!

Yes, that's right.  Serving lunch to Barbara Bush can cause all sorts of
problems from the past to be dug up.  My roommate and I found out firsthand on
Saturday afternoon.  He called me 20 minutes after I dropped him off at work,
saying "It seems I'm in jail.  Can you come downtown and bail me out?  Bring
$220."

The cause?  It seems they did a background check on all the hotel employees
that would be involved in the function that day.  He had bounced one too many
checks at a grocery store in the northern Wisconsin town where he lived -- a
year and a half ago.  The checks were all paid before he moved down here and he
had no idea that any charges had been filed.

Mary Culnan reported the lengthy list of items that TRW asks for in order
to receive the free credit report.  Peter Loshin reported that he found
his credit report satisfyingly "sparse".  TRW is reported to be in the
information-sales business which would imply large and quite complete
records.  How does one reconcile all of that?

The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that a copy of the "credit report"
be given to anyone upon request [or for fee] or upon denial of credit.  At
the time the FCRA was passed [roughly 1970], things were simple in the
credit-reporting and information business.  They are not today.

One must wonder what the definition of "credit report" would be in today's
world.  I'm sure that the TRWs of the world would argue that it would be
just that part of a data-subject's record that is pertinent to a credit
decision.  It is unlikely that any data-subject gets the full content
of the record by requesting a credit report, although it is tempting to
believe to the contrary.

I know of no law compelling the credit reporting industry to go beyond
furnishing the most simplistic from of an individual's record; namely, that
part of the record pertinent to credit matters.  One does not know what the
status of the individual's total record might be.  We're not seeing them, but
it's obvious that they're available for sale.  Might they be subject to
subpoena without knowledge of the data-subject?  One wonders what corporate or
industry policy is on that count.

Of course not everything need be included in a single record.  A company could
maintain separate databases -- although perhaps less efficiently -- for credit
reporting vs. general information sales.  Of course, modern software can easily
subset a record for printing, but it really doesn't matter from the viewpoint
of the data-subject who is not seeing everything.

The RISKS digest is available via WAIS.  there are two servers, one run by TMC
and one by me.  TMC's is better, but is available only during restricted hours.

WAIS is a distributed full-text search system based on the Z39.50 protocol.
There are on the order of 200 public servers scattered around the world which
provide a straightforward way to search through mailing list and newsgroup
archives, network directories and catalogs, poetry, weather, back issues of the
Communications of the ACM, and a variety of other stuff.

For more information, ftp to think.com then "cd wais".  or see the
comp.infosystems.wais newsgroup.

Below are the "source" files for the two servers:

How true - but the root cause of the current software crisis (which is widely
unknown to the user community) is that it's bad for business to talk about the
down side.  Let me give a few examples:

I was writing a monthly column for a rag in the Unix world, and it was
cancelled because (according to the publisher) the advertisers threatened to
pull their ads if the security problems with Unix were published in the rag.
This despite the fact that I included code to fix every problem I described in
the same article as I described the problem.

I was writing a monthly column for another rag in the Netware world, and the
Novelle lawyers told the publication they would sue if my articles were not
stopped!  It seems they were upset that I was pointing out how netware could be
abused and how to avoid the problems inherent in the implementation.  Ther goes
another forum for the public.

Over the last several years, I have applied for positions in over 100
universities, and the universal response is that protection is not of interest
to the university community.  This dispite the recent report from the US
National Research Council that calls for increased university research in the
field.

You cannot find a single US university (and only a few outside the US) with
more than 2 computer security experts on the same faculty.  You also cannot
find a university in the US where more than one person was hired with the prior
knowledge that they have computer security interest (again I am talking about
faculty positions).  With the educators woefully ignorant, we can only expect
the students to be equally ignorant.

I have dealt with literally hundreds of companies over the last 10 years in the
area of computer security consulting, and the universal feeling seems to be
that you only invoke security after a disaster forces you to, and then you back
away from it as soon as possible afterwards.  It's like insurance, except that
the board won't force you to get it, and the stockholders are never told that
it's imprudent not to have it.

The media constantly hits the idea that any security system can be broken and
that the human end of things saves the day.  This makes the technological end
of protection a negative in most people's minds.  The social implication is
that regular people rarely see any benefits with protection systems.  How come
we never hear on the risks forum about any successes where the computer
security system saves people?  It happens every day you know.  How about a few
nuclear reactor stories where human error was detected and corrected by a
computer and saved us from a meltdown?  How about some airplane stories where
fly-by-wire kept a small plane from (large plane?)  crashing when the pilot was
hurt in a collision with a flock of birds?  How about the people saved every
day by airbags and anti-lock brakes?  I know that the risks forum is intended
to help us see and understand the risks, but many in the media view this forum
as well, and perhaps we should consider the risks of only discussing failures
and ignoring successes.

So, this whole thing was inspired by the British story about BA incidents.  I
have been in a 747-400 flying from DC to Heathrow (it starts in Pittsburgh)
several times, and once we were told after a very smooth landing on a fairly
poor landing condition day, that the computer have made the landing for us.  I
was pleased to know that I was an unwitting part of the great experiment,
butthe landing was far smoother than most pilot landings in similar conditions,
so I should feel pretty good about it.

The point is that the reason we don't have enough experts to do QA is that we
don't teach that stuf in schools, we punish those who follow that line (as a
society), and not enough executives lose their children in these incidents to
cause them to care about it.  After all, we can't even detect a bomb on a 747
flying out of the most security conscious airport in the world (Heathrow -
commercial that is), so why do we think we can track down minor computer
software bugs that don't even kill hundreds of people?

Well, that's enough space for now - I'll continue my ravings at a later date.

P.S.  How can we expect these computer systems to work so well when the
computer I use to talk to the network doesn't let me see the last line when I
reach the end of a page, doesn't let me backspace past a line break, and
doesn't automatically check for spelling errors before sending my mail out?
And this is a computer operated by the NSA designed for multilevel secure
operation.  It obviously has some major integrity problems.  Until we get
computers past these problems, I doubt if we will be able to design a truly
safe fly-by-wire system to control aircraft.

Simon Marshall drew our attention to an article on: 

&gt; the front page of the UK ``Sunday Telegraph'' May 17, 1992, a so-called 
&gt; ``quality newspaper''. 

This was rather useful, since the only Sunday paper I normally read is the 
``Observer'' (a *real* quality newspaper :-). 

I would like to make a few comments on the article itself and on Simon's 
comments. 

The article states: 

&gt;&gt; But leading computer experts are worried that there is no adequate way of
&gt;&gt; testing the enormously complex software routinely used by the aircraft
&gt;&gt; industry.

and Simon comments: 

&gt;   Given the number of years these systems have been
&gt; around, it worries me to think that these relatively simple systems fail at
&gt; this frequency, while fly-by-wire, with its increased complexity and the
&gt; increased reliance upon those systems for the safety of the aircraft, is now
&gt; being applied to commercial aircraft.

So are the systems complex or simple? 

It depends which on-board system we are talking about. 

Fly-by-wire systems (according to my best information - the probability of an 
outsider being allowed to see the source code are slightly less than the 
required maximum probability of failure of a critical avionics system, i.e., 
10^-9. :-) are *relatively* simple. They accept an input vector of flight 
parameters, multiply it by a matrix whose elements represent the "flight 
control laws" in force at that moment, and output a vector of signals to  
the hydraulic actuators which move the flight control surfaces. They control 
the second-by-second behaviour of the aircraft, and they don't have to 
"remember" too much: in the event of a transient failure, it is usually 
acceptable to reset them by switching off and on (if you have time! :-). 

On the other hand they *are* regarded as "critical" from a certification 
point of view: they possess modes of failure which can crash the 'plane. 

Flight Management Systems, on the other hand, are (by any standards) 
horrendously complex. They not only include the function of the traditional 
autopilot, but can also guide the aircraft over its entire route, including 
performing an automatic landing. To do this, they can in some cases access a 
database of airport information and topographical details of the approach 
terrain, and can select the cheapest or fastest route. 

However, they are *not* regarded as critical: the pilot can override them, 
and if you just happen to be a few miles off-course, it's not necessarily 
fatal. 

&gt;  at least some of the "software errors" were within
&gt; auto-pilot control systems (it may be all, the article is not clear - 

The incidents cited in the article all involve sudden unintended manouevres. 
They *could* be due to the FMS "telling" the FBW to do something stupid, but 
might conceivably arise within the FBW. (Where the under/over thrust 
conditions are concerned, bear in mind that the FBW must "talk to" the 
engine controller, these days almost invariably a Full-Authority Digital 
Engine Controller (FADEC), and that the software in the FADEC is a single 
point of failure, since there is no diversity of the software in the duplex 
channels of the FADEC.) 

&gt;  maybe BA does not fly any fly-by-wire aircraft anyway, I don't know). 

It operates some A320s. The aircraft in the three incidents described are all 
recent Boeings, which don't have quite the same degree of automation at the 
FBW level, but still have some. 

&gt; The third is that the software had "CAA approval", as if this is meant to 
&gt; make us feel any better, and that it had been tested by BA themselves 
&gt; (not the CAA), 

A few facts about "CAA approval": 

To start with, the regulations stipulate quantitative demonstration of 
reliability for *systems*, i.e., the manufacturer must convince the 
Airworthiness Authorities that an on-board system has the famous maximum 
probability of catastrophic failure of 10^-9 per flying hour. (For less 
serious failure modes, higher probabilities are allowed.) 

For the *software* in those systems, however, NO FIGURE IS PLACED ON 
RELIABILITY. Instead, a *process* certification, rather than a *product* 
certification is employed: the manufacturer has to provide the Authority 
with documents which show that a "good job" has been done in developing 
the software. These include (for software in critical systems) test plans 
and reports, details of inspections carried out, summary of achievement 
(whatever that is), etc., etc. These procedures and the required documents 
are specified in a set of guidelines: ``Software Considerations in Airborne 
Systems and Equipment Certification'', referred to as RTCA/DO-178A. 

In no case do these guidelines oblige the manufacturer to make available to 
the Authority either a machine-readable copy of the source code or object code. 
The question of the Authority (or anyone else) doing independent verification 
and validation (IV&amp;V) therefore simply does not arise with the regulations as 
they stand. 

&gt; for "100 hours before entering service".  This does not seem particularly
&gt; rigorous to me!

I disagree that this is "not particularly rigorous". It's pathetic! In fact, 
I suspect that a proof-reader failed to spot a missing zero or two here. 
The A320 systems were run on a ground simulator for a year before the first 
test flight, and run for a further year in flight and on simulators before 
service. 

&gt; The fourth came with the old call for qualifications for those working in
&gt; safety-critical software design; lack of suitably trained people. 

What John Cullyer meant here was training in formal mathematical methods: 
the use of formal specification languages such as Z or VDM, together with 
mathematical proof of correctness as part of verification. He's right, except 
that the use of such methods does not guarantee perfect software. In fact, 
no method that we know of, and possibly no *conceivable* method, would ever 
enable us to claim the incredibly low failure probability required by the 
regulations, where software is concerned (which would have been the main 
message imparted by Bev Littlewood in his talk to the ACM).

The Sunday Telegraph report was based on an issue of British Airways'
newsletter FlyWise, which seems to be a monthly safety awareness newsletter
for BA pilots. This issue covered January, and more incidents were caused by
software than by any other cause except ground handling (eg trucks
colliding with parked aircraft, baggage handlers denting the hull).

The UK trade paper, Computer Weekly, is covering the story in this Thursday's
issue. BA have apparently told them that the faults in the 747-100 and -200
were the result of a maintenance upgrade to the FMS, and were not
safety-critical.

So, do these incidents provide any reason for concern? Do they reveal process
failures in software maintenance? Do they reveal failures in recertification?
Will DO-178B help? Should all airlines make their safety-records available for
statistical analysis, so that Bev Littlewood can predict *next* year's
reliability figures? These are some of the questions which probably won't be
found in next week's Sunday Telegraph.

The computer-controlled hydraulic system for the stage at the Munich Opera is a
wonder of modern technology, controlling all rolling side stages, platforms,
flats and panels.  It is the ultimate play-by-wire system and for many
explicitly programmed operas the show cannot go on without it.  The problem is
that the hydraulic fluid used in the new system (circulating in the old water
pipes) is 50,000 liters of ecologically correct Quintolubric oil, made in the
Netherlands.  Unfortunately, it is biodegradable, and the bacteria left over
from the old pipes love it.  The result is a nasty yellow slime that multiplies
fruitfully.  The repertory has been trimmed dramatically, excluding those works
that cannot be performed without it, and reducing some others to concert
versions.  Some performances have had to be halted in mid-scene, which requires
cleaning all vents and filters.  Audiences are upset.  The cost to fix the
problem (presumably to replace all the pipes and change the oil to something
ecologically less sound) is estimated at $24M.  [Source: A NY Times article by
John Rockwell, seen in the San Francisco Chronicle, 26 May 1992, p.E2]

  THOUSANDS DIAL LONG-DISTANCE 'FREE' AS A COMPUTER GLITCH HANGS UP BELL
               Star Ledger:Newark-NJ, 22 May 1992, p.1

New Jersey Bell officials said yesterday that thousands of New Jersey Bell
customers have been dialing long-distance between February 17 and April 27
without being billed for any of the calls. The situation, involving about two
million calls, was blamed by New Jersey Bell on an internal programming error.
The error affected 15 exchanges in the state and blanketed all direct-dialed
calls made through AT&amp;T.  New Jersey Bell said the calls were registered and
customers will eventually be back-billed, which could result in some large
telephone bills. However, an AT&amp;T spokesperson said customers could contact New
Jersey Bell to "arrange a flexible billing arrangement so there is no financial
hardship."

White House Fights to Erase E-Mail Backups

From a story by Paul Houston in the L.A. Times 20 May 1992:

Two days before President Bush took office, a researcher discovered that the
new Administration planned to erase computer backup tapes containing thousands
of messages sent by "electronic mail" [sic] throughout the White House of
departing President Ronald Reagan.

The report alarmed groups representing historians and reporters, who for
decades have been able to go to the National Archives and plow through the
records of past Administrations, gaining valuable insight into how policies
were formed and carried out.

The groups knew that some E-mail tapes already had been shown to carry
incriminating messages between former National Security Advisor John M.
Poindexter and his aide, Oliver L. North, in the Iran-Contra scandal.

Fearing that much more treasure was about to vanish in this new electronic age,
one group immediately filed suit and won a temporary order preserving many
tapes.  That ignited a far-reaching clash between researchers and the Bush
Administration that is finally coming to a head Friday in federal court.

At stake is not only past tapes but present ones, which are being regularly
erased before unknown numbers of messages can be printed out and saved for the
National Archives.

"We are probably losing fascinating snatches of things that provide
illumination and point you in new directions," laments Robert J. Donovon, who
has written histories of former Presidents Harry S. Truman, Dwight D.
Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy.

BACKGROUND:  The federal Records Act requires that "all books, papers, maps,
photographs, machine readable materials" dealing with government "policies,
decisions, procedures, operations" be preserved for the National Archives.

In 1978, Congress made clear that the law applied to presidential records,
including "electronic or mechanical recordations."  The move blocked an attempt
by former President Richard M. Nixon to control--and theoretically destroy--all
tapes of conversations between him and his staff that had led to his
resignation in the Watergate scandal.

When the Iran-Contra affair broke in 1987, investigators searched White House
computer tapes for messages involving Poindexter, North and other White House
aids.  The aides thought they had erased the messages--but many were preserved
on backup memory [sic] tapes.

One message that has been made public concerned a 1986 meeting at which North
later admitted he lied to a group of congressmen about his support of the
Nicaraguan Contras.  A Poindexter aide reported by E-mail that "session was
success," with North saying that he "gave no military advice" to the Contras.
Poindexter forwarded the note to North, attaching an E-mail message of his own
that said: "Well done."

ISSUES:  "The Administration would call those two words a mere telephone
message slip," and not a record that must be preserved, says Thomas Blanton,
head of the National Security Archive, a research center that filed the pending
suit.  "But a historian would say those words give the whole picture of
suborning testimony to Congress," he added.

The plaintiffs contend that the records preservation law clearly covers E-mail
and that the head archivist has sole authority to determine which White House
messages should be kept for posterity.

Justice Department attorneys respond that a White House manual--leaving it to
aides to decide which E-mail should be printed out for safekeeping--is
sufficient to comply with the law.  Most of the messages are personal or
trivial anyway, the attorneys contend.

The plaintiffs have asked U.S. District Judge Charles Richey to order the
Administration to turn over a large sampling of E-mail from the Reagan years so
he can determine whether it--and by extension, much subsequent E-mail--should
be preserved.  Richey is expected to rule on the request Friday.

Did I miss an earlier discussion of the March 1991 Report of the (US) National
Critical Technologies Panel?

The software section makes depressing reading.  Complexity is identified as the
problem.  CASE is identified as The Answer.

Under "Innovative Concepts", two are identified: rapid prototyping and modular
software.  (Perhaps this section got left in from a report a decade earlier, by
mistake :-)

The impossibility of exhaustive testing is identified, yet testing is seen to
be the answer! "Intensive efforts are underway to develop advanced testing
tools that attempt to simulate the broadest possible set of conditions in which
a program might operate.  By reducing manual quality control requirements, these
tools have the potential to greatly shorten the software development cycle and
reduce development costs".  By juxtaposition, this is set as the solution to
"complex software cannot be exhaustively tested prior to release".

The section ends: "The central challenge in software development is automated
code generation for sophisticated programs. The development of such tools is
largely dependent upon artificial intelligence and other software-based
technologies. ... ...".

The Risk? That someone might actually believe this stuff (although I concede
that it seems unlikely).

I think there's a gigantic conceptual leap from the skepticism that people 
may have that an extant system (UNIX, in this case) can be reliably hacked 
to be something that it wasn't intended to be--secure--to extrapolating that 
to a broad notion that the ground-up design of a secure system is impossible.  
There are bases for both viewpoints: what actually happens has largely to 
do with the usual design trade-offs of features vs. functionality, and how
much money the developing agency has to throw at the problem.  

UNIX, with its historically anarchic functional development, and relatively 
simple OS, is a particularly bad example to be using.  Yeah, there are lots 
of people at work developing secure UNIX, but I have doubts as to what's 
being done to the OS to pull it off.  What they produce might run a shell, 
all the right software, and keep the bogiemen out, but the hackwork that's 
involved is pretty impressive.  And hackwork tends to produce unforeseen 
effects: thus a never-ending cycle of fixes and hacks, to plug those 
unforeseen problems, in an ever-increasingly complex OS.  It's no wonder 
people are skeptical.

Changing the fundamental emphasis of an aspect of an existing complex software 
system-- in this case, changing the "security" emphasis of UNIX to keeping 
errant Russians out, from keeping errant students or casual intruders out--is 
always more tricky than designing a system designed for a SPECIFIC emphasis 
from scratch.  

&gt;  How come
&gt;we never hear on the risks forum about any successes where the computer
&gt;security system saves people?  

Why should we?  We all know such systems exist.  Or, at least, we hope
they exist.  I'm not willing to adjudge any complex program *I* write as
"100% reliable."  Notwithstanding logical or semantic errors, there are many 
ways in which a language can be misinterpreted or misimplemented by a given 
compiler.  What's the cut-off point at which we can claim to judge a section
of code "reliable"?  100,000 lines?  50,000 lines?  10 lines?  Is an ag-
gregate of such reliable segments in itself reliable?  You tell me. 

The *problems* occur where systems fail.  It's way too easy to fall into a 
see-no-evil, hear-no-evil mindset, which seems to be precisely that which 
your advertisers--who you're complaining about--wish to propagate!  
It is my perception that the risks forum was intended *precisely* to offer an
alternative to the widespread propagation of such attitudes in the industry.  
It serves an important purpose: to show people (including a great many 
students, not yet a part of the Real World) that the spec sheets can't always 
be believed; that sloppy, cheap design is all too often the order of the day; 
and that ideal, elegant solutions don't always get done right in the real
world.  We can read about elegant solutions in the journals, or have them 
ordained from some professor, any time.  

&gt;nuclear reactor stories where human error was detected and corrected by a
&gt;computer and saved us from a meltdown?  

But isn't it so much more productive to concentrate on cases where such
meltdowns were averted only by the last level of redundancy?  And then 
debate why higher levels of redundancy failed?  The possibility of the
last level of redundancy failing NEXT time is so unacceptable that we
can't possibly take time off and thank our lucky stars that we got it 
right, this time.  Safety-critical systems require--DEMAND--INTENSE 
scrutiny and criticism.

&gt;So, this whole thing was inspired by the British story about BA incidents.  

But don't forget the two pilots in the cockpit, monitoring the instruments,
*waiting* for the all-important comparator or autopilot annunciator to 
indicate a failure state, and ready, at the first sign of trouble, to
CLICK IT OFF and go around.  This being the sole emphasis of all their
training: the determination of the point when a situation's going to hell,
and what to do.  An integral part of the *safety* checks of the system.  
THAT thought makes me comfortable, through a landing in weather I wouldn't 
be caught driving a car in.  Unfortunately, though, I KNOW airline pilots 
who have too much faith in the automation, who expect it to do what they tell 
it to, who view it as an abstract entity that "does" things, and not merely a 
machine, a collection of parts, decisions, and compromises, a machine 
which, like all machines, can FAIL.  They are trained like any other airline 
pilot, but can spend lifetimes with no fundamental problems, and get sloppy.  
Those pilots (and their passengers) DIE when they get too far behind the 
airplane, and rely on the computer to do their job.  And lo and behold, the 
747-400, which makes such wonderful landings, has a cockpit environment so 
secure, so amazing, that it's almost tailor-made to produce such attitudes.  

But I know: the solution to sloppy pilots in automated cockpits is to increase
the automation ("Hey, we can do it!"), to protect us from the pilots (ala
A3[2-4]0 FBW), which, in turn, can produce even more isolated, insulated
attitudes, thus producing even more fundamental mistakes.  Ad nauseum.

Enjoy your next flight. :-)

&gt;The point is that the reason we don't have enough experts to do QA is that we
&gt;don't teach that stuf in schools, we punish those who follow that line (as a
&gt;society), 

I think you're mistaken.  The sole reason that highly robust systems are not
pursued, whether it be operating systems or retail-vertical software, is money.
Cheap solutions that fit the customer or marketing specification, that don't
break too often, are the order of the day.  When companies are willing to spend
more money on development--and research on methods, and training decent
software engineers, and willing to postpone release a couple of years when the
production process--which is an art, not a science, and not amenable to Harvard
Business School management tactics--bogs down, AND society's willing to
shoulder the extra costs all that will engender: THEN we'll have something to
talk about. :-)

I can see what you're saying, but I don't think your position's very 
productive.  Several times a year, RISKS sees "lighten up!" posts, but 
let's keep the name and charter of the digest in mind.  

Perhaps we need a "USA Today" version of RISKS, a respite for when the gloom 
and doom becomes a bit much. :-)

This is the third Working Conference on this topic, following the successful
conferences held in August, 1989, at Santa Barbara (USA) and in February, 1991,
at Tucson (USA). As evidenced by papers that were presented and discussed at
those meetings, critical applications of computing systems are concerned with
differing service properties, relating to both the nature of proper service and
the system's ability to deliver it. These include thresholds of performance and
real-time responsiveness that demark loss of proper service (failure),
continuity of proper service, ability to avoid catastrophic failures, and
prevention of deliberate privacy intrusions.

The notion of dependability, defined as the trustworthiness of computer service
such that reliance can justifiably be placed on this service, enables these
various concerns to be subsumed within a single conceptual framework.
Dependability thus includes as special cases such attributes as reliability,
availability, safety, and security. In keeping with the goals of the previous
conferences, the aim of this meeting is to encourage further integration of
theory, techniques, and tools for specifying, designing, implementing,
assessing, validating, operating, and maintaining computer systems that are
dependable in the broad sense. Of particular, but not exclusive interest, are
presentations that address combinations of dependability attributes, e.g.
safety and security, through studies of either a theoretical or an applied
nature.

As a Working Conference, the program has been designed in order to promote the
exchange of ideas by extensive discussions. All the paper sessions will end
with a 30 minute discussion period on the topics dealt with in the session. In
addition to the paper sessions, three panel sessions have been organized. The
first, entitled "Safe Vehicle-Highway Systems" will explore safety
requirements, design methods and validation techniques for computing and
communication subsystems associated with intelligent vehicle-highway systems.
The second, entitled "Malicious and Inadvertent Human Operator Faults" will
explore current and proposed techniques for detecting and countering faults
introduced by the human operator. The third, entitled "Security Issues in
Intelligent Networks" will deal with privacy problems related to the delivery
of intelligent network services and related customer control, along with
network security problems mostly related to open network provisioning.

Advance registration as well as hotel reservation is required. No on-site
registration will be available.

In this week's Aviation Week and Space magazine, there is an article entitled
"Mission Control Saves Intelsat Rescue from Software, Checklist Problems."  In
the article it is stated that:

  Analysis of the problem showed that it occurred when IBM, with NASA
  approval, made pre-launch changes in rendezvous software.  ``It didn't work
  exactly the way they thought it would work,'' [launch director] Hale said.

  The problem not only threatened the rendezvous, but also raised questions
  about the entire shuttle guidance and control software. ... ``We were
  concerned about the safety of all the other software on the orbiter -- if the
  computers don't work, nothing on the orbiter works.''

The Town of Vienna is a small bedroom-community enclave of about 15,000 people
in the northern Virginian suburban overflow of Washington DC.  Although
dependent on the surrounding Fairfax County for many services (most notably
schools and, for the sake of the second story, the cable franchise), Vienna
does have its own police force. 

  Vienna is proposing to maintain a voluntary-entry next-of-kin database for
  all town residents, to be used only in the event of death or medical
  emergency.  Contacting next-of-kin has been a serious problem in cases of
  recent fire victims.  Opponents see this as a further incursion into privacy.
  [This paragraph starkly excerpted by PGN from "The Washington Post" FAIRFAX
  WEEKLY Section - May 21, 1992, `Next-of-Kin Plan Splits Vienna Residents', by
  By Whitney Redding - Washington Post Staff Writer.  See also "The
  Connection", a local freebie weekly - May 6, 1992, `Police data base has some
  Vienna residents irked', by Darcy Nair, and a letter in the same issue.  PGN]

The impression I get from this and other stuff that appeared was that a lot of
it arose because a larger budget (several thousand dollars?) was originally
requested to implement a "database"(? - and is it any coincidence the way this
term seems to be bandied around?). My impression was that a proposal without
the `computer' dimension (say, storing 3"-by-5" index cards in street address
order) might not have caused such debate.   Barry Johnson   WB15471@IBRDVax1

The lead article in today's Government Computer News (5/25/92, v.11, n.11),
entitled "NIST standing firm on digital signature," describes the efforts of
the National Institute of Standards and Technology to defend its harshly
criticized proposed standard, DSS.  It contains some particularly important
comments by the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jack Brooks, on
executive branch actions regarding use of secure technology by the American
public.

During the hearings, vendors and industry experts kept hammering at what they
described as critical flaws in the DSS proposal.  The Director of NIST, John
Lyons, testified before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Economic and
Commercial Law that DSS is being established strictly for federal agency
applications and should not impede the development of technology within the
private sector.  Under questioning, Lyons admitted that "Any standard
improperly formulated can slow down and stifle technology."

At an earlier hearing, Assistant Comptroller General Milton Socolar (from the
General Accounting Office) testified that DSS is weaker than a popular
commercial signature verification product developed by RSA Data Security, Inc.
of Redwood City, CA.  He questioned whether requiring federal civilian agencies
to use NIST's DSS, if it is less effective than commercial alternatives, would
serve a useful purpose.  He also said that the National Security Agency and the
FBI pressured NIST into proposing a weak standard to ensure that NSA and FBI
can crack it, and thereby forge digital signatures.

The chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Jack Brooks (D-Texas) agreed,
stating that FBI Director William Sessions had told the subcommittee that the
FBI is "against having security encryption devices that they could not break.
They did not want any system that they could not have a key to," Brooks said.
"They said it would give drug dealers, terrorists and buggers an advantage.
That's what they said publicly, and there's no use dissenting on it."

[It certainly does give those buggers an advantage.... -lh]

Brooks said Congress must be wary of White House efforts to grant intelligence
agencies a greater role in civilian security matters.

[The rest of us should be vigilant, too.]

In <A HREF="/Risks/13.52.html">RISKS-13.52</A>, "White House Fights to Erase E-Mail Backups", it is noted that
`In 1978, Congress made clear that the law applied to presidential records,
including "electronic or mechanical recordations".' Does the executive branch
use voice-mail? Will they have to re-program it so that old messages cannot be
deleted; they just fade away to the archives?  Think of all the telephone
pranks (a la Bart Simpson) which might result.  Spoofing of computer backups
may also become more likely as their volume grows; will we need digital
signatures (!) on the documents?

	Followers of the Risks conference aren't the only ones worried about
computer risks.  So's your friendly neighborhood insurance agent.  Several
insurers have launched programs to protect businesses against computer
mischief, namely computer viruses. And one, the Aetna Casualty and Surety
Company of Hartford, Connecticut, has gone much further.
	The major reason carriers aren't shying away from virus insurance is
they don't expect to get whacked with significant losses.  That certainly has
been the experience of two companies that offer virus protection, the St. Paul
Companies of St. Paul, Minnesota, and the Allstate Insurance Companies of
Northbrook, Illinois.  In 1991, St. Paul's losses were less than $15,000.
Allstate has had to pay off on its virus coverage but nothing in excess of
$5000.  A typical small business computer policy from Allstate, which would
automatically include virus insurance, would cover an exposure of $25,000 to
$50,000 and have an average premium of $250 to $750.
	An ambitious computer crime insurance program has been launched by
Aetna. Called ACCENT (Aetna Coverage for Computer and Electronic Network
Technology), the program, limited to financial institutions and service
bureaus, includes protection against phone fraud, computer viruses, software
piracy, and threats to set off "time-bomb" viruses, disclose security codes,
and other forms of extortion.

I probably shouldn't be writing this entry until I have time to cool down about
it, so FLAME-ON=&gt; ISPNews just published a tiny piece derived from an article I
wrote them on benevolent viruses, and left my name attached.  I think I will
sue for liable and slander.  If you get a chance to read this piece, please
realize that they mangled it to promote the protection business.  The main
point of the article (which was written before the Michelangelo scare but only
published this week) was that benevolent viruses are possible and that only the
computer security industry wants to claim they are not - and the reason is so
they can scare you into paying them.  The article had a counterpoint to each
point of an abusive article written in a previous issue, but of course the
counterpoints were all removed and replaced by a single sentence saying you
should support good viruses.  The claims that you could write safe viruses were
included, but the reasons why were removed.  The article it criticized was
given great placement, but the counterarticle was placed in a hard to find area
and given half the space of the original article it criticized.

If you get ISPNews, write to the editor and tell them that you know about the
hatchet job they did on my article.  Tell them that you no longer trust them to
tell you about integrity protection in computers, since they obviously don't
have any integrity and care more about money than truth (they will probably
agree with that one).  Cancel your subscription, and pull your advertising!
(just kidding)

The point of all this is not that they mangled my article - I am used to that -
but rather that there is a tremendous risk in an uncontrolled protection racket
that goes by the name of "computer security".  If I told you your house would
burn down unless you paid me $100/year, you would probably report me to the
police (and wonder why I charged so little).  If someone in the protection
rackets tells you your computer will crash and you will lose all your data
unless you pay them $100/year, how is that any different?  There's a finite
probability your house will burn down, and there's a similar probability you
will suffer damage at the hands (bytes) of a computer virus.  If you think the
person will burn down your house by lighting a fire, you should be aware that
some computer virus defenders have sent copies of viruses out to their
customers on demo disks (along with an order form for the cure).

I would like the FTC to look into truth in advertising in the computer security
industry, but I can't convince them that there is any false advertising, since
they seem to think that nobody could be fooled into thinking that Norton
antivirus would actually protect them from all future viruses (old ad), or that
central point caught ALL 150 viruses (that they knew about - I knew about a lot
more).

Oh well - so much for now.  FLAME-OFF...

C-17 Program Faces Problems in Manufacturing, Software
(Excerpted from Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, May 18, 1992, p. 31)

The C-17 [military aircraft] program encountered manufacturing problems in
flight control surfaces and criticism by the General Accounting Office of
software development last week.  [...]

Reviewing the status of C-17 embedded computer systems, GAO said the program is
"a good example of how not manage software development when procuring a major
weapon system."  The Air Force waived or ignored many Pentagon software
standards and guidelines, gave Douglas Aircraft Co. control over software
development, limited its own access to software information, and restricted its
ability to require correction of problems, even after critical problems were
evident, GAO said.

"In essence, the Air Force assumed that software was a low-risk part of the
C-17 program and did little to either manage its development of to oversee the
contractor's performance," GAO said. "Douglas (with the Air Force's
concurrence) to a number of shortcuts that have substantially increased the
risk of not successfully completing software development and testing and may
result in substantially higher software maintenance costs with the C-17 is
eventually fielded.

[The first C-17 in 9/91 had all safety software but only 34% of avionics
software.  The complete software is supposed to be provided with the second
aircraft in 6/92.  The GAO lays the blame on proliferation of languages in the
project.  The systems were supposed to have been written in Ada, but Douglas
had been working in JOVIAL.  Further,]

... Douglas had trouble finding subcontractors who would use JOVIAL, however,
and the Air Force "allowed the subcontractors to develop software in whatever
language they chose."  As a result there are six languages, four of them using
existing as well as newly developed code and one of them proprietary to General
Electric Co.  Many subsystems contain more than one language.  There are three
in the flight control computer, for example.

[The Air Force now plans to convert all this code to Ada, which may be
difficult because of inadequate documentation.]

====================================================================

C-17 - The Real Story

To All Teammates:              May 13, 1992

     The chorus of critics has been out in force lately.  Their target: our
C-17 program.  These critics continue to focus on outdated, unsubstantiated
allegations, and in some cases flat untruths about the C-17.  They also echo
the groundless charges that we were "bailed out" of financial difficulty by the
government.  I'm angry about this partial, slanted, misleading reporting, and
you should be too.  You deserve to hear the real story.

     Let's begin with the C-17 wings.  The critics have focused on the
Drivmatic machine, saying the rivets it installs do not fully expand all of the
time.  Here are the facts.  First, the C-17 wing is designed to last 60,000
hours, or twice as long as the required 30,000-hour life of the airframe.
Second, fully expanded rivets add to that 60,000 hours.  Those that do not
fully expand do not detract from wing life.  Beyond that, we have improved the
processes and the machines.  Our own internal investigations and those of
Department of Defense agencies and the FBI found no fraud or wrongdoing.  The
bottom line: There is no safety of flight issue.  There was no cover-up.  The
wings exceed contract requirements.

     A network television reporter claimed the Drivmatic machines caused fuel
leaks in the wing.  Here are the facts.  None of the leaks occurred around
fasteners installed by the Drivmatic machines.  We told the reporter that.  We
explained in detail to him where the leaks were found.  In addition, we
described the leak rate, which was less than one drop per minute; we told him
we found that out of position work had caused the problem; we told him we had
developed a new sealing process; and we told him we had taken the precaution of
doing a reinspection of all wing sealing in every aircraft on the production
line.  He chose not to report the facts.

     Some critics say we fired the employees who reported and investigated the
Drivmatic issue.  Here are the facts.  Both individuals were fully involved in
our investigation of the issue.  The individual who reported the issue was
given a pay raise for his role, but then just stopped showing up for work.
After a period of months, we fired him just as we would any other employee who
failed to show up for work for extended periods.  The second individual, an
internal investigator, had been identified as a part of a reduction in force
decision a month before the investigation started.  He was ultimately let go as
part of our overall reductions, and not for any reason related to the
investigation.

     Other critics say problems are showing up in the C-17 flaps.  Here are the
facts.  Early ground testing showed greater pressure on the flaps than had been
anticipated in design.  The flaps were redesigned and new flaps were made
available for the first production aircraft.  In actual flight, it turns out
the pressures were much less than the ground testing had predicted.  Result -
the present flap exceeds contract specs.  Flight testing also shows higher
temperatures than anticipated in one area of the flap.  We made a relatively
simple change to more temperature-resistant materials.  Those who attempt to
judge a program solely by problems found and fixed during tests seem to ignore
that one purpose of a test program is to do just that.  The fact is that these
incidents are a test program success, not a failure.

     Still others question our candor on the C-17.  Here are the facts.  We
keep our customers fully informed.  We are consistently on the record with the
facts concerning our problem areas as well as successes.  Most recently we
joined with the United States Air Force and the Grumman Corporation in
announcing an inspection program to detect possible flaws in composite
materials provided by Grumman.

     Some alarmists claim the taxpayers will pay billions in contract ceiling
overruns.  Here are the facts.  This is a fixed-price type contract for
development and initial production of C-17.  We believe the government is
responsible for at least some of the cost growth, and we are submitting claims
for those costs.  Once our claims are resolved, we pay any difference - not the
taxpayer.  As for those who project costs greater than $8 and even $9 billion,
with more than 90% of the work done, we believe our estimate of $7.39 billion
is correct.

     Finally the bailout allegation.  We didn't ask for a bailout, and we
didn't get one.  The facts are simple.  We do the work, we submit bills, and
then we get paid.

     And now to conclude the real story.  We are continuing to improve.  We are
building each new C-17 with far fewer labor hours than the previous aircraft.
We are reducing rework.  We are flying a rigorous test program - more than 200
hours so far - and passing with top grades.  And in the final analysis, we will
silence the chorus of critics with our successes.

                        John F. McDonnell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

                      Report Questions SDI Estimates
   WASHINGTON (AP)
   Deploying an antimissile defense system will cost $37 billion over five
years, about $10 billion more than the Bush administration estimates, a
congressional report said Wednesday.
   The Congressional Budget Office said costs for the Strategic Defense
Initiative from fiscal 1994 to fiscal 1997 would be about $8 billion a year.
President Bush has requested $5.4 billion for the system in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1.
   SDI Director Henry Cooper has said building a system of defenses would cost
$25 billion. The government has already spent about $29 billion on the program
commonly known as Star Wars.
   The CBO based its report on administration figures for research, development
and procurement of a single-site defense at Grand Forks, N.D., by late 1997.
   The program would include either ground-based or space-based sensors to
detect incoming missiles, interceptors and a controlling command system.
   Last year, leading defense Democrats such as Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Rep.
Les Aspin, D-Wis., joined congressional Republicans in backing the Missile
Defense Act, which set a new goal for the program.
   The law directs the administration to deploy an SDI system by 1996 or when
the technology allows that would comply with the U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty of 1972.
   The CBO calculated the cost of alternatives to the administration's SDI
plan, including a system favored by Nunn, Aspin and several Republicans. That
system would cost $31 billion with an average annual budget of $7 billion.
   The system would be deployed at a single site by 1997 and would include an
additional system of sensors known as the ground-based surveillance and
tracking system.  It also would spend less money on space-based interceptors
such as Brilliant Pebbles.
   The House Armed Services Committee, in its version of the fiscal 1993
military budget, approved $4.3 billion for SDI, cutting about $1 billion from
Bush's request. The panel eliminated all funds for space-based interceptors.
   The CBO report acknowledges that its estimates "do not attempt to account
for cost increases that might occur during development of a technically
challenging project such as missile defense."
   In August 1988, the CBO examined the cost growth of more proven weapons such
as missiles, helicopters, tanks and fighter planes. It found that concurrent
work on each program resulted in a cost growth of 193 percent to 288 percent.
   Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., one of four House members to request the
report, said the CBO cost estimates combined with recent comments from Cooper
that deploying an SDI system by 1997 is a major challenge, creates a "recipe
for cost overruns and operational effectiveness problems.  With real defense
assets being scrapped for budgetary reasons, it is hard to justify big
expenditures for a questionable concept like SDI," Bennett said.
   Aspin, Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., and Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., also asked
for the SDI report.

An AP item in the San Francisco Chronicle on 26 May 1992, p.A3 noted that at
least $7.7 billion (out of a total investment of $29B) in Star Wars projects
"never got off the ground", being "cast aside as unneeded, unworkable, or
unaffordable".  These included the following:

 * A surveillance satellite to detect and track hostile missiles.  $1B.  Dead.

 * A ground-based laser to zap missiles in flight by bouncing laser beams off
   relay and "fighting" mirrors stationed in space.  At least $1.2B.
   Mothballed.

 * A Nuclear bomb-powered X-ray laser and other "nuclear-directed energy"
   weapons in space.  At least $1.8B.  Dead.

 * A pop-up "probe" to help interceptors distinguish warheads from decoys.
   At least $.5B.  To be mothballed in 1993, but until last year deemed 
   `essential'.

 * A guided rocket to intercept hostile missiles inside or outside the
   atmosphere.  $623M.  Mothballed.

Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) has set up a list
server to (1) archive CPSR-related materials and make them available on
request, and (2) disseminate relatively official, short, CPSR-related
announcements (e.g., press releases, conference announcements, and project
updates).  It is accessible via Internet and Bitnet e-mail.  Mail traffic
will be light; the list is set up so that only the CPSR Board and staff
can post to it.  Because it is self-subscribing, it easily makes material
available to a wide audience. 

We encourage you to subscribe to the list server and publicize it widely.

To subscribe, send mail to:

	listserv@gwuvm.gwu.edu (Internet) OR
	listserv@gwuvm (Bitnet)

Your message needs to contain only one line:

	subscribe cpsr &lt;your first name&gt; &lt;your last name&gt;

You will get a message that confirms your subscription.  The message also
explains how to use the list server to request archived materials (including
an index of everything in CPSR's archive), and how to request more information
about the list server. 

Please send any CPSR queries to cpsr@csli.stanford.edu.

If you have a problem with the list server, please contact the administrator,
Paul Hyland (phyland@gwuvm.gwu.edu or phyland@gwuvm). 

We hope you enjoy this new service.

"Space Junk May Threaten NASA (Space) Station"

A NY Times item seen in the San Francisco Chronicle (2 Jun 1992, p.A7) quotes
the current issue of Space News, which reports that NASA experts have adopted
new calculations on collisions between space junk and the space station, which
suggest that the risks are much greater than previously thought.  They estimate
that there may be 30,000 pieces of debris, mostly from old spacecraft that have
broken up.  Adding protective shielding might significantly raise the cost,
already estimated at $30B to $40B.

The following appeared in `The Guardian', on 2 Jun 1992:

  Fiat, makers of the Tipo in which two-year-old Lucinda Richardson died
  when an automatic window shut, said last night that one of the front
  doors has to be open and the switch continuously depressed to close a
  front window when the ignition key was removed.
 
  Lucinda's father, Douglas, said she must have stepped on the switch
  while playing in the car.

  A statement issued by Fiat's UK headquarters at Slough, Berkshire,
  said: "The system ... meets German standards, to which all
  manufacturers conform."  [..]

  Labour called on the Government to issue immediate regulations to
  compel car maufacturers to fit vehicles with safety devices which
  automatically cut out motors on electric windows as soon as pressure
  is applied.  The Royal Society for the Prevetion of Accidents urged
  manufacturers to examine the design of electric window design.

I don't believe that this particular window system is computer controlled ...,
but I do know that several of the quality cars on the market have many of their
body functions, including windows, under control of a central processor.

   [Roland called our attention to an item in The Wall Street Journal,
   1-Jun-92, p. B6B, which I have abstracted as follows.  PGN]

Computer Glitch - 500,000 Pepsi bottlecaps turn into "winners"

PepsiCo's Philippine bottling franchise has had a promotion with numbers
printed in the bottle cap.  A winning number was supposed to pay off up to
$38,000.  A "computer glitch" was blamed for "349" being announced as the
winning number, even though that number appeared on 500,000 bottle caps.
Several thousand people accepted PepsiCo's offer of $19 to each "winner", but
about 4,000 people are seeking governmental action for fraud.

     [This might lead to a new tack in creative advertising -- planning ahead 
     of time to have an effort backfire so as not to have to pay off, with 
     the a priori intent of blaming it "on the computer".  PGN]

Is anyone with a given name and date of birth who lives in the same county
necessarily the same person?  That is what the Santa Clara County (California)
voter registration computer believes, as reported in today's San Jose Mercury
News.

John P. Taylor, a San Jose patent lawyer, has voted in every election since
1979, but he didn't receive his voting materials in the mail this year even
though his wife, two sons, and daughter did.  On checking with the regristrar
of voters he discovered that another John P. Taylor, who happened to have the
same date of birth, had recently registered in nearby Sunnyvale -- both were
born on Christmas 56 years ago.  The computer "knew" that a person with the
same name and date of birth was the same person and so treated the transaction
as a change of address.  The computer records showed different places of birth,
but it apparently wasn't programmed to check that.

While county authorities scratched their heads over this improbable event and
what to do about it, the disenfranchised John P. Taylor telephoned the other
one and worked out a quick fix.  It seems that their middle names are Paul and
Phillip, so they agreed to re-register with their full names.

What do you think are the chances that this programming blunder will be fixed
before it claims its next victim?  In the meantime, voters with common last
names might consider registering their full names in order to reduce the
chances of being victimized by this kind of programming foolishness.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Claudia Braun is only 9 months old, but already her credit
rating is shot.	Indiana University Medical Center computers show that the
youthful Miss Braud has run up bills of more than $3,000 for medical services -
including pregnancy tests and dental care.  Since late last year, the baby and
her parents, Jean and Thomas Braun, have received about 15 bills, all for
services rendered to people they don't know. Each bill listed Claudia as the
person responsible for ensuring it got paid.
	"I'd love to see them take me to court and carry her into court and
say, `Hi, this is Miss Claudia Braun,"' Thomas Braun said. "Its hilarious when
you think about it.  But it's getting to be an old joke," added Mrs. Braun, a
registered nurse at Wishard Memorial Hospital.
	Robert D. Wehling, associate director of fiscal affairs at the medical
center, said the problem began when Claudia entered the world without a Social
Security number.
	The university's computer program, which had just been installed,
registered Claudia as 000-00-0000. Later, when other patients who didn't know
their Social Security numbers were entered, they got 00-000-0000, too.  The
computer decided that all the patients with the zeros must be related, and put
Claudia in charge of paying the bills. At last count, there were 37 patients
linked to Claudia's account.
	Medical center officials thought they had the Braun problem fixed in
February and sent the family a letter of apology. But the computer then spit
out seven more bills.	New computer software was installed Tuesday that
Wehling said should eliminate the problem.  "We're sorry it happened," Wehling
said. "This should not happen again."

&gt;From the "Federal Employees News Digest," 18 May 1992:

	An employee who forgot to type a two-character code in accessing
	a computer at work that then gave him unauthorized access to a
	check generating program should not have been disciplined for
	the mistake, the Merit Systems Protection Board has said.

	The problem began when an Army depot switched certain information
	from a mainframe computer to mini-computers.  When the employee
	tried to access his normal work-related files, he ran into problems
	and inadverently created a file listing banks and companies that were
	to get checks over one million dollars...The checks never were
	actually generated, however.

It goes on to report that the Army demoted the employee and that MSPB ordered
him reinstated because the mistake was a "simple one" and because the employee
had nothing to lose.

The RISK: Often, we've discussed the risks of not using proper passwords to
prevent unauthorized access.  This is the first time that I've seen a user
required to supply a password in order that he NOT be granted access to files.
This is quite a perverse risk!

Most of you have read about last week's kidnapping of Charles Geschke, head of
Adobe Systems, Inc., in Mountain View CA, and his successful rescue by the FBI
after four days of captivity.  We wish to express our appreciation for the way
in which the rescue was carried out, and to send our best wishes to the
Geschkes for some sort of return to a normal life.

In general, security (whether with respect to individuals, corporations,
computers, or communications) is very difficult to ensure.  In many cases the
threats are not even perceived -- let alone defended against -- until they have
flagrantly manifested themselves.  Increased awareness of the incredible gamut
of problems is vital.  But the problems are inherently never completely
solvable -- there are no guaranteed solutions.  This is by itself a very
important realization.

Technological solutions to security problems (in general) must be accepted as
just one of many approaches.  In the Geschke case, apparently the FBI planted
transmitters in the package of ransom money.  The kidnapper who picked up the
money had a transmitter sniffer that detected some but not all of the planted
transmitters.  Even there the technology seems to escalate the use of
countermeasures and countercountermeasures, as well as escalating the risks.

    The spacewalk was [...] delayed for 1 1/2 hours because
    Endeavour's on-board computer made a mistake in plotting the
    route needed to rendezvous with the satellite.

It is of course completely false.  Endeavor's on-board computer might have
gotten the wrong result because its programmers made a mistake, or perhaps the
data entry folks made a mistake, or perhaps because its fabricators made a
mistake, or even because its designers made a mistake.

The difference is not pedantry; it goes directly to the issue of what the risk
is in computers.  Saying the computer made a mistake encourages people to think
that the machine errs like people, due to wandering attention, fatigue, etc.

One result of that in turn is less attention to the real culprit: programming,
data entry, or fabrication, or design, or whatever else some human did wrong.
A second result is the ability to shut off constructive demands for
improvement by making it far too easy to offer the standard excuse: "It's just
those goofy computers again &lt;shrug&gt;; there's not much we can do about them."

There's not much immediate personal impact from this particular application of
course, but the identical issue arises all the time in response to ATMs,
insurance claims, etc., etc., ad nauseum.

We've discussed this subject before on risks, but I don't believe that there is
such a thing as a "benevolent virus".  If I am a user, I don't want some new
piece of software, which I normally don't run, to be automagically executed on
my machine without my being informed about it, and given an option to veto it.

It all boils down to what your definition of "virus".  My definition of "virus"
is a piece of software which transmits itself from machine to machine without
the knowledge or permission of either a user on the system or the system
administrator of the machine.  Using this definition, I do not believe there
can be such a thing as a "benevolent virus", because I, as a system
administrator or a user, want control over what I run on my machine.  Perhaps I
am running some special software that I know will break if my operating system
gets upgraded --- I don't want a "OS Updating Virus" to go in and change my
system without my permission.  That's just wrong.

If you have some other, more broader definition of "virus", which includes the
ability for the user or system administrator to veto or delay it --- I suggest
you not use the term "virus".  For one thing, the battle is lost.  People think
of viruses as bad (and I suspect most of them have a similar definition of
virus as I presented).  It's like the use of the word "hacker" --- at this
point, it's practically hopeless to try to convince people that there is such a
thing as a "good hacker"; the language has evolved to the point where the only
definition of a "hacker" is a "system cracker"; the original definition of
"super-competent programmer" has be long lost.

Several people (for example, Martin Hofmann &lt;hofmann@sap-ag.de&gt;) asked me why
that piece appeared in RISKS.  My answer was something like this:

  RISKS is by definition concerned with computers and related technology.
  The stage system is computer controlled, but the point is that even the
  most modern computerized installation can be brought to a halt by something
  seemingly unrelated to the computer!  Usually it is people.  This time it is
  a choice of hydraulic fluid and the decision to use the old pipes.

Incidentally, Nigel Hall &lt;N.F.Hall@newcastle.ac.uk&gt; commented that "proper
biodegrading hydraulic fluid, which looks like yellow slime, removes anything
non-metalic in its path (especially automotive paintwork)" ...

.&gt; Over the last several years, I have applied for positions in over 100

.&gt; National Research Council that calls for increased university research in the
.&gt; field.
.&gt;
.&gt; You cannot find a single US university (and only a few outside the US) with
.&gt; more than 2 computer security experts on the same faculty.  You also cannot
.&gt; find a university in the US where more than one person was hired with the prior
.&gt; knowledge that they have computer security interest (again I am talking about
.&gt; faculty positions).  With the educators woefully ignorant, we can only expect
.&gt; the students to be equally ignorant.

We then conducted the following dialog; fc suggested that I submit it to Risks.

BRINT:
	I'm interested in your comments about the paucity of university
faculty who are knowledgable in computer security.  The issue is an old
one, but I've never fully come to grips with it.

	Teaching a 3-rd year course in operating systems... I introduce
concepts of "protection" in various units of the course, especially
those involving memory sharing and file system design.  Also, to
facilitate handling of programming projects, I try to be sure that the
students understand the unix file permissions mechanism.

	However, I've not worked out for myself just how far I should go
beyond this.  Some of these students will be system administrators or
systems programmers. Others will be managers responsible for policies
regarding computer installation and "security."  Some others, however,
may be irresponsible types, looking for a laugh or a way to screw their
fellow human.  So, do I teach them about the historical security holes
in Unix systems?  Do I tell them that if they have privileges on their
workstation, many of these privileges can be applied on the fileserver
if they have an account there?  Do I explain how the famous RTM Internet
Worm exploited bugs?  Do I cover how one can capture keystrokes in the
X-windows environment?

	In short, do I do more harm than good or vice versa?  I've heard
most of the standard arguments and tend to feel that what is known
should be passed on, but I'm interested to hear your views.

fc &lt;FBCohen@dockmaster.ncsc.mil&gt;:

First, I think that your point should be placed on Risks so that all of
the others on that list can understand your concerns.  More importantly,
this issue is fundamental to many peoples' view of protection issues.

I will briefly explain my feelings on this matterhere, but for a much
more thorough coverage, you should probably give me a call - [I've
deleted his number; he didn't specifically say that I might post it.]

          The basic issue is what we should teach about protection to
students in light of the fact some might use if for evil.  I think that
there is a lot of information on how to attack systems available to
anyone who wants it, but there is too little information on defenses for
those who wish to protect themselves.  In light of this imbalance, it is
clear what to do, if you believe it.

          When I teach people about protection, I don't necessarily
discuss all of the attacks in order to point out defenses.  A
fundamental thing that most people don't understand is that protection
is not an excersize in attack and defense, but rather an excersize in
design for integrity, privacy, availabilit, and accountability.  You
could present it in this positive light without talking about attacks at
all.  In fault tolerant computing we discuss failures, often leaving out
the mechanism by which the fault occurs.  We still want continued
operation, and can describe it in terms of proobabilities of events
regardless of causes.

          In terms of teaching about how to break into systems, I think
it is important to every user to understand how people guess passwords,
if only to help them understand how to choose their own passwords.  I
think that they should understand the concept of a Trojan horse, and
that when they run another user's program, they can have all of their
protection bits changed (etc.).  If you don't know this, you might (and
most do) assume that setting a protection bit in Unix makes you safe.
So we teach people a lot of assumptions about protection (if only by
telling them that setting a bit prevents something from happenning), and
these assumptions are almost always wrong, and as a result, they are
vulnerable.  Perhaps you could simply be very careful about the
assumptions you leave your students with.  (e.g.  ANY program can set
the protection bits of any files owned by the user running it - for
example, the "chmod program" provides a handy user interface to this,
while other programs set protection bits without the user getting
involved.)  Some bright student will likely ask whether this means that
their protection bits can be set whenever they run another user's
program, and you should answer "yes!" (note the emphasis).  Take that
chance to also point out that this is why you don't run their programs
from your account - after all, we wouldn't want their grades
accidentally protected so that other could read (or modify) them.  (you
do take this precaution - yes?).

          Having taught protection for many years in universities, I
have faced these moral issues on many occasions.  I can say that the
delicacy of modern systems is a surprise to my students, and they walk
away a bit more careful than when they entered, which I think is a good
thing.

          When you teach about operating systems, do you point out that
the internal OS tables are generally not allocated the "worst case"
amount of space they may require?  You know that in practice, designing
systems in this way is commonplace because the total resources is not
sufficient to handle worst case, but we don't want to artificialy limit
things.  This is a common cause of protection problems - leaving
temporary files around because of the process failures that result,
overrunning available memory and overwriting some OS code, not being
able to handle a critical interrupt, etc.  Most of the programmers I
know don't check every possible return code on each OS call and act
appropriately by undoing everything they should when the failure takes
place, and no current language I am aware of provides the means to
handle these issues appropriately.  None of these things require that
you discuss attacks, but rather are simple realities your students
should understand when writing their code, along with the knowledge that
most programmers don't properly deal with these things.

          Well, my list goes on for books worth - perhaps you should get
some of them for your own interest.  Call me for details.  FC

COMPUTER BLAMED FOR SEA COLLISION (The Independent, 5 Jun 1992)

A Trainee submarine commander yesterday blamed a computer error for an accident
which sank a trawler and killed four Scottish fishermen.  Lieutenant Commander
Peter McDonnell told a court martial at HMS Drake in Plymouth that he trusted
HMS Trenchant's computer system when it told him he was at least three miles
away from a possible collision with the Scottish trawler Antares.  He said his
generation of submariners preferred to rely on the computer rather than a
manual plotting system which a senior submarine captain earlier told the
hearing was a more trustworthy method in busy waters.

Four men died in November 1990 when the Antares was dragged to the bottom of
the Firth of Clyde by HMS Trenchant.  Lt Cdr McDonnell, 33, from Glossop,
Derbyshire, had just completed the last exercise of a six-month command course
known as the Perisher when the accident occurred at 2.18am.  He denies six
charges of negligence.  Yesterday he told the hearing that he had not even
known that Trenchant had passed close to the Antares and another fishing boat
five minutes before he ordered the submarine to turn around and head back
towards them.

The hearing continues today.

SORRY, BUDDY - IT SAYS RIGHT HERE THAT YOU'RE DEAD
(Indianapolis Star, June 3, 1992)

And you think you've had trouble dealing with apathetic bureaucrats?

Meet Eugene Smith of Doylestown, PA.  The healthy 33-year-old has spent the
past 2.5 years convincing authorities he's not dead.  The frustrating error
cost him his driver's license and his job.  He still can't get a license, and
he's still fighting nine traffic violations that he says aren't his.  Smith
traces the trouble to the theft of his wallet in 1988.  He believes the thief
used his driver's license, racked up violations that led to the license
suspension, then died in a traffic accident.

In February 1990, a police officer stopped Smith and told him his car regis-
tration was expired and that state computer records showed he was dead.  "He
said I was dead, and because of that I was not allowed to drive," said Smith.
"I agreed that it would be [a] hazard for a dead person to be driving."

Life isn't easy for an officially dead man.  Without a license, Smith lost his
job as a driver for a warehouse.  Without that job, he had to find a cheaper
place to live and take a job nearby, at a deli.  Being an officially dead
taxpayer, no one in the state capital took him seriously.  "I would call and I
could hear them say, `Oh, this is that guy again,' and I could hear them laugh
and they would say nobody there could help me," Smith said.

Finally, Susan Rakus, an aide to Democratic U.S. Rep. Peter Kostmayer, took his
case and persuaded the state motor vehicle agency to resurrect Smith [isn't
this against separation of church and state?].  But Smith still can't get a
license -- he's still accused of a string of years-old traffic violations.

"Obviously we dropped the ball on this," Rick Schoen, state transportation
department spokesman, said Tuesday.

</i><PRE>

There has been a discussion going on in the Telecom forum about *67 which
TOGGLES(!!!!!) the caller-id blocking state of a phone line -- at least in
those areas with caller-id blocking.  The rationale for requiring caller-id
blocking in some states is that there are situations where disclosing one's
location might be life-threatening as in the case of a shelter for battered
women or maybe a protected witness.  Of course, there are also normal privacy
considerations.

If one always was sure of the default state of the line one was using a toggle
might work.  But there is no way to determine the state beyond faith that the
telco's computer is exactly synchronized with one's expectations and that one
has is using the assumed CO lines on multi-line systems.  If one is a visitor,
all bets are off. As from plain errors made in the business office or at the
CO, one reader pointed out that one some switches reloading the software loses
the settings.  Another reader pointed out that *67 isn't an accident but the
specified behavior.

The stupidity (the word risk doesn't do justice to the situation) is obvious.
I'm more puzzled about how it came about. I generally lean towards incompetence
as an explanation rather than conspiracy but since some of the rationale for
requiring caller-id comes from public safety considerations, I'm surprised that
no one has challenged this approach as failing to satisfy this requirement and,
by providing the illusion of caller-id blocking, might increase the risk.

While on this subject, there is also the issue of access control over
information passed via signalling protocols.  Telcos are assumed to have full
access and subscribers none.  But some organizations can act as their own
telcos.  The MIT ISDN switch comes to mind.  Which side of the protection
barrier are they on?  ANI is similar to caller-id but is nonblocked and
delivered when calling an 800 #.  This means that if I give out my personal
800#, I will eventually (on the next bill) get their #.

In today's Wall Street Journal, there was a feature piece on a slot machine
tournament in Atlantic City.  The problem was that the machines were returning
a 70.6% payoff rather than the 96.4% planned.  "After the tournament ended and
the prizes were awarded, the manufacturer called back to report that the two
kinds of chips it shipped were incompatible with each other".  Aside from all
the issues of how this might have happened, the real danger is soft failure
that are hard to detect.  The only reason someone even looked for a problem was
the unique circumstances of a tournament which provided an environment to
notice the statistical anomalies Apparently there is no constant checking to
see that the statistical results match the predicted results.

The *67 (above) and this story both illustrate a risk of not understanding the
philosophical (as well as engineering) concept of closed-loop systems, i.e.,
those with feedback so that one can determine the result of an action.  This is
a lesson that should feedback to nontechnology systems also.

        [Chuck Weinstock &lt;weinstoc@SEI.CMU.EDU&gt; also noted the slot machine 
        saga, as did Roland Ouellette, who added the note that follows.  PGN

This makes me wonder if anyone actually tests these machines: people at the
factory or regulators at the casinos.  Also would this sort of error be noticed
only with an event like this and ordinarily go undetected?

I've had up on my door an article from the 4/14/92 Weekly World News an
American tabloid) with a headline: "Girl, 13, kidnaped by her computer!"  Here
is an excerpt:

	A desperate plea for help on a computer screen and a
	girl vanishing into thin air has everyone baffled ---
	and a high-tech computer game is the prime suspect.

	Game creator and computer expert Christian Lambert
	believes a glitch in his game Mindbender might have
	caused a computer to swallow 13-year-old Patrice
	Toussaint into her computer.

	"Mindbender is only supposed to have eight levels,"
	Lambert said.  "But this one version somehow has an
	extra level.  A level that is not supposed to be there!
	The only thing I can figure out now is that she's
	playing the ninth level --- inside the machine!"....

	Lambert speculates that if she is in the computer, the
	only way out for her is if she wins the game.  But
	it's difficult to know for sure how long it will take,
	Lambert said.

	"As long as her parents don't turn off the machine
	Patrice will be safe," he said.  "The rest is up to her."

Why am I posting this to comp.risks?  Do I really think there is a risk of
people being kidnaped by computers?  No (although at times, when I work on my
thesis, I wonder.)  The risk is the misinformation people receive about
computers.  I don't worry too much about the WWN, but I was concerned about an
educational show I watched last night, Mathnet, based on a segment of the PBS
educational television show, Square One.  Mathnet is a spoof of the detective
show Dragnet, and the detectives use math to solve crimes.  So far, so good,
but on last night's episode, the crime they solved was the kidnaping of a
baseball player whose disappearance had been unnoticed because he had been
replaced by an android which had been able to talk and play baseball.  An
educational show would not show space aliens or magic, so the implication of
including human-like robots is that they are technically feasible.

Similarly, when I recently visited Epcot, an amusement park that is supposed to
be educational, the computer exhibit featured an electronic character that was
able to understand and even physically transport its human companion.

I expect (and enjoy) such unrealism in tabloids and in science fiction, but it
should not appear in educational settings.  I suspect that a large percentage
of people, if asked, would say that a robot could currently be built that could
pass as human, based on all the misinformation they receive.

Isn't it just like our technocratic society to react to such an accident,
caused by a completely unnecessary luxury becoming too complex, by making it
even more complex? Wouldn't the simpler solution be to ban automatic windows or
even power windows instead of requiring another safety interlock?  Nobody needs
such things but, unfortunately, there are car models in which you can't get an
ABS (good thing) without buying power windows (artificially induced desire).  I
told my dealer that I was willing to pay extra for manual windows, but could
not get them.

Viruses are a dime a dozen nowadays, but I thought this one was of particular
interest (though I do have to wonder if the issue of "Computing" magazine was
from April 1st...).

&gt;From Communications of the ACM, June 1992 (vol.35, no.6), page 10:

Barry's Bug...

Viruses, as we all know, can play strange and frightening games with
computer-based data.  Now, "Computing" magazine has reported a new strain that
plays some strange, and yes, frightening music.  It's called the Barry Manilow
Virus - a phantom bug that's infiltrating a growing number of computer systems,
scaring users with such tunes as "Mandy" and "Copacabana."  The virus is a
collection from the singer's "Greatest Hits" album.  Once detonated, the virus
spins out a continuous stream of Manilow's million sellers.  Experts are
working feverishly on an antidote for this plague.

My family is enrolled in AT&amp;T's World Reach-out plan.  This plan provides
discounted calls to many countries throughout the world during designated
times, including what used to be West Germany.  However there are no discounts
to what used to be East Germany (GDR).  At our house, we call Germany (the
western part) a lot.

Yesterday we received our May phone bill from Ohio Bell.  I noticed that after
around May 5 our calls to Germany did not have the Reach-out discount.  Also,
the designation of the location called was changed from "Ger Fed Rep" to
"Germany".

I called AT&amp;T, and a rate adjuster told me that the problem was with Ohio
Bell's billing software.  It seems that their software was keying off the "Ger
Fed Rep" to apply the Reach-out discount, not the country code (49).  Thus, in
May, when AT&amp;T decided to change the designation "Ger Fed Rep" to "Germany",
the software broke.

AT&amp;T credited me the difference, which was $21.00.  I wonder how many other
phone companies will have the same problem and how many other people will be
affected.

With the increasing amount of casual communication these computer networks
(like usenet) are encouraging, this namespace collision situation is
likely to increase.  I recently experienced this.

A few months ago, I posted an article to comp.realtime which quoted the US GAO
report on the Patriot missile failure.  Somebody read it there, and reposted it
to the widely-read comp.risks forum.  Shortly thereafter, I received an e-mail
message from another person named Fred Roeber.  He works for Raytheon, the
makers of the Patriot system!  His father, also named Fred Roeber, also works
for Raytheon.  He saw my article, and immediately fired off letters to his
superiors, alerting them that the posting was *not* inside information from
either one of them, but public information from someone with the same name.

Luckily, it seems that no harm has come from this.  In fact, two branches of a
family that hadn't known about each other can now fill in some gaps in the
family tree.  But if one of his superiors had seen the article first, and acted
prematurely; or if the GAO or I had made a mistake that Raytheon might have
considered slanderous, the results could have been much worse for him.

The RISK seems to me to be that if we do not realize just how large this
increasingly popular global community is, we may mis-estimate the probability
of such a collision, and make mistaken assumptions about identity.

A little over a year ago, I was hounded by a collection agency for debts owed
by Richard Simkin, a car dealer in northern Illinois.  It took about a month
(and a letter to the Better Business Bureau) to convince the agency that I
wasn't their man.

Late last fall, I applied for and received a Discover Card.  About 4 months
later, Discover Merchant Services decided that my name matched that of Richard
Simkin of Roselle Motors and tried to collect his debts from me.

The pattern was to leave a phone message, or send a letter, telling me to call
Ranee.  Phone messages (especially the first time, when all this was news to
me) never said why I should call.  When I would call, Ranee was never in the
office, so I'd end up talking to someone else.  I'd explain that I wasn't a car
dealer, and that they'd mixed me up with somebody else.  They'd promise to take
care of the problem; once a supervisor told me that I shouldn't have gotten a
letter at all--he couldn't even figure out how it got to me, since my address
wasn't on the record of the delinquent merchant--and I should ignore it.

I've cancelled my account now, hoping that if there's no customer record, they
won't match it to their merchant record.  I'm told that Discover policy
requires more than a matching name to claim that two records represent the same
person; and that by that policy, my record does not match that of the car
dealer's.

Computer Risks:
  - Computer programs don't always reflect company policy.
  - Flexible tools (such as a database query language and mail merge)
    provide an easy means to act on wrong assumptions, and don't
    always leave audit trails the way tailored applications can.

&gt;It all boils down to what your definition of "virus". My definition of "virus"
&gt;is a piece of software which transmits itself from machine to machine without
&gt;the knowledge or permission of either a user on the system or the system
&gt;administrator of the machine.

While I agree with the first part, I must disagree with the second.  A virus
is nothing more than a propagating program. "Knowledge or permission" has 
nothing to do with the purpose of a virus. The only factor that is necessary
is some sort of rules base to maximise the probability of viable propagation.

Personally, I deplore the common use of viruses primarily because it is
inherently destructive whether or not the programmer was intentionally
malicious. The current crop of PC viruses (what most people know as viruses is
a function of personal computers - single tasking unprotected architectures) is
obviously only a subset of Dr. Cohen's envelope.

The incredible diversity of what the world considers a "PC" is what makes even
the most innocuous virus destructive in some cases. Take STONED for example. It
has only two functions: 1) To propagate 2) To occasionally display a message.
The fact that it (and its close variants) are statistically the most common
virus in the world today indicates that it is very good at (1).

However, in some cases, probably not understood by its creator, STONED is
destructive. Hard disks created without any hidden sectors (early FDISK),
floppy disks with nearly full root directories, and UNIX systems may become
unusable.

This type of problem also occurs with professional software and any reader can
name major products that would not run on a particular machine. (Years ago the
true test of a "100% compatible" PC was whether or not it could run "Flight
Simulator" properly. The interesting thing about FS was that the early versions
ran without any operating system, you just booted the PC with the FS disk in
"A:").

The point that I am trying to make is that very few people really understand PC
architectures at the BIOS/Microcode level and this is necessary to be able to
write "safe" low-level code. Most viruses are not intentionally destructive,
however their mistakes often have the same effect. Consequently, while I can
conceive of a "benevolent" virus, I would not necessarily trust one on my
systems.

Having said that, consider the following case: a LAN server that as part of the
logon script checks the client for the presence of resident security software,
verifies its integrity, and automatically updates the software on the client if
missing or an older version. This would meet the test of software that is
self-propagating and rules based. Even if user intervention is required to
continue, given the alternative of being denied access to the LAN, few will
refuse. Is this a "benevolent" virus ? (can give commercial examples).

In <A HREF="/Risks/13.50.html">RISKS-13.50</A>, I reported an article concerning software errors in auto-pilots
of Boeings flown by British Airways, which appeared on the front page of the
``Sunday Telegraph'', May 17.  My reason was to bring attention to the
article's content, which was that there were ``10 serious incidents involving
computer errors in January'' with BA.

I then made a number of comments, principally that this appeared to be a high
incidence rate; that the errors occurred in auto-pilots which I assumed to be
relatively simple systems (as compared to fly-by-wire) in which there is much
experience of design; that a comment made by a British Airways spokesman that
the software was CAA approved and tested for 100 hours before entering service
hardly reassuring.

Imagine my surprise when I received a phone call a week later from an
exasperated Dan Hawkes of the CAA.  I am reporting this more than a week after
the fact, largely from memory.  His main complaint was that the article had
been quoted without question, and that so often (as we know from newspaper
reporting of our own fields) these articles are of dubious reliability and
sensational.  He made a further comment that he felt that academic input to the
issue of software reliability in aircraft was largely negative.

He reported to me that the software problems in the auto-pilots arose as a
result of a modification to software; the cause had been rapidly located and
fixed.  Recovering from the initial shock of his call, I attempted to don a
journalistic hat and ask a number of questions.

I suggested that the MTBF of 10^-9 for software is unverifiable.  This he was
happy to agree with, but stated that auditing and monitoring of all stages of
the software design and development gave a high level of confidence in its
performance.  Overall design meant that no single possible on-board failure (be
it software of mechanical) could result in loss of aircraft integrity.  He
stated that as all of these involved auto-pilots, there was never any danger to
the aircraft as pilots are always there to take remedial action when necessary.
In effect, that these were not serious errors at all.  I think Nancy Leveson
(a name he was familiar with - ``an academic'') has pointed out the dangers of
making highly trained pilots into computer monitors.

I then raised the point that this certainly cannot apply to fly-by-wire
software, as in this situation pilots are not monitors but dependent users.
His answer was that the auditing and monitoring is more rigorous in the design
and development of fly-by-wire, and that (to paraphrase) ``there have not been
any failures yet''.  Again his message was re-assurance; there is no serious
risk.  I could not get a real answer as to where the 10^-9 figure came from.

I then decided to attempt to get in contact with the authors of the original
article, Robert Matthews and Christopher Elliot.  Robert Matthews (Science
Correspondent) told me that the basis of the article had come from Flywise (as
pointed out by Martyn Thomas, <A HREF="/Risks/13.51.html">RISKS-13.51</A>), and had been checked out with BALPA
(union), BA and CAA (who were ``not all that helpful'') before publication.  He
stood by the article, and added that the airline companies and authorities were
a closed world, and getting any information from them near impossible.  Sounds
familiar?  He had not received any satisfactory explanation of the software
reliability figure of 10^-9.

I swapped sources; a few issues of RISKS for a few tidbits from him.  The issue
of Flywise states that the software incidents were due to ``software design
defect[s]''.  An interesting titbit was a paper from Boeing on structural
airworthiness.  According to their figures, in terms of hull loss rates per
departures, to 1988 the A320 was worse than any other commercial jet since the
Comet.  Though none due to software; that hasn't happened yet.

Well, I'm pretty close to the source, so I thought I'd write about it.

Some time ago, the Liberal party of the province decided they'd use a high-tech
voting system, fairly simple in structure.  They would contract with the local
telco, Martime Tel and Tel, to use a phone/computerized phone system so that
people could vote from the main leadership convention here in Halifax or from
regional rallies (where they had banks of phones installed) or from home using
their touchtone phones.

The method:
 1) Each candidate got a 1-900- number.
 2) Each card-carrying Liberal would get a PIN and instructions.
 3) Come convention day, each Liberal could dial the number for the candidate
    of his or her choice, the candidate's recorded voice would state for whom
    that vote was about to be cast, and request the Liberal to enter the PIN.
 4) After entering it, the candidate would thank the Liberal for his or her 
    vote, and hang up.  

Voting was supposed to begin at 12:30, and take 90 minutes for the first
round.  If necessary, several voting rounds could be cast during the day.

Everything went wrong.

A chronology:
12:30	Voting begins.  However, voters do not get the thank you after
	entering their PIN.
12:35	Confusion takes the throne, and reigns for the rest of the day.
	Some telco reps said that your vote was registered even if you
	didn't get a thank-you.  Others said that the votes were being 
	counted, don't worry.
~1:00	Voting is suspended while everyone works things out.
1:40	The electoral officer announces that all votes will be cancelled,
	and that voting will begin again at 2:30.
2:00	A kid with a scanner calls the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
	to tell them that he has a recording of the Party's conversation
	with the telco via celphone, giving the results so far.  The CBC
	passes the report up their hierarchy, trying to decide if it's a
	faked report.  The kid calls back thirty seconds later with the
	contents of *their* conversation with an Executive Producer, also 
	by celphone.  The CBC decides to run the story.
2:30	Voting begins again.  Callers are instructed that unless they
	get the thank-you message, their vote has not been counted.  Some
	people get a thank-you on the first try, others try for 20 or 30
	times.  In a desperate move, the telco cuts down on the number of
	circuits into the system, to no avail.  Voters now have busy
	signals as well as no acknowledgements to deal with; they report
	that the far end phone either sends the thank-you within a few
	seconds, or does nothing for about ten minutes before hanging up.
3:00	Voting is extended until 4:00.  Many voters complain that their
	PIN is being rejected.  Officials say to never mind, just try to
	vote again in this case.
4:00	Less than half the conventioneers have voted.  Voting is extended
	until 5:00.
5:00	Voting is extended until 6:30.
5:30	Reports begin arriving that members have been able to vote twice.
6:30	The convention is called off.

What went wrong?  System-design-wise?  Considering the PIN as a password --
each member knew only his -- there was no UID (member number) to PIN matching.
So anyone who knew your PIN could vote on your behalf.  So the problems of a)
PINs being rejected, and b) voting twice could easily be explained as people
making finger errors.  If you made a mistake with your PIN, either you got
someone else's number and voted for them, or you got rejected -- no way to
tell.  If you later went back and used your correct PIN after having used
someone else's, why, that would look a lot like being able to vote twice.
Users couldn't, of course, change their PINs.

Anyone with a programmable dialler could have voted for many, many Liberals if
he knew the format of the PINs.  Given the profoundly bad management we saw, I
wouldn't be surprised to see them as six-digit numbers ranging from 100001 to
107290; there were 7289 registered voters.  This prospect hasn't even been
discussed yet in the local media.

There was no backup voting system for this, the inaugural use of the system.
The telco convinced the Party there was no need for it -- the telco (the
newspaper report says) reminded the Party that it handles hundreds of thousands
a call a day, and there was no possibility of the system failing.

Operationally, there was either a bug in the voting software, or it was
incapable of handling the volume of traffic, causing it to fail to thank-you
most of the time.  And, of course, the kid with the scanner telling all just
added icing to the cake.

It was not a great day for the telco, or for the Liberal Party.  There hasn't
been any discussion of responsibility, but there sure will be next week!  The
convention cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and it was *entirely* a
wasted effort.

The lead story in the business section of the New York Times 8 Jun 1992 says
that "a surge of litigation" is expected in cases alleging repetitive strain
injury (RSI) caused by information-based equipment, "pitting telephone
operators, supermarket cashiers, journalists, and a wide variety of clerical
workers against many of the world's biggest manufacturers and a number of
smaller makers of high technology equipment."

The reason for this "surge," says the article, is last week's ruling by a
Federal Court in Brooklyn consolidating plaintiff cases of all hand, arm, and
wrist injuries allegedly caused by using high tech equipment, especially
keyboards.  There are 57 defendants in the case that the Court ruled on last
week, including IBM, AT&amp;T, Unisys, DEC, Apple, Xerox, Eastman Kodak, and
Hewlett Packard.  The defendants also include the U.S. subsidiaries of Northern
Telecom, Sony, NEC, Fujitsu, Samsung, and Phillips.

The article says that victims of RSI have previously relied on workers'
compensation awards, but workers' compensation does not provide for judgments
based on pain and suffering or on negligence on the part of the defendants.
The Federal Court's ruling last week will allow plaintiffs to sue manufacturers
under product liability laws, which means jury trials and, potentially,
punitive damages, although the latter seems unlikely.

RSI injuries are potentially one of the largest pools of product liability
cases in the country. The article says that the Bureau of Labor Statistics
estimates that 45 million people use computers on the job in the United States.

Consolidation of cases has risks to both sides of a product liability dispute.
Rulings and decisions in a consolidated case can affect thousands of
plaintiffs, so if the case comes before a judge with a tendency to rule in
favor of one side or the other, the effects of the rulings are magnified.  The
judge in the subject case consolidated the plaintiffs' cases in order to get a
baseline of scientific testimony on the connection between computer equipment
and RSI, but that could mean that companies that have taken more care in terms
of equipment safety could be lumped with companies that haven't done anything.
Plaintiffs have the advantages of seeing their case come to trial sooner and
getting better testimony from top expert witnesses, as well as sharing the risk
of failure, but they tend to get lower awards when they share a judgment or a
settlement than if their case was successfully tried on its own.

The judge in Brooklyn, Judge Jack B. Weinstein, said that the decision to
consolidate does not rule out the possibility that the cases may be separated
in the future, or that they could be dismissed altogether.  Judge Weinstein is
one of the most famous figures in American product liability law, having
presided over the consolidation of cases involving asbestos (the world's
largest product liability pool to date), Agent Orange, and DES
(diethylstilbestrol).

A printer who thought that his employers were trying to avoid paying him
\pounds 2,000 he believed was owed hacked [sic] into the firm's computer and
disabled the machine, Southwark Crown Court, south London was told yesterday.
Richard Goulden, 35, a freelance typesetter of Uxbridge, west London, who had
used a password that only he knew, refused to free the computer until the firm,
Ampersand Typesetting Ltd, of Camden, north London, had paid up.  The computer
refused and, after allegedly losing more than \pounds 36,000 of business
because it did not have access to information on the computer, went bankrupt.
The prosecution claims that Mr Goulden's action contributed to the bankruptcy.
Mr Goulden denies illegal modification of computer material under the 1990
Computer Misuse Act.  [_The Times_, London, 9 June 1992]

This is a summarized translation from Japanese of a posting of H. Murakami
(mhiroshi@tansei.cc.u-tokyo.ac.jp) regarding the use of a bulletin board
service in Japan to commit fraud.

Method:

        1) The perpetrator opens a BBS.
        2) Passwords and E-mail addresses are collected.
        3) The passwords and E-mail addresses are used to gain
           access to the BBS users Nifty Serve or PC-VAN accounts.
           (Similar to Compuserve and Prodigy)
        4) The passwords of these accounts are changed to prevent
           access of the real users.
        5) A bank account is opened under an assumed name.
        6) 'For Sale' notices for PC's etc. at low prices are posted
           from the stolen accounts.
        7) Victims replying to the postings are requested to transfer
           money into the bogus bank account.
        8) The money is withdrawn and the victims are out of luck.

The police were able to arrest the perpetrator after his face was
recorded by bank security cameras when he withdrew the money.

Morals of this story:

        A) Use different passwords for different accounts.
        B) Log on regularly to check for irregularities.

Aviation Week and Space Technology (8 June '92, p. 69) states that
"NASA Will Modify Rendezvous Software To Avoid Repeat of Endeavour
Problem"  The article reads:

NASA will change the specifications on the IBM software used to calculate space
shuttle rendezvous maneuvers to avoid problems on future missions like the one
that occurred at a critical point during Endeavour's final rendezvous with the
Hughes/ Intelsat 6/F3 spacecraft (AW&amp;ST May 25, p. 79).

Engineers have traced the problem to the sensitivity of NASA-developed
equations to a particular set of numeric values that arose when Endeavour was
making one of the final computer-targeted rendezvous maneuvers.  Test show the
software had been properly coded by IBM and therefore passed all preflight
tests, according to Ted Keller, senior technical staff member at the IBM
Shuttle Project Coordination Office, Houston.

The numerical values that caused the problem so closely resembled each other
that the software recognized them as identical values -- which they were not.
This resulted in the software providing incorrect targeting data for the
maneuver.

By relaxing the tolerances in the software, orbiter computers should be better
able to differentiate between values that are similar and provide proper
targeting information, Keller said.

This might be "the risks of asking for subscriptions 2 years before you can
deliver any issues": I received 3 copies of the 2nd issue of ACM TOSEM
(Software Engineering and Methodology) last week.  I called up ACM Member
Services and they said there had been "a problem printing the mailing labels"
(which, at least, they didn't blame on "the computer".  A careful examinination
of the labels shows they're all identical, except one says "EXP 9012", another
"EXP 9112", and the third "EXP 9212".  It's nearly certain those are a series
of dates on which my ACM membership expires (it's a common practice with
subscriptions these days to include the expiry date on the mailing label).

I got to thinking after the phone call about how this problem might have
occurred.  I'm quite absent-minded, as befits an academic, but I think I signed
up for TOSEM as soon as ACM announced it, which may well have been back in
1990.  At some point, perhaps later in 1990 when I paid my dues, I paid for a
subscription.  The first issue came out in January 1992; I wonder if some
attempt to remember ACM's multi-year obligation to send things to me resulted
in records for each of the 3 years?  It doesn't explain why the problem didn't
occur with the first issue.

If a lot of people had such a problem, it may well have cost ACM a lot of
money.

I read several years ago (Datamation, or some similar 'free' magazine) that
there is an offical testing lab in New Jersey (for Atlantic City) that tests
these things.  In order to be 'certified' they need to produce the software in
source form, the diagrams of the circiuts, and copies of the ROM's used in the
machines.  The testing lab used all sorts of tools (ICE's Logic Analyzers,
etc.) to verify that the opeation of the game (Slot Machine, Video Poker, etc.)
was up to specification (odds, etc.).  The article went on to say that the
testing lab did all it could to prevent non-random payoffs (not too cool).  It
sounds as though the testing was not complete for the given games, or the
testing facility (funded part of gaming commission) was not funded.  Perhaps
someone else can remember the exact article, as it has been a few years
(probably about 4 or so) since I saw it.

Richmond, June 9 (AP) -- An intruder erased information on about 17,000
supporters of Ross Perot from a computer file at the undeclared Presidential
Candidate's Virgina headquarters, campaign officials said.  They added,
however, that they have copies of the files destroyed in the weekend incident.

The data included the names, addresses, telephone numbers and notes on about
17,000 Perot supporters in Virginia.  "It's not a political act as far as I'm
concerned," said Mark Adams, the state petition coordinator for Virginians for
Perot.  "I don't feel threatened by anything of that nature."  [From the NY
Times, 10Jun 1992, p. A20]

  I understand that the spokesperson for the campaign would want to downplay
  the importance of the incident, and say that he didn't feel threatened, but
  it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this is a politically motivated dirty
  trick.  The Virginia election petition filing deadline is less than 3 weeks
  away.

  With a hotly contested and unusually complicated Presidential election upon
  us, I would hope that electoral computer risks will be receiving heightened
  attention from the community of computer professionals.

Most people tend to enjoy their days off, Memorial Day included.
Unfortunately, I received a call from our Operations staff at 4:30 in the
morning on Memorial Day.

It seems that during their normal nightly backups, one of the systems seemed to
have a problem.  During processing of one of the disks, nothing happened -- the
tape drive wasn't spinning and any attempt to exit out of the command (using
^Y) was ignored except for a useless "*INTERRUPT*" message on the console.

In frustration, they accidentally hit ^P which halted the system and then
attempted to reboot.  The system just would not come back up.

Something I should note about this system is that it (probably incorrectly) has
the key "votes" for the VAXcluster to continue operating normally.  Since it
was down, all the other systems were waiting for it to come back up ("quorum
lost, blocking activity").

After spending an hour fruitlessly searching for the problem, it turned out
that the disk that the system had tried to backup had gone south.  This disk
was (incorrectly) single-ported to a single HSC (Hierarchical Storage
Controller).  The HSC's action to disk problems it to spit out the errors onto
its console.  The console had a locally attached printer which had run out of
paper.

So, since there was no paper in the printer, the console hung waiting for it.
Since the console was hung, the HSC waited for it.  Since the HSC was hung, the
VAX couldn't come up.  Since the VAX couldn't come up, the VAXcluster wedged.

This is how a $150 printer could hang a half-a-million dollar VAXcluster.

Sigh..    --Marc

The following are excerpts from the article "The Data Weapon"
[Peter Grier, in _Government Executive_, June 1992, p. 21],
discussing U.S. communications support during the Iraqi conflict:

"...Throughout the Gulf theater of operations, satellite communications uplinks
seemed as common as the crushed water bottles that littered allies' camps....
The ubiquitous dishes were visible evidence of the vast command,
communications, control and intelligence (C3I) network the United States
laid....
    Getting it all working wasn't always easy.  The communications network
often needed workarounds and quick fixes to patch together equipment of
different technical generations, with different software interfaces and
protocols.
    One big glitch occurred early on.  In September 1990, it became apparent
that the new Defense Switched Network was experiencing a horrible
call-completion rate back to the United States, with only 20 to 30 percent of
attempts going through.  It took a troubleshooting effort of almost three
months, involving AT&amp;T and GTE technicians as well as military communicators,
before the trouble was found: a signaling incompatibility between tactical and
fixed systems.  Over a three-day weekend, Bell Labs finally produced a new
software patch to connect the systems, raising the call-completion rate to
about 90 percent.
    Another problem arose because the Army's new Mobile Subscriber Equipment
communications switches had not yet been tested for operability with the older
switches of the other services.  The Joint Tactical Command, Control and
Communications Agency back in the States had to whip up software fixes enabling
the Army's switches to work the Marine/Air Force Unit Level Circuit Switch, as
well as the French RITA communication system.  This took 17 days, according to
a DISA [Defense Information Systems Agency] report.
    Meanwhile, the demand for connectivity was so great that DoD communicators
were involved in an almost continuous search for all possible means of carrying
messages [earlier in the report Grier mentioned that the daily message load was
700,000 telephone calls and 152,000 messages].  Among other things, the amount
of electronic data being sent back and forth for tactical reasons was larger
than anyone had ever envisioned....  Every time a new [satellite] came on line,
it was used up."

_Government Executive_ is published by the same folks who put out the political
magazine _National Journal_, and it's aimed at the inside-the-Beltway
managerial crowd.  One wonders what might have occurred had the Iraqis pursued
a more rigorous electronic warfare strategy.  "Interoperability" is still the
big problem -- the Navy's inability to read the Air Force's computer-generated
Air Tasking Order [the daily air war plan] is becoming almost as famous as the
82nd Airborne trooper who used his AT&amp;T Calling Card to call Fort Bragg from
Grenada, asking them to call the Navy because he couldn't get through on the
radio to ask the ships offshore for fire support (I'm going to be _really_
disappointed if that story turns out to be apocryphal).  It also seems Patriot
batteries could receive data from the Airborne Warning and Control System
(AWACS) only with difficulty due to incompatible data links.

Typing errors are the fault of the contributor, not the magazine.

&gt;From Aviation Week as quoted by James Paul:

     Engineers have traced the problem to the sensitivity of NASA-developed
     equations to a particular set of numeric values that arose when Endeavour
     was making one of the final computer-targeted rendezvous maneuvers.  Test
     show the software had been properly coded by IBM and therefore passed all
     preflight tests, according to Ted Keller, senior technical staff member
     at the IBM Shuttle Project Coordination Office, Houston.

Here is some additional information about this event.  You can evaluate it 
yourselves with respect to the statements in AW.

The STS-49 failure of the flight software to converge during targeting has been
traced to the Lambert targeting routine.  The associated algorithms used by the
routine converge on an independent variable called "U" which is a double
precision scalar.  U is iterated (up to 10 times) via this algorithm.  The
algorithm is designed to converge on a value of U between two dynamically
updated limits called U_MIN and U_MAX, which are single precision scalars.  On
each iteration, either U_MIN or U_MAX is updated to decrease the interval
within which the algorithm will search for the desired value of U.

To determine which limit to update, the algorithm calculates a variable U_STEP,
the amount by which U will be updated on this iteration.  If its value is
positive, U_MIN is set to U.  If its value is negative, U_MAX is set to U.
Then U_STEP is added to U, and the resulting value of U is compared to the
limits U_MIN and U_MAX.  If U is now outside the limits, U is recalculated as
the average of U_MIN and U_MAX, thereby keeping U within the search interval.

                   U
          |--------|-----------------------|
         U_MIN                           U_MAX

U continues to be updated in this manner on each iteration until convergence is
attained or maximum iterations are executed.  Convergence occurs if the
normalized transfer time that corresponds to the current value of U is close
enough to the desired transfer time.  "Close enough" is a function of a
mission-specific data value.

For the third rendezvous of STS-49, the value of U after the first iteration
was very close to the desired value, and U_MIN was set equal to U because
U_STEP was positive.  On the second iteration cycle, U_STEP was smaller thana
one least significant bit (LSB) for U_MIN.  Since U_STEP was positive, U_MIN
was set to U, and U_STEP was added to U.  Algebraically, U should have been
greater than U_MIN.  However, due to precision differences, U_MIN was greater
than U.  (Loss of precision occurred when the double precision value of U was
stored into the single precision variable U_MIN.) Therefore, U was recalculated
to be the average of U_MIN and U_MAX, and the search interval no longer
contained the desired value of U.

         |&lt;---1 single precision LSB--&gt;|
         |                             |
         |                             |
         |     U          U            |
         |   after      after          |
         |    1st        2nd           |
         |    pass      pass*          |
         |------|---------|------------|
                |         |            |
                |&lt;-------&gt;|            |
                  U_STEP               |
                                      U_MIN
        *Prior to recalculations      after
                                     2nd pass

     Note:  both U and U-MIN had negative values

On subsequent iterations, U was updated in the direction of the desired value,
but never reached it before maximum iterations occurred because it was outside
the search interval.

To fix the problem and allow the mission to resume, they had to uplink a new
state vector from the ground, by-passing the onboard routine.  The permanent
fix involves changing U_MIN and U_MAX to double precision.

On Monday 8th June, I was tuning my amateur radio set across the 20-metre band,
when I came across an emergency traffic net on 14.245 MHz.  Several radio
amateurs, in Hawaii, California, Florida, and Mexico City, were assisting an
American marine vessel in the Carribean, the "Sea Harvest", whose navigation
systems had been disabled, apparently by a lightning strike.

Miami Coast Guard was alerted and the Coast Guard cutter "Courageous" was
dispatched from Jamaica to locate and assist the vessel.

One problem that arose was getting accurate coordinates for the vessel: all
they had to go on was the last known LORAN readout from the previous day, and
the direction and speed she had been sailing.  Later, Sea Harvest contacted
another ship on the marine distress frequency, VHF channel 16. Because Sea
Harvest had a hand-held VHF tranceiver, the other ship would have been fairly
close, and that ship's position reading would have been a reasonable
approximation.

However, when it came to relaying that information to the Coast Guard, things
became confused: the position was read out as "22 degrees, 34 minutes north,
*08 42 92* West" (I don't recall all the digits correctly, but the longitude
was read out as three pairs of digits).

The "08 42 92" was interpreted by all on frequency as being
degrees/minutes/seconds, as most of us have been brought up to read
geographical positions. The "08" was immediately rejected as a mistake,
possibly in translation from Spanish to English, as 8 degrees west is in the
Western Sahara desert, and it was judges that it was in fact *80* degrees West,
which is in the Carribean. The ship which provided the coordinates however
insisted that "08" was correct.

Several hours later, when authorisation was given to activate Sea Harvests's
EPIRB (Emergency Positioning Information Radio Beacon), the longitude figure
again came up as "084.."; it was only then that everyone realised that the
first THREE digits represented degrees, and the remaining three the minutes in
decimal format, eg 84 degrees 34.6 minutes.

The misinterpretation of the data format, when relayed over a voice radio link,
led to a lot of confusion: one of the degree/minute/seconds coordinate groups
placing the Sea Harvest five miles inland! This confusion lasted several hours
until the EPIRB was activated.

I'm very suprised that the Coast Guard could have been caught out by this: It
suggests that the "decimal minutes" representation is non-intuitive, or at
least counter to the way most "non-mariner" people (e.g. the radio amateurs
providing voice relays) have been educated to read geographical coordinates.
(Or, perhaps, there are two different readout systems currently in use?)

Of course, when passing messages through one or more relay operators, one must
be very careful not to try to "interpret" the message being passed, rather to
send it *exactly* as received.

It also illustrates that even the most sophisticated, systems can fail, and
that it's always best to have a safety backup.  Presumably, Sea Harvest's HF
radio antenna was on a different mast, and thus not destroyed by the lightning
strike!

I have a new '92 Saturn SL with a computer controlled ignition system.  I've
been having some minor problems with cold start--sometimes after starting the
car, the car seems to "hunt" for a good fast idle speed. It slow's the engine
down until the RPM's reach zero and the car is about to stall, then suddenly
boosts the engine speed to about 2000 RPM. Then it repeats.

The Saturn service manager mentioned that there is a software change due out at
the end of the month. Saturn HQ will download this change to each dealership
(by satellite link, I believe), and then each car will receive the software the
next time it checks in for servicing. This is likely related to my problem.

There's all sorts of potential risks here, and no doubt many of them have been
raised in this forum before. The important point is that the car I drive in to
the service center is not the same car that I drive out! Prototypes of the car
may have been driven for N million miles at proving grounds, but it didn't have
the same software. How extensively has the software been tested? What are the
security measures, if any, to ensure that the software I get is the software
distributed by the factory? Do I have the option of not accepting the new
software? I wonder if it's crossed anyone's mind that only downloading to
selected cars would be a way of performing economical field tests on large
numbers of cars (at some risk to those owners)? Even if this isn't explicitly
intended, it works out that way since not all the cars are downloaded
simultaneously--not yet, anyway.

As a sidenote, when you check in for Saturn service, your car's history is also
uploaded to Saturn HQ. Every engine stall, my salesman told me, is recorded, as
is the entire service history for each vehicle.

Telecom Australia allows easy denial of service attack

I was dismayed to find out today that Telecom Australia (which holds
a virtual monopoly on telecommunications in this country) will
disconnect a line given only two pieces of information:
    * telephone number
    * subscribers name

Anyone listed in the phone book, therefore, is an easy target for "prank"
denial of service.

More seriously, however, are some of the technology related considerations.
The building in which I work has a number of outside lines on a rotary.  The
alarm system when triggered, however, notifies a security firm on a fixed line.
A high-tech criminal could simply have that line disconnected and we would
never know (since the other lines on the exchange would still work).

There are two morals to the story. Firstly, the old problem of bureaucracies
not validating requests is still alive and well. Secondly, the shortcoming of
yet another automated system (our alarm) is highlighted when examining the
TOTAL environment.

How many mission critical telecommunications users verify the internal
checks and policies of their service provider?

The following appeared on the letters page, Philadelphia Inquirer, Wednesday,
June 10, 1992:

The rest of the story

Your story relating Eugene F. Smith's troubles with the Pennsylvania Department
of Transportation (June 2) was not a complete representation of Mr. Smith's
dealings with us.  I'd like to offer your readers the rest of the story.

When we received a police report that Mr. Smith had been killed in a car
accident, we edited his driving record accordingly.  When Mr. Smith learned of
the mistake to his record -- after the police stopped him for a driving
violation -- he wrote to us, and we corrected his record and issued him a photo
identification card since he was not eligible for a driver's license.

State law prevents me from disclosing any violations on an individual's
personal driving record, so I cannot explain to you why a driver may be
suspended or for how long.  I can tell you that an indication on our record
that a driver is deceased would in no way lead to a suspension.  [comment ---
special zombie permit?] I can also tell you that the rest of Mr. Smith's
problems with Penn-DOT are because of his own disregard for state traffic
safety laws.

I have asked the Pennsylvania State Police to investigate Mr. Smith's case so
that it can be settled correctly as the law provides.  Within those legal
parameters, we will work carefully with Mr. Smith to ensure that he understands
his responsibilities to drive legally in Pennsylvania.

Another moral:

        [...]
        6) `For Sale' notices for PC's etc. at low prices are posted
           from the stolen accounts.
        7) Victims replying to the postings are requested to transfer
           money into the bogus bank account.
        8) The money is withdrawn and the victims are out of luck.
        [...]

Morals of this story:

        A) Use different passwords for different accounts.
        B) Log on regularly to check for irregularities.
        C) When buying things advertised by computer, use COD.

Creative Technology makes Sound Blaster, a sound board used by IBM compatibles
to create game noises and other sound effects.  Media Vision, Inc. develops
computer peripherals and also makes a competing Thunder Board, designed to be
compatible with software commonly used with Sound Blaster.  However, a new
release of a developer's software apparently works fine with Sound Blaster, but
not with Thunder Board.  Media Vision claims Creative Technology inserted a
crash code that disables Media Vision's product, and has sued them for
restraint of trade, unfair competition, and monopolization.  (Media Vision was
sued LAST MONTH by Creative Technology for violation of copyrights.)  [Source:

Summarized from *The Boston Globe*, June 11, 1992, page 39:

The FBI raided the home of a computer bulletin board operator in Millbury,
Massachusetts, yesterday, confiscating "several" computers, six modems, and a
piece of equipment called "PC Board," which the FBI said was used to run the
bulletin board system.  The Software Publishers' Association brought the
bulletin board to the FBI's attention, claiming that the system, called "Davy
Jones' Locker," contained pirated copies of copyrighted software that users
were encouraged to download.  SPA claimed that there were over 200 different
programs on the system, and users who uploaded copies of copyrighted software
got free log-on time as a bonus.  The alleged operator of the bulletin board,
Richard Kenadek, was not arrested.  The FBI would not comment on the case.

An SPA spokesperson said that the system had nearly 400 subscribers paying $49
for three months or $99 for a year to gain access to downloadable copies of
Lotus 1-2-3, Microsoft Word, and other programs.  SPA estimated that the system
distributed $675,000 worth of software since March of this year.

Sanford Sherizen, a computer security specialist in Natick, was quoted as
saying, "We're making legal history here," because this case is apparently the
first time federal authorities have gone after a bulletin board system for
violations of copyright law.

The SPA representative said that the organization runs a telephone hotline for
reports on bulletin boards offering downloadable copyrighted software, and they
get "at least ten calls a day."  SPA takes action against about two bulletin
boards a week, usually with the threat of a lawsuit.

This week's Sunday New York Times Magazine has a story by James Gleick,
"Chasing bugs in the electronic village," (June 14, 1992, p. 38 ff).  It
describes users' experiences with the Microsoft Word for Windows product, as
reported in a Compuserve forum and at user's group meetings.  Gleick reports
that, through several successive product versions, the vendor did not fix
defects that were reported by many users and claimed the product included
features that were incompletely and incorrectly implemented.  Gleick also says
these problems were not much reported in reviews in the trade magazines, even
though they were widely known in the user community.

I have a friend who is a clinical psychologist specializing in crisis
counseling.  Last weekend one of her patients was in an auto accident and
called the counseling center hotline to ask for my friend.  The patient's
record indicated that her behavior could be self-destructive under stress.
Following clinic procedure, the clinic (1) paged my friend.  After a 10 minute
wait for a call back they (2) paged her again.  After another 10 minutes they
(3) called her home, reaching her immediately.  Her pager had been on and the
batteries were fine, but it had not received the page.  Anyway, my friend
immediately called the patient to discover that she had taken a large dose of
pills perhaps 30 minutes earlier.  An ambulance was called and the woman was
(barely) saved.

My friend's reaction to this failure was to update the patient's record
specifying special handling procedures in the case of a crisis call.  She
rather blithely accepted the paging system failure and said that it happens all
the time: phantom pages, missed pages, etc.  Some of these are due to keying
errors by the caller, others are due to environmental conditions blocking the
radio signal.  This incident is likely neither; two pages were made and my
friend has never missed a page at home before.

Here are my questions:

	1) What are the failure modes of pager systems?  For example:
	   Can the system detect that a page is not getting through?
	   What range of causes are there for a failed page?
	   Can the person initiating the page be notified of failure?

	2) What responsibilities does a paging service have to inform
	   its users of failures as soon as it can detect them?  What
	   responsibility does it have to inform its users of recent
	   failure rates?

BTW, The location of this incident was not in a metropolitan area.  This means,
apparently, that this paging service has a monopoly.

This is a follow-up on the huge local vote-by-phone fiasco.  In <A HREF="/Risks/13.56.html">RISKS-13.56</A> I
wrote about the vote-by-phone system contracted from the telco by the Liberal
Party for their leadership convention, following Murphy's Law.

On June 8th, the telco held meetings with the Liberal Party, and with the
media.  As always, there's a little second guessing to do about what the
press releases mean.  Here's what they *say*:

 - The system was composted of two software packages which had never
   been tested together at high call volume.  ``All I can say, is it never
   occurred to anybody in my staff, and it never occurred to me.'' said
   Colin Lantham, the vice-president of business services for Maritime Tel
   and Tel.

 - The first part of the system [presumably the touchtone answering
   /selection system] was capable of handling 78,000 calls an hour.

 - The second part of the system, "set up to receive the caller's 8-digit
   PIN" proved much slower.  [I'd guess that this was the interface to
   the databases that kept track of votes and who had voted. -dm]

The *first* part of the system had a dead-session detection function, to keep
people from tying up phone lines.  However, when the second part of the system
started to slow down [transactions queued up?  -dm] the first module hung up
before the second part issued an acknowledgement.

Also, the telco says when voting was restarted, ``some rogue information stayed
in the system, causing some voters to be rejected.'' [They didn't reset the
who-had-voted list, perhaps?  -dm].  On the day of the fiasco, the telco
initially blamed the problem on a missing line of code in the software, but
they say now that that was a mistake.  The problem of people being able to vote
twice hasn't been mentioned.

The telco says the Liberal Party won't be charged for the services rendered on
Saturday.  [Like the power utility burning down your house with a million volts
by accident, and saying ``Don't worry, you won't be billed for the
electricity.'' -dm]

150 telco employees were recruited to test the system, [compared to 8000 voters
in the real system!  -dm] on Thursday the 11th, and it apparently worked.  The
telco reduced the number of incoming lines to cut down on system load.

The Liberal Party has decided to have another go at the vote-by-telephone
system in a few days, but there won't be another convention.  The telco will be
posting a 350,000$Cdn performance bond on the system, and there will be a
paper-ballot backup system on hand.

Sme candidates have asked the telco for partial reimbursements of their campain
costs on the basis that disclosure of the numbers (leaked via the kid with the
scanner listening to the cellular conversations) have destroyed their chances
of winning.  The telco claims that the numbers leaked (numbers of calls
recorded to each of the candidate's phone number) bear no relationship to the
number of votes that had been collected or would have been collected.

I was very impressed by Mr. Shannon's message of a $150 printer hanging up a
$0.5M VAXcluster (<A HREF="/Risks/13.57.html">RISKS-13.57</A>).  Meanwhile, it reminded me a common "hang-up"
problem we have in my institution (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro -
Brazil).

It's reasonably easy for us to get money to buy hardware; actually, we have an
ever-growing Sun and IBM-PC network.  But, it is difficult to get money to buy
supplements. This means that we are usually working under bad conditions,
because of:

  1. lack of paper or toner for our printers
  2. lack of tapes to do backup
  3. lack of maintenance contracts, due to lack of funds, etc...

It can be a third-world problem, but it is really a risk to invest in an
expensive system if you cannot afford its maintenance.  It can happen that the
cheapest choice turns to be just wasted money.

How can Howard Yerusalim, State Secretary of Transportation, miss the point so
completely while claiming to offer us the "rest of the story"?  He accepts the
fact that an anonymous driver was killed in a car accident while in possesion
of Mr. Smith's stolen driver's license, yet completely ignores Mr. Smith's
claim that the anonymous driver was also responsible for the traffic violations
which caused the license to be suspensed.
 
I am not comforted by Mr. Yerusalim claims that State Law prohibits him from
from disclosing details of an individual's driving record, when he then accuses
Mr. Smith of vague and sweeping "disregard for state traffic safety laws" in a
public newspaper.  If Mr. Smith is cleared by the police investigation, will he
sue the state for lost wages, related damages, and slander?  It might help
motivate Pennsylvania to correct the situation.
 
Perhaps some RISKS readers know what procedures are used by other state
transportation departments to prevent similar situations, or could this happen
to you?

&gt; I'm very suprised that the Coast Guard could have been caught out by this: It
&gt; suggests that the "decimal minutes" representation is non-intuitive, or at
&gt; least counter to the way most "non-mariner" people (e.g. the radio amateurs
&gt; providing voice relays) have been educated to read geographical coordinates.
&gt; (Or, perhaps, there are two different readout systems currently in use?)

    Having raced "the big boats" for 9 years or so now, primarily as navigator, 
I may be able to supply a little background information here.  With the advent 
of reliable and relatively inexpensive Loran navigational equipment, decimal 
minutes has become a very popular "readout system" for displaying position.

    Most, if not all, units allow the user to select either degrees-minutes-
seconds or degrees-minutes-decimal minutes for display.  Most users opt for the 
decimal minutes display.  It is usually easier to plot to the nearest tenth of 
a minute, it is usually sufficient accuracy (approx. 200 yards - depends on 
latitude), and Loran isn't much more accurate than that for absolute position 
anyway.  I do because all of my racing marks have been measured and listed in 
this manner by the local racing association, probably because of the above 
reasons.  GPS units provide increased accuracy, of course, but 200 yards is 
usually plenty close most of the time.  It is not unusual for a powerboat with 
a Loran or GPS coupled autopilot to collide with the buoy selected as a 
waypoint by an inattentive skipper.

    I am also surprised that the Coast Guard couldn't figure it out.  At the 
very least, the previous day's position would make it obvious, and the leading 
zero would make me suspicious.

&gt;As a sidenote, when you check in for Saturn service, your car's history is also
&gt;uploaded to Saturn HQ. Every engine stall, my salesman told me, is recorded, as
&gt;is the entire service history for each vehicle.

Hmm, how 'bout every engine overspeed (or overrev)?  Or, since I suspect the
engine knows what gear the transmission is in, how 'bout %time over 65mph?  I
can see it now.  "I'm sorry, Mr Foo, but we show that you drive this car
outside of it's limits.  We can't do any warranty sevice because of this"

When engine computers were newer, I read in Car and Driver that Cadillac's new
engine computer would record overspeeds.  The person they were talking to
implied that this might be used later if you reported engine problems.

There were actually several reassuring things about the Perot incident,
especially as per the full AP story.  First, of course, they did have backups.
Not only that, the backups were stored off-site.  Second, the spokesperson said
that they didn't store sensitive information on that machine, because too many
people had access to it.  Finally, he implied that the level of computer
security wasn't that high, precisely because anyone, from anyone else's
campaign, could have walked in off the street and achieved a position of trust.
In other words, don't worry about your technical security measures if your
other protections, including personnel screening, don't match up.  Security is
as strong as the weakest link, not the strongest.

One of the local radio stations broadcasting the report of this incident noted
that the Perot office had been staffed over the weekend with untrained *and
unsupervised* volunteers.  The broadcast drew no conclusions from this
statement, but it strongly suggests that the problem may have the result of an
innocent mistake in a poorly organized activity.

While it may in fact be somebody's deliberate attempt at sabotage, I'm more
inclined at this point to agree with the old adage that one should not ascribe
to malice anything which can be explained by simple stupidity.  (On the other
hand, this *is* a political environment, in which most rules are stood on their
heads...)

In RISK Volume 13 Issue 55, David Parnas writes:
&gt; Isn't it just like our technocratic society to react to such an accident,
&gt; caused by a completely unnecessary luxury becoming too complex, by making it
&gt; even more complex? Wouldn't the simpler solution be to ban automatic windows

Integrating new technology into society is never painless. There is constant
conflict between pressure for new technology (or new features) and need for
stability. New technology causes changes no one can foresee, even less control.
There is no easy solution. Public debate involving specialists, interest groups
and lay people, and economic pressure on those "responsible" seems to be the
least bad way of "controlling" technology.

Banning products usually harms the consumer more than protects him.  Banning
specific products or features can be feasible in clear cut cases, but cases
usually are not clear cut. If they are, we usually have a case for product
liability not a ban. Value of products can never be stated objectively. Its
always relevant to a person or a group. What is useless to some does have value
for others. (Very few things, if any, can be shown to have objective value
independent of a person or a group).

Complex regulations on safety usually lead to more complex products, that are
more expensive and more error prone. And worse it releases producers from
responsibility, because they can refer to the regulations.

There is a conflict between goverment intervention and freedom. To much or too
little harms the public, not the producers. Through public debate and by
placing (economic) responsibility were its possible, pressure can be built to
increase product quality and safety. Under pressure products become simpler and
safer, and their price reflects the producers risk of producing, because he can
not put that risk anywhere else.

Pugwash organizations exist in 20 countries on four continents.  For more
information, reply to this message at porten@eniac.seas.upenn.edu.

More information about the conference follows.

For each of the listed topics, student and senior participants form small
working groups in which they will meet every morning throughout the conference
week to discuss areas of mutual interest and expertise.  These intensive
discussions offer an invaluable opportunity for students to explore the
ethical and value questions posed by advances in science and technology with
forward-thinking professionals.  

Senior Participants will be present from the U.S. Congress, National
Institutes of Health, National Academy of Sciences, Carter Center, Centers
for Disease Control, Brookings Institution, Emory University, and many 
other prominent institutions.  Several special events will also be held,
including a day at the Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta and an
interactive, multi-media World Game Workshop.

The separate working group meetings are complemented by afternoon and evening
plenary sessions for the full conference.  Plenaries will address issues which 
cut across disciplinary boundaries such as ethical conduct in scientific
research, race and gender in science, technology and global responsibility,
and religion and science.

Student Pugwash USA is committed to representing a broad spectrum of
political,international, and disciplinary perspectives.  Previous conferences
have attracted participants from over thirty nations.  We are striving for even
greater international, intergenerational, and interdisciplinary representation
at the 1992 conference.

This is something I picked up while having some discussions at a software
company here in Edinburgh. The company has a Gaelic name, and has been
having problems with British Telecom's directory enquiries service not
finding their entry. Apparently, all calls to directory enquiries are put
through an implementation of the SOUNDEX algorithm: the operator listens to
the name given by the caller, and types in the name as heard or a close
phonetic approximation to it. I don't know a great deal about SOUNDEX, but
it doesn't work for Gaelic, even though the company's name (An Teallach) is
not too distant from the phonetic pronunciation (An Chellack).

The final part of the long, heated discussion with the BT engineer revealed
that they've been having a lot of problems with the system, especially with
people calling up to ask for phone numbers of French restaurants...

Those of us who are aware that denial results when the output queues for
peripherals overrun are aware that it can be devastating, but there are
also those of us who take advantage of it as if it were a feature.  Here
is what happened to me today.

          On a 3B2, the system backups and restoration program does not
allow you to restore information to different directory structures than
it was backed up from without great difficulty.  I happened to have over
9,000 files to restore to a system, and they were backed up from "/v",
but the system they were being restored on had only a "/u" it would fit
on.  (These are Unix sub\directories).  As a result, I essentially had
to do the restore to a newly created "/v" in the root file system, which
did not have enough file space available to do the entire restore.  I
had a plan - As the tape was restored, I would copy disk-to-disk and
delete the incoming files after copying them.  I have done this "race"
before, and I knew that I had to transfer out at a rate high enough so
that the root file system would not overrun - which is to say, I had to
beat the incoming tape transfer with disk to disk transfers.  Of cours
the tape in streeming mode operates faster than the disk I was using, so
in the end, it was helpless because it takes two disk accesses to move a
file from one disk to another, but only 1 access to get a new file from
the tape.  I tried putting in multiple transfer processes at high
priority, but of course, the DMAs always won from the tape to the disk.

          The solution I used (when the available space began to get
critical) was to halt output on the console!  Hard to believe it works?
Of course it does.  The tape transfers produce a dot on the screen for
each of the files transfered in, and by pressing &lt;ctrl&gt;s (stop output) I
was able to block the tape transfer process after only a few hundred
more files are transfered.  By watching the disk space, stopping the
console output to block tape transfers when space got too low, and
continuing output when more space was created by the transfer to the
second disk, I was able to complete the job.

          The point of this insanity is that as a practical matter, there are
times when knowing how to cause denial of services can be a very useful part of
systems administration - especially when we can do it so selectively.  The
title of this piece indicates that by knowing about how to break a system, I
was able to compensate for one flaw in the system by exploiting another flaw -
hence, 2 wrongs made a right!

P.S.  I am interested in other stories where knopwn holes were used to
compensate creatively for other known holes.  It is my contention that most of
the best systems administrators and systems programmers know about and exploit
these sorts of things all of the time, and that without these flaws, we would
really have to design systems right - otherwise, we would never be able to make
up for the wrongs with other wrongs.

Bell attempts to correct error that allows free phone-sex calls

OTTAWA (CP)  --  Bell Canada is scrambling to repair a computer error
that allows some Ottawa pay phones to dispense free phone-sex services.
   The error has been giving callers easy access for months to graphic
recordings of simulated kinky sex.  Callers have also been able to speak
to women whose job is to fulfil sexual fantasies by talking dirty.
   Bell officials weren't aware of the glitch in the system until an
Ottawa Citizen reporter told them of it, said official Lynn Francoeur.
   Phone-sex clients "certainly weren't going to call Bell and tell us
they were getting this for free."
   Francoeur could not say why Bell hadn't detected the error which has
affected pay phones in Ottawa's west end and in the nearby community of
Nepean.  Nor could she say how much money Bell and the phone-sex companies
have lost, or how long the error has existed.
   Many west-end high school students have been in the know for months.  At
Woodroffe High School, where three pay phones allowed the no-charge calls,
several teenagers said they knew of the free dial-a-porn since late 1990.
   "It's perverted," said a 16-year-old male in Grade 10, who asked not to
be identified.

&gt;From The Courier-Mail, Queensland, Australia - May 18, 1992
	"Pay-TV boost to technology" (copied without permission)

A US export ban on pay-TV decoding technology could lead to a multibillion-
dollar, Australian-led revolution in the industry.  The 15-year-old decoding or
encryption system used in the US is classified "military sensitive", ruling out
its export to and use in Australia when this country introduces a pay-TV system
in 1994.

Far from creating a major hurdle for Australia's nascent pay-TV industry - pay
TV cannot work without a signal decoding system - the export ban is likely to
result in a massive boost for Australian technology.

After three years of developmental work, Gold Coast-based electronics company
Digital Blanking Systems has produced a pay-TV "black box" which, it says, is
better than the American version and which could save Australia $100 million a
year in imports.  [RNZ - $A1 = ~$US0.76]

The company says its revolutionary decoder could earn Australia up to
$2.5 billion a year in exports if the designed was accepted in key Asian
and European pay-TV markets.

	So, what we've said in the past about US export restrictions on
encryption technology being detrimental economically is coming to pass.

In the June 15 issue of <A HREF="/Risks/13.58.html">RISKS-13.58</A>, Bill Griswold of UCSD describes an
incident that took place regarding a missed page that nearly cost the life of a
person in personal crisis.  I cannot comment on the availablity of any type of
fault-tolerance in most radio paging system, that is can the system confirm
that the page was recieved by the intended beeper?  It would seem that the
beepers that are typically available cannot transmit a return signal to
indicate reception.  I make that statement based upon the logical assumption
that if the system needs a 100 foot tall (sometimes taller) tower to transmit
the primary signal to the pager, the pager does not have the power to send a
return signal.  There are certainly experts out there in radio signal
transmission that can comment on the specifics.  But in most cases, it takes
less power to sense a transmission than to actually generate one.  Automotive
radar detectors are a prime example of this.

My personal experience has had similar events.  In my former life as a cardiac
surgical assistant, there were times that I missed pages during life
threatening situations when patients were in need of immediate attention from a
health care professional.  I had a Motorola BPR2000 beeper (the LCD display
type) that was considered one of the best at the time (1981 - 1986 time frame)
and there were more times than I care to think about when I was either in the
hospital or on call away from the hospital that pages were missed.  In no case
did anyone die (luckily), but it did create enormous amounts of tension as
precious minutes were sometimes lost due to not recieving the page the first
time.  In one circumstance, I changed from the hospital's own system to a
commercial system, that was signifcantly more reliable (higher power
transmitter with a better, more central antenna location).  With that system, I
did not miss any pages over the course of the subsequent year.  At least that I
know of!

I also would be curious to hear of any similar experiences and any expert
comments on the nature of error detection and correction on the systems,
especially with the new nation-wide paging systems that are in wide spread
use by companies, including my present employer for our field personnel.

Subject: Privacy alert:San Diego voters on CD
Date: 8 Jun 92 18:31:33 GMT
Organization: Argus Computing, San Diego, CA
 
An article that made the front page of the San Diego Union on Sunday,
June 7, 1992 bore the title: "Technology pits privacy vs. Information
Age". The article starts with these paragraphs:
 
++++++
 
   The morning after Bill Turner voted in last week's election, he picked up a
copy of a local computer magazine and his jaw dropped.  "This ad just jumped
out and hit me in the face," said the 35-year old La Mesa computer programmer.
"It was a severe shock."  There, for sale, were Turner's name, address,
unlisted telephone number, occupation, birthplace, birthdate and political
affiliation.
 
   A list of San Diego County's 1.25 million registered voters containing the
information is available for $99 in a relatively new format [CD-ROM] that
virtually anyone with a personal computer can use. It is the first known such
use of voter registration data in the nation.
 
++++++
 
The CD-ROM is marketed by a San Diego company call Sole Source Systems, a local
computer store.
 
Lists of voter information have always been available, and political campaigns
have had access to the information on data tapes for years.  This is, however,
the first time that such information has been made available to the public at
large, in an easily accessible format (dBase, from what I can gather).
 
Sole Source says that use of the CD is limited to "election purposes,
...election, scholarly or political research, or government purposes."  Sole
Source says that they require ID and the completion of a form before selling
the CD.  Turner responds to this with "What is there to prevent me from going
up there and telling him I'm with the Little Old Ladies Auxilliary 97, and I
want this list to call people up and help arrange transportation to the polls
on Election Day?  It would be a bald-faced lie, but I would get it [the CD]."
 
He may be right, as Conny McCormack, the San Diego County Registrar of Voters
says that the registrar's office does not check to make sure the list is being
used within the law, primarily because "we have no authority in that area."
 
David Banisar, a policy analyst with Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibilities in Washington, DC, said in all likelihood the CD would end up
in the hands of direct marketers. "This is really an unanticipated use of the
data," he said, "You register to vote because you want to feel patriotic and do
your citizen's duty and try to get some good government.  You don't register to
vote so that you can be solicited by every bozo out there with a widget that he
feels he should hock to you."
 
The article goes on to discuss the problems of privacy in the computer age, and
mentions two other CD-ROM databases that are publicly available: PhoneDisc USA,
from a corporation of the same name in Marblehead, Mass., lists 90 million
names, addresses and phone numbers nation wide.  MetroScan CD, from
Transamerica Information Management in Sacramento, is a database containing
housing ownership information, from deed filings, and for a given address
provides the owner's name, address, when the building was purchased, how many
bedrooms and bathrooms it has, how many square feet it has, and it's property
tax assessment.
 
In the article, Ken Smith, from Transamerica Information Magagement,
is quoted as saying: 
 
   "I'm very much in favor of making the information, if it's in the
    public domain, available to a very wide audience, rather than just
    major corporations and government agencies. It's a very, very 
    powerful tool for the little guy."
 
and further:
 
   "I don't think the privace issue has been a concern yet. I can
    see where it might be in the future, but it's not a problem now."
 
Finally the article goes back to Dante Tuccero, from PhoneDisc USA Corp.,
listing such PhoneDisc customers as "the U.S.  Drug Enforcement
Administration, the Navy, the Air Force, the Social Security
Administration, as well as local libraries and law enforcement, public
investigators, geneologists, and even high school and college reunions."
Quoting Tuccero, "There's a company in Langley, Va,. that uses it, I
believe, but wouldn't say so."
 
The last paragraphs of the article point out that "the direct-mail company
that provides PhoneDisc with most of it's data prefers to remain off other
people's lists."
 
"We're not at liberty to share that," Tuccero said, "A lot of data
providers like to be low key."
 
The saddest part of the whole article, in my opinion, is this statement
from Turner: "I have voted in every election since I was 18, and I think
(this) was the last election I'll ever vote in."
 
[For those concerned about the PhoneDisc listings, they will remove your
name from the next release of their CD if you call.  They claim that only
two people have called so far.  I imagine we can change that!  Their
number in Marblehead, Mass. as given by directory assistance, is
617-639-2900.]

Summary: PhoneDisc won't remove names.
Date: 9 Jun 92 21:18:44 GMT

...
 
I called this number to get removed from their list.  The lady who
answered the phone was polite, and told me that they got their information
from the white pages of phone books around the country, which are public
information.  I told her I wanted to be removed from their product, and
she responded that all I needed to do was to get an unlisted number from
the phone company so that I would not be in the next phone book, and that
would prevent me from getting into the next copy of their product.  They
will not remove someone from it individually.
 
Looks like more cause for concern...

   The Third Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy
         Sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM, SIGCAS &amp; SIGSAC
                    9 - 12 March 1993
     San Francisco Airport Marriott Hotel, Burlingame, CA

INVITATION

This is an invitation to submit session and topic proposals for 
inclusion in the program of the Third Conference on Computers, 
Freedom and Privacy.  Proposals may be for individual talks, panel 
discussions, debates or other presentations in appropriate 
formats. Proposed topics should be within the general scope of the 
conference, as outlined below.

SCOPE

The advance of computer and telecommunications technologies holds 
great promise for individuals and society. From convenience for 
consumers and efficiency in commerce to improved public health and 
safety and increased participation in democratic institutions, 
these technologies can fundamentally transform our lives.

At the same time these technologies pose threats to the ideals of 
a free and open society. Personal privacy is increasingly at risk 
from invasion by high-tech surveillance and eavesdropping. The 
myriad databases containing personal information maintained in the 
public and private sectors expose private life to constant 
scrutiny. 

Technological advances also enable new forms of illegal activity, 
posing new problems for legal and law enforcement officials and 
challenging the very definitions of crime and civil liberties. But 
technologies used to combat these crimes can threaten the 
traditional barriers between the individual and the state.

Even such fundamental notions as speech, assembly and property are 
being transformed by these technologies, throwing into question 
the basic Constitutional protections that have guarded them. 
Similarly, information knows no borders; as the scope of economies 
becomes global and as networked communities transcend 
international boundaries, ways must be found to reconcile 
competing political, social and economic interests in the digital 
domain.

The Third Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy will 
assemble experts, advocates and interested people from a broad 
spectrum of disciplines and backgrounds in a balanced public forum 
to address the impact of computer and telecommunications 
technologies on freedom and privacy in society. Participants will 
include people from the fields of computer science, law, business, 
research, information, library science, health, public policy, 
government, law enforcement, public advocacy and many others.

Topics covered in previous CFP conferences include:

Personal Information and Privacy
International Perspectives and Impacts
Law Enforcement and Civil Liberties
Ethics, Morality and Criminality
Electronic Speech, Press and Assembly
Who Logs On (Computer &amp; Telecom Networks)
Free Speech and the Public Telephone Network
Access to Government Information
Computer-based Surveillance of Individuals
Computers in the Workplace
Who Holds the Keys? (Cryptography)
Who's in Your Genes? (Genetic Information)
Ethics and Education
Public Policy for the 21st Century

These topics are given as examples and are not meant to exclude 
other possible topics on the general subject of Computers, Freedom 
and Privacy.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION

All proposals should be accompanied by a position statement of at 
least one page, describing the proposed presentation, its theme 
and format. Proposals for panel discussions, debates and other 
multi-person presentations should include a list of proposed 
participants and session chair. Proposals should be sent to:

	2210 Sixth Street
	Berkeley, CA 94710

or by email to:    cfp93@well.sf.ca.us    with the word "Proposal" 
in the subject line. Proposals should be submitted as soon as 
possible to allow thorough consideration for inclusion in the 
formal program. The deadline for submissions is 15 August 1992.

STUDENT PAPER COMPETITION

Full time students are invited to enter the student paper 
competition. Winners will receive a scholarship to attend the 
conference and present their papers.

Papers should not exceed 2500 words and should address the impact 
of computer and telecommunications technologies on freedom and 
privacy in society. All papers should be submitted to Professor 
Dorothy Denning by 15 October 1992. Authors may submit their

This cryptography article appeared Sunday, June 21. It is being forwarded to
RISKS as a way of giving back something to the many thoughtful participants
here who helped give shape to the questions and the article.

In a companion submission [see <A HREF="/Risks/13.61.html">RISKS-13.61</A>], I include the scanned text of the
NSA's 13-page response to my interview request, which appears to be the most
substantial response they've provided to date. I would like to invite feedback

               Promising technology alarms government --
  Use of super-secret codes would block legal phone taps in FBI's crime work
          By JOE ABERNATHY, Copyright 1992, Houston Chronicle
	
   Government police and spy agencies are trying to thwart new technology that
allows conversations the feds can't tap.  A form of cryptography -- the science
of writing and deciphering codes -- this technology holds the promise of
guaranteeing true privacy for transactions and communications.  But an array
of Federal agencies is seeking to either outlaw or severely restrict its use,
pointing out the potency of truly secret communications as a criminal tool.

   ``Cryptography offers or appears to offer something that is unprecedented,''
said Whitfield Diffie, who with a Stanford University colleague devised public
key cryptography,'' an easily used cryptography that is at the center of the
fight.  ``It looks as though an individual might be able to protect information
in such a way that the concerted efforts of society are not going to be able to
get at it.  ``No safe you can procure has that property; the strongest safes
won't stand an hour against oxygen lances. But cryptography may be different. I
kind of understand why the police don't like it.''

   The National Security Agency, whose mission is to conduct espionage against
foreign governments and diplomats, sets policy for the government on matters
regarding cryptography.  But the FBI is taking the most visible role. It is
backing legislation that would address police fears by simply outlawing any use
of secure cryptography in electronic communications.  The ban would apply to
cellular phones, computer networks, and the newer standard telephone equipment
-- already in place in parts of Houston's phone system and expected to gain
wider use nationwide.

   ``Law enforcement needs to keep up with technology,'' said Steve Markardt, a
spokesman for the FBI in Washington.  ``Basically what we're trying to do is
just keep the status quo. We're not asking for anything more intrusive than we
already have.''  He said the FBI uses electronic eavesdropping only on complex
investigations involving counterterrorism, foreign intelligence, organized
crime, and drugs.  ``In many of those,'' he said, we would not be able to
succeed without the ability to lawfully intercept.''

   The State and Commerce departments are limiting cryptography's spread
through the use of export reviews, although many of these reviews actually are
conducted by the NSA. The National Institute of Standards and Technology,
meanwhile, is attempting to impose a government cryptographic standard that
critics charge is flawed, although the NSA defends the standard as adequate
for its intended, limited use.

   ``It's clear that the government is unilaterally trying to implement a
policy that it's developed,'' said Jim Bidzos, president of RSA Data Security,
which holds a key cryptography patent.  ``Whose policy is it, and whose
interest does it serve? Don't we have a right to know what policy they're
pursuing?''  Bidzos and a growing industry action group charge that the policy
is crippling American business at a critical moment.

   The White House, Commerce Department, and NIST refused to comment.

   The NSA, however, agreed to answer questions posed in writing by the Houston
Chronicle. Its purpose in granting the rare, if limited, access, a spokesman
said, was ``to give a true reflection'' of the policy being implemented by the
agency.  ``Our feeling is that cryptography is like nitroglycerin: Use it
sparingly then put it back under trusted care,'' the spokesman said.

   Companies ranging from telephone service providers to computer manufacturers
and bankers are poised to introduce new services and products including
cryptography.  Users of electronic mail and computer networks can expect to see
cryptography-based privacy enhancements later this year.

   The technology could allow electronic voting, electronic cash transactions,
and a range of geographically separated -- but secure -- business and social
interactions. Not since the days before the telephone could the individual
claim such a level of privacy.

   But law enforcement and intelligence interests fear a world in which it
would be impossible to execute a wiretap or conduct espionage.

   ``Secure cryptography widely available outside the United States clearly
has an impact on national security,'' said the NSA in its 13-page response to
the Chronicle.  ``Secure cryptography within the United States may impact law
enforcement interests.''

   Although Congress is now evaluating the dispute, a call by a congressional
advisory panel for an open public policy debate has not yet been heeded, or
even acknowledged, by the administration.

   The FBI nearly won the fight before anyone knew that war had been declared.
Its proposal to outlaw electronic cryptography was slipped into another bill as
an amendment and nearly became law by default last year before civil liberties
watchdogs exposed the move.

    ``It's kind of scary really, the FBI proposal being considered as an
amendment by just a few people in the Commerce Committee without really
understanding the basis for it,'' said a congressional source, who requested
anonymity.  ``For them, I'm sure it seemed innocuous, but what it represented
was a fairly profound public policy position giving the government rights to
basically spy on anybody and prevent people from stopping privacy
infringements.''

   This year, the FBI proposal is back in bolder, stand-alone legislation that
has created a battle line with law enforcement on one side and the technology
industry and privacy advocates on the other.  ``It says right on its face that
they want a remote government monitoring facility'' through which agents in
Virginia, for instance, could just flip a switch to tap a conversation in
Houston, said Dave Banisar of the Washington office of Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility.

   Though the bill would not change existing legal restraints on phone-tapping,
it would significantly decrease the practical difficulty of tapping phones --
an ominous development to those who fear official assaults on personal and
corporate privacy.  And the proposed ban would defuse emerging technical
protection against those assaults.

   CPSR, the point group for many issues addressing the way computers affect
peoples' lives, is helping lend focus to a cryptographic counterinsurgency that
has slowly grown in recent months to include such heavyweights as AT&amp;T, DEC,
GTE, IBM, Lotus, Microsoft, Southwestern Bell, and other computer and
communications companies.

   The proposed law would ban the use of secure cryptography on any message
handled by a computerized communications network.  It would further force
service providers to build access points into their equipment through which the
FBI -- and conceivably, any police officer at any level -- could eavesdrop on
any conversation without ever leaving the comfort of headquarters.
	
    ``It's an open-ended and very broad set of provisions that says the FBI can
demand that standards be set that industry has to follow to ensure that (the
FBI) gets access,'' said a congressional source.  ``Those are all code words
for if they can't break in, they're going to make (cryptography) illegal.
``This is one of the biggest domestic policy issues facing the country. If you
make the wrong decisions, it's going to have a profound effect on privacy and
security.''
	
   The matter is being considered by the House Judiciary Committee, chaired by
Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, who is writing a revision to the Computer Security
Act of 1987, the government's first pass at secure computing.
	
   The recent hearings on the matter produced a notable irony, when FBI
Director William Sessions was forced to justify his stance against cryptography
after giving opening remarks in which he called for stepped-up action to combat
a rising tide of industrial espionage. Secure cryptography was designed to
address such concerns.
	
   The emergence of the international marketplace is shaping much of the debate
on cryptography. American firms say they can't compete under current policy,
and that in fact, overseas firms are allowed to sell technology in America that
American firms cannot export.
	
    ``We have decided to do all further cryptographic development overseas,''
said Fred B. Cohen, a noted computer scientist.  ``This is because if we do it
here, it's against the law to export it, but if we do it there, we can still
import it and sell it here. What this seems to say is that they can have it,
but I can't sell it to them -- or in other words -- they get the money from our
research.''
	
   A spokeswoman for the the Software Publishers Association said that such
export controls will cost $3-$5 billion in direct revenue if left in place over
the next five years. She noted the Commerce Department estimate that each $1
billion in direct revenue supports 20,000 jobs.
	
   The NSA denied any role in limiting the power of cryptographic schemes used
by the domestic public, and said it approves 90 percent of cryptographic
products referred to NSA by the Department of State for export licenses. The
Commerce Department conducts its own reviews.  But the agency conceded that its
export approval figures refer only to products that use cryptology to
authenticate a communication -- the electronic form of a signed business
document -- rather than to provide privacy.
	
   The NSA, a Defense Department agency created by order of President Harry
Truman to intercept and decode foreign communications, employs an army of
40,000 code-breakers.  All of its work is done in secret, and it seldom
responds to questions about its activities, so a large reserve of distrust
exists in the technology community.
	
   NSA funding is drawn from the so-called ``black budget,'' which the Defense
Budget Project, a watchdog group, estimates at $16.3 billion for 1993.
	
   While the agency has always focused primarily on foreign espionage, its
massive eavesdropping operation often pulls in innocent Americans, according to
James Bamford, author of _The Puzzle Palace_, a book focusing on the NSA's
activities. Significant invasions of privacy occurred in the 1960s and 1970s,
Bamford said.
	
   Much more recently, several computer network managers have acknowledged
privately to the Chronicle that NSA has been given access to data transmitted
on their networks -- without the knowledge of network users who may view the
communications as private electronic mail.
	
   Electronic cryptology could block such interceptions of material circulating
on regional networks or on Internet -- the massive international computer link.
	
   While proponents of the new technology concede the need for effective law
enforcement, some question whether the espionage needs of the post-Cold War
world justify the government's push to limit these electronic safeguards on
privacy.
	
    ``The real challenge is to get the people who can show harm to our national
security by freeing up this technology to speak up and tell us what this harm
is,'' said John Gilmore, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems.  ``When the
privacy of millions of people who have cellular telephones, when the integrity
of our computer networks and our PCs against viruses are up for grabs here, I
think the battleground is going to be counting up the harm and in the public
policy debate trying to strike a balance.''
	
   But Vinton Cerf, one of the leading figures of the Internet community, urged
that those criticizing national policy maintain perspective.  ``I want to ask
you all to think a little bit before you totally damn parts of the United
States government,'' he said.  ``Before you decide that some of the policies
that in fact go against our grain and our natural desire for openness, before
you decide those are completely wrong and unacceptable, I hope you'll give a
little thought to the people who go out there and defend us in secret and do so
at great risk.''

  The following is the written response to my request for an interview with
the NSA. To the best of my knowledge, and according to their claims, it
is the government's first complete answer to the many questions and allegations
that have been made in regards to the matter of cryptography.
   I would like to invite reaction from any qualified readers who care to
address any of the issues raised herein. Please mail to edtjda@chron.com (713)

   NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY
   CENTRAL SECURITY SERVICE
   Serial: Q43-11-92 9

10 June 1992
Mr. Joe Abernathy
Houston Chronicle 
P.O. Box 4260
Houston, TX 77210

 Dear Mr. Abernathy:
	
   Thank you for your inquiry of 3 June 1992 on the subject of cryptography.
Attached please find answers to the questions that you provided our Agency. If
any further assistance is needed, please feel free to contact me or Mr. Jerry
Volker of my staff on (xxx) xxx-xxxx.
   
   Sincerely,

   MICHAEL S.CONN
   Chief, Information Policy

ENCL:

   1. Has the NSA ever imposed or attempted to impose a weakness on any
cryptographic code to see if it can thus be broken?
	
   One of NSA's missions is to provide the means for protecting U.S. government
and military communications and information systems related to national
security.  In fulfilling this mission we design cryptologic codes based on an
exhaustive evaluation process to ensure to the maximum extent possible that
information systems security products that we endorse are free from any
weaknesses. Were we to intentionally impose weaknesses on cryptologic codes for
use by the U.S. government, we would not be fulfilling our mission to provide
the means to protect sensitive U.S. government and military communications and
our professional integrity would be at risk.

   2. Has the NSA ever imposed or attempted to impose a weakness on the DES or
DSS?
	
   Regarding the Data Encryption Standard (DES), we believe that the public
record from the Senate Committee for Intelligence's investigation in 1978 into
NSA's role in the development of the DES is responsive to your question. That
committee report indicated that NSA did not tamper with the design of the
algorithm in any way and that the security afforded by the DES was more than
adequate for at least a 5-10 year time span for the unclassified data for which
it was intended. In short, NSA did not impose or attempt to impose any weakness
on the DES.
	
   Regarding the draft Digital Signature Standard (DSS), NSA never imposed any
weakness or attempted to impose any weakness on the DSS.

    3. Is the NSA aware of any weaknesses in the DES or the DSS? The RSA?
	
   We are unaware of any weaknesses in the DES or the DSS when properly
implemented and used for the purposes for which they both are designed.  We do
not comment on nongovernment systems.
	
   Regarding the alleged trapdoor in the DSS. We find the term trapdoor
somewhat misleading since it implies that the messages sent by the DSS are
encrypted and with access via a trapdoor one could somehow decrypt (read) the
message without the sender's knowledge.  The DSS does not encrypt any data. The
real issue is whether the DSS is susceptible to someone forging a signature and
therefore discrediting the entire system. We state categorically that the
chances of anyone - including NSA - forging a signature with the DSS when it is
properly used and implemented is infinitesimally small.
	
   Furthermore, the alleged trapdoor vulnerability is true for ANY public
key-based authentication system, including RSA. To imply somehow that this only
affects the DSS (a popular argument in the press) is totally misleading. The
issue is one of implementation and how one goes about selecting prime numbers.
We call your attention to a recent EUROCRYPT conference which had a panel
discussion on the issue of trapdoors in the DSS. Included on the panel was one
of the Bellcore researchers who initially raised the trapdoor allegation, and
our understanding is that the panel -- including the person from Bellcore --
concluded that the alleged trapdoor was not an issue for the DSS. Furthermore,
the general consensus appeared to be that the trapdoor issue was trivial and
had been overblown in the press.  However, to try to respond to the trapdoor
allegation, at NIST's request, we have designed a prime generation process
which will ensure that one can avoid selection of the relatively few weak
primes which could lead to weakness in using the DSS.  Additionally, NIST
intends to allow for larger modulus sizes up to 1024 which effectively negates
the need to even use the prime generation process to avoid weak primes. An
additional very important point that is often overlooked is that with the DSS
the primes are PUBLIC and therefore can be subject to public examination. Not
all public key systems provide for this same type of examination.
	
   The integrity of any information security system requires attention to
proper implementation. With the myriad of vulnerabilities possible given the
differences among users, NSA has traditionally insisted on centralized trusted
centers as a way to minimize risk to the system.  While we have designed
technical modifications to the DSS to meet NIST's requests for a more
decentralized approach, we still would emphasize that portion of the Federal
Register notice for the DSS which states: While it is the intent of this
standard to specify general security requirements for generating digital
signatures, conformance to this standard does not assure that a particular
implementation is secure. The responsible authority in each agency or
department shall assure that an overall implementation provides an acceptable
level of security. NIST will be working with government users to ensure
appropriate implementations.
	
   Finally, we have read all the arguments purporting insecurities with the
DSS, and we remain unconvinced of their validity. The DSS has been subjected to
intense evaluation within NSA which led to its being endorsed by our Director
of Information Systems Security for use in signing unclassified data processed
in certain intelligence systems and even for signing classified data in
selected systems. We believe that this approval speaks to the lack of any
credible attack on the integrity provided by the DSS given proper use and
implementation. Based on the technical and security requirements of the U.S.
government for digital signatures, we believe the DSS is the best choice. In
fact, the DSS is being used in a pilot project for the Defense Message System
to assure the authenticity of electronic messages of vital command and control
information.  This initial demonstration includes participation from the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, the military services, and Defense Agencies and is being done
in cooperation with NIST.

      4. Has the NSA ever taken advantage of any weaknesses in the DES or the
DSS?
	
   We are unaware of any weaknesses in the DSS or in the DES when properly
implemented and used for the purposes for which they both are designed.

 5. Did the NSA play a role in designing the DSS? Why, in the NSA's analysis,
was it seen as desirable to create the DSS when the apparently more robust RSA
already stood as a de facto standard?
	
   Under the Computer Security Act of 1987, NIST is to draw upon computer
systems technical security guidelines of NSA where appropriate and to
coordinate closely with other agencies, including NSA, to assure:
	
   a. maximum use of all existing and planned programs, materials, and reports
relating to computer systems security and privacy, in order to avoid
unnecessary and costly duplication of effort; and
	
   b. that standards developed by NIST are consistent and compatible with
standards and procedures developed for the protection of classified systems.
	
   Consistent with that law and based on a subsequent Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) between NSA and NIST, NSA's role is to be responsive to
NIST's requests for assistance in developing, evaluating, or researching
cryptographic algorithms and techniques. (See note at end). In 19??, NIST
requested that NSA evaluate candidate algorithms proposed by NIST for a digital
signature standard and that NSA provide new algorithms when existing algorithms
did not meet U.S. government requirements. In the two-year process of
developing a digital signature for U.S. government use, NIST and NSA examined
various publicly-known algorithms and their variants, including RSA. A number
of techniques were deemed to provide appropriate protection for Federal
systems. The one selected by NIST as the draft Digital Signature Standard was
determined to be the most suitable for reasons that were set forth in the
Federal Register announcement. One such reason was to avoid issuance of a DSS
that would result in users outside the government having to pay royalties. Even
though the DSS is targeted for government use, eliminating potential barriers
for commercial applications is useful to achieve economies of scale.
Additionally, there are features of the DSS which make it more attractive for
Federal systems that need to have a digital signature capability for large
numbers of users. Chief among them are the number of trusted operation points
and system management overhead that are minimized with the NIST proposed
technique.

 6. What national interests are served by limiting the power of cryptographic
schemes used by the public?
	
   We call your attention to the House Judiciary committee hearing of 29 April
1992. The Director of the FBI expressed his concerns that law enforcement
interests in meeting responsibilities given to them by Congress could be
affected unless they had access to communications, as was given to them by
statute in 1968 (court monitored, court sponsored, court reviewed and subject
to Congressional oversight).
	
   The National Security Agency has no role in limiting the power of
cryptographic schemes used by the public within the U.S. We have always been in
favor of the use of information security technologies by U.S. businesses to
protect their proprietary information, and when we had an information security
role with private industry (prior to the Computer Security Act of 1987), we
actively advocated use of such technologies.

    7. What national interests are served by limiting the export of
cryptographic technology?
	
   Cryptographic technology is deemed vital to national security interests.
This includes economic, military, and foreign policy interests.
	
   We do not agree with the implications from the House Judiciary Committee
hearing of 7 May 1992 and recent news articles that allege that U.S. export
laws prevent U.S. firms' manufacture and use of top encryption equipment. We
are unaware of any case where a U.S. firm has been prevented from manufacturing
and using encryption equipment within this country or for use by the U.S. firm
or its subsidiaries in locations outside the U.S. because of U.S. export
restrictions.  In fact, NSA has always supported the use of encryption by U.S.
businesses operating domestically and overseas to protect sensitive
information.
	
   For export to foreign countries, NSA as a component of the Department of
Defense (along with the Department of State and the Department of Commerce)
reviews export licenses for information security technologies controlled by the
Export Administration Regulations or the international Traffic in Arms
Regulations. Similar export control systems are in effect in all the
Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) countries as
well as many non-CoCom countries as these technologies are universally
considered as sensitive. Such technologies are not banned from export and are
reviewed on a case-by-case basis. As part of the export review process,
licenses may be required for these systems and are reviewed to determine the
effect such export could have on national security interests - including
economic, military, and political security interests. Export licenses are
approved or denied based upon the type of equipment involved, the proposed
end-use and the end-user.
	
   Our analysis indicates that the U.S. leads the world in the manufacture and
export of information security technologies. Of those cryptologic products
referred to NSA by the Department of State for export licenses, we consistently
approve over 90%. Export licenses for information security products under the
jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce are processed and approved without
referral to NSA or DoD. This includes products using such techniques as the DSS
and RSA which provide authentication and access control to computers or
networks. In fact, in the past NSA has played a major role in successfully
advocating the relaxation of export controls on RSA and related technologies
for authentication purposes. Such techniques are extremely valuable against the
hacker problem and unauthorized use of resources.

      8. What national interests are at risk, if any, if secure cryptography is
widely available?
	
   Secure cryptography widely available outside the United States clearly has
an impact on national security interests including economic, military, and
political.
	
   Secure cryptography within the United States may impact law enforcement
interests.

    9. What does the NSA see as its legitimate interests in the area of
cryptography?  Public cryptography?
	
   Clearly one of our interests is to protect U.S. government and military
communications and information systems related to national security. As part of
that mission, we stay abreast of activities in public cryptography.

   10. How did NSA enter into negotiations with the Software Publishers
Association regarding the export of products utilizing cryptographic
techniques? How was this group chosen, and to what purpose? What statute or
elected representative authorized the NSA to engage in the discussions?
	
   The Software Publishers Association (SPA) went to the National Security
Advisor to the President to seek help from the Administration to bring
predictability, clarity, and speed to the process for exporting mass market
software with encryption. The National Security Advisor directed NSA to work
with the mass market software representatives on their request.

 ii. What is the status of these negotiations?
	
   These negotiations are ongoing.

 12. What is the status of export controls on products using cryptographic
techniques? How would you respond to those who point to the fact that the
export of RSA from the U.S. is controlled, but that its import into the U.S. is
not?
	
   To the best of our knowledge, most countries who manufacture cryptographic
products regulate the export of such products from their countries by
procedures similar to those existing within the U.S. Some even control the
import into their countries. The U.S. complies with the guidelines established
by CoCom for these products.
	
   Regarding the export of RSA from the U.S., we are unaware of any
restrictions that have been placed on the export of RSA for authentication
purposes.

13. What issues would you like to discuss that I have not addressed?
	
   None.

 14. What question or questions would you like to pose of your critics?
	
   None.

 NOTE: To clarify misunderstandings regarding this Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU); this MOU does not provide NSA any veto power over NIST proposals.  As
was discussed publicly in 1989, the MOU provides that if there is an issue that
can not be resolved between the two agencies, then such an issue may be
referred to the President for resolution. Enclosed please find a copy of
subject MOU which has been made freely available in the past by both NSA and
NIST to all requestors. At the House Judiciary Committee hearings on 7 May
1992, the Director of NIST responded that he had never referred an issue to the
White House since his assumption of Directorship in 1990.

remains abreast of emerging technologies and issues effecting automated
information system security in computer-based systems.
	
   5. Establish a Technical Working Group to review and analyze issues of
mutual interest pertinent to protection of systems that process sensitive or
other unclassified-information.  The Group shall be composed of six Federal
employees, three each selected by NIST and NSA and to be augmented as necessary
by representatives of other agencies. Issues may be referred to the group by
either the NSA Deputy Director for Information Security or the NIST Deputy
Director or may be generated -and addressed by the group upon approval by the
NSA DDI or NIST Deputy Director.  Within days of the referral of an issue to
the Group by either the NSA Deputy Director for Information Security or the
NIST Deputy Director, the Group will respond with a progress report and plan
for further analysis, if any.
	
   6. Exchange work plans on an annual basis on all research and development
projects pertinent to protection of systems that process sensitive or other
unclassified information, including trusted technology, technology for
protecting the integrity and availability of data, telecommunications security
and personal identification methods. Project updates will be exchanged
quarterly, and project reviews will be provided by either party upon request of
the other party.
	
   7. Ensure the Technical Working Group reviews prior to public disclosure all
matters regarding technical-systems security techniques to be developed for use
in protecting sensitive information in Federal computer systems to ensure they
are consistent with the national security of the United States. If NIST and NSA
are unable to resolve such an issue within 60 days, either agency may elect to
raise the issue to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Commerce.  It
is recognized that such an issue may be referred to the President through the
NSC for resolution. No action shall be taken on such an issue until it is
resolved.
	
   8. Specify additional operational agreements in annexes to this MOU as they.
are agreed to by NSA and NIST.
	
   IV. Either party may elect to terminate this MOU upon six months written
notice. This MOU is effective upon approval of both signatories.

Oakland station KTVU news reported that a Richmond refinery's emergency
notification system was sabotaged by a disgruntled ex-employee, and the damage
wasn't discovered until a leak caused the refinery officials to attempt to use
it.  Unfortunately, I didn't catch any names, but the gist of the story is that
this refinery has a system in place which automatically dials nearby residents
when accidents occur and informs them of emergency procedures that should be
followed.  Specifically, a recent leak caused them to activate the system in an
attempt to warn residents to remain indoors for the duration.  However, the
system failed to operate.  A subsequent investigation discovered that a former
programmer who had been fired had sabotaged the system in revenge prior to
leaving.

Authorities are reportedly planning on filing charges against the former
employee once they figure out what charges are appropriate.

"Reckless endangerment" springs to mind.  Hope they nail the guy to the
wall.
				Jim

   [An item by Erin Hallissy in the San Francisco Chronicle, 2 July 1992,
   p.A19 had some details.  The emergency alert network is run by the Community
   Alert Network.  An EX-employee of their New York office (who has confessed
   to the malicious hacking) modified software ("reconfigured some things that
   caused it to crash") in their computer systems in both New York and San
   Jose.  In this case, the incident occurred at the Chevron refinery.  The
   network had been used four times previously (since last October) in Contra
   Costa County, twice for incidents at Chevron, once at Pacific Refinery in
   Hercules, and once for a fire at Rhone-Poulenc in Martinez.  As a sidelight,
   the previously fired perpetrator broke into the NY office two days after the
   latest Chevron emergency, "maybe just to gloat".  The system was down for 
   10 hours, during which time the only emergency was the one at Chevron.
   [Note that the system cannot call unlisted numbers or numbers listed without
   street addresses.  PGN]

Among the advertisements in this Sunday's (28 June) Philadelphia Inquirer, and
probably most every other newspaper in the United States, was an announcement
for the NutraSweet Summer Sweepstakes.  It works as follows: call the free 800
number they provide, then punch in your phone number and the UPC code from any
product containing NutraSweet, a sugar substitute.  You are immediately told
whether you won one of a few thousand prizes ranging from a tote bag to ten
thousand dollars.  In the fine print, it says that the sweepstakes will end
after two million calls are received, or at a certain date in July, whichever
comes first.  It also says that the odds of winning depend on the number of
calls received.

First point: the odds seems odd to me.  Unlike a paper sweepstakes, where all
the entries are received before the prizes are drawn, in this sweepstakes the
winners are chosen immediately.  The random selection process must have fixed
odds built-in, probably based on a projection of exactly two million calls.
Even if they have to cut off the contest before two million calls are received,
the odds for a particular call would still be the same, and some fraction of
the prizes would not be awarded.

Second point: the drawbacks of a sweepstakes where the entries are free data
calls are obvious.  People with access to smart modems or autodialing machinery
and the ability to program them have a significant advantage over those
without.  Many telephones nowadays have programmable dialers built in, but
they're usually not as useful as the following command string for a
Hayes-compatible modem:

	ATDT 18002351000,,,,,,1,&lt;your phone number&gt;,2100012868

I used this command to enter the sweepstakes approximately 40 times while
eating a carrot cake.  When I heard the "you lose" message over the modem's
speaker, I hung up and used the repeat command "A/" to call again.  It took
about 30 seconds per call.  I imagine more dedicated redialers than myself have
already made thousands of calls since the official opening of the contest at
3:01 AM.
 
By the way, after you enter the UPC code (21000 12868 in this example), the
system takes about 6 seconds and then mentions the product by name.  I was
surprised that it took even that long.

Third point: the Official Rules are NOT included in the advertisement.  (I'm a
bit surprised that that's legal.)  You have to send a stamped, self-addressed
envelope to get them.  I'd bet a phenylalanine tote bag that less than 1% of
the entrants will actually request and read the rules, though the phone message
exhorts you to be familiar with them.  Assuming a very optimistic one week
turnaround time to get the rules, you could miss a substantial portion of the
contest by waiting for them.  If the rules explicitly forbid machine-assisted
entries, how will they enforce this?  Will they disqualify people for using the
autodialers built into their phones?

Fourth point: what are they going to do when they know the phone numbers and
something of the eating habits of hundreds of thousands of Americans?  I can't
believe they don't have some use in mind for the information.  If you enter a
false phone number at this point, it may disqualify you for a prize, and they
can get your real number from billing records anyway.  From the phone number,
name and address are a simple database lookup.

By the way, I never eat NutraSweet if I can help it.  I don't like the taste.

In the current (6/92) BYTE, Jerry Pournelle discusses his difficulties with
using the word-count feature in Microsoft Word For Windows.

     ...when I would read in the file, Word For Windows told
     me there were 767,356 characters and 135,000 words; the
     word count was in gray, indicating that it was an
     estimate...clicking on [the 'update' button] caused the
     program to trundle for a while and then proudly
     announce a total of 60,273; which, of course was
     absurd...I've since learned, though, that all I needed
     to do was add 65,535 to the total shown...

Sounds like one of the wizards at Microsoft determined that an int rather than
a longint was plenty big for the kind of documents people would be editing.

&gt;From the "Cambridge Evening News", June 30 1992:

[HEADLINE] Students cheated BT to win phone contest

Two students swindled BT [British Telecom] out of 68,000 pounds [sterling] in a
"lucrative scam" to constantly win on a telephone quiz game, a court heard. The
two men hired four phone lines between them under false names and left the
receivers off the hook for hours on end at a Cambridge flat to win thousands of
pounds.

On one occasion, said a BT official outside court, a receiver was left off the
hook for almost 24 hours. Eight or nine hours was the average, with peak rate
calls at 48 pence a minute.

&gt;From his winnings, Shaun Middleton bought an XR3i high-performance car and a
computer, while his confederate, Tristan Abbott-Coates, also bought a computer.
The pair were "determined to beat the system", Cambridge Crown Court heard, and
hatched a scheme to constantly win on the "Wheel of Fortune" game advertised in
the national press. The game has a 10,000 pound jackpot.

The pair rang the contest phone number, which was monitored by a computer. When
the computer asked them questions, they made no response - and the computer was
programmed to interpret silences as "no" answers.

The correct "no" answers accumulated into winning cash combinations.

A copy of the original advert, printed in The Sun newspaper, was presented as
evidence. Judge Frederick Beezley asked if it was page three. [Page 3 of The
Sun carries pin-up photographs.] When told it was not, he quipped, "Oh well,
never mind, I'll suppose I'll look at it anyway."

Middleton, 22, of St George's Road, Preston, admitted three charges of
obtaining services by deception. He won a total of 10,709 pounds but ran up an
unpaid BT bill of 51,469 pounds. Abbott-Coates, 24, of the same address,
admitted one charge of obtaining services by deception. He won a total of 2,672
pounds - but ran up an unpaid bill of 16,601 pounds.

The offences were committed while the two men each rented a room in Marshall
Street, Cambridge, between March and September last year. They moved to Preston
together to attend the polytechnic there.

Francis Sheridan, prosecuting, said that Abbott-Coates first recognised the
loophole in the telephone quiz, but Middleton was the most active in the
swindle. He said the pair used false names to hire the lines "to avoid being
cut off and thus ending a lucrative scam". Abbott-Coates chose the alias Murphy
after an actor who played a famous screen policeman.

Eventually, BT became suspicious and traced the pair to Preston. Both men were
then arressted. Sentencing was adjourned until July 24 so that social enquiry
reports could be made. Judge Beezley said he was considering a custodial
sentence, and remanded both men in custody.

COMPUTER-LITERATE CHILDREN FIND PORN AVAILABLE ON THEIR SCREENS AT HOME
By James Michels, Scripps Howard News Service

  Connie Lewis recently discovered one of the unpleasant shocks of patenting: 
pornographic pictures her 15-year-old son had collected.
  What surprised her more was where she found them: on the screen of the 
family's home computer.
  Her son had gotten them free from a local computer bulletin board. 
[..Deleted..]
  The pornographic pictures could have been posted on the computer bulletin
board by anyone. Lewis' son had learned about them from a friend.
  The pictures were in an area of the board restricted to adults, but all the
15-tear-old had to do to get access was to type in false information about
his name and age. He instantly gained access to dozens of pornographic
pictures.
[..Deleted..]
  The technology of putting pornographic pictures on computers and 
distributing them by telephone is so new it is unregulated.
  Public officials say current laws don't appear to apply to the bulletin 
boards. Indiana Bell can block access to sexually explicit 900 numbers, but 
not to local numbers, such as those used by the boards.
  The Federal Communication Commission, which regulates telephone lines, said
the issue does not come under its jurisdiction.
  The FBI is investigating a case in which a national computer board was
used to pass along child pornography.
[..Deleted..]
  So What's a responsible system operator to do?
  He can threaten to close his board to those who misuse it, but that is 
often a hollow threat.
  "You have a apparently strong warning that you can be banned and so on
if you mislead the system operator," said Michael Banks, a Cincinnati 
computer writer familiar with bulletin boards
  "The threat of being banned permanently is meaningless. If someone wants 
to get back on, they do it with a different name."

    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Even though this is a sensationalistic article designed to invoke a shock
response in 'decent americans' (a risk in and of itself) there are several good
points.  If it is deemed a crime to distribute, electronically, pornographic
images to minors then what sort of validation is enough? Who is actually
responsible?  Can the owner of the bulletin board be charged? Should the
original poster be charged? In this day and age of store-and-forward worldwide
networks how are legal boundaries handled? Is the system operator responsible
for all the data stored on his machine?

Banks face challenge over teller machines
 
Reproduced without permission from the Financial Times Weekend June 27/June 28
1992 edition.
 
Banks and building societies face their most serious legal challenge from
customers over cash dispensing automated teller machines (ATMs), writes Barbara
Ellis.
 
This is in spite of words of comfort from the Building Society Ombudsmen this
week.  They welcomed the new (pounds) 50 limit introduced by the Code of
Banking Practice, on losses from unauthorised use of machines unless the bank
can prove fraud or gross negligence.
 
Some 400 customers assembled into an action group by J. Keith Park, solicitors,
of St Helens, Merseyside, are to seek a High Court ruling, within the next two
to three weeks, that banks and building societies operating teller machines are
in breach of contract beacuse the machines are suseptible to error and fraud.
 
Each of the 400 will make detailed claims for losses through alleged
unauthorised withdrawals ranging from (pounds) 90 to (pounds) 13,000 and
totalling close to (pounds) 500,000.  All the claims have been rejected by
banks and building societies.
 
For example, Barclays stated this week that out of its 15 million machine
transactions each month, fewer than one in every 250,000 is disputed - which
would imply 60 disputes a month.  Dennis Whalley , of J.Keith Park, says he has
deduced, from ATM dispute cases that disputes have been running close to 9,000
a month.
 
Barclays says there is no correlation between the volume of teller machine
disputes and the reference numbers which relate to computer files. (Strange I
haven't seen a computer program yet that didn't start counting at one with
increments of one!)
 
For years banks and building societies have insisted that the ATM systems are
completely secure and that money can only be withdrawn with the use of a card
and personal identification number (PIN) [sic].
 
The obudsmen have almost inveriably backed the insitutions in rejecting claims
from customers who detected "phantom" unauthorised withdrawals, saying that
they must have unwittingly lost their cards, disclosed their PIN or been a
victim of a dishonest family member.
 
However, the 1989 Jack report on banking acknowledged that the PIN system was
open to fraud and last year an engineer employed by the Clydesdale Bank
confessed to removing (pounds) 17,000 from customers' accounts by arranging
phantom withdrawals using a hand-held computer.

PRESS RELEASE, June 30, 1992
CPSR Challenges Virginia SSN Practice

WASHINGTON, DC -- A national public interest organization has filed a "friend
of the court" brief in the federal court of appeals, calling into question the
Commonwealth of Virginia's practice of requiring citizens to provide their
Social Security numbers in order to vote.  Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility (CPSR) alleges that Virginia is violating constitutional rights
and creating an unnecessary privacy risk.

	The case arose when a Virginia resident refused to provide his Social
Security number (SSN) to a county registrar and was denied the right to
register to vote.  Virginia is one of a handful of states that require voters
to provide an SSN as a condition of registration.  While most states that
require the number impose some restrictions on its public dissemination,
Virginia allows unrestricted public inspection of voter registration data --
including the SSN.  Marc A. Greidinger, the plaintiff in the federal lawsuit,
believes that the state's registration requirements violate his privacy and
impose an unconstitutional burden on his exercise of the right to vote.

	The CPSR brief, filed in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in
Richmond, supports the claims made by Mr. Greidinger.  CPSR notes the
long-standing concern of the computing community to design safe information
systems, and the particular effort of Congress to control the misuse of the
SSN.  The organization cites federal statistics showing that the widespread use
of SSNs has led to a proliferation of fraud by criminals using the numbers to
gain driver's licenses, credit and federal benefits.  The CPSR brief further
describes current efforts in other countries to control the misuse of national
identifiers, like the Social Security number.

	Marc Rotenberg, the Director of the CPSR Washington Office said that
"This is a privacy issue of constitutional dimension.  The SSN requirement is
not unlike the poll taxes that were struck down as unconstitutional in the
1960s.  Instead of demanding the payment of money, Virginia is requiring
citizens to relinquish their privacy rights before being allowed in the voting
booth."

	CPSR argues in its brief that the privacy risk created by Virginia's
collection and disclosure of Social Security numbers is unnecessary.  The

largest states in the nation, such as California, New York and Texas, do not
require SSNs for voter registration.  CPSR points out that California, with 14
million registered voters, does not need to use the SSN to administer its
registration system, while Virginia, with less than 3 million voters, insists
on its need to demand the number.

	David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, said "Federal courts have generally
recognized that there is a substantial privacy interest involved when Social
Security numbers are disclosed.  We are optimistic that the court of appeals
will require the state to develop a safer method of maintaining voting
records."

	CPSR has led a national campaign to control the misuse of the Social
Security Number.  Earlier this year the organization testified at a hearing in
Congress on the use of the SSN as a National Identifier.  CPSR urged lawmakers
to respect the restriction on the SSN and to restrict its use in the private
sector.  The group also participated in a federal court challenge to the
Internal Revenue Service's practice of displaying taxpayers' SSNs on mailing
labels.  CPSR is also undertaking a campaign to advise individuals not to
disclose their Social Security numbers unless provided with the legal reason
for the request.

	CPSR is a national membership organization, with 2,500 members, based
in Palo Alto, CA.  For membership information contact CPSR, P.O. Box 717, Palo
Alto, CA 94303, (415) 322-3778, cpsr@csli.  stanford.edu.

While I concur with Davis' criticism of the anthromorphic attribution of the
mistake to the Endeavour's computer, I cannot accept the assumptions about
responsibility that seem to stand behind this criticism.

He seems to assume that whenever something goes wrong, some human did wrong.
This is clearly too strong.  Most technological causation works through groups
(teams, firms).  But even the weaker assumption that all wrong is attributable
to humans -- let me call it Complete Human Responsibility, or CHR -- is
problematic.

My point is that CHR is not obviously true.  It is trivial to note that some
bad events *just happen*.  I do not see why this is not the case with artifacts
as well.  People are not naturally responsible for everything that happens,
just because people made the object(s) involved.  I suggest that we see CHR as
a value or standard, not a report of a fact about the world.  But then CHR
needs to be argued for.

The risk?  Taking a (controversial) matter of principle to be a simple fact.

An interesting little story from AIRLINE PILOT, May 1992 issue ("No
Brakes, No Reversers!", by Joseph J. Poset, USAir).

It deals with a Fokker F.100 which landed at Chicago O'Hare, on November 21,
1991, with thrust reversers and brakes inoperative.  The F.100 is a
higher-capacity, fundamentally redesigned version of the Dutch company's
popular F.28.  It is a twin-engine, T-tailed "commuter" jet, in the 100-120
seat capacity.  It was certified in November 1987.  It has a "glass cockpit,"
but is *not* an FBW airplane, at least as far as flight control is concerned.

Essentially: the flight landed on Chicago's Runway 22L.  Upon landing, the crew
discovered their brakes and thrust reversers weren't working.  They took the
high-speed turnoff (a taxiway oriented about 30 degrees off the runway), shut
down one engine, zipped down the parallel taxiway, turned left at the end of it
(90-degree U-turn), went back up Runway 4R (reciprocal runway of the one they
landed on), took the *opposite* high-speed taxiway, and headed onto Runway 27,
which an American Airlines jet had just taken off from. Twice, the captain
thought he would have had to turn off the pavement into the rough, to avoid a
collision.

After they finally came to a stop on Runway 27, the crew noticed that their
flight computers thought they were still in the air.  The stickshaker (stall
warning) was also activated, and the "speed limit" flag on their flight display
(indicating excursion outside the approved flight envelope) was on.

After some investigation, it was discovered that both Air/Ground switches
(located on the landing gear) were each "stuck," thus relaying improper data to
the computers and devices which controlled the stickshaker, various
annunciators, reversers, and ground braking.  It was only after maintenance
applied glycol that the computers indicated the proper modes.

Now, there's nothing new about the use of Air/Ground switches--they're used,
for instance, to prevent the inadvertent application of reverse thrust in
flight, for most airliners.  They're also used to deactivate stall-warning
systems on the ground.  But this is a pretty widespread set of high-level
services that were affected by the switches being out of whack.  I don't
believe, for instance, that the A/G switch is used to establish whether wheel
braking is available, on most airliners. It also has interesting ramifications
to FBW aircraft, which might use an independent "ground control" mode to
determine how everything from nosewheel steering to rudder control to wheel
brakes work.  In this case, if the airplane did not have nosewheel steering
(for instance, if the design was highly compartmentalized into "ground"
services and "air" services), it may have gone off the high-speed taxiway, into
the rough, and ended up on yet another runway.  This could have been a major
accident...

There is a "flight-test" article on the F.100 in the January 30, 1998, issue of
FLIGHT INTERNATIONAL, by Harry Hopkins ("Fokker 100: protect by wire.").  It's
interesting reading.

More info on the Fokker incident.  Note that it wasn't based on an ASRS report;
I had confused it with another article.  R.

&gt;I hate to say it, but I find that incident pretty unbelieveable.
&gt;Firstly, I can't imagine that, if the Fokker had enough momentum to
&gt;need to come back on runway 4, that it wouldn't have groundlooped
&gt;around the 180 (90?) degree turn. 

The article said they had a 25G38 kt headwind on roll-out.   Around
40-50 kt at the first high-speed exit.  But then again, if they hadn't 
stopped by the loop back up RWY 4, that headwind would have become a 
TAILWIND...  The article indicates they started *accelerating* up RWY 4.  
They entered the other high-speed exit at 20-30 knots.

&gt;Also, F100's like F28's, don't
&gt;*have* thrust reversers, so the continual reference to them worries me. 

It was penned by the captain, based upon his ASRS report.  He was much
more inexperienced than his F/O, but surely not that much! :-) 

&gt;Are you sure of the veracity of the publication? 

Absolutely not.  It's garbage.  But the occasional article catches my interest.

&gt;It wasn't dated April 1 or something?

No.  I went to the FLIGHT article cited, looking for more information.
Generally, it played up Fokker's in-flight protections; it's quite interesting.
Little on systems.

On the last page: "Final roll-out to a standstill was made without reverse 
thrust, and with late minimum braking for test purposes.  Rudder and pedal 
steering completed a halt within 2ft of the centerline.  Reverse was 
restricted temporarily to idle anyway, because full reverse efflux can 
impinge on the tailplane, and a modification will set a gap between
the two target doors to spill some flow centrally.  The F.28 is not fitted
with reversers.  

"Reverse opeation is shown by a green 'R' at the top of the primary engine
instrument display, but I did not find it compelling.  A brighter panel, 
nearer to peripheral vision, would be easier to take in."

Perhaps reversers were INOP on early models, or are optional equipment.  I
don't imagine there's a compelling need for them on the lighter configurations,
but this is probably a regulatory issue.

A Swissair pilot reported to me another incident he had with a F100 just a few
days ago: they had no flaps for landing.

The computer controls if flaps on both wings are extending together, and if
not, it blocks to avoid an asymetrical configuration.

The flaps were moving correctly, but the computer had a false indication and
did not permit to extend them.

The aircraft landed without problem at 160 KTS instead of 130.  The passengers
didn't even remark an abnormality.

I'd be interested in comments on its accuracy.

I won't comment on the larger issues of the "if it moves, shoot it" mentality.
But as a systems designer I can understand the compromises made to meet the
specs, but two small points stick in my mind.

One is the image of a technician madly scanning through a dog-eared issue of
the OAG (the article didn't mention a brand name) to find the Iranian flight.
It's hard enough to not miss an entry when in a quiet airport in a single time
zone.  I realize that tracking civilian flights was not part of the normal
battle plan, but I presume that the system has still not been updated to link
to the civilian airline reservation systems or other such sources of
information.  One change in warfare, which I think the Gulf War illustrated, is
how the commercial technology has, in many ways, surpassed the military.  Of
course, the online airline info might not be accurate which means a delayed
flight could still have been missed.

The other is that the tagging of the plane as an F-14 provided for no level 
of ambiguity.  Even in the heat of battle, can the system cope with multiple 
interpretations of data or does it mindless lock in on a worst case and then 
present it to the befuddled user as fact?

Of course, dealing with ambiguous information from many sources is a very 
difficult problem and, as this incident illustrates, neither the system nor 
the users are up to task.  Conversely, what good is SDI if the incoming 
missiles all follow commercial airline schedules?

   [The article was based on a new report produced jointly by Newsweek and  
   the ABC "Nightline" (and scheduled to be broadcast on ABC on 1 July).  The
   report challenges the official U.S. account, claiming that U.S. forces had
   "provoked the episode".  It also cites Admiral Crowe as confirming that the
   Vincennes was in Iranian waters at the time.  The Pentagon replied that 
   that was true, but only in self-defense.  Source: NYTimes, 2 July 1992.

     For those of you who don't remember the technological aspects of the 
     Aegis system, see my item recounting a discussion with Matt Jaffe in

   [I just returned from Paris, where I read the following article in the
   "European" newspaper. Hmm...]

PIN Money for Thieves"
 
Italian thieves have managed to pull off the world's most ingenious cash card
fraud. A perfect replica of a bank cash dispenser was glued on top of the real
thing and swallowed cards inserted by unsuspecting customers when they tried to
withdraw money.
 
Police say that the thieves collected 104 cards before staff at the bank, in
Busto Arsizio, near Milan, were alerted.
 
Normally a stolen bank card is useless without the owner's Personal
Identification Number. But the thieves programmed their fake machine to request
the customers' PIN numbers before telling them the card had been accidentally
demagnetized and was being retained.
 
After collecting the cards, the thieves then spent the night withdrawing money
from genuine cash dispensers.
 
A police spokesman said: "The thieves have been having a spree, withdrawing
money with the credit cards and the right PIN numbers. They were obviously
electronics experts."

My mother-in-law is a sales clerk at a Sears store in Everett Washington.  I
saw 25 new CompuAdd point-of-sale terminals in the back room.  They're super
techie, with a small CRT, ASCII keyboard, fancy strip printer, and mag card
stripe reader.  They were supposed to be installed months ago, but apparently
they have a dose of the Michaelangelo virus.

"Michaelangelo?  On a terminal?  Are you sure?" I asked.  Needless to say,
the answer was not too specific.  She said it might also have been on a PC
that configures the terminals, rather than the terminals themselves.  Doesn't
Michaelangelo only strike on one day of the year?  All she knew was that they
were "full of viruses" and could not be installed.

Sears has its share of troubles these days, and apparently it is running so
lean and mean that there is no one in the store with enough computer smarts
to get things cleared up in the intervening months.  So there they sit,
depreciating.  But they'll *sell* you a computer...If you dare...bwah ha ha!

And you thought people who knew what viruses are were scared...

The Data Protection &amp; Data Security Task Force of the German Gesellschaft fuer
Informatik (GI) has again published a "Statement of Observations" concerning
the IT Security Evaluation initiative driven by the Commission of the European
Communities.

This time the statement had to be made on the Information Technology
Security Evaluation Manual (ITSEM) in its current Version 0.2.
The ITSEM shall give help to evaluators and sponsors working with 
Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria (ITSEC) and
therefore are related quite closely to them. The current version 1.2
of ITSEC was subject of the last "Statement of Observations" the 
GI Task Force published in February 1992.
Discussion of Criticism on ITSEM shall take place in Brussels
(Belgium) from September 8th to September 10th 1992.

Observations, criticism and proposals on ITSEM V0.2 concentrate on the
following issues:

(1)	Lack of Correction of ITSEC problems
(2)	ITSEC needs much deeper and therefore more improvements than 
	admitted in chapter 1.5.
(3)	Who oversees the Certification Bodies?
(4)	Several Classes of potential attackers are not covered.
(5)	Threats can not be enumerated and must be specified the other
	way round.
(6)	The discrimination between strength of mechanisms in only 3 classes
	(basic, medium or high) is very poor and not adequate.
(7)	Requirements for Tools and Techniques are missing.

The full statement is posted to alt.security, comp.security.misc and 
probably comp.society.privacy.

WORLD'S FIRST VOTING BY PHONE: JUNE 20 IN NOVA SCOTIA

After an initial failure on June 6, the Liberal Party of Nova Scotia held a
primary June 20 to elect its next leader: 94% of the 7416 delegates voted, all
with touch-tone phones. Typical turnout for Canadian elections is 60-70%.

The Liberals were issued Personal Identification Numbers by mail.  For each of
2 ballots, voters called one of five 900 numbers corresponding to their choice
of leader, and then keyed in their "PIN number". The computer then checked
their number off so they couldn't vote again. John Savage won on the second
ballot with almost 53% of the vote.

The service was provided by Maritime Telephone &amp; Telegraph and cost each voter
50 cents. The eight-digit PIN numbers enabled one to vote from any billable
touch-tone phone: if you did't have touch- tone, you'd borrow your neighbor's.
Absentee voting was as simple as picking up the phone, wherever you were.

With this success, the Canadian government is considering a national referendum
by phone on the results of their Constitutional Convention, within 6 months.

The Federal Voter Assistance Program of the Pentagon is now considering voting
by phone for servicemen, who had voting by fax from the Persian Gulf. But a
$300 fax machine is overkill when a $10 touch-tone phone will do.  The Program
called the Voting by Phone Foundation of Boulder for their initial information.

The Voting by Phone Foundation is now in a petition drive to put a charter
amendment on November's Boulder City ballot. If passed Boulder would become the
first city in the U.S. to offer the option of phone voting. Please call [Evan
at] (303)444-3596 to help.

The Foundation is holding a demonstration of voting by phone from now until the
November 3rd election. Anyone may call (303)444-3596, 24 hours a day. If you
are registered to vote in Boulder, you will be asked to enter your last name
and birth date for identification.  This limits you to one vote, although not
as effectively as the random PIN number to be used for real elections. A
different question will be asked every 2 weeks, and presidential [... rest

When Cryptography is Outlawed, Only Outlaws Will Have Cryptography

The really difficult-to-understand part about the Federal Government's
recent assault on cryptographic privacy is how the Feds think they'll keep
cryptography out of the hands of criminals and Evil Foreign Governments.

Now that the Feds have admitted that they have trouble decoding encrypted
messages, any criminal or Evil Spy with a brain will be rushing to purchase
the equipment.  Criminals are hardly worried about breaking any law that
says they can't keep their deeds a secret, and smuggling the technology into
the country will hardly pose a problem to a reasonably proficient Drug Lord.

Perhaps what the Feds are looking for is a new weapon of prosecution; use of
cryptography is by definition a felony, and widespread use of cryptography
is then by definition racketeering as defined by RICO.  It's like bagging
Capone for tax evasion, when he was too slippery to be caught breaking the
law.  I find this sloppiness unacceptable as a taxpayer.

It's just like illegal weapons.  The crooks have the Uzis and MAC-10s, and
the cops have .38s.  And the streets are nevertheless protected.  I see a
future where the world class criminals profit from breaking our insecure-by-
legal-decree comm systems, preying on us law abiding citizens, while carrying
out their business in unlawful security.

Why can't the spies get wise?  Technology is not static.  If the phone becomes
secure, there must be improvements in bugging or some other spook-versus-crook
technology that could replace this information gathering avenue.

How typical of our freedom-loving government to make keeping a secret felonious.

   [By the way, see the July issue of the CACM, which contains material some of
   which has appeared earlier in RISKS, plus a piece by John Perry Barlow and a
   a response to letters from Rivest, Hellman, and Anderson from John Lyons of

That same 15-year-old can see some pretty steamy R-rated movies on his
family's cable TV movie channels, or over at his friends.  He can
trade videotapes.  Many mainstream magazines, such as Vogue, purchasable
over the counter by anyone, contain photographs of partially nude women.

It would be tragic if heavy legal restrictions placed on "computer porn", when
it is so difficult to police users' actions and impossible to monitor all
activity on any moderately large BBS in any case, and when "pornography" is so
readily available to everyone through so many other channels, for many of which
no attempt is made to validate the recipient's age at all.

With the ongoing fusion of communications technologies such as computers,
telephones and television, the restrictions' boundaries would broaden to
encompass more and more of the technologies available to us to communicate
with.  Further, since the technology for copying and forwarding images (video,
PC, etc) is so pervasive, enforcement would be spotty and selective, with many
innocent people, for example those whose systems were unknowingly used to
further these peoples' purposes, caught in the net.

          European Symposium on Research in Computer Security
                November 23-25, 1992, Toulouse, France

Computer security is concerned with the protection of information in
environments where there is a possibility of intrusion or malicious action. The
aim of ESORICS is to further the progress of research in computer security by
establishing a European forum for bringing together researchers in this area,
by promoting the exchange of ideas with system developers and by encouraging
links with researchers in related areas. To achieve this aim under the best
conditions, ESORICS 92 will be a single track symposium and the selected papers
will be presented in a conference hall whose capacity is 290 attendees. ESORICS
92 is the second symposium of a series started with ESORICS 90 held in Toulouse
in October, 1990.
