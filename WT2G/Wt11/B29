There were several collisions recently that are worthy of note here.

  A twin-engine 18-seat Metroliner and a single-engine private plane
  collided near Salt Lake City on 15 January 1987.  All 10 aboard killed.
  The small plane had no altitude transponder.

  An Army twin-enginer turboprop collided with a twin-engine business plane 
  near Independence, MO.  All 6 people killed.  19 January 1987.  Both
  planes had altitude transponders, but controllers said they did not see
  the altitude data on their screens.

  A six-seat regional airliner and a single-engine private plane grazed
  each other near Westerly, RI.  No one hurt.  19 January 1987.

The FAA is contemplating extending its forthcoming Mode-C regulations to
include commuter planes as well as mainliners.   [Source: SFChron 25 Jan 87]

All Honeywell CP-6 sites running version C01 of CP-6 suddenly entered a time
warp Wednesday morning.  The Front End Processor (FEP) suddenly thought it was
December of 1968, but the host still knew the correct time and date.  It
turns out that the sign bit of the word containing the time finally got set.
Unfortunately, that word appears to have been declared as a signed number
rather than an unsigned one.  (How you could ever have a negative time is
beyond me.)  Since the base time for CP-6 is January 1, 1978, we suddenly
scooted back in time to 1968.  The problem was first reported by a CP-6
site in Germany at 5:23am Pacific Standard Time.
 
What impact did this have on CP-6 users?  Those using programs running
solely on the host weren't affected, though the login message gave the
wrong time and date.  Those using the Transaction Processing (TP) features
of the FEP, however, discovered that incorrect dates were entered into
their databases on the host.  CP-6 sites are now manually correcting the
bad data.
 
The problem was fixed by early Wednesday afternoon and a patch was made
available to Honeywell's customers.
 
By the way, one CP-6 site determined that the time stamp will overflow
at 15:26:07.35 on October 11, 1999.  Mark that down on your calendars!
 
Here's the message Honeywell sent to its customers.  (A STAR is a problem
report.)

    Sent: 01/28/87 06:39  Rcvd: 01/28/87 06:53  Number: 68

    Subject: FEP timestamp problem

    Yes, good morning y'all.  The CP-6 interpretation of the level-6 timestamp
    seems to have started to pickup a sign bit today, so every site in the
    world, regardless of patch revision or system revision is happy, happy,
    happy.  Star 32173 has been generated to track this problem at severity
    one.  If you want to be on the list of people to be notified as soon as a
    fix is available, please build a note on that star. Sorry 'bout that.

The reason that the ROMs on the GM Engine Control Module do not come with
the replacement unit is that they are specific to the automobile--they vary,
depending on the particular automobile model, engine, and transmission.
This is no different from a number of other components (distributor innards
in older cars, for instance).  The ROMs are available (on special order)
as replacement parts; you need to know the exact configuration of your
GM car to order them (that is, the VIN, the engine code, and the transmission
code--I don't think you need the complete set of option order codes, though
these are usually available on a sticker buried in the trunk).  The ECMs are
generic (there have only been a few major revisions of the basic module), and
the ROMs are (extremely) specific--so it is not possible to stock the complete
set of ROMs, nor to stock ECMs with ROMs installed.

There are several specialized tools available for ECM based diagnostics.
For field use, several companies make special tools which plug in to a
connector under the dash, and communicate with the ECM to monitor engine
parameters and diagnose faults.  This is an amazingly powerful tool for
diagnosing engine problems; you can, for instance, see if the engine tends
to run rich or lean in one particular regime by reading out the current
"block learn mode" matrix from the ECM (this is a set of fudge factors the
ECM keeps so it can guess at the correct fuel delivery for your particular
car and engine).  All GM dealers should have such tools, and (presumably)
know how to use them.

Incidentally, you can read out some of the ECM diagnostics with nothing
fancier than a bent paperclip; the GM shop manuals give all the details.
This is most useful in a case where the ECM has already found a problem,
and illuminated the "Service Engine Soon" light (the ECM checks all its
sensor values for "reasonableness"; if things don't seem right, it
complains).

In Risks 4.42, Alan Wexelblat asks about the applicability of the
principle of "loose coupling" to computer systems.  I think the
principle is a valuable one.  Herewith, a brief study in contrast.

My present employer, Wang Labs, makes a variety of computer systems.  The
Wang VS series are conventional minicomputers.  That is, they have a cpu
which runs user tasks, with a conventional OS.  The Wang OIS is a
loosely-coupled system in which a central file server (the OIS "master")
supports a collection of workstations and peripheral devices.  The VS, which
is probably no better or worse than most computers of its class, suffers
occasionally from task crashes and OS crashes.  Installation of new
peripherals or major new software generally requires an IPL or two.  On the
OIS, all user code runs in the workstation.  If your workstation (or other
peripheral) crashes, the most that's required is to cycle power on the
device.  The master sees the power-up, and reloads you.  *All* OIS software
except the master code can be re-installed without an IPL.  Peripherals can
be installed simply by plugging them in.

In a development environment, VS's are sometimes reloaded hourly in
order to change software, change configuration, or recover from crashes.
(Released software, of course, is orders of magnitude more stable.)
OIS's?  The last time mine was IPLed was to recover from a mechanical
disk failure, months ago.  Master crashes are practically unheard of.

Generally, I think loose coupling presents an invaluable opportunity
for bullet-proofing of components.  It becomes possible to validate
your input and to recover from external problems, only when "input" and
"external" are well-defined terms.  Let the lines be drawn.

Disclaimer:  These are my own opinions about Wang products.  Other
Wang employees, salesmen, and customers have their own opinions.

Another classic case of mistaken magnitude is documented in a variety of
books on the CIA. When they were carrying out their infamous LSD experiments
they heard that Sandoz had for sale 22lbs of LSD and being so afraid that
the Russians would buy, put $250,000 in a case and went shopping. The people
at Sandoz looked very puzzled - they had only ever made about the 0.5 oz of
the drug. Someone in the CIA Swiss office didn't know the difference between
milligrams and kilograms.

I just finished a quite entertaining book featuring a computer crimes
investigator of the year 2000. The technical stuff is OK (for a change) and
the basic idea behind the plot is quite feasible (and scary!!) from a RISKS
point of view.  The book is :

A unit conversion error (pounds and kilograms, if I recall) was a major
contributing factor in the Air Canada 767 flameout incident a few years
ago.  The jet ran out of fuel during cruise; the pilot also flew
sailplanes, the co-pilot trained near (90 miles away from) the flameout
site, and they were able to land safely.

  I think it goes like this:

 Power    American       British      Metric
of ten      name          name        prefix

   3      Thousand      Thousand       Kilo
   6      Million       Million        Mega
   9      Billion       Milliard       Giga
  12      Trillion      Billion        Tera
  15      Quadrillion  
  18      Quintillion   Trillion
  21      Sextillion   
  24      Septillion    Quadrillion
  27      Octillion
  30      Nonillion     Quintillion

  The problem is not that different names are used, but that the same
names are used for very different numbers.  This is why metric
prefixes have caught on.  For instance a thousand million electron
volts is now called a GEV (for Giga) rather than a BEV (for Billion).

  Unfortunately, the metric prefixes don't go very far.  In any case,
they are hard to remember.  And they are no longer always unambiguous,
at least in the computer world, where the prefix Mega may mean 1,000,000
or 1,048,576 or even 1,024,000.

  The best solution is to use the exponents of ten.  Instead of GEV,
just say 1E9 EV.  This is catching on rapidly, perhaps due to computers,
which are more easily programmed to say 1.02E+09 than 1.02 GEV, etc.

  You are right, Milliard is not used in the United States.  Actually, the
highest name I ever hear is trillion.  People who speak of quadrillions tend
to get funny looks.
             [Wait until our national budget gets there in a few years!  PGN]

  Science meets engineering where I work, too.  This results in code where a
distance is always stored as millimeters, but is output and read in in mills
(thousandths of an inch).  Similarly with degrees C and F.  Sometimes fully
a third of my programming time is taken up with making sure incompatible
units don't mix, and making extra sure whether I multiply or divide by a
conversion factor or its inverse, etc.

  I discovered a bug in someone else's code where a unit was BTUs per cubic
foot per degree F and was later used as calories per cubic centimeter per
degree C.  I spent a whole day fixing this, before working out the actual
conversion factor to put in the constants section - and the conversion
factor was exactly 1.

     In 1976, the Canadian government sponsored a meeting in Quebec at the
"Stanley House", composed of top data processing experts and philosophers.
The meeting specifically addressed the issue of ethical conduct in the
computer industry.  The list that follows was extracted from an article
published that year in SCIENCE Magazine (the official magazine of AAAS).
Unfortunately, I do not have the date of the magazine.

     I have not heard of any followup on these criteria, either in a
discussion on computer risks or ethics, or as any meaningful attempt
to implement them.  I present them here to RISKS DIGEST for comments
by other readers--and perhaps someone has some later information?

                      Stanley House Criteria for
                    Humanizing Information Systems


     1.  Procedures for dealing with users.

         A.  The language of a system should be easy to understand.
         B.  Transactions with a system should be courteous.
         C.  A system should be quick to react.
         D.  A system should respond quickly to users (if it is unable
             to resolve its intended procedure).
         E.  A system should relieve the users of unnecessary chores.
         F.  A system should provide for human information interface.
         G.  A system should include provisions for corrections.
         H.  Management should be held responsible for mismanagement.


     2.  Procedures for dealing with exceptions.

         A.  A system should recognize as much as possible that it
             deals with different classes of individuals.
         B.  A system should recognize that special conditions might
             occur that could require special actions by it.
         C.  A system must allow for alternatives in input and
             processing.
         D.  A system should give individuals choices on how to deal
             with it.
         E.  A procedure must exist to override the system.


     3.  Action of the system with respect to information.

         A.  There should be provisions to permit individuals to
             inspect information about themselves.
         B.  There should be provisions to correct errors.
         C.  There should be provisions for evaluating information
             stored in the system.
         D.  There should be provisions for individuals to add
             information that they consider important.
         E.  It should be made known in general what information is
             stored in systems and what use will be made of that
             information.


     4.  The problem of privacy.

         A.  In the design of a system all procedures should be
             evaluated with respect to both privacy and humanizing
             requirements.
         B.  The decision to merge information from different files
             and systems should never occur automatically.  Whenever
             information from one file is made available to another
             file, it should be examined first for its implications
             for privacy and humanization.


     5.  Guidelines for ethical system design.

         A.  A system should not trick or deceive.
         B.  A system should assist participants and users and not
             manipulate them.
         C.  A system should not eliminate opportunities for
             employment without a careful examination of consequences
             to other available jobs.
         D.  System designers should not participate in the creation
             or maintenance of secret data banks.
         E.  A system should treat with consideration all individuals
             who come in contact with it.

   [This seemed worth drawing to your attention, although it might also
    be suited to Human-Nets and Soft-Eng.  But to prevent subsequent 
    discussion from wandering all over the place, let's see if we can
    constrain it to RISKS-related matters.  Thanks.  PGN]

Early this year a message appeared on ARPANET-BBOARDS commemorating the 
ten-year anniversary of DATE-75.  A somewhat more ominous anniversary will
occur in four weeks, on 9 January 1986.  Users of the TOPS-10 operating
system should beware of software failures beginning on that date.

DATE-75 is the name of a set of program modifications applied to the TOPS-10
operating system, running on DEC PDP-10 computers.  Before the
modifications, the TOPS-10 system could only represent dates between 1
January 1964 and 4 January 1975.  The DATE-75 modifications added three more
bits to the representation of dates, so that dates up to 1 February 2052
could be represented.  To maximize compatibility with existing software, the
three extra bits were taken from several unused positions in existing data
structures.  The change was announced in mid-1974, and several tens of
person-years went into updating software to recognize the new dates.

Unfortunately, reassembling these bits into an integer representing the date
was somewhat tricky.  Also, some programs had already used the spare bits
for other purposes.  There were a large number of bugs that surfaced on 5
January 1975, the first day whose representation required the DATE-75
modification.  Many programs ignored or cleared the new bits, and thought
that the date was 1 January 1964.  Other programs interpreted the new bits
incorrectly, and reported dates in 1986 or later.  Date-related program bugs
were frequent well into the Spring of 1975.

On 9 January 1986, the second bit of the DATE-75 extension will come
into use.  Users of software developed in the 60's and early 70's on
the TOPS-10 operating system should beware of problems with testing and
manipulation of dates.  Beware especially of programs that were patched
after manifesting bugs in 1975, for in the rush to fix the bugs it is
possible that some programs were modified to assume that the date was
between 1975 and 1986.  Any date that is off by a multiple of eleven
years and four days is probably caused by this type of bug.

Since my original posting on this I've received enquiries as to whether
there has been any follow up in the UK press. I hadn't seen any until
today's Guardian, which carried the following (excerpted) article:

                 MEDICAL SCHOOL FACES RACE INVESTIGATION
                 By Andrew Veitch, Medical Correspondent

  The Commission on Racial Equality is to launch an investigation into 
discrimination against blacks at one of Britain's leading medical schools,
it was disclosed yesterday.
  Sir Peter Newsam, the CRE Chairman, is invoking its rarely used legal
powers under the Race Relations Act to investigate the way in which St
George's in south London selects its students.
  This means that CRE officers have satisfied the commission that there is
prima facie evidence that the Act has been breached. [...]
  The inquiry follows the Guardian's disclosure last month that the school was 
using a computer programme which deliberately downgraded non-white applicants.
  Two of its consultants, Dr. Aggrey Burke and Dr Jo Collier, ran applications 
through the computer and found that being a non-Caucasian female lowered the 
applicant's ranking by up to 20 points - probably enough to reject a candidate 
who would have been accepted on academic performance alone.
  The programme was designed to mimic the decisions of the selection committee,
which it replaced.
  The academic board scrapped the programme after being given details of the
consultants' investigation.

Garnered from a report just now heard on NPR's All Things Considered:
BBC reporter speaking of the investigation of the crash of the
airliner carrying Mozambique President Samora Machel:

  Based on official transcripts of the cockpit conversation before the
  crash, when a ground proximity alarm sounded, the (soviet) pilot ignored the
  alarm, believing it to be malfunctioning.  The investigation also noted
  evidence that some of the instruments appeared to have been tampered with
  after the crash, fueling speculation by the soviets that the plane had been
  lured to the site by a false navigational beacon.

Summary: Loose coupling applies to software.

I think that the concept of loosely-coupled systems can be very well applied
to software engineering, although perhaps not in the way Wexelblat quotes
Meldman as saying.  There, the model seems to be that computer systems as a
whole don't communicate well, and therefore prevent massive "data rot," as
it were.  That's as may be, and I may be reading it wrong anyway.  But I see
this as a very good model for the kinds of things we do in modularisation of
software, information hiding, defensive programming, and the like.  We try
to make sure that errors in one part of a system don't propagate to other
parts, by building bridgeheads against them (testing for bad data), not
tightly coupling data values (controlling import and export), et alii.

  &gt;                              According to my FAA source, the FAA is not
  &gt;thoroughly comfortable with this, but the autopilot is only flight-crucial
  &gt;on this aircraft during about 45 seconds of the landing.  Also, their tests
  &gt;have found that pilots can successfully recover from an autopilot failure
  &gt;during this period (by performing a go-around) about 80% of the time.

	While not a direct computer risk, is anyone else troubled that 
the FAA considers a 1 in 5 chance that the pilot WON'T recover acceptable?
Or is it just that they believe a failure during these crutial 45 seconds
to be of acceptably low probability?

I just saw this program tonight on the local PBS-station here in Austin, TX
and would like to call your attention to it, as it may air later in your
area (or as a daytime repeat later this week, as here in Austin).

It contained the most up-to-date and reasonable analysis and report of
airline crashes in recent years I am aware of.  It points out that human
errors (mostly by the pilots) are the leading factors of these accidents
and it reports on the programs major carriers have currently in operation
that try to reduce this (mainly having to do with Flight Deck Management
and Human Factors in the cockpit).

One item that I found particularly interesting was a statement to the effect
that the Automatic Pilot may well have been a contributing factor in several
incidents, as the crew tended to trust the "computers" to the point to where
they neglected to monitor the flight situation sufficiently and avoidable
fatal accidents were the consequence.  Examples included the case of a Chinese
airliner crossing the Pacific on Auto-Pilot were one engine went out and the
crew seemed not to notice in time to avoid entering a 6-mile, near-fatal
dive,  the crash of a liner near Miami, where the crew was occupied trying
to analyze a burnt-out light-bulb of the "gear-down indicator", flying the
plane on auto-pilot, unaware that, for reasons unknown, it did not hold the
2,000 feet altitude, even ignoring the warning buzzers until a few seconds
before the end in the Everglade swamps.  The shooting-down of the Korean
airliner was also cited as an event were an incorrect data-entry and sloppy
supervision procedures may have been the beginning of the end.

Some comments on "Why Planes Crash":

The program is not without virtues.  But it suffers from the same sort
of inaccuracies, omissions and misrepresentations seen frequently in
such unthinkable contexts as recent New York Times articles, and will
probably do further damage to the image of aviation.

Example:  "Most accidents are caused by Pilot Error."  Pilot Error is
often a NTSB euphemism for "we don't know what happened."  In fact,
the last episode of the program, concerning the Delta L-1011 accident
in Dallas, makes the points that NTSB decisions are often driven by
politics, not safety per se, and that in this case "Pilot Error" was
added to the causality findings of weather and controller/radar operator
negligence so as to allow a "unanimous" decision to be announced --
leaving even my elderly parents wondering:  if the microburst was
so severe as to be unflyable (according to NCAR's McCarthy), and if
its potential presence was not reported by the only people who could
have known about it, how could it be the pilots' fault?  "Too bad about
the pilots' reputations, but we gotta look good on camera..."

The program did little to assure me that anyone out there understands
the real problems and their possible solutions:  too few competent
controllers, failure to adapt useful technology (like Geostar-based
position monitoring for collision avoidance), and FAA policies clearly
dictated by political motives (e.g., the desire to control ALL airspace
from the ground, thereby maximizing the FAA employee count &amp; budget).

It would have been nice to see the point made that 1986 was one of the
safest years EVER for U. S. aviation.  'Nuff said.

I, like many other readers of this forum, have become concerned about the
increasing use of computers in our automobiles.  I wonder about the
increasing number of cars whose idle speed can go crazy due to a software
bug.  I have my doubts at times as to whether anti-lock brake systems are
really failsafe, as their makers allege.

However, this week my concerns have turned into outright fear.  Featured in
the cover story of the February 2, 1987 issue of _AutoWeek_ magazine is a
show car made by Pontiac, called the Pursuit.  Unlike most cars made for
auto shows, which are mostly exercises in styling, the Pursuit is a fully
functional concept car.  It features such goodies as full-time all wheel
drive, active suspension with adjustable ride height, CRT instrumentation, etc.

The killer (pun intended) is the electronic four-wheel steering.  There is
no mechanical connection whatsoever between the steering wheel and the
steering gearboxes! Two 24 volt battery-powered electric motors are
responsible for turning the front and rear wheels.  The article only
mentions "electronics" for control, but presumably a microprocessor is
involved.  It is Pontiac's intent that many or all of the features of the
Pursuit be incorporated in production vehicles by sometime in the 1990's,
including the "steer-by-wire" system.

An article in the Feb.  2, 1987 Brown (University) Daily Herald (Providence,
RI) describes an incident in which a Brown senior's account was "accidentally
credited" 25,000 dollars last September by Citizens Bank located in Providence.

The article continues with information credited to the Providence (RI)
Journal:  (I have deleted the student's name.)

  According to the *Journal*, bank officials gave police the following account
  of the events:  Approximately $4,000 was wired to [the student's] account on
  September 3.  At about the same time, the bank said, $25,000 came into
  another customer's account.  Due to an accounting mistake, the $25,000 was
  accidentally credited to [the student's] account.

The student claimed he thought his parents had wired the large amount of
money to him.  If he returns the amount, police will 'probably' drop all
criminal charges.  The student has spent a large portion of the money, but
he said that he still planned to repay the bank.

I wondered what the phrase "accounting mistake" might mean, so I called
Citizens Bank to see what I might learn.  (I also wanted to give them a
chance to give their side of things for this posting.)

As might be expected, a bank official was not excited about going into any
detail about their mistake.  I spoke with someone in (computer?)  Security,
who was very hesitant about speaking with me.  All he would say was that if
I thought the problem was computer-related, I was "heading in the wrong
direction".

There is, as yet, no evidence that the error *was* computer-related, but
"account mistake" is so vague that I can't help worrying...

And then there is the question of whether using money that you have been
mistakenly given is illegal or not, and why.  But best not to discuss that
here, I guess...

Recently, Apple Computer Inc. purchased a $14.5 Cray Research supercomputer
to aid in the design of their next-generation Apple computers.

John Rollwagen, Cray Research Inc. chief executive, told Seymour Cray about
how Apple was using their newly purchased Cray supercomputer.  "There was a

because I'm designing the next Cray with an Apple.'"

On Sunday CMU's computer center was shutdown due to an electrical
failure.  The failure was bad enough that power was not restored to the
building until sometime on Monday.  Workers in that building were sent
home until Tuesday.

The CMU library has totally computerized its catalog.  This is really
neat because it lets me search for books and other goodies from my
office instead of trekking over to campus for nothing.

On Monday, of course, the library catalog was not operational.  A talk
with the reference librarian confirmed my fears: the card catalog has
not been kept up to date and, in fact, will eventually be discarded.

I wonder if the power failure will convince them not to put all their
eggs in the computer basket?

Here's John Joseph's message, in its entirety:

  Not to slight your mention of, and interest in, the "signed UTS" problem, I
  do have a minor correction to make to your analysis of the underlying
  problem.  Your RISKs BB entry states something akin to:  "the UTS word
  appears to have been declared as a signed number rather than an unsigned
  one".  While that may be an obvious conclusion, based on the symptoms, it is
  not necessarily true, and casts doubt on the competence of the responsible
  programmer.  The programmer did indeed declare the UTS as an unsigned value.
  The CP-6 host-based cross compiler that generated the code for the FEP
  generated what it could for the CP-6 FEP, namely, signed instructions, since
  the extended arithmetic mode of the CP-6 FEP can only do signed
  instructions.  It generated these instructions without actually generating a
  diagnostic (warning) message for the programmer.  E.g.  the programmer
  probably thought he was doing it "right".  In fact, all the criticism at the
  development center focused on the apparent oversight of the compiler
  programmer (which had its defendants, too).  As a side note, the FEP could
  probably have executed some instructions to handle this situation properly,
  had Honeywell required its users to purchase a "Scientific Instruction
  Processor" (functionally equivalent to an 8087 upgrade for a PC), at $3000.
  At that price, it's generally less than 5% of a total FEP purchase.  Rather
  than force that upgrade, a decision was made to use the existing "Commercial
  Instructions Processor" (CIP) for extended airthmetic.  With the
  unfortunate, but obvious results.
 
  So, just to correct the record, I know the UTS problem was NOT a problem
  of a programmer declaring a datum incorrectly.  There are a myriad of other,
  insidious, underlying problems that contributed to that appearance.

Last week while I was in Washington D.C. for a conference my "/usr"
disk crashed and destroyed all the data on the disk.  This unfortunately
included the entire mailing list for the Computers and Society Digest,
so I now have stuff to mail, and no-one to mail it to!  

If you were on the list, or if you're interested in joining, please 
send me mail so I can rebuild it.  Furthermore, if you know of any
friends or others that were receiving the list...

(I remember having company burst points for BBN, SRI, Xerox, CMU, and
 some others, but not the actual addresses.)

This is all very frustrating, as you might suspect, so a slight sense of

Subject:  More on British Phone fraud

Just as a brief followup to the recent discussions of British PhoneCard 
toll fraud, I heard a news item on a BBC World Service "News about Britain"
program a couple days ago that a number of the staff at British Telecom
have been charged with complicity in a toll-fraud scheme. This was only
a sentence or two, giving no detail, but the fraud seemed to be plain human
criminality, with no computerized aspects. Included amongst those charged
were some operators; it appeared that the fraud was simple actions like
not reporting for billing calls the operators handled. Perhaps someone
on the list(s) with access to British media can post more details.

The East Coast edition of the Wall Street Journal, on Wednesday January 28,
1987, contains a front page leader article headlined "As Complexity Rises,
Tiny Flaws in Software Pose a Growing Threat."  ...  Most of the examples
reported in the article have already appeared in Risks, but as a summary
report to a wider audience, it is quite readable.

If you look for the article any place but the East Coast edition, be warned
that different editions of the WSJ often run leader articles on different days.

On Tuesday, 10 Feb 87, Golden Gate Fields opened its 41st season racing
season with a $3 million upgrade -- including its computer systems.
Unfortunately, the first day was a disaster.

Due to starkly degraded computer capacity, only 80 of the 130 betting
windows could be opened, despite adequate personnel for manning all windows.
And those 80 were operating at a snail's pace.  Bettors waiting in line for
20 minutes never got their bets in.

The new Z Alpha Display next to the totalisator board was showing ridiculous
probable payoffs.  Actual payoffs could not be displayed and had to be
announced.

The Pick Six had to be cancelled altogether.  It, a new Pick Nine, and a daily
triple all used computer-readable marked cards, but the equipment was not
up to the task.

The GGF president Kjell Qvale said the reason for the breakdown was that the
new equipment had been standing idly for too long and wasn't tested
properly.  Actually, mutuel machines are linked in groups of 8, and when one
goes all 8 go.  Something like 6 grids of 8 all collapsed.  The resulting
degradation in performance was intolerable.  

this is another example of the difficulty of testing a system adequately
without the presence of LIVE operating conditions... although it sounds as
if they had plenty of time to do less-than-live testing...

There's a very interesting letter in the 1/87 issue of Byte magazine
(page 408).  Seems that the writer purchased a "speed-up BIOS chip for
PC compatibles made by Softpatch Inc.", and installed it in his
Televideo 1603 computer.  Because the 1603 isn't strictly a PC-clone,
he had to change two bytes in the video parameters (to suit the
characteristics of the 14-inch monochrome monitor), and had to change
one other byte to to make the BIOS checksum come out to zero.  He
decided to use the manufacturer's-logo byte for this latter change.
Woe was he!  The new BIOS contains a logo check, buried in the
clock-tick interrupt routine, which is activated several hours after
bootup.  If the logo doesn't match, a glaring "PLEASE POWER OFF OR YOUR
DISK WILL BE TRASHED!" message appears on the monitor, and if any key
is typed (or is being held down when the message appears) the disk is
"totally wiped out".

The writer reports that the documentation which comes with the BIOS
chip makes no mention of the worm.  He apparently spoke with the author
of the BIOS, who told him that his choice of the logo-byte for checksum
fudging was "unfortunate", and that he (the BIOS's author) had wiped
out his own hard-disk twice while testing the worm.

Sounds to me as if Softpatch Inc. may be in a VERY dubious legal
position with this worm, under the legal doctrine of "strict
liability"...  especially if the worm is accidentally activated on
someone's computer due to a "wild branch" into the BIOS, as the writer
suggests might happen.

At a recent aviation safety conference, Jack Eggspuler told a story similar
to that of the student with the extra $25,000 credited to his account
[Steve Thompson, <A HREF="/Risks/4.46.html">RISKS-4.46</A>]:

He had banked for years at a small-town bank.  One day, a large banking
conglomerate bought up the small bank.  After this, Jack noticed that his
deposits weren't being listed.

He went into the bank to talk to them.  It turned out that his account
number, which had been assigned to him when the bank was independent, was
identical to Borden Industries' account number with the conglomerate.  Yup,
his penny-ante deposits were going into Borden's account.

He thought it was straightened out.  A week or so later he went in to
cash a check, and asked for his balance.  It was:  $9,238,345.35.  Ulp!  He
thought of a new Piper, but settled for a copy of the printout.  He's got
it hanging on his wall...

In the January 19th, 1987 issue of Newsweek, there is an article on
the problems with the B-1B bomber project (page 20) .  Three key systems
are reported as being "faulty" with two of those attributed to software
problems:

 * Terrain-following radar:  "Software glitches have prevented pilot training
   but Air Force engineers say the flaws will be corrected  within weeks."

 * Flight-control software: "..is especially critical during delicate
   in-flight refueling operations.  Faulty software programs make such
   operations difficult."

The third key system, electronic countermeasures systems (stealth), is
reported as "jamming their own signals instead of the enemy's" but it was
not mentioned whether software played any role in the problem.

	I just saw an article in the San Francisco Chronicle describing a
new little goodie which inventors have called the Super-Smart card.  It is a
credit-card-sized unit with lots of memory in it, and it also appears to
have a 12-key keypad on the back.

	What I found interesting about this article is that its inventors
don't know what to do with it (solution looking for a problem), and are
soliciting potential applications, such as encoding medical information.

	Do we really need this?  Think about it.  Supposedly "foolproof"
systems have been defeated before (VideoCypher, British Telecom, countless
computer systems, etc.).  Why should this be any different?

	This is not just a card with an indentification number specially
encoded, this is a full computer system in a credit card.  It's got memory,
I/O, an external interface (I would surmise that this would be the case so
external readers can be plugged in), etc.  Imagine: All your personal
information encoded on a credit card.

	What if it's stolen?  Thieves are getting more and more ingenious,
and a particularly smart one could easily upload all the information out of
the card.  What if an even more ingenius person encoded fabricated
information on the card?

	Suppose you're in an auto accident.  The card is damaged.  How will
emergency personnel read the vital medical information?

	The list could go on.  I agree that it's a neat gadget, and wouldn't
mind having all kinds of information available in my wallet, but do we
REALLY need something like this?  Not necessarily because of the RISKS
involved, but just as a new piece of technology to worry about.

	"Damn, the batteries are dead.  And I can't buy new batteries
without the card.  And I can't use the card because the batteries are
dead..."  :-)

	IRAN INQUIRY REPORTED FOCUSING ON NEW DATA

	... Computer Records Revealed

	... FBI agents reviewed National Security Council computer
	    records ...

	The records, part of a massive electronic filing system
	disclosed to investigators by the White House this winter,
	contains copies of private messages sent between National
	Security Council offices to the White House's internal IBM
	computer network, called PROFS.  ...

	The computer messages under scrutiny by the FBI - which
	range from routine memos and obscene jokes to eyes-only
	accounts of intelligence operations - were composed and
	sent by most NSC employees in the belief that they were
	not being recorded elsewhere.

	In fact, however, their contents were stored on magnetically
	treated "hard" computer discs and retained for at least one
	to two months before being erased, White House spokesman
	Dan Howard said Tuesday.

	"We were living under a delusion.  We thought when we
	deleted them from our own files, that they dissapeared,"
	the rueful Administration official said.  "In fact, they
	were just going into storage."  ...

	The rest of the article contains more details on who was using
the system and what they were saying.

Lear Jets have no mechanical connection between rudder pedals (steering wheel)
and nose wheel.  I would also assume a microprocessor is involved.
While I have seen these jet's steering fail (intermittently) due to
water leakage I have never heard of an accident attributed to this.
This lack of steering linkage means the nose wheel swivels freely without 
power (*very* helpful to linesmen). It is probably useful to note that main
wheels are independently brakeable though.

power steering and brakes are designed in such a way that even when all power

  &gt;I just saw [Nova: Why Planes Crash].... One...interesting [item] was...
  &gt;that the [autopilot] may... have been a... factor in several incidents....
  &gt;Examples included...a Chinese airliner...[where] one engine [failed]...

I've read the NTSB report on this incident (and I saw the television
program).  It appears to have been much more a case of pilot error
(failing to follow standard procedures -- namely "disengage the autopilot
upon engine failure") than of "computer failure."

  &gt;...the crash...near Miami, where the crew was occupied trying to analyze a
  &gt;[lack of gear-down indication], flying the plane on auto-pilot, unaware
  &gt;that...it did not hold [2000']....

Again, this was much more a disregard of primary duties: no one bothered to
fly the airplane.  Three supposedly qualified pilots all diverted nearly
their entire attention from their primary jobs at the same time, for several
minutes!

Now, do these (and others) indicate an over reliance on technology?  Is THAT
the risk we're seeing in aviation today?  Or is it lack of sufficient
training in systems that are growing more and more complex?  During primary
training and initial instrument training, a good curriculum will include
tremendous information about the systems of the aircraft.  A frequent
criticism of recent airline training is that it is becoming more
procedures-based ("if this happens, do this"), rather than systems-based
("this is how it all works, and plays together").

As a counterpoint (i.e. that in many cases it IS an error on the part of
the pilots -- often an error which adherence to procedures, even as taught
in procedures-based training, could have avoided), during the China Air
incident, the entire cockpit crew, including the backup crew, experienced
severe spatial disorientation.  Everyone there misinterpreted the attitude
indicators (one of the primary non-visual flight instruments, used in
essentially every instrument-capable airplane, from trainers like Cessna
172s, to 767s and L1011s), which showed, very clearly, and correctly, what
was happening to the 747 as it began its uncontrolled (though NOT
uncontrollable!) roll.  Both the captain and the first officer believed
that both of their attitude indicators (attitude indicators in that 747,
and in most planes, are gyroscopic instruments) had tumbled at the same
time!  As soon as the plane broke out below the clouds, the captain was
able to recover from the unusual attitude -- using VISUAL flight skills.

How much of the China Air incident could be blamed on computers?  On
technology?  On training?  Where are the REAL risks?

The St. Louis Public library has also recently eliminated its physical card
catalog and gone to a computerized system for cataloging and for book
loaning and tracking. It is based on bar-code scanning, and I've noticed
a rise in incorrect book-overdue notices and the like; one specific 
example that happened to me was that I had checked out and returned a
book which had water damage distorting the bar-code label. Some weeks
after returning it I got an overdue notice, so I went to the library,
found the book on the shelf, and took it and the notice to circulation
to remonstrate with them. They seemed to be used to reports of errors
by that time, so I suppose this was relatively common. My guess for the
reason for that error was that the bar-code-reader returned an incorrect
reading when they processed the return.

This was during their transition period, though, and things seem better
now. However, the catalog is now on microfilm or -fiche, which is harder
to use than the paper card catalog, plus it is only updated periodically.
(With the paper cards, they could always insert new cards at any time --
whether they actually DID this, or waited until they had a batch to put
in, or did it on a weekly or other time-based schedule, I do not know.)

I find the COM microfilm catalog to be particularly difficult to use,
as the film is in manually-driven reader units, and there is no
indication to the user just where in the reel the viewer is pointing.
(That is, they have the author/title and subject catalogs both on
the same reel, and I can never remember which is first, and they do not
tell you. So you turn on the reader and see you are looking at "M" in
the author/title section, and you want to go to "G" in the subject
section. You have to crank for a minute or so in one direction and hope
you are going the right way; if not, you hit end-of-reel, and have to
crank back over what you already skipped over, plus the rest of the
alphabet, before you even get into the section you want to search.)
At least the fiche allow a random or direct search to get the right
fiche, and then you can jump around within it with the reader unit.
But you always have to look at two fiche -- they issue change-update
sets more often than they re-issue a complete updated catalog set.

This had nothing to do with the Phonecard scam.  As far as I could make out
from the newspaper reports it was a simple fraud - probably worked by
hacking wiring in exchanges or something (that is a pure guess, no details
were mentioned).  There certainly seemed to be no computer aspects involved.

P.S. Does anyone have a pointer to the work on human error being done by people
at UCSD? Hofstadter mentions it in his latest book and it sounds interesting.

          From the Observer 15th Feb 87:

17 March 86. A crowded One-Eleven jet and a Short 330 commuter aircraft descend
to land simultaneously on Aberdeen's single runway.  The jet screams over the
top of the slower plane, cuts through its descent path, then aborts landing,
narrowly averting catastrophe.  An Aberdeen radar controller is blamed.

28 November 86.  An Iran Air jumbo jet is told to stay at 6,000ft but instead
climbs and almost collides with an Air UK Fokker F27 in holding stack over
Heathrow.  The Iranian crew's poor English makes analysis of the incident
impossible.

13 December 86.  Over Detling, Kent, a Britannia Airways 737 from Luton to
Munich comes within half a mile of a One-Eleven bound for Amsterdam from
Gatwick.  The controller handling 14 aircraft simultaneously, had forgotten
the 737's existence.

22 December 86.  A British Midland One-Eleven en route from Heathrow to
Leeds is instructed to climb to 28,000ft.  Over Cranfield, Bedfordshire, it
passes a United States Air Force KC135 tanker aircraft crossing the airway
at the same altitude. The pilot of the passenger jet takes evasive action.
A trainee controller had forgotten the presence of the military jet.

At 6.30 a.m. on 15 November 1986 the London Air Traffic Control Centre (LATCC)
at West Drayton suffered a total loss of main power as the morning rush of
flights began.  A standby generator also failed.  Radar screens covering Wales
and England south of Newcastle went blank.  The IBM 9020 computer shut down,
halting updating of flight progress strips.  Controllers had to revert to
writing strips manually.

Radio contact with aircraft was precariously maintained by a battery supply
with a life of 30 minutes.  Pilots continued to fly in the busy airspace
without radar by scrupulously maintaining their separation from other
planes.  But without radar monitoring by controllers on the ground little
could have been done if a jet had strayed.

Power was restored five minutes before the batteries gave out.  The fault
was blamed on a freak sequence of events started by the failure of a small
capacitor.

Managers were eager to clear the backlog of flights but the computer would not
function normally.  It displayed some radar blips but not others.

The LATCC controller said: 'We were pushed to handle more aircraft but refused
because the computer could have gone down at any time.

'There were many near misses that morning, all due to equipment failures.  We
were lucky.  If the same sequence of events occurs in the summer, the effect
does not bear thinking about.'

Excerpted and edited from the Los Angeles Times, Feb. 15, 1987:

	FLIGHT DELAYS LAID TO COMPUTER MALFUNCTIONING
		    By Dean Murphy
	
  Flights from airports throughout Southern California were delayed
during most of the day on Friday because of a 30-minute early morning
computer failure at the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center at
Palmdale, according to Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Russ
Park.  A backup system was activated 14 minutes after the outage.

  The aging computer, known as the 9020, has been the source of numerous
controllers' complaints, and is expected to be replaced later this year.
It provides information abot the flight plans of aircraft over a
180,000-square-mile area of Southern California, southern Utah, southern
Nevada and western Arizona.  Palmdale controllers give flight
instructions to pilots while they are flying above 10,000 feet between
areas that are covered by controllers at individual airports.  The 9020
failed 12 times during the last six months of 1986, with an average
failure time of about four minutes.

  The outage Friday forced air traffic controllers to ground flights for
15 minutes during the morning rush period at airports throughout the
area.  Combined with heavy air traffic and rainy weather, delays
continued through much of the day.  Airport and airline spokesmen said
that most of the delays were minor, describing the situation as more of
an irritation that a significant disruption in service.  The outage
posed no safety hazard to passengers.  Controllers lost flight plan
information -- including such things as the flight number, altitude and
airline of each flight -- during the 14-minute transition to the backup
system, but they were able to continue tracking the planes on radar
screens.

Been some time since I've sent something in, but Alan Marcum brings up some
good issues with respect to flying aircraft.

Alan brings up some good buzzwords like a systems approach to training.
What does this really mean?  You don't want a pilot doing "long-hand"
reasoning as the plane is falling out of the sky.  This is not to say they
are reading paper when they are going down either.

Pilots get a systems approach (so believed right now), but it is not
clear what they don't need to know.  A friend at the MVSRF (featured
in the Nova episode for NASA/Ames) pointed out in a local meeting
at PARC a couple of months back that checklists are written in blood.
(Obviously dramatic, but true.)

I have also learned in recent days that war gaming and battle management
can be regarded as `batch' rather than `interactive' in nature.  There are
those local `interactive' things called "engagements," but good commanders
set up battles months and weeks in advance to anticipate the widest variety
of contingencies, and not to fight or fly "on the fly."  This is part of why
checklists exist.  They are hardcopy versions of our memory.  They don't
forget, or suffer interference.  We try to think of contingencies before
they exist.  Sure, they are hardwired, and have lots of
problems, and there are people doing research on check lists here
and other places.

Yes, if we get lax because of computers, this is a computer associated
risk.  The human factors people have done LOTS of work to differentiate
knobs in planes.  If we computer people fail to do a similar job with
software (as an example), then we will kill people.

--eugene miya, NASA Ames Research Center

p.s. would you trust your life to any single line of code you wrote?
     think about it, before answering.  I've worked on flight (space) projects,
     but not man-rated, don't know if I could.

  From: "Peter J. Laughton" &lt;PJL%MX.LCS.MIT.EDU@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU&gt;
  Subject: PC-Write Trojan Horse

  In light of the announcement of PC-WRITE availability to Info-IBMPC
  readers (volume 6, issue 8), I considered that it would be valuable to
  share the following warning:

             ----------------------------------------
             TROJAN HORSE ALERT:  BOGUS PC-WRITE 2.7x
             ----------------------------------------

  The latest INFOWORLD (02/09/87) reports the discovery of a bogus version
  of PC-WRITE.

  Tom Wilkinson, the sysop in Los Angeles who discovered it says "the trojan
  version when invoked, destroys the file allocation table of a user's hard
  disk, and initiates a low level format, destroying the hard disk's data."

  The bad version pretends to be the latest version, PC-WRITE 2.71 and is
  98,274 bytes long.

  The real version of 2.7 is 98,242 bytes long, and the real version of 2.71
  is 98,644 bytes.  Wilkinson says the version posted on Compuserve is the
  real version.

  INFOWORLD reports that "Quicksoft, PC-WRITE's developer, is offering $2500
  reward for the first person who identifies the creator of the bogus program
  and a $5000 reward for the person who provides proof that convicts the
  perpetrator."
                                         Don Richardson, 02/10/87

  From: jam@mitre-bedford.ARPA

	According to Quicksoft, the publisher of PC-Write, the latest 
  version is 2.71. Version 2.72 is a hack containing a booby trap, and
  trashes hard disks. BEWARE!

	Version 2.71 is a minor update of 2.7. They will not release a 
  version 2.72. They are trying to notify bulletin boards of the existence
  of the bogus version, but are walking a thin line: they don't want to
  scare people away from PC-Write. 

	I use version 2.7 and like it a lot.

   (From the Sunday 15 Feb 87 New York Times)

Prescott Valley, Ariz., Feb. 14 (AP) -- All the computerized financial
records of this Rocky Mountain community have been erased, leaving officials
with no idea how much money has been spent this year or how much cash the
town has left.

Mayor Phil Beeson told the Town Council on Thursday that the account shows a
balance of zero.

He called it "positively a case of deliberate attack."  Lyn Newton, assistant
town clerk, said Friday that there is "strong circumstantial evidence pointing
to one person" whom she would not identify.

Ms. Newton said she discovered the problem over the weekend as she began
closing out the books for January for the town of 2,700 residents.

"All our expenditure accounts and all of our revenue accounts were erased,"
she said.  "The thing that scared me so badly is that we have no valid means of
knowing where we are.  By the time this was discovered, we could have been way
over budget."

The records apparently were erased sometime between Jan. 1 and last week, Ms.
Newton said.

They can be reconstructed, she said, but the task will be time consuming and
expensive and will be complicated by the fact that the town manager, assistant
town manager and town clerk all left office in recent weeks.

And, she said, it is time to begin preparing next year's budget.

The growing popularity of using the RJ series connectors (aka `telephone
modular jacks') for terminal cabling is exposing a lot of people to a major
risk.  These jacks are directly interchangable with normal telephone jacks,
and you can be sure that people will make mistakes and plug terminals into
telephone equipment.  This can do tremendous damage, and may even pose a
health risk.

When a telephone rings, the ring signals are a pulsed DC that can reach as
high as 150 volts! In terms of vaporized semi-conductors, this is just as
destructive as plugging your connector into an electric outlet.  The
frequency, voltage, and power don't quite match standard electric power but
they are more than enough to totally destroy any unprotected electronics.

The health risk arises from the potentially poor grounding of the digital
electronics.  These circuits are not normally designed to be safe with 150
volts on them.  This risk may be shortlived since the digital circuit will
quickly self destruct.  Telephone extension cables with RJ connectors pose a
greater hazard.  When the phone rings there is high voltage on that
connector.  If a child is chewing on it when the phone rings there is a real
risk of death from electrocution.  (The hazard to adults is lower since they
don't normally chew on cables, and the power levels are low enough that the
odds are in favor of a nasty jolt instead of fatal one.)

Beware of using these connectors in inappropriate circumstances.  (I was
warned quite thoroughly by our Mechanical Design people when I suggested it.
I learned then for the first time that telephones are not UL approved, nor
will they ever be, because of this 150 volt risk.)

	The following makes me wonder why no widespread concern exists
about failure of "conventional" power steering and brakes when an auto
engine dies.  I have had both experiences, fortunately without accident,
and they are frightening.  If we haven't worried about that risk, will
we collectively worry about the risk of an electronic system failure?

I really hope that scheme never makes it to production! Last time I heard,
power steering and brakes are designed in such a way that even when all power
is lost, the driver can still control the car and stop manually.

I enjoyed very much the interesting report by Lindsay F. Marshall (RISKS
DIGEST 4.48) that shows four near-miss incidents in the UK.  The reasons
for the incidents are: (1) An Aberdeen radar controller, (2) The Iranian
crew, (3) The controller who handled 14 aircraft simultaneously and had
forgotten the 737's existence, and (4) a trainee controller who had
forgotten the presence of the military jet.

I find this important report to be misplaced.  It must belong to another
RISKS-FORUM Digest, one that is not a "FORUM ON RISKS TO THE PUBLIC IN
COMPUTER SYSTEMS" like ours, but to the "FORUM ON RISKS TO THE PUBLIC IN
MANUAL SYSTEMS".

I do not find it fair that we include their stories in our bulletin.

By the way, I guess that they had a field day with the train accident,
the one in the East that none of us managed to blame computers for.

    [I HAVE INFORMALLY BEEN WORKING UNDER THE CRITERION THAT RISKS is
     a forum on risks to the public in COMPUTER-RELATED TECHNOLOGIES.
     If the computers in a computerized system are not used to proper
     advantage to prevent something that is caused by PEOPLE, that is
     relevant.  If there are no computers in an environment that is
     critical (and especially if it is difficult to control), then that
     also is relevant.  In the former case, the existence of computers
     often leads people to rely on the computer systems rather than
     remember that they (the people) are critical elements in the overall
     system.  In the latter case, the absence of computers is itself an
     issue.  Besides, it was a slow week otherwise.  But, I left out the 
     trains anyway...  PGN]

This is starting to become ridiculous.  In <A HREF="/Risks/4.48.html">RISKS-4.48</A> there were only 2
articles concerning computers; all the rest were about aviation, cars and
telephones - nice horror stories, but all referring explicitly to human
error (not while using/programming computers) and faulty hardware (not
computer hardware). I thought the purpose of having this group moderated was
to prevent such articles from filtering through! (Yes, I know, some of them
are mine, I admit).

In RISKS Vol 4 Issue 48 Lindsay Marshall reproduces a recent news
article from The Observer, which is a quality newspaper:

&gt; London Air Traffic Control Centre ... suffered a total loss of main
&gt; power as the morning rush of flights began.
&gt; A standby generator also failed ...

Now, even allowing for paraphrasing and journalistic licence, it would
seem to be relevant to ask what happened to the secondary and tertiary
main (grid) power feeds, the secondary and tertiary generators, the
secondary battery system, and why the battery system was apparently
only designed to last for 30 minutes. Phone switches have better
backups! At least Bell Systems' ones do -- I can't speak for British
Telecom. Of course these systems may have been the result of
Government cost savings...

Here's a story about how a little innocent disk-space cleanup led to a
student doing an exam, and being told he'd passed, when he shouldn't have
been allowed to take it at all.

All law students in Ontario must pass the Bar Admission Course before they
become lawyers.  One course in the BAC is on Accounting in a Law Office.
This course is taught by CAI, and the exam is on-line.  Every student gets a
different exam; the random seed is the student's (internal, numerical)
user-ID on our UNIX system, so that we can easily reproduce any student's
exam if need be.

Students who fail the exam on the first crack are allowed to do it again as
a supplementary.  They are supposed to get a new account installed for them
and use the new account.  With the new account, they get a different user-ID
and therefore a different exam.  If they try to use their original account
to do the exam again, once they've already done it, the system stops them.

A student took the exam on a Tuesday afternoon and failed (scored 44%).
He didn't contact us to get a new account set up, merely came in on
Wednesday morning and took the exam again.  Taking EXACTLY THE SAME EXAM,
he scored 50% and was told he'd passed.

We discovered this when our weekly statistics run told us that out of 538
students who had taken the exam, 536 had passed and 3 had failed! (The Bar
Admission Course's overall pass rate is very close to 100%.  You have to be
pretty bad to get 50% your second time round on the SAME exam!)

Normally the system would have prevented him from taking the exam again.
However, in an effort to free up some disk space that Tuesday night, I
combined all students' result files into one compendium.  (There was a
one-line file for each student account, and disk blocks were used much more
efficiently by combining them all together.)  I had forgotten that the way
the system stopped a student from taking the exam twice was by detecting the
existence of a result file! (This has been fixed.)

Also, the message to the student indicating that he had failed, but
could retake the exam as a supplementary, did not indicate that
he'd have to get a new account to do so.  (Now it does.)

What we decided to do was contact the student and tell him that the allowing
of him to retake the same exam was a mistake and he must do it again.
Fortunately, he didn't object, took it again (different exam) and passed.
If he had objected, I don't know what we would have done.  How do you fail
someone after he's taken an exam and passed?

On February 4 a restaurant near Rochester, NY caught fire.  The owner
dialed 911, which connected him to the county-funded, city-run emergency
services network.  Apparently he told the operator that the fire was at
"321 Linden Ave."  The Automatic Location Indicator, a system which uses
a computer file maintained by Rochester Telephone to identify the
address from which incoming calls originate, displayed "321 Linden Ave.
Brighton" [a suburb of Rochester].  Fire trucks were immediately
dispatched to that address.

Unfortunately, the restaurant is located at 321 Linden Ave. in East
Rochester, another suburb several miles east.  Fortunately, about two
minutes later the fire was called in by someone else who did specify the
proper location; the additional damage suffered because of this delay
does not appear to have been major.

Operators for 911 are instructed to seek locations from callers, and to
rely on the ALI only when the caller is unable to give that information.
In this case, however, it seems clear that in the absence of the ALI the
operator would have attempted, almost certainly successfully, to
ascertain the town involved orally.  Thus the faulty data in the ALI
file was the cause of the dispatching delay.  It appears that such
errors, while not common, are not extremely rare either.

(Incidentally, the county Commissioner of Public Safety took this
occasion to complain about duplicate street names within the county,
apparently a continuing sore point here.  It strikes me that the system
(computers and procedures) should be robust enough to handle this; after
all, if one eliminated the duplicates one would still have the
sound-alikes, numbers east versus numbers west, and so forth.)

    At a recent aviation safety conference, Jack Eggspuler told a story similar
    to that of the student with the extra $25,000 credited to his account
    [Steve Thompson, <A HREF="/Risks/4.46.html">RISKS-4.46</A>]:
    
    He had banked for years at a small-town bank.  One day, a large banking
    conglomerate bought up the small bank.  After this, Jack noticed that his
    deposits weren't being listed.
    
A similar thing happened to me through the Massachusetts Baybanks
chain.  Although it is it statewide bank it's actually split into
smaller regional banks.  I had/have an account Baybank/Middlesex.
Unfortunately someone else had an account with Baybank/Harvard with
the same individual account number (although the bank codes were different).
Every few months she would make a deposit or (more often) a withdrawal
at a Baybank/Middlesex branch and the teller wouldn't notice that the
bank number was different.  Bingo, money out of my account.  After
three such errors (including one that resulted in an overdraft), and a
number of fights to insure that I got back all charges and interest, Baybanks
finally agreed that something should be done about it - namely having me
change my account number.

This is one instance where I'd far rather trust my account to a computer
that reads ALL of the information off my banking card.

  &gt;&gt; The killer (pun intended) is the electronic four-wheel steering.  There is
  &gt;&gt; no mechanical connection whatsoever between the steering wheel and the
  &gt;&gt; steering gearboxes! Two 24 volt battery-powered electric motors are
  &gt;&gt; responsible for turning the front and rear wheels.  ...

I don't see why just using electronic steering is dangerous.  Especially
in today's litigious society.  I am sure that the car makers will think
of this when they put the electronic control in.

Side note: Isn't the F-16 a fly-by-wire plane?  If electronic steering is
safe, and reliable enough for combat jets, why wouldn't it be safe enough
for everyday car?

  &gt; ...leaving even my elderly parents wondering:  if the microburst was
  &gt; so severe as to be unflyable (according to NCAR's McCarthy), and if
  &gt; its potential presence was not reported by the only people who could
  &gt; have known about it, how could it be the pilots' fault?  ...

They flew into/under what they clearly saw to be a violent thunderstorm.
There are few worse sins in flying.  Their only excuse was the the planes
ahead of them had gotten away with it -- an attitude that has been loudly
criticized in other contexts, e.g. the Challenger disaster.

Summary: careful design makes them much safer

If you are going to use RJ parts for terminals, you should make the center
wires (red and green) be ground, and tie them together in your RJ to DB25
box.  If you plug this cable into a phone system it looks like a phone which
is off the hook.

This is, of course, only true for single-line service, but that is probably
the vast majority.

Properly wired RJ terminal cables solve just about all of the problems with
RS232.  You want to plug your terminal into your modem?  Great, just use a
standard male-male cable.  PC into terminal?  Same.  PC into printer?  Modem
into printer? Terminal to terminal?  Same.  Solve the wiring problem ONCE
for each device that comes in the door, and you never have to do any work to
connect any two devices.  If you'd like further info on how to wire like
this, send mail.

This scheme (the one I'm familiar with, superior to all others I've seen)
was developed (I believe) by Dave Butterfield at UCLA, and is used there.
The parts are much smaller, cheaper, and easier to use than DB25s.

I have been reading RISKS for a while now and find that I have absorbed
some healthy principles.  I recently developed a program that relies on
coding to determine how to manipulate data.  After completing the first
version, I found that I had a much higher proportion of coding errors
than expected.  Since I do not want to proofread reports microscopically,
I decided to rewrite the program to analyze the data automatically (as
much as practical).  I then considered doing away with the hand-coding
altogether, but the RISKS of relying excessively on computer programs to
determine the "right results" quickly came to mind.  The second version
of the program uses the results of its own data analysis, but warning
messages are issued wherever that analysis disagrees with the coding.
This seems to me an ideal solution, and I am sure that I would not have
arrived at it so readily if I had not been reading RISKS.
 
I now face situations in which the program has minor deficiencies that I
tend to ignore.  Knowing that the hand-coding is right and that it would
take several hours to upgrade, I prefer to see a few warning messages
flow by.  It reminds me of all of the people who have ignored warning
lights and buzzers to their detriment, and I am preparing to work on the
program to ensure that I do not become insensitive to the warnings.
 
So, thank you for moderating RISKS, Peter, and thanks to all of the
contributors.  People occasionally complain about postings that do not
deal directly and exclusively with computers; in my experience, these
postings help prevent problems in software design.  --Jim
 
James H. Coombs, Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in English, Brown University

   [Some of you look upon RISKS as a collection of anecdotes and nothing
    more.  The old principled codger that I am, I always look for the
    underlying principles, which you are (sometimes subliminally)
    continually confronted with when you read RISKS.  I think it would
    get tiresome to our readers if I called out the principles related
    related to each contribution, but you don't have to read too carefully
    between the lines.  The "relevance" issue amuses me, because principles
    can be derived from or applied to cases in which the computer link is
    only marginal.  Many of the same principles apply irrespective of the

Once in a rare while we turn to that wonder of sources, the Weekly World
News, for a different kind of news item.  (An earlier one was the Chinese
computer developer who was electrocuted by his old computer after he built a
new one.  There WWN's shtick involved his wife blaming jealousy on the part
of the artificially intelligent computer that had been programmed to have
human-like emotions.)  The issue of 3 March 1987 had on page 3 the tale of a
bank in Valpariso, Chile, that had recently installed $7.3 million worth of
computer equipment, including 13 terminals.  One of these terminals was used
by three different people who met extreme misfortune in some strange way --
deaths of two employees and the brain-dead coma of a third.  One of the
deaths was attributed to a massive stroke, the other to "unknown causes".
``At first we decided to remove the terminal'', said Jorge Montalabo (VP of
customer relations).  ``But the workman who came to carry it away fainted
when he tried to unplug it from the system.''  Since no workers will now go
near the terminal, the bank is apparently going to try exorcism! ``If the
exorcism doesn't work and someone else dies while using the terminal, we'll
have to scrap all of our computers and spend millions getting a new system.
Otherwise no one will work here.''

The issue here is of course not whether the computer terminal is possessed,
but whether there could have been some harmful attribute of that particular
terminal (electromagnetic or isotopic radiation, etc.).  (Presumably
shutting down the entire system and removing that terminal would have made
sense...)  On the human side, it is not surprising that such a sequence of
events would have such a profound effect on the surviving computer
personnel.

It would be easy to discredit this story on the basis of other off-the-wall
stories found by the WWN.  Although I don't think RISKS should indulge in
rampant speculation, it does seem plausible that some physical phenomenon
could have been involved -- electric currents, radiation emissions, etc.,
and thus some open-minded curiosity about this case is in order.  I wonder
whether there are any RISKS readers in South America who could provide any
solid information on this case!  PGN

One thing I'm surprised no one mentioned is the RISKS being discovered at
the NSA in the ongoing Iran-Contra affair.  The NSA spooks (and the
administration) seem to be getting burned because of *too much* backup.

For example, the false chronology of events reported by Regan and Reagan
during their testimony to Congress was discovered only when someone made
available the NSA's massive computer archive.  Apparently every file, mail
message, etc., ever created on the NSA's computers is archived there at time
of deletion.  It seems that most NSA people were not aware of the archive
(or had forgotten about it).  Messages in this archive showed how North,
Casey, and Poindexter had concocted the false story.

Just recently, Oliver North's secretary turned over floppies to the Tower
commission which contained undeleted copies of the memos that North et al.
carefully shredded before the investigators arrived.

Findings of a recent security review:

The environment here is a computer software vendor, which also has a number
of timesharing customers using the same computer as the programmers.
Customers rely on the computer for accounting and inventory control
applications.

I should first say that people at the company at which this security review
took place were of the general impression that their system, and in
particular directories containing their proprietary programs and sensitive
customer data, were quite secure.  The combination of case histories
garnered from RISKS and a recently-terminated employee prompted the review,
but the general consensus before it was started was that there was no cause
for concern.  A couple of programmers griped about having their "time
wasted" in such a "silly exercise."  This turned out to have been a mistaken
assumption.

Although it is unlikely that a breakin actually occurred, part of 
the problem with one of the security defects was that such a breakin
would be untraceable.  The facts are these:

The account system of this particular computer includes the ability to
"share" files on other accounts. If the directory file of that account is
shared one is granted access to the account as a whole.  One can gain access
to an account which is not shared through the use an alias command which
will require a password.  No such password is required to access a shared
directory.  Generally, aliases, failed aliases, logins, and failed logins
are all logged. Secure accounts are protected by having a special
"PASSWORD2" program which performs additional (user-definable) verification.
This program is uninterruptible.  On this particular company's system the
password2 program demands that the user enter a six digit number that varies
with the time of day, day of the week, and an array of random numbers
presented to the user.  Since the secondary password changes with each login
attempt, it was felt that accounts protected in this way were immune to
breakin attempts.

First problem: The proliferation of shares for the convenience of
programmers. It was found that several of the programmers had permanent
shares to many "secure" accounts.  All the most important accounts on the
system were shared with accounts that were not protected by the secondary
password system.  Thus, to break into one of these secure accounts one had
only to break into one of the programmer accounts and alias.  Many shares
which had been given for some temporary project were never removed.  Thus
programmers who were denied knowledge of login passwords to sensitive
accounts had shares to them anyway.  Some *customer* accounts still had such
shares left over from temporary projects.

Second problem: Poor passwords.  Most of the users on the system (including
the programmers) had not changed them in over a year.  Most passwords were
easily guessed.  A programmer with shares to the most sensitive accounts on
the system had a two letter password consisting of his initials.  A number
of customer accounts had been set up with *null* passwords which had never
been changed! All this in spite of the fact that memos had been circulated
advising users of the need for better passwods and relatively frequent
password changes.

Third problem: Alias and login logging can be turned off on an
account-by-account basis.  While this does require access to the system
manager's account, by (1) and (2) it was easy enough to obtain this access.
What's more, at least one programmer, with shares to many sensitive accounts
had turned off this logging for several accounts, for reasons which remain
unclear.  (Perhaps just because he was able; perhaps because at one time he
had found a hole in the security system -- duly reported -- which allowed
access to certain hyper-secure accounts and he had wanted to pin the hole
down without having to answer a lot of embarrassing questions.)  This was
not discovered by the security review, incidentally, but by an attempt to
reconstruct the circumstances of a system crash.

Fourth problem: While the secondary password program is uninterruptibly run
automatically with terminal logins, it is not run at all for a batch job
login.  Thus it is possible to break into the secure accounts by a standard
password attack once one has gained access to any account on the system
(although with the overhead of creating batch jobs, it's true).

Fifth problem: A program can be created with "OWNDIR" privileges.  While it
is running, it has all the privileges associated with the account on which
it resides.  So one can grant unprivileged users access to commands that
require privileges by sharing such a program with them.  The problem with
this is that unless the program is shared execute-only instead of read-only,
it can be interrupted, granting the unprivileged user access to all the
privileges of the program's account.  A number of such programs were shared
read-only instead of execute-only.  The types of privileges thus gained
include the ability to bring down the system or terminate any job.

Conclusions: there were several gaping holes in the security system, and it
would have been quite possible for someone to have gained access to
proprietary programs or sensitive timesharing customer data without any
record of the breakin being left.  And all this at a company which already
had in place what it considered sophisticated security policies and
effective protection against breakins.  One shudders to think what the
situation might be at places which haven't even considered the problem.

   In reply to the comment about drive-by-wire versus the F-16 fly-by-wire
system, the levels of safety of the two systems aren't really comparable.
   The average military aircraft gets a maintenance checkout either each or
every other flight to test for system malfunction, while on an average auto
you are looking at more like a checkup every 50K miles. Myself, I'd not
consider purchasing a drive-by-wire auto unless it has a much better record
than the computer-aided automotive systems have demonstrated so far, especially
on a putative high-performance sports car model, but instead drive a car with
no electronics in it to speak of (a 1966 Volvo 122S). 
   Although a computer enthusiast, I prefer not to bank my life on them more
than absolutely necessary, knowing their ocassionally erring ways. All it would
take in a system as described in previous issues would be once.

 &gt;&gt; Side note: Isn't the F-16 a fly-by-wire plane?  If electronic steering is
 &gt;&gt; safe, and reliable enough for combat jets, why wouldn't it be safe enough
 &gt;&gt; for everyday car?

Combat (and other jets) are maintained much better than cars, in general.
The FAA requires every airplane to pass a pre-flight check before the first
flight of each day.  How often does the average person give a pre-drive check
to his/her automobile before driving to work?

I was once driving a car when it suffered a complete power failure.  The main
cable from the battery had somehow worked it way next to the engine (probably
during a battery replacement), and the heat melted through the insulation,
shorting the +12 volt line to ground.  Everything stopped:  the engine, the
radio, the clock, etc.  Fortunately, the power steering and power brakes worked
even without power, and no damage occured.  I hate to think what would have 
happened if the car had had electronic steering.

I am not against electronic steering in principle; it does have its advantages
(if they design it right, it should be much easier to perform such maneuvers
as parallel parking in tight spots and making U-turns on small streets).  But
I would hope that the designers take into consideration the possibility of
a sudden and complete power loss while driving.

One RISKS reader (<A HREF="/Risks/4.49.html">RISKS-4.49</A>) asks why a system that is safe and reliable
enough for combat aircraft would not be safe enough for a car?

The answer is that combat aircraft receive a great deal of care and
preventive maintenance.  Cars, on the other hand, are often driven without
being properly maintained and their systems are not repaired until they
break down.  Mechanical systems are fairly reliable and degrade faily
smoothly.  (Brakes often make noise or become "mushy" before failing
completely.)  Electronic systems tend to simply stop working.  So in today's
car, you drive through a puddle and your engine dies (perhaps the power
steering dies as well), but you will have control of the car:  you can steer
and brake.  In tomorrow's car, you'll drive into the oncoming lane without
any control at all.
             				Kevin Oliveau

   [Electronic systems need not just stop working -- they may have failure
   modes that bear little resemblance to physical principles.  A wild
   transfer in a program or a dropped bit may result in strange behavior.

   Wet brakes may fail in either case.  For that matter, in each case there
   is the possibility of overreaction.  (I am reminded of the 1950's tale
   about the Swarthmore students who greased up a train track approaching a
   station.  The engineer applied full brakes when the train did not slow
   down; at the end of the greased section, the train and the clean track
   did not react well to one another...)  PGN]

  &gt;for everyday car?

(The following may be apocryphal...) A friend of mine once told me that
the first time a prototype F16 was taken out on the runway, its test
pilot tried to retract the F16's landing gear while on the ground.
The gear happily did so.  This caused a fair amount of damage to the
F16.  My friend speculated that this might not have happened had the
F16 not had a computer between the pilot and the landing gear.  I'm
not at all convinced that remote steering and such-like are safe at
all.  I can just see the folks at GM forgetting a couple of lines of
code in some important part of the steering program...

And there is another problem which I am not sure has even been brought up
here.  Aircraft are supposedly meticulously maintained (unless they are
owned by Eastern...).  Even with this high quality maintenance, accidents
happen.  What do you suppose will happen when you put sophisticated computer
steering equipment in a car that gets serviced when the owner feels like it?
We have enough trouble forcing cars to pass safety and emissions control
inspections without having to depend on car owners to get their on-board
steering computer inspected every year.

This originated in New England, not Old England ... and is from the
Boston Sunday Globe, 22 February 1987, editorial page.

                    WHAT THE COMPUTER KNEW

	The Reagan presidency may become the first to be done in by a
computer.  While legislators, investigators and reporters go sniffing
down the money trail, trying to track the flow of funds from Tehran to
Geneva to Honduras, an electronic archive in the White House has been 
leaking the most embarrassing facts to the Tower Commission.

	It is an irony of the computer age that an administration 
obsessed with secrecy allowed many of its secrets to be saved in an 
electronic memory bank.  All the computer messages Oliver North and his 
collaborators in covert action sent each other since Nov. 8 have been 
preserved.

	A nonpartisan system of software is now telling the Tower 
commission not only about the hardware sent to Ayatollah Khomeini, but
also abut frantic White House efforts to save the president from scandal.
The backup system for the White House computer reportedly shows that the
president's men tried to alter the history of what they did in order to
distance Reagan from his ill-considered policies.

	The computer messages are being compared to the tape recordings
of Richard Nixon.  If they demonstrate a White House attempt to design a 
cover-up, they may play the role of the Nixon tapes in the Watergate 
scandal.

	Messages indicating that North passed military intelligence to
Tehran, for use in Khomeini's destabilizing war against Iraq, suggest
that even now the White House has not told the full story of Reagan's 
concessions to the ayatollah.

	By preserving the tamper-proof truth of what government officials 
did or did not do, the electronic archive in the White House may add an
unforeseen dimension to the system of checks and balances bequeathed by the
Founding Fathers.

	This computer was not user-friendly.

   [Several readers noted that Alan Wexelblat meant NSC and not NSA in
   his message in <A HREF="/Risks/4.50.html">RISKS-4.50</A>.  However, I recall that several key NSC 
   phone conversations had been monitored by NSA fairly early in the game.

   The NSC archives remaining even after on-line copies were deleted and 
   hard-copies shredded is of course another instance of the hidden-residue
   problem in (allegedly) secure systems, i.e., a deletion is a deletion
   is not a deletion!  By the way, the assumption that the archives are
   tamperproof is of course bogus.  PGN]

I once spoke to someone who helped set up the fire brigade database in
Melbourne.  The system they use is to specify the intersection of two
streets.  Initially there were various integrity constraints in the
database, such as street names had to be at least two characters long,
streets didnt cross each other more than once etc.  Two streets violated
both conditions: S street (shaped like an S) crossed another street in three
places and Y street (shaped like a Y) crossed another stree in two points
(numbering must be rather confusing in Y St.!).  (The real world is not

    Is there anyone on this list who knows whether the air traffic control
radar systems have automatic collision alert systems?  And if they do, do
they work?  It seemed to me that if everyone were required to have Mode C
transponders (which automatically report the plane's altitude to the nearest
100 feet to the ATC computer), then it would be simple to write a program
which would detect possible collisions.  Arguments against this may include
that the controller would have much too many targets on his screen to handle
-- as it is now they often screen out all traffic that they are not working
with so that the planes do not even appear on their radarscope.  However, a
program such as I suggested could work on all planes, whether actually being
displayed on the scope or not, and maybe bring to the controller's attention
two planes on a collision course and altitude which were not being displayed
and would not have been noticed.

   [It is my understanding that the ground-based AUTOMATED collision alerts
   will be a part of the new system (currently in procurement).  But the
   expense of the on-board equipment seems to mitigate against its use in
   small private planes, which preset a very serious gap in the on-line
   information.  3-D radar might be more appropriate, especially since a
   Mode-C transponder could be faulty...  PGN]

     Another thing: what are people's opinions about autoland[ing]?  This
system, installed on many of the large passenger jets, will take over
control of eveything -- rudder, ailerons, and throttles -- from up to 20
miles out from the airplane, fly the approach, flare the plane, and actually
touch down, all automatically.  At present I believe only several thousand
complete autoland cycles have been flown at all.  I read in an aviation
magazine an article written by a 30,000 hour airline pilot about it; he said
when he went along for a demonstration of autoland it flew a flawless
approach, and he rated it well above the average human approach.  Plus it
can do this is any weather at all (in terms of visibility and cloud layers).
Certainly computers are not infallible, but neither are humans.  It may be
true that if pilots always used autoland they would not retain the flying
skills to take over in case of failure, but in some cases I can certainly
see a use.  For instance, a common time for minor incidents is when a plane
is nearing its destination after a long international flight.  After the
crew has spent maybe 4 hours acting only as "system monitors," now they must
suddenly start talking to people and actually flying the plane.  If one
would say that autoland is not good because pilots' skills would
deteriorate, is this not true of the autopilot, which does the flying for a
large part of most flights?

Seems to me a point that the other respondents missed here is that in a
military system, people are prepared to accept a certain number of deaths
due to failure, in order to have a higher performance system.  Look at the
number of military planes that crash while on maneuvers, and no-one thinks
much about it.  Similarly, one might put electronic steering on a race car,
if it was felt to offer a competitive advantage, and if the car crashed
during the race, "them's the breaks".

   [Another message on this subject was received from William Swan: ...
    Military planes undergo a lot of maintenance, logging, as I understand
    it, as much or more service time than flight time (if I am wrong, please
    provide the real numbers). ...]

  Subject: Re: James Burke (what a real blackout is like)
  Date: 17 Feb 87 17:57:55 GMT
  Organization: Hawaii Institute of Geophysics

  On Thanksgiving evening 1984, Hurricane Iwa---essentially without
  warning---hit the islands of Kauai and Oahu, destroying major portions of
  the electrical grids on both islands and knocking out all electrical
  generation.  It was several days before power was restored to portions of
  Honolulu (incidentally, the 11th most populous city in the United States),
  several weeks before power was completely restored.  One of the reasons it
  took so long was that all of the generators were designed to be
  "jump-started" from another running generator on the grid, and no one knew
  how to bootstrap up a generator all by itself.
  
  The whole story is rather too long to go into here, but here are some of the
  key points...
  
  There was no satellite meteorological coverage for the central Pacific,
  because the GOES East satellite had failed, and the GOES West had been moved
  over to cover the Atlantic...which the Weather Service figured was more
  important.  Weather observations from ships told of a strong hurricane
  developing west of the islands, but a military reconnaisance flight sent out
  on Thanksgiving day failed to accurately locate the storm.  There was no
  historical precedence for the path it took that led right to the population
  centers.
  
  In the afternoon, winds started rising, and the Weather Service issued a
  Hurricane Watch, then quickly a Warning, but still didn't have a precise fix
  on Iwa, nor accurate information on speed or direction.
  
  Early in the evening, after dark the winds started gusting well above 60
  mph, and the electrical grid went down, surprising the electrical utilities
  who had taken no precautions to isolate any of their systems...taking down
  all their generators.
  
  [This could be a separate story in itself, but suffice it to say that the
  Civil Defense Emergency Broadcast system didn't work.  Besides all the TV
  stations, all the radio stations---except one--- went off the air that
  night.  The single radio station that had an operating emergency generator
  was running "on automatic", playing religious music.]
  
  By the next day, one or two other radio stations were up (and the religious
  station had hastily converted to all-news), but power was still out...
  remaining out for days.  The first thing people missed was water, the water
  distribution system being driven by electrical pumps...though some places
  that had gravity feed from tanks above in the hills were lucky for a while.
  
  Traffic was a shambles since no traffic lights were working... though that
  became less of a problem over the next day or so since no gas stations were
  pumping and people realized that they were stuck with just whatever gasoline
  they happened to have in the tanks of their cars, and started being very
  careful about how they used that up.
  
  Food in refrigerators and freezers spoiled.  Long lines developed at grocery
  stores as people tried to buy more food...and clerks had to add up by hand.
  Most resturants stayed closed; the few that opened---cooking with gas---soon
  closed again as the city gas system began losing pressure.
  
  Electrical generators (even small ones) were not available for love nor
  money, ice and candles (when available) went for premium prices.
  
  The most-listened-to person in the islands was the spokesman for the
  electrical company who spent virtually all of his waking hours on one radio
  station or another detailing the repair work underway.
  
  Meanwhile, the electrical utility company crews worked around the clock to
  restore portions of the electrical grid, and devise ways to start up even
  one major generator.  I don't know the full story behind the restart effort,
  except that lots of different techniques were tried, one of which finally
  worked on Oahu. The Navy dispatched a nuclear submarine to Kauai in an
  effort to "jump start" the main generator there.
  
  It seemed like forever, but it was only a few days until electricity
  was available to some parts of Honolulu.
  
  We lived with rolling blackouts for about a week more.  Outlying areas
  on the islands weren't fully restored for over two weeks.
  
  There were some fatalities, due mostly to "freak" accidents of various
  kinds...and a small, but statistically significant "baby boomlet"
  some 9 months later.  If this had happenedd to a major mainland city
  in winter there would have been considerably more fatalities, and
  the story would be much more widely known.  As it was, if it had
  lasted too many more days, water would have become very critical...

         FUTURE TRENDS IN COMPUTER CRIME: THE POST-HACKER ERA

Dr. Sandy Sherizen is a criminologist and former information security 
expert who consults with corporations, banks, and Government Agencies on 
the prevention of computer crime.  Dr. Sherizen began his discussion 
by giving an impression based on the development of safes and safe 
cracking.  He talked about the overly technological nature by which 
safes improved and safecrackers got better.

What is important about Sandy speaking is that criminology is a well-
founded science and that many of the patterns in computer security have
been studied already in criminology.  (Sandy finds this shocking.)  We
would do well to learn from it.

Let me try to reproduce the sequence.  First, safe were created, and
crackers broke the locks.  Locks got tougher.  They went to combination
locks (and lock picking, separate area).  Next, they resorted to drills, and
the countermeasure was stronger metal.  Next came simple explosives again
followed by heftier metal, and more powerful explosives.  Around this time,
they discovered nitroglycerin which as a liquid can be poured into cracks.
They then discovered the use of oxyacetylene torches to cut thru.  Safe
makers retaliated with heat-conducting materials.  During this time, people
started kidnapping bankers and their families (a totally non-technical
solution to the problem).  This problem was "solved" using time-locks on
doors.  (I enjoyed the last example.)  Crime goes on.

In Sandy's thesis, there are 4 stages that we have to deal with in terms of
computers, and the talk itself was a series of rambling discussions.  The 4
stages, by the way, which worked in the case of banks, safes, and vaults,
are detailed in a book in Criminology which we can get as a reference.

Sandy's concerns are first:
  privacy, work, monitoring of work
  computerization of crime
  information property

Sandy also made some interesting comments, for instance, on the 
development of laws -- the concept of "moral entrepeneurship", a very
different kind of thing than most computer people are used to.

The Tylenol drug poisoning case is an interesting case -- the point 
is that no new laws were created, but a technological solution of tamper 
proof packages came into use.  That corporation on the whole had no 
policy for dealing with problems of this kind to begin with, and had 
inadequate protection in understanding them.

The reasons for commiting crime are interesting Criminological and
Sociological areas.  Basically, the common threat is a "trusted embezzler"
with an "unsharable resource" or "unsharable problem", and there are what is
called the 3 B's starting with Booze as the reason why people do regular
crimes.  The reason why people commit computer crimes is what is called the
3 C's:
 cash
 career
 challenge

Sandy also mentioned the fact that the media basically regards 
computer crimes as hi-tech soap opera.  We make criminals folk heroes, 
but at the same time we have to be able to protect whistle blowers.

The 4 stages in EDP growth have similar trends or patterns in the 
nature of computer crime.  This is called the Gibson-Noland Law on EDP 
growth.  The 4 stages:
 initiation
 expansion
 formalization
 maturity
as generalized to computer crime initiation begins with 
 first hit or miss crime 
such as in Steven Levy's book, "Hackers" which is popular and we are
transitioning out of this phase into a phase of
 expansion 
which includes lots of people and undetectable crime with many rewards.  [We
are] beginning "specialization," which is a formalization stage of crime
where the law gets into the act and the criminals themselves specialize in
criminal things like financial systems, or UNIX Systems, and so forth, but
in the formalization stages law gets interested and finally the fourth stage
of maturity there are a relatively predictable sequence of crimes.  Such as,
there is measure and countermeasure on part of the law enforcement as well
as the criminals themselves.

Sandy's basis for this talk is that were going to see new types of 
crime with a new series of targets: a new sense of how-to-do crime and 
how-to prevent crime.  Basically, they are categorized by the 414's
(the Milwaukee WI area code), teenagers who broke into computers.
When asked by a Congressional committee when he realized that he had
done something wrong, Neil Patrick pointed out "When the FBI was 
knocking on my door" -- there basically was hunt and peck computer crime.  

So Sandy's predictions for future directions of computer crimes are 
threefold:

  First of all there will be fewer crimes on computers, but they
  will be of a much more serious nature, because there is 
  survival of the fittest -- and organized crime will get into it.  We see 
  some people who won't quit but who have to learn about criminal 
  elements such as, laundering money, not leaving fingerprints, and so 
  forth which would basically defeat the older generation criminals. 

  The second thing will be more technological opportunities to 
  commit crime, such as photocopying with copying machines and money.

  The third prediction is more internationalization of crime.  (There was a 
  brief aside after the internationalization regarding viruses, and the 
  typical example of this was given in the piece of software known as 
  eggbeater and also by the book Soft War -- eggbeater was a program 
  that literally ate up data and dropped away ...)

Another area of concern was the area of modes of learning about crime.
Sandy was concerned with the suicide epidemic noted by the Center for
Disease Control, and uses the name "copy-cat crime".  (Example of copycat
crimes are in the movie "War Games" and in use of Automatic Teller Machines
(ATM).)

The professionalization of crimes involves such things as raids and
reverse-engineering files and records not just in a sense of building
things.  But changing records -- we're going to see more.  Again, the
evolution of specialization -- more collusion perhaps between individuals
who commit crimes.  A good example of this is the Walker spy trial; this is
a serious crime but the public will not see it as a serious crime, just as
it does not see white collar as a serious crime.

Part of the problem is that we look upon things such as pens and pencils as
free, which come with the territory as far as working.  Because of offices,
nobody thinks of it as a crime unless you come literally and haul the pens
and pads away using a truck; that's just like taking a disk for a computer
home, its not really regarded as a serious thing unless the entire payroll
is located on it.  So a large part of this is public awareness and education
in terms of how to deal with crime.

Privacy is the issue that we really probably need to work on the most, Sandy
said -- the needs and problems of technology invading privacy and that what
we should do (in particular) is worry about that as opposed to trying to
solve all computer crime problems.

Sandy is a friend of Dr. Lucy Suchman at the Xerox, Palo Alto Research
Center (PARC) and if we want to get in any further contact with him
the best thing to do is contact him through Lucy. I believe he's
teaching at MIT.  Also in attendance was Donn Parker (SRI International)
who is also well known.  

There was considerably more discussion than was involved on this 
tape.  Correspondents should send electronic mail to me, for further 
information.

    [Lightly edited.  Garbles could be mine or Eugene's ...  
    This is included primarily for our newer readers, in that RISKS
    has gone over much of this ground on various occasions in the past.  PGN]

(From the Stanford Daily, 26 Feb 87, in the "Dateline" section, compiled
from the wires of the AP and the LA Times/Washington Post News Service)

WASHINGTON -- Government investigators said Wednesday that as many as half
of the new B-1 bombers at a Texas air base have been grounded in recent
weeks because of nagging technical problems and that the aircraft's
shortcomings may persist well into the next decade, contrary to public
statements by the Air Force.  During hearings before subcommittees of the
House Armed Services Committee, Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis, said the bomber's
heart -- its defensive electronics system -- not only fails to jam enemy
radar signals but actually serves as a beacon illuminating the B-1 as a
target.  Government Accounting Office officials ... testified that the
problems with the $28.3 billion bomber program, especially the critical
defensive electronic countermeasures (ECM), are far more serious than Air
Force officials have acknowledged.  GAO officials also predicted that the
Air Force will have to ask Congress for substantially more money in coming
years to repair and upgrade the bomber.

	The Los Angeles bus system (also known as the Rapid Transit
District (RTD)) uses a computer to keep track of its buses.  The computer
knows which bus is traveling which route at what starting time.  The
computer also has the complete time schedule information.  The computer
can be used to estimate the position of any bus using this information.

	On Feb. 25 the driver in trouble radio alarm was set off on bus
#181, the computer was asked where the bus was and the LAPD was notified.
The LAPD patrol unit that responded to the call could not find the bus, so
they called in more units.  They still could not find the bus and asked for
a helicopter to help search for it.

	After about a hour, the bus driver was located in the drivers'
lounge at the bus yard.  The bus was in the repair yard and the repair crew
had accidentally set of the alarm.  It turned out that the driver had
assumed that the repair yard had told the RTD computer that the bus was out
of service, and the repair yard thought that the driver had told it.

There was a very interesting documentary on BBC TV in their QED series here
last night, entitled "A Fall from Grace: Patterns of Human Error", which
contained quite a bit of material of relevance to RISKS.

     The programme (Yes, that is how even I spell it when it isn't intended
for a computer!) used as its principal illustrations the 1977 collision of
two Jumbo jets at Tenerife airport, and the task on making tea! Various
types of human error were described, and discussed with several experts,
including Professor Jim Reason, (Dept of Psychology, Univ. of Manchester),
Dr. Ivan Brown (Applied Psychology unit, Medical Research Council), and
David Embrie (sp?), an ergonomist from Aston University.

     The principal thing which I learnt, to my shame, from the programme was
that psychologists seem have done a lot of useful study of the many different
types of errors that even highly trained human beings make when exercising a 
sophisticated skill.

     Some comments I jotted down:

(1) One could learn much of relevance regarding the errors made in carrying
out highly skilled safety-critical tasks, such as piloting an airplane, or
in a nuclear control room, from studying the errors made in inconsequential
tasks (hence the tea making example, which when you think about it, does
involve considerable, albeit informal, training) - i.e., the underlying causes
seem to be similar, even if the consequences of errors are grossly
different.

(2) With a highly skilled activity, you make more mistakes if you do it
consciously. This particularly applied to "sequencing" errors, such as
missing or repeating a step. For example, if you are so following a
well-known sequence of actions, on mental auto-pilot, and then suddenly
become aware of your actions, there is a good chance of your resuming the
sequence at the wrong place.

(3) When you have learnt two similar sequences, you have, so to speak,
constructed two similar competing "action daemons" - one can acccidentally
switch to the wrong one. This was illustrated with an account of how one of
the pilots (who was very skilled, and spent much time training others) was
thought to have reverted to a pattern of actions which he was familiar with
from simulator training, which did not quite match reality in the way that
the pilot was supposed to communicate with the air traffic controller.

(4) One characteristic of error-proneness concerns the notion of "field
dependence" - some people have difficulty, and are slow, at picking out a
relevant object from a complex field of view - a sort of mental tunnel
vision, for which there are standard tests. Pilot training would probably
select such people out, but drivers might well suffer from this, and the
idea of using the standard tests to decide whether someone should have a
driving licence was unlikely to be acceptable.

     The programme also contained a well-illustrated, though to me rather more
expectable, account of the problems of designing interfaces to try to minimise
human error - mainly illustrated by control room design, with reference to
Three mile Island. 

     Today I telephoned Prof Reason, and had a very interesting chat with
him. We have arranged that he will come and give a talk to our Systems
Research Group, and I have been given the following interesting sounding
reference: New Technology and Human Error (ed. J. Rasmussen, K. Duncan, &amp; J.

Since WWN is usually quite authentic, I will entertain some speculation on
the topic. While 'electric currents' cannot be ruled out (an incompetent
electrician could put full voltage into the 'ground' and many countries use
220V rather then US style 110V), the most likely explanation seems be the
good old 'VDT stress'. (VDT = Video Display Terminal).

There is a big volume of writing on the topic and even some solid
information. Radiation (soft x-rays from CRT) was often blamed but informed
consensus (which agrees well with my own observations) is that stress is
psychological. Introduction of any 'computerised system' could be an
enormous trauma to people who were never exposed to the computers (even when
all you do is replace IBM Selectrics with the word processors &lt;=:: I have
seen secretaries crying and thinking of quitting or even retiring from the
workforce for good).

The proper procedure for converting to computer system is as follow:

 1) Introduce terminals to the workplace, while doing the 'real work' with
     the old, manual system.
 2) Put some games on the machine and let people play with VDTs (perhaps
    after hours or during lunch breaks).
 3) Introduce e-mail, first just as alternative to phone call or memo,
    so that it is not NEEDED to get the job done.
 4) When everybody (as measured by volume of use) is comfortable with
    the system, put some work-functions on the new system.
 5) After a month or two, convert the rest. (You may find out that some
    people will quit or ask for a transfer, even with slow transition;
    those requests for transfer should be honored from the start.)

I wonder how may 'mysterious accidents' that occur after new 'sophisticated 
safety systems' (e.g. in nuclear power plants) are introduced are caused by
ignoring these simple common sense rules.

I generally favor the broad interpretation of what gets into this list.
In that spirit, I offer the following item from the San Diego Evening
Tribune of Feb. 25.  It may or may not be "computer risk" related:

     "Los Angeles (AP) - Dialing a telephone is sometimes a gamble, as
callers found out when they got "Dial-Porn" instead of state lottery
information because of a switched line.
     "Pacific Bell fixed the problem yesterday, but before that callers
heard a suggestive recorded message from a sultry-voiced woman when they
sought Saturday's winning lottery numbers.
     "Maria de Marco, who manages 976 prefix lines for Pacific Bell, said
it wasn't known whether the switch was a prank or an accident..."

     [Since most telephone systems are now extensively computer controlled,
     this certainly falls into the class of human misuse of computers.  PGN]

In the same paper there was another item, also datelined Los Angeles,
that described the confusion of some Lawrence Welk compact disk buyers
when their mislabeled and mispackaged CDs turned out to contain the
soundtrack from a movie about former Sex Pistols member Sid Vicious.

     [I decided not to delete this paragraph on technology-irrelevance
     grounds.  It could have been a computer-related problem!  PGN]

If a computer is involved in these instances, it would appear to be one 
with a sense of humor.

[...]
As a firefighter in Monroe County (where Rochester is located) I can offer some
insight to the troubles of the 911 system here. The 911 dispatch center here
provides services for more than 80 county-wide emergency agencies (police,
fire, ambulance). That is reportedly more than any 911 center in the US.
Among the problems encountered are that fire district boundaries don't match
postal service boundries which don't match ambulance service boundries which
don't match town boundries, etc. Therefore when the ALI indicates a particular 
address is in Town X is is necessary for the dispatcher to turn to another 
screen and determine which police/fire/ambulance agencies are to be dispatched.

Other problems encountered with 911 include the fact that the entire county
is served by more that one phone company. Most of the county is served
by Rochester Telephone which has set up its computers to route all
Monroe County 911 calls to the 911 dispatch center. There are however
locations in the county which are served by New York Telephone. NYT has
set up its computers to route the 911 calls from Monroe County to the
Syracuse dispatch center (70 miles east). The dispatcher on the Syracuse
end must recognize the call is from Monroe County and route the call to
the Monroe 911 center. There are also areas of the county served by
Ogden Telephone. I don't know how they handle the 911 calls.

  &gt;(Incidentally, the county Commissioner of Public Safety took this
  &gt;occasion to complain about duplicate street names within the county ...

While it is not clear that eliminating duplicate street names would
have avoided the above problem, it would eliminate other problems.
Not all emergency calls received by the 911 dispatch center come in
via the 911 number.  Many calls are still received on the old 7 digit
number.  When a call comes in on that number the pertinent data for
the address is not displayed. The dispatcher must then determine
which one of the many duplicates the caller is referring to. I recall hearing
6 fire departments dispatched one day to a false alarm on East Avenue
because there are multiple East Avenues within the county. The call
was received on the 7 digit number and the caller gave incomplete
information to the dispatcher (intentionally I imagine). The county feels
that it must continue to provide service on the 7 digit number since
for many years phone stickers were distributed with that 7 digit number. Also
the residents the the areas served by New York Tel are encouraged to use
the 7 digit number to avoid delays by going through Syracuse.

Here in Howard Co. Md., the county government took a big step years ago and
renumbered all the addresses so that with in some quanta the street numbers
are not only unique, but they also give the physical location of the property. 
This has done wonders for getting the FD to the right place.  Unfortunately...

"Laurel" phone exchanges lie in four counties; Laurel zip codes in three.
This makes dialing 911 a bit of an adventure because you had better know
which county you are in.  Sometimes even this doesn't help.  One zip code
was believed by the counties to lie entirely in P.G. county, when in fact a
small piece of it lay in Montgomery County.  This meant that these people
got no county services-- no fire, no trash, nothing.  After years of bickering,
the Postal Service cut the gordian knot and created a new zip code just for
these people.  The moral: "Garbage in, Gospel out" doesn't just apply to
computers; they can "bless" information that never came near them!

Since the discussion has once again come around to the use of computers in
cars the "... most important single automotive advance since the accelerator
pedal ..." may be of interest.

There have been a number of articles in British motoring magazines (Car Oct
86, Fast Lane Jan 87) over the last few months describing the Lotus "Active"
suspension. This consists of a replacement for the normal passive suspension
of dampers, springs, and anti-roll bar, by a sensing system, computer, and a
set of hydraulically controlled actuators. The sensors return the cars
relative movement and driver inputs, and the computer adjusts the actuators
to compensate.  The resulting handling characteristics are by all accounts
superb - no roll, no understeer, no oversteer, just perfectly balance
handling.  Various parameters used by the computer may be adjusted to
provide different levels of ride, prompting one of the writers to speculate
that it would "be possible to build a schizophrenic car with His and Hers
alternative handling at the flick of a dashboard switch."

One of the more contentious claims of the system is that "it is truly
fail-safe". By providing a "get-you-home stand-by suspension" computer
failure does not render the car unusable. One of the articles even describes
the cars behaviour when the system is "dumped" as the car is negotiating a
corner - the car switches suddenly from neutral handling to oversteer
prompting the driver to think one of the rear tyres had punctured. What they
didn't try was the effects of over compensation though!

It will be a few years before active suspensions appear in cars (Lotus are
intending to use it in their supercar the Etna which they are currently
developing), but given that Lotus have been recently bought by GM, and a
number of rivals (notably Mercedes-Benz) are developing similar systems, then
this should provide another fertile area for discussion when the time comes....

     It is true that Mode C capability costs a bit of money, but I think
the majority of people who own planes could afford the extra $1500 or so,
especially considering the added safety.

     As to 3-D radar, it would be very nice but I am under the impression
that it is quite impossible, realistically speaking, with the present
technology.  A professor here at MIT who flew for the Navy for 20 years
told me it is reasonable to make altitude-detecting RADAR, but that it
is only economically reasonable for tracking a single target at a time.
Aircraft such as the F-14 and F-16 can track several targets at once, but
those systems are very expensive and have MTBF averages of only several
hours of operation because of their complexity.

I think an apology is in order.  I sent my notes to the CPSR Sherizen talk
to Peter (not with the intention of posting to the net).  Locally, we are
trying to have discussions on security trying to forego problems of
discussing security both when it was tried in unix-wizards (and it
subsequent list) and info-vax (for the VMS side).  Although the Sherizen
meeting of CPSR was open, our other meetings are not (they are not
classified either).

Regarding auto-land: I don't know if I would trust such a system yet.  I
know few pilots who would not feel at least a little uncomfortable.
Actually, I think systems like this would be great Darwinian tests of
AI.  The posting implied we control everything.  This is not true.
The plane is not everything, there are other planes and obstacles out there.

Put the developer on the plane, let his or her system land the plane.
If the plane survives, the developer goes on to create their next system.
(Might not be enough, but a good first cut.)
Similar tests for things like MYCIN, etc. can be used (infect using a blood
disease, developer then must trust system for diagnosis ;-).  Sound a little
too real world?  We know less about the real world than many think.  Thinking
is not enough.

Use of automated landing also would leave the crew more free to spend its
time looking for things out of the ordinary -- unreported traffic, patterns
of air movement, the effect of the wind on preceding traffic, the overall
condition of the aircraft -- that automated systems are not good at detecting.

In Risks Digest 4.51, Matthew Machlis questions whether there may be
risks of pilots losing their flying skills, due to flying for extended
periods on autopilot.

At a conference last year, I spoke to folks from a major commercial aircraft
manufacturer, who were concerned about the same thing.  (One of the
speculations about KAL 007 was that the pilots just `lost track' of what
they were doing.)  This firm had the thought of dividing the cockpit in two,
using one half for flying the real airplane, and the other half for a
training simulator.  The pilots would trade off acting as `system monitor'
and practicing `real' problem flying.  The problem with this solution was
loss of orientation, along the lines of "Oh, damn, I just put the plane in
an unrecoverable spin; well, restart... that's funny, nothing seems to
happen...  Ohmygod, I'm sitting on the *real* side".

Another key difference, which to me seems just as important as the
maintenance issues already mentioned, is that cars (generally!) aren't
fitted with ejection seats.  A driver can't punch out when things get weird.

Also, cars tend to be operated in much more crowded conditions.  Usually in
fighters (except possibly during takeoff and landing), you really don't have
to worry about what your plane will come crashing down on, because most
operations (both real and training) occur over very sparse areas.  In a
runaway car, on the other hand, you stand a significant chance of wreaking
considerable havoc among other vehicles travelling in your vicinity, as well
as bystanders and property near the roadway.

    Winds from Hurricane Iwa passed through a small mountain pass, gathered
pressure from the narrow slit, and knocked out power lines which carried
power to most of Central Oahu.  They also did serious damage to an army base
on the exiting winds side of the pass, opening warehouses filled with emergency
supplies like sardine cans, or ripping the prefabricated buildings away from 
their foundations while leaving the contents sitting.
    The base was without power for three weeks, and without water for about
two.  The Mayor of Honolulu asked the military for help, and they refused
(being much harder hit than the civilian community, mainly due to the damage
at this base).  There were several scathing editorials in the Advertiser,
but the military did not really release any information about the extent of
the damage.
    The island of Kauai was worst hit.  Although the generating system was not 
heavily damaged, there was no way to restart the generators without power, as
no one had foreseen that all the turbines would go down at once.  The Navy sent
a nuclear submarine from Pearl Harbor over to Kauai to provide power for the 
starters, but by the time it arrived, the engineers had restarted the system,
using almost a hundred automotive batteries.

&gt;  In the afternoon, winds started rising, and the Weather Service issued a
&gt;  Hurricane Watch, then quickly a Warning, but still didn't have a precise fix
&gt;  on Iwa, nor accurate information on speed or direction.

    At about noon, state employees were sent home, schools were cancelled.
I was in downtown Honolulu at 3:00 or so.  All the shop windows were taped up,
and a cold, dry breeze blew through the streets, picking up bits of paper and
carring them around.  There was not another soul on the streets, and I was not
able to get back to the base, as all the buses had stopped.  I eventually got
someone to come down and pick me up, and we were the only car on the roads.
I don't know much about the damage to Honolulu, being stuck on base for a while
because I had no form of transportation (tree fell on car).

&gt;  [This could be a separate story in itself, but suffice it to say that the
&gt;  Civil Defense Emergency Broadcast system didn't work.  Besides all the TV
&gt;  stations, all the radio stations---except one--- went off the air that
&gt;  night.  The single radio station that had an operating emergency generator
&gt;  was running "on automatic", playing religious music.]

  Nope.  Radio station KGU was on almost all the time, on their standby 
generator.  They were off for a few hours when their antenna was damaged, but
brought the transmitter (at the studio site) back up with a long wire dipole.
At first they were calling various authorities, but after the phone went out,
they just sat around and played music, complaining about the weather.

  I don't think that the extent of the damage to the military installations
was ever revealed, so you can probably say you saw it first here.  It doesn't
have much to do with risks from computer systems, but it does have a bit to
do with risks to computer systems, as well as anything else that uses 
electricity.  At least, I know my PDP-11 did go down at the time.

Can we knock this one on the head once and for all?  The patent for this did
exist but was allowed to lapse by AT&amp;T.  The proper use of setuid is of course 
NOT nonsecure and does allow the easy implementation of certain facilities. 
Badly used, yes it can be nonsecure, but don't knock it because of that!!

         [It is precisely BECAUSE it allows easy implementation that it is
         so frequently misused -- by people who don't know better.  Use of
         "setuid" opens up the possibility of a variety of security flaws,
         including Trojan horses, search-path traps, etc., and tends to
         substantially widen the perimeter of trust.  I'm not sure that
         anyone knows how to characterize "proper use" completely -- if
         it is indeed possible at all.  PGN]

I read this today and wonder if I would really regard this as a risk.  We
have Use, Abuse, and Misuse.  I sometimes (emphasis) like to believe that
the last two are not possible -- that a different word is needed.  Yes, I
acknowledge that the Mafia can use dBase II, or the people at kremvax use
Lotus on separate PCs ;-).

Remember: light behaves like a particle on MWF and a wave on TTS.  This might
be a useful technique.

  What a wonderful thing to see:

    &gt;  Today I telephoned Prof Reason, and had a very interesting chat with
    &gt;  him. We have arranged that he will come and give a talk ...

  It upholds some faith in the value of television.

  You might ask Dr. Reason [interesting name] about the role in the past of
  things such as ritual, mnemonics and (devices) [programmes] as this was the
  way things were done in the past before writing, and it also probably helped
  with the development of such arts as poetry.  I think this is important (if
  you have not realized this) because of proposals for nuclear waste include
  monuments and the creation, literally, of a "priesthood" to deal with
  nuclear waste.  Could similar such priesthoods develop for computers (some
  would say we have such now)?

  A follow-up report on Dr. Reason's seminar would be most interesting.
  I wish I could attend.  Thank the net.

Sigh!  This hits home.  When I was in high school, I had a job with
North American Rockwell designing parts for the B-1 after school.
Three stiffeners are mine.  It was always interesting to be sitting
trying to figure out how to design something when some one would walk
in with a requirement for a hole (right there).  Why?  Avionics.  Nothing
more would be said.  You were not supposed to ask as an airframe person.
Interesting to see that all this comes back to the avionics people.

   [This provides an interesting lesson to programmers who don't understand
   the environment in which a program is expected to run.
   In response to my query of Eugene on "stiffeners", he replied thusly:]

Angle brackets used in homes are stiffeners.  They fit into corners to make
the structure more rigid.  Interesting asides: there are two philosophies in
building aircraft.  (I was told this as a young engineer, and I passed it on
the space group recently WRT multi-piece SRB design.)  You make can make
aircraft from a few large pieces, or from many small pieces.  Boeing is a
big pieces company and Rockwell (my ex while in HS) was a small-pieces
company.  Tradeoffs in both directions: like multics and unix, pl/1 and c.

I am a little confused about all the recent discussion in Risks about
pilot problems with autolanders, etc.  I read a paper written in the 
early 70's about how the autolander for the L1011 was verified.  So 
there are already autolanders in operation and have been for a long time.  
Yes, they use analog computers rather than digital computers, which 
makes a difference in implementation techniques and perhaps reliability, 
but should make no difference from the pilot's point of view.   Perhaps 
I am missing something here?   Does a digital autoland system perform
different functions than an analog one?

I would be equally unhappy being a passenger in an autolanding plane as
I would be living in a chronic state of "launch-on-warning" nuclear
policy.  In either case the machinery makes the ongoing critical
decisions, and the people supervising it just *might* be able to notice
a problem, acquaint themselves with recent system actions, and make the
appropriate correction (if still possible).  In indeterminate, complex
situations such as strategic nuclear systems and plane landings, I am
much happier if the (admittedly fallible) humans are making the ongoing
decisions, with a possibility that machinery might notice a problem and
warn them.  The "supervisors" stand a much better chance of being able
to react appropriately to an unexpected situation if they have the
"feel" of the system by already having been in control of it.

Miliary aircraft not only get maintained more often than the average
car, but they are also designed and manufactured to more exacting and
demanding specifications than their civilian counterparts.  Military
hardware in general is designed to operate correctly in wider range of
operating conditions and more thoroughly tested.

Military software must also meet certain coding standards and go
through formal verification testing before being approved.

Now, none of this guarantees that all errors are caught (especially
the software errors).  You do, though, have some guarantees about
whatever can be tested properly such as component quality, and
RFI-shielding.

Given the amount of testing and verification a MIL-spec steer-by-wire
car would have to endure before being accepted, I might consider driving
a steer-by-wire car with software that had been coded and tested under
military specs and ran on MIL-spec, RFI-shielded hardware.

Given the history of electronic ignition systems however, I wouldn't come
near a steer-by-wire car that had been developed and manufactured to
"GM-specs".

According to the CBS Evening News, the National Weather Service issued a
report that Rockford Illinois was destroyed by a killer tornado this morning.  
The report was picked up by the media and reported as fact.  Rockford is
still there, the NWS was just testing a new reporting mechanism.  The report
should not have been issued.  The NWS blames faulty computer software.

The Number 4 ESS system in Dallas went down for much of the day on
Wednesday, 25 February 1987, blocking most long-distance calls in and out of
area code 214.  Both the main system and the backup system failed.  One
smart company was Fidelity Investor Information, which was able to reroute
incoming calls (presumably through an 800 number?) to phone centers in
Boston and Salt Lake City.  Multilevel layers of redundancy seem like a
good practice.  [Source: Austin American Statesman, 26 Feb 87, p. D11,

     repair personnel were not allowed in the building until after 5 p.m.
     During the same week, a Chesapeake &amp; Potomac switching center also

In this decade there have been at least a dozen dock crashes in the Puget
Sound ferry system (the largest such system in the USA) that were
attributable to onboard computer failures.  The damages for one crash alone
(12 September 1986) cost an estimated $750,000 in repairs to the Whidbey
Island dock.  The $17 million mid-sized Issaquah ferries [100 cars, 1200
passengers] came on board in 1980 with the slogan, "Computerized propeller
systems make the ferries more fuel efficient."  The state sued the ferry
builder (the now bankrupt Marine Power &amp; Equipment of Seattle), which agreed
to pay $7 million over 10 years.  The state's recommendation now is to spend
an extra $3 million cutting 6 ferries over to MANUAL CONTROLS.

       [It is disappointing that the fix is to bypass the computer systems,
       rather than to make them work.  Nevertheless, accepting reality is
       clearly a good idea.  Although they did not have a gift horse in whose
       mouth to look, perhaps Seattle still believes in the truth ferry.]

I had the good fortune to tour General Electric's Grove City, PA diesel
engine manufacturing plant on Friday.  The plant manager, who was conducting
the tour, was especially proud of the highly automated machine tools and the
computerized engine testing cells.  They are so confident of the process-
control computers' ability to detect problems that the employees in charge
of watching the process are allowed to take a break while things keep
running.  I found this appalling.  The fact that the test cells were made of
reinforced concrete to shield the rest of the facility from an engine
explosion did not make me feel any better.

The plant is currently running at less than one third of capacity.  I 
wonder what surprises they are in for if and when it starts running at or
near capacity?

The March 2, 1987, issue of the `New Yorker', has a discussion of `people
meters' in its editorial column.  The two major television audience-rating
companies, Nielsen and AGB, are each going to switch from a paper-and-pencil
diary system of recording viewing samples, to an automatic electronic system
that is connected to the viewing family's television sets and VCRs.

There will be some measurement effects: ` ``Here's something that
causes us concern, '' Mr. Dominus (a vice-president of CBS) stated. ``To
install this system, a man has to wire your house. Let's say you've got
two sets and a VCR.  He has to literally solder stuff to your equipment.
When you walk into the room and turn on the set, you have to punch in, and
when you go out of the room you punch out.  I would say there's a personality
bias toward people with a high-tech style.  Now, some people are technology-
adverse -- I'm one of them, so I ought to know.  They say, `I don't want to
do this.'  How do you adjust for that mind-set?'' '

Apparently the advertising agencies will want `a money-back guarantee that
a given commercial would reach a givena number -- and type -- of viewer.'
The networks, because of the unknown nature of the measurement effects,
want to avoid giving such guarantees, particularly on $3.7G worth of business,
the amount of up-front advertising that was sold last year.  They would
like to forego guarantees this next year to `save the networks a fortune
in unfairly assumed risk.'

Toward the end of the article it is revealed that the actual system under
discussion is a `real-time electronic diary', instead of a true `people
meter', which would function in a totally passive way, leaving no room for
human error (such as forgetting to punch in).  `Computerized voice
identification' and `miniature radio transmitters built into the family
jewelry' are mentioned as research directions...

Occasionally, one encounters a truly lovely algorithm. Often they can be
recognized by their simplicity.

A friend of mine discovered such an algorithm on the Burroughs 6700, lo these
many years ago. It all came about because he was debugging a database manager.
One day, it attempted to use a somewhat random number as in index into a 
data file.

Now, my friend had a budget, and received bills monthly from the computer
centre. The next bill was shocking, and in fact, wasn't even believable.
He had been charged for more disk space than the centre owned.

It was obvious that the billing software didn't really know how large the files
were. Instead, the biller trusted each user program to end at the end of its
file. In the true spirit of experimental science, my friend changed his
program so that it would always finish by accessing at index zero.

A computer system, installed at airports to help to speed cargo deliveries, has
been withdrawn from service after it collapsed as soon as it was switched on
(Our Air Correspondent writes).

Now cargo agents are considering taking the airlines which own the computer to
court because, they claim, they have lost up to 5million pounds as a result of
the failure.

The computer was installed by travicom, a company jointly owned by British
Airways and British Caledonian.

After a meeting of more than 100 freight forwarding agents yesterday Mr. Chris
Quintin of the cargo company LEP said: "The system was simply unable to cope
with the requirements we put on it.  As a result cargo and freight was held up
all over the country, diverted from one airport to another and couldn't clear
Customs because they were plugged into it too."

Travicom has offered 500,000 pounds.

ReSent-To: RISKS@CSL.SRI.COM

(1) Yesterday (2nd March) the bank machine swallowed my card when I asked
for some money, claiming that it had expired. Not having checked the date
beforehand I didn't know if this was true or not, but I hadn't received
a replacement card in the post in advance which usually happens.

When I cashed a cheque today in my branch and complained about this, I was
told that I was not alone. All the cards for customers of the branch which
were due to expire in June had expired in February instead although the
computer wasn't planning to send out the replacements until June. I assume
that there was a discrepancy between what was printed on the front of the
card and what was encoded in the magnetic strip on the back.

(I got the impression from the cashier that all the cards issued
by the branch expired on the same date {June} so that the problem
was actually quite serious. However, there didn't seem to be many
irate customers about, and people were using the machine outside
{although possibly with cards issued by different branches}, so
maybe I was mistaken in this impression.)

(2) Every year the Royal Shakespeare Company brings their current
productions to Newcastle before taking them to London. This year the Theatre
Royal has acquired a nice new computerised booking system that prints your
name on the ticket and lets you choose where you want to sit on the screen.
       [I hate sitting on screens.  The electrostatic effect is annoying.  PGN]

When I went in about a week ago to try and get some tickets for one of the
productions, I was told that although there were plenty of seats available,
I couldn't buy any tickets because the computer was down.  (However, I was
able to get a couple of returns for Midsummer Night's Dream the old
fashioned manual way). Apparently the machine was still broken several days
later so they can't have been able to sell any tickets in the meantime - it
is perhaps just as well that the Shakespeare productions are usually sold
out months in advance.

The columnists Evans &amp; Novak were interviewing Gen. Brent Scowcroft on their
CNN show Sunday.  They asked him if the information retrieved from the NSC
computer archives provided data that was not found anywhere else.  He
replied no -- they would have been able to track it down from other sources.
However, it was instrumental in showing that North was not working in a
vacuum -- there were on-line copies of memos that he wrote to higher-ups,
keeping them informed of his activities.

You know that I am not a fan of N-version programming.  However, I must say
that the tale is not as scary as might have been implied by the "man at the
FAA".  Sperry Avionics was recently purchased by Honeywell and I have been
working with the people who are advocating this N-version approach.  The
following is my own opinion and not that of my employer ... etc.

What Sperry wants to do is use N-version software in place of "white box"
(structural) tests.  The "black box" (functional) tests would be still be
performed.  Specifically, Sperry has asked the FAA for concurrence on using
the N-version techniques described in Larry Yount's 1984 AIAA paper 84-2603
and Level 2 software V&amp;V {referring to RTCA/DO-178A, which uses 3 levels of
software (depending on criticality):  Level 1 (Critical), Level 2 (Essential),
Level 3 (Non-Essential)}.

In its letter to Sperry, the FAA says that this method "appears to be
satisfactory" with the following constraints:

a. Level 1 must used for paragraphs 6.2.2 (Requirements Development and
   Verification) and 6.2.3 (Design).
b. Formal configuration control must used and, if common errors are found,
   structural testing may be required for some or all of the modules.
c. Formal review and comparison of source code must be used to verify
   dissimilarity.  Where this is not feasible, Level 1 structural test and
   analysis must be used.
d. Functional tests of the system must be performed.  It must be shown that
   the system will not have false alarms.

It seems to me that c. is the same as doing structural analysis.  Therefore,
this method is not any less rigorous than "full" DO-178A Level 1.  However,
how one complies with c. and d. I do not know.

I think that it is relevant to point out that pilots of military jets
have a very good record of steering a broken plane so that it crashes
in a safe area, sometimes at the cost of their own lives. How many of
us would do the same in a car? Also, all the rear-wheel steer-by-wire
systems which I have heard about have been designed to be fail-safe, by
locking the rear wheels in the straight-ahead position, which makes
them the same as current-day cars. Should they fail in a locked-over
position then the driver would feel some steering drag, but nothing
uncontrollable. Some show vehicles have had full steer-by-wire, but
this is at no more than the experimental stage.

Concerning steer-by-wire cars, why would you want one in the first place ?
I can understand the use on a large airplane where it would be almost
impossible to fly without some sort of power system. But with a car, where
it seems that it easy to have direct mechanical linkage for steering as well
as a power system, why bother ? It's also probably safer that way too.
Mechanical linkage steering does not have a very high incidence of failure.

As far as  my sketchy  knowledge goes, the  audience ratings
here in  Germany  are collected  (or soon will be)  by  true
'people meters'.  A box with phone line  access is hardwired
into the TV, and it detects and records what channel is being viewed when.
The central data collection office dials up each viewers' meter overnight,
and the data are sucked up for processing.  The one thing the box can't do
is know who is actually looking at the TV; for this a hand-held thingummy
(rather like a TV remote control) is supplied, which has a button for each
member of the family (and and extra one for visitors - isn't that very
hospitable of them!).  People are supposed to 'clock in' and out their
personal viewing with the buttons.

Personally I wouldn't be caught dead with such a thing.  Big Brother would
have to do almost nothing to monitor an awful lot of your life, almost in
real time.

AT&amp;T computer failure stalls area 214 calls

  DALLAS (AP) -- Long distance telephone service was back to normal Thursday
in Dallas and across a vast area of North Texas after thousands of calls
were blocked for hours because of a computer problem, an AT&amp;T spokesman
says.  "Our number four electronic switching system, which is essentially a
large computer that switches long-distance clals into and out of the 214
Area Code, failed," Diane Schwilling, media relations manager for AT&amp;T, said
Wednesday.  "The machine handles between 500,000 and 600,000 in its busiest
hours. It's capable of handling more than that," she said.
  The problem began about 9 a.m. Wednesday and by 2 p.m. the company had
begun processing calls through the switch again.  "From about 3 to about 4
it was handling calls real well," Ms. Schwilling said. Then, there were more
problems.  At 6 p.m., she said service was near normal and that no other
work on the computer was planned for Wednesday night.  The malfunction
affected long-distance calls primarily into and out of the 214 area, so
anyone calling into or out of the area could have been affected, she said.
  "Other parts of Texas may have gotten more busy signals than normal simply
because during the busy hours of the days, the Dallas switch acts as a backup
and would pick up overflow traffic from other parts of the state," Ms.
Schwilling said.

For the program committee for the 1988 ACM CSC to be held in Atlanta, I'm
organizing a panel session on liability issues in software.  The intent is
to have the panel address issues more related to the legal aspects rather
than methods of software engineering methods or ethical considerations of
using computers, although those also may be fair game.

I'd appreciate suggestions from Risks readers as to people you'd like to see
on the panel.  Please include some reasons why you think the people you are
nominating would be interesting, and provide me with a contact address, if
possible.  You can nominate yourself if you believe you have something to
contribute.

I already have some ideas of people to invite, but I'd like to get more
input before issuing formal invitations.   Thanks.

(Excerpts from call for papers in <A HREF="/Risks/4.28.html">RISKS-4.28</A>.  Due date 4/1 is approaching.)

            DIRECTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF ADVANCED COMPUTING  
            Seattle, Washington                 July 12, 1987

The adoption of current computing technology, and of technologies that 
seem likely to emerge in the near future, will have a significant impact 
on the military, on financial affairs, on privacy and civil liberty, on 
the medical and educational professions, and on commerce and business.

The aim of the symposium is to consider these influences in a social and
political context as well as a technical one.  The social implications of
current computing technology, particularly in artificial intelligence, are
such that attempts to separate science and policy are unrealistic.  We
therefore solicit papers that directly address the wide range of ethical
and moral questions that lie at the junction of science and policy.

[Submit papers to be refereed on ] RESEARCH FUNDING, DEFENSE APPLICATIONS,
COMPUTING IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, COMPUTERS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST, other
relevant topics.  The program committee includes Andrew Black (U. WA), Alan
Borning (U. WA), Jonathan Jacky (U. WA), Nancy Leveson (UCI), Abbe
Mowshowitz (CCNY), Herb Simon (CMU) and Terry Winograd (Stanford).

Complete papers, not exceeding 6000 words, should include an abstract, 
and a heading indicating to which topic it relates.  Papers related to 
AI and/or in-progress work will be favored.  Submissions will be judged 
on clarity, insight, significance, and originality.  Papers (3 copies) 
are due by April 1, 1987.  Notices of acceptance or rejection will be 
mailed by May 1, 1987.  Camera ready copy will be due by June 1, 1987.
Proceedings will be distributed at the Symposium, and will be on sale
during the 1987 AAAI conference.

For further information contact Jonathan Jacky (206-548-4117) or Doug
Schuler (206-783-0145).  Sponsored by Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility, P.O. Box 85481, Seattle, WA 98105.

Computer problems produce false weather warnings

  WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Weather Service ordered a halt to all test
warnings on its national weather wire Wednesday, until corrections can be
made in new computer programs that have led to several false warnings in
recent days.  "A cease and desist on all drills has been ordered until we
can correct the system," spokeswoman Carolyn DeBona said in a telephone
interview.
  Two false warnings were issued in the Chicago area and others occurred in
Brownsville, Texas; Long Island, N.Y.; and Washington, D.C., said another
Weather Service spokesman, Donald Witten.  And reports of a similar problem
on Tuesday have been received from Dodge City, Kan., officials said.
  Witten said the troubles started after local Weather Service offices were
sent new computer programming discs designed to speed warnings when severe
weather conditions occurred.  The discs include prepared messages, with
local forecasters only required to fill in the names of endangered cities or
counties and provide any necessary localizing information, he said.
  When the meteorologists tried out the new discs, they were supposed to
include the statement "This is Just a Test," but for some reason that phrase
did not get transmitted in several instances, Witten said.  He said Weather
Service programmers are currently analyzing the discs to see where the
problem is located and to correct it, a process that could take a few days.
  In the most widely publicized instance, a tornado warning was issued early
Monday morning stating, incorrectly, that a twister had destroyed the city
of Rockford, Ill., and was headed for Chicago.  The statement was broadcast
on several radio stations in the Chicago area before a correction was issued.
A severe thunderstorm warning -- also false and also without the "test"
disclaimer -- was transmitted at 1:53 p.m. Monday from the Chicago Weather
Service office and also had to be corrected.
  In the Long Island case, the warning from the New York City weather office
occurred the afternoon of Feb. 20 and involved a tornado warning for Nassau
County, N.Y., and two New Jersey counties, according to local news media.
That tornado statement was followed by a message 16 minutes later that said
the original warning had been in error.
  The Brownsville case occurred at 8:41 a.m. Monday and also involved a tornado
warning, according to Weather Service officials.
  In the Washington instance, on Sunday, a severe weather warning was issued at
2:32 p.m.
  In Dodge City, the false bulletin reported a tornado near Medicine Lodge and
moving northeast. Five minutes later, the Weather Service sent a disclaimer
saying the bulletin had been sent by mistake.
  Jim Johnson, a meteorological technican who was on duty when the false
bulletin moved, said he was testing a new computer program used for severe
storms forecasting when the bulletin was accidentally transmitted.
  The warnings are distributed on the agency's "weather wire," a Teletype
circuit that prints out local conditions, forecasts and warnings. Local Weather
Service offices issue their reports on this wire, which is widely used by the
news media, government agencies and others.

To the best of my knowledge, the outage of one of the working GOES satellites
(summer 1983) was from causes which are still unknown, onboard computer being a
possibility. (Do any other RISKS readers have more information on this?)

The decision to have the remaining GOES cover just the Atlantic was definitely
an "assumption of risk" on the part of the National Weather Service, based on a
decision that it was more important to accurately hurricanes and other weather
affecting the U.S. east coast. 

After Hurricane Iwa, the NWS had the GOES "cheated" west to be able to just see
the Hawaiian islands, and found they could get some coverage of the central and
western Pacific from a Japanese GOES-like satellite and miscellaneous polar
orbiting satellites.  Most of that info was presumably also available back in
1983...but not used by the NWS at the time of Iwa. 

GOES-7 was finally launched successfully last week and---after many delays and
one splash since 1983---the NWS finally has separate GOES capable of monitoring
weather over both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, with overlap coverage of
North American. 

However, it is still an open question whether better satellite coverage, giving
a more accurate track of Iwa, would really have had much effect. 

The complete story of the effects of Iwa can (and did in subsequent government
investigations) fill volumes.  A useful case study for anyone interested in
natural disasters in general.  Perhaps also an interesting study of the failure
modes of different types of interdependent systems (EBS, telephone system,
water, sewage, city gas, transportation, food supply) when a major system
(electrical) upon which others depends, fails suddenly. 

For example, some of the "pre-programmed" contingency plans that were activated
weren't appropriate. After the initial serious alert went out on the radio
stations just before noon on Thanksgiving the bus system continued in normal
operation until approximately 2:00pm (during the worst traffic jam in
Honolulu's history), the bus company then activated the only emergency plan
they had, for tsunami/earthquake evacuation. All running buses proceeded to
previously-designated schools in the hills with reinforced concrete buildings.
However, since it was Thanksgiving, the schools were closed, leaving confused
bus riders to walk home from wherever they happened to end up. 

After Iwa, the Civil Defense groups (both state and county) were completely
re-organized, and a emergency radio communications network (yet to be tested
under realistic conditions) has been set up to reduce CD's dependency on both
the telephone system. CD has also added a collection of microcomputers to keep
track of things and beefed up their uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems.

The major electrical utility, Hawaiian Electric built a new centralized, highly
computerized monitoring and control facility (itself protected by a rather
large UPS) for the electrical grid on the island of Oahu. One of the reasons: a
second failure of the electrical grid 9 months or so after Iwa when a fire
which brought down a transmission line, the resulting surge burned out a key
relay, and isolated the major generators.

Hawaiian Electric now claims that type of failure won't happen because their
new computers "react faster than people".

    [By the way, let me take this opportunity for an erratum.  The contents
    list in <A HREF="/Risks/4.51.html">RISKS-4.51</A> should have attributed the original message in this

*RUMOR*

I can't vouch for this personally... but a few years ago I spoke to a
contractor who said he had been approached to write software for the
Issaquah class ferries.  According to him, there were single-chip
microcomputers in the wheel house and in the engine room which communicated
by direct connection of their serial I/O pins.  No buffering.  So, apparently, 
when the captain moves the engine controls on the bridge, the engine
computer is all too likely to reply "what's that Captain, I canna hear ye."

My friend refused the contract.

The continuing saga of the Rochester/Monroe County 911 dispatching center
continues. The following was printed in the Saturday 2/28/87 Democrat &amp;
Chronicle:

A 911 computer error sent sheriff's deputies to Hilton instead of
Spencerport yesterday afternoon said Sgt. Paul Hayes of the Monroe County
Sherriff's Department.  A caller to 911 said there was an assault taking
place at 111 West Ave., then hung up, Hayes said.  A computer readout
indicated the call had come from Hilton, but when deputies arrived at 5:25
p.m. they could not find number 111.

The 911 center called back the number on the computer readout, which was
correct, and found that the call had come from West Avenue in Spencerport.
A deputy arrived at the scene at 5:28 p.m. Hayes said.

"Apparently the computer's program is somehow at fault", he said.

The incident was over when police arrived. There were no injuries he said.

When a computer-based misfortune occurs, we are quick to fault the
last-in-line of the system builders.  Usually this is what is euphemistically 
and disparagingly called the applications programmer.  Only on rare
occassions do we ask if this unfortunate soul could have done any better
given the tools that were available.  Consider ...

Modern computer architectures (the Transputer, for example) sacrifice time
determinism in favor of speed.  Modern computer languages (Ada and Occam,
for example) sacrifice time determinism in the interest of features (Ada) or
provability (Occam).  And yet, the metaphorical mist that surround these
developments (concurrent, multi-tasking, real-time, etc.) invites people to
incorporate them in time deterministic systems like cars and planes.  As if
the applications programmer didn't have enough to worry about, he now has to
build a deterministic system using a non-deterministic language on top of a
non-deterministic machine.

What I'm getting at is that while we all talk about risk reduction, not only
do we not specify and build system components (machines, languages,
theories, test harnesses, diagnostic tools) that let us get ahold of and
engineer risk factors, we encourage, yea verily demand, components that are
ever more slippery.  Then we give these teflon flywheels and greased gears
to the application programmer and expect him to build a nice safe system.

How come my vendor won't tell me the instruction execution times of his
machine? Where are the time specifications for an Ada kernel?  Why are there
no real-time languages?  How come we don't insist on time delay guarantees for 
operating system calls?  Why can't I turn off ALL interrupts?  Why are time
services so impotent?  What exactly is the caching algorithm and how can I
change it?  Why can't I install my own scheduler?  All these and many more.

If we want to really want to build reduced risk systems, then we should start
to define and build reduced-risk parts. I don't believe you can expect the 
painter to be responsible for the structural integrity of the bridge.

   [This a very nice challenge, and one that should be taken seriously.  PGN]

First on autoland, there are various commercial planes flying that have an
autoland capability, including the L1011, 767, 757 (this is not an
exhaustive list).  This isn't meant to imply that I approve or disapprove,
simply that the system exists on a fair number of planes.  In fact, the
system was invented in England (CAT IIIC ILS approaches, in the jargon:
ceiling 0', visibility 0 -- the stereotypical English day?), to help with
some of the weather difficulties there.

Regarding Conflict Alert and Mode C transponders, this has been a topic of
hot discussion of late.  One recent comment on RISKS was to the effect
that anyone owning a plane could afford the US$1500 or so to add Mode C.
Many, many planes in the general aviation fleet have no on-board
electrical system whatsoever, much less any transponder.  A large number
of pilots would find an additional $1500 a significant burden.  Folks
squawked about FAA's ELT (Emergency Locator Transmitter) requirement
several years ago, and that was for much less than $1500!

It's unclear how much it would help right now, anyway, to require Mode C
altitude reporting transponders on all planes (here's the competer tie-in,
least you've been concerned).  The current US ATC system (I'm unsure about
that in other countries) would be grossly overloaded if all the planes in
the sky now even had Mode A (position-reporting, without altitude), much
less Mode C.  This is a capacity limit of the computers and the signal
processing equipment.  Yes, they could be upgraded, and are being upgraded
-- at tremendous expense (needed, perhaps), and it will take a long time.

&gt;I would be equally unhappy being a passenger in an autolanding plane as
&gt;I would be living in a chronic state of "launch-on-warning" nuclear policy...

Yes, automatic anything will have bugs and accidents will happen; however
since we cannot eliminate them altogether, the question should not be whether
automatic systems will cause accidents, but whether the accidents' cost
would be greater os smaller than the cost of accidents in the human systems
they replace. The type of accidents may be different, and some automatic
systems introduce hazards were none were in a parallel human system; but they
also solve many more problems than they introduce.

&gt;...You can make aircraft from a few large pieces, or from many small pieces...

Ed Heinemann, famous for designing aircraft that were lighter and cheaper
than anyone else thought possible, was a real fan of big pieces, because a
structure of a given size needs *more* small pieces.  He once said something
along the lines of "when you count the parts in the F-14 wing, it's obvious
why the F-14 is so expensive".  I'd speculate that there is a correlation
with reliability as well, again because of simplicity.  Here we have an
analogy to software in the opposite direction from the one Eugene was
making:  Unix builds things out of little pieces, but it is a big-piece
system in one way because it emphasizes a few unifying principles rather
than a myriad of special cases.

I was told an interesting story last night, and I wonder if anything
has been written about it in mod.risks, or if anyone knows
anything about it (or even if it is true!).

In Europe there was a spate of (F-111?) crashes.  The apparent cause of
these crashes was pilots (1) believing they could fly the plane on their
own without the help of any dumb computer, (2) turning the computer off,
and (3) promptly flying into a mountain.

Any Hints?					DavidP

Numerous contributors have attacked automotive drive-by-wire systems.  
Consider some possible benefits, if implemented correctly: 

- No more drivers speared by the steering column 
- Speed-proportional steering 
- Feedback selectable to match the individual driver's needs 
- Easy to implement special controls for the handicapped 
- Three degrees of freedom for "steering wheel" adjustment and for driver entry

Basically, "drive-by-wire" will allow unlimited freedom to human-engineer
the driver's input to the steering system of the automobile.  I suggest
that we concern ourselves with ensuring that the system is safe and reliable,
instead of reminiscing about the good old days of mechanical steering.

Recent discussions have compared risks of computerized autolanding of planes
to those of computerized launch-on-warning of nuclear weapons.  I think lumping
these together can be misleading. For example, as Mr. Shapir points out:

  &gt;  ...the question should not be whether automatic systems will cause
  &gt;  accidents, but whether the accidents' cost would be greater or smaller
  &gt;  than the cost of accidents in the human systems they replace.

This is A good question, but not THE only good question. In cases where
an existing situation is being automated, I agree that this is the right
question to ask. Often, however, the prospect of using high-speed computer
control is cited in support of plans to establish new situations where human
control would be unworkable. Subsequent discussion often focuses on the
relative risks of human vs computer control. But if neither works, then
the mistake is to get into the situation in the first place! Ideas like
computerized launch-on-warning or AI-based weapons release for SDI are not
bad ideas because humans could do those jobs better -- they are bad ideas
because we are moving toward situations where neither humans, nor computers,
nor any combination of the two can be trusted to do the right thing in the
time available. One of our responsibilities as professionals is to try to
identify and call attention to such situations before the choice degenerates
to one of arguing about which of several unworkable options is the least
unworkable.

         (interrelated thoughts)
 
911: Having been associated with the Emergency Services for some 20 years, I
do not find the 911 articles surprising. I remember the horror stories from
the times of conversion from "local" operators to those of the more regional
type. People were accustomed to picking up the phone and yelling help or fire
and screaming the address to the operator. While in the "new" system, the "0"
DIALED in the phone would connect you to the local operator (usually) within
the town or city of origin. Here the most severe complications were duplicate
street names or same names suffixed by St. or Terr. or Place or Circle. As
time went by the switchboards dissapeared from the local towards the regional
type. Now the problems grew to the kind of identifying the neighboring
community possibility. Here the operator would be the one in the position of
determining the locality of origin of the call, as well as the correct
address. Sometimes (1960's era to present) multiple community dispatches were
heard for the same address in different municipalities.
 
The problems have not been rectified, only compounded by the advent of
differing phone systems and overlays of telephone exchanges. Software may or
may not be the problem, as the best software can only rely on input
(electronic or manual). As area codes are becoming more and more prevalent,
it may be necessary to soon dial an area code to report the fire across the
street. hmmmmmm.....
 
Point 1. System modification (hard or soft) is not always the answer unless
the root problem is solved. Even here, there will forever be unresolved
complications. Example: a non-English speaking (obscure language) person will
call an English speaking relative in another town (or state) to report an
emergency. Second party calls are always the hardest to handle.
The time is not yet at hand to convert the emergency services to AI !
 
Steer/Drive by wire: These discussions are relevant to Risks as they are or
will be implemented at some time. BUT! It is sort of the same as adding the
computer to a small business; there are times that it is just not
appropriate. Mechanical design considerations have been for some time at the
technological point to eliminate any of the problems (reasons) for such a
computer system. Ask a race car driver what computer systems he wishes. Here
the answer seems to be more emergency condition indicated than technologically
capable. That driver wants a system to turn on the fire extinguishment system
in .000001 second of the explosion or fire, and yet you will not see the air
bag pop out of the MECHANICAL steering wheel. You have seen the severe
crashes these people are exposed to, and yet they want the machine to be at
hand, not computer. This will hold true unless the people start loosing to
such a system, thus proving its merit.

Point 2. This is the, "eliminate the man" syndrome. If the speed and
complexity of the systems are such so that a computer insertion to control
it is necessary, then it is time to consider removal of the human element.
This bridge is a hard one to cross. Project loss due to failure and the
price of backup systems put the cost of such projects over the top. We still
put the wo/man above price and yet when a multibillion dollar project is
launched, the requirement of the human to be onboard is still paramount.
Protection of the systems, uncalculated emergency procedures, patches and
repairs incapable of the onboard systems are only feasible with the HANDS
and brains of the crew, supported by their electronic and human counterparts
in remote.  Major system failure will cost not only the project, but also
the crew. This possibly is the impetus for quality in design and
manufacture. Do you work more carefully when there is a human life in the
balance at the reception of your output?  i.e., The program writer who
discovered his program was inside the operating room during a heart
transplant, and had a few thoughts about the possible bug.
 
Work ethics in the U.S.: Systems installation into the chain of mechanical
elements is obviously an expected outgrowth of our technology. The desire to
have modern systems replacing 100 year old mechanical ones runs back as far
as the fellow that removed the square corners from the wheel. The real
question is if the can opener really needs that keyboard input in conjunction
with the clock card in order to do the job. If it is a desire of the customer
to have such a system, so be it. System implementation seems more of, "Gee,
look what I made. Where shall I put it?", than here is the problem, what
shall we do to make it better.
 
Total redesign may be more appropriate than added-on systems. It is up to us
to say enough is enough and initiate that type of improvement rather than
amend a system.
 
  &gt;From: sigma!roman@entropy.ms.washington.edu (Bill Roman) &gt;*RUMOR*
  &gt;I can't vouch for this personally... but a few years ago I spoke to a
  &gt;contractor who said he had been approached to write software for the
  &gt;Issaquah class ferries.       [...]      My friend refused the contract.
 
This type of reaction to an idiotic set of circumstances is of the highest
quality. The only neglect here (not mentioned) was a blast to the authorities
requesting the work.
 
It is a shame that in order to keep position in relation to other
professionals, one must remain mute on problems such as this. I wonder how
many lines of code be eliminated or dollars saved (redundant?) if there were a
majority of professionals that acted in this manner?
 
Tell me, are the Risks that we are seeing more of a moral question or one of
simple incompetence?

Representatives of GM recently gave a presentation here at Duke on the
Chevrolet Corvette Indy. This "show concept car" (a one-of-a-kind) has about
everything on it people have been worrying about in this forum; I went to the
presentation and nagged the engineers about the points of concern that have
been raised here. This car was built by Lotus Cars Ltd.; it might have been
the project that started this discussion.

For starters, the term "drive-by-wire" is used in their glossies *not* to
refer to the computer controlled steering, but to computer controlled
throttle! The car is four-wheel-drive, with computer control over the split of
torque between the front and rear wheels, designed to maintain maximum
traction in all conditions of acceleration/deceleration. The "gas pedal" is
connected to a sensor (and has a hydraulic ram behind it so the computer can
simulate the feel of a mechanical linkage); the sensor concludes what
acceleration the driver wants and delivers torque to the front and rear
wheels. This is probably the most RISKy part of the whole car, in my humble
opinion. It is a bit more comprehensive than the computer controlled idle
adjustments and suchlike that are getting to be common these days.

It also has a computer controlled four wheel active suspension; when I asked
them about the failure modes and potential RISKs in this subsystem, they
replied that in the event of loss of power to the hydraulic system driving the
active suspension, the coil spirings hold the car at its normal height above
the wheels, and the hydraulic rams are designed to fail under loss of power
into reasonable shocks. The ride would be mushy, but not dangerous (unless of
course it failed in the bottom of a really tight turn). The computer
controlling the system (1) has internal sanity checks throughout, and (2) has
multiply redundant sensors; whenever any inconsistency is found in the system
it fails into the powered down mode.

Finally, the computer controlled steering. The front wheels are normal manual
rack-and-pinion steering; the front steering linkage has a sensor on it so
that the computer can tell how far you have the front wheels deflected. Based
on the deflection of the front wheels, the speed you are going, current
acceleration vector, "weight" currently on each wheel, and suchlike, the
computer deflects the rear wheels. In particular, at low speeds, the rear
wheels turn the opposite direction from the front, tightening the turning
radius substantially. At high speeds, they turn the same direction as the
front wheels, making fast lane changes smoother; instead of slewing around,
and rocking from side to side, the car tends to slip crabwise laterally. The
total deflection available to the rear wheels in the prototype is 20 degrees
left or right of center; according to one of the engineers there they only
would leave 5 degrees available in a production system (that's all that is
needed). The system is once again equipped with multiple internal sanity
tests, and dumps at the first sign of trouble; large springs center the rear
wheels if the system dumps. In tests where they deliberately cause the critter
to fail turned as sharply as possible, they found that at slow speeds the car
could be stopped safely, and at high speeds the driver could keep control by
steering the front to compensate (and proceeding slightly angled down the
road). All in all, the severity of symptoms seem much less severe than a
blowout; if the likelihood of such a failure can be reduced as low, then the
steering shouldn't introduce too much RISK.

Those who do not like category IIIA autoland (auto up to main wheels on the
ground, pilot has to lower the nosewheel) might avoid flying the Concorde,
which uses it routinely at Kennedy and London Heathrow, and might also avoid
flying in to London Heathrow, which I understand has Cat IIIA on all
runways, used routinely in English Weather. It's been thoroughly tested in
the field for many years.

From a Puget Sounder who has followed the story in the papers...
The computers for the Issaquah class ferries were built by a private
contractor to MP&amp;E.  This private contractor turned out to be a one man shop
who did little or no quality control and went belly-up after the ferries were
built.  He/she did not leave any documentation behind.

The results were:
    (a) The computers are poorly designed and built -- at one point the boards
	physically fell out of the card cage while under way.
    (b) With no documentation, repair would be incredibly expensive.
    (c) The failure of the computers (starting with the maiden voyage) had
	caused the public to mistrust them, and so replacement by a physical
	system is occurring.
    (d) Many of the failures have been attributed to physical parts such as
	small relays.  (i.e. The software said "slow down" but engine didn't.)
	A better overall system design would have helped.

   [This is another instance of an old problem, but worth rehearing.]

Yesterday I received a nasty letter from my credit union stating that I had
exceeded my VISA card's authorized credit limit of $500 by $203.  They
advised me to pay up immediately or face the consequences, etc. etc.  This
was a bit of a surprise, considering that my credit limit was actually $2000.  

The very next letter in my stack of mail contained the following:

  Dear Member:

  Please accept our apology for the recent letter stating you were over
  your credit line.

  We were attempting to implement a credit line increase into the system.  Due
  to a programming error by our processor in Dallas, the old credit line was
  inadvertently removed and only the increase appeared on the account.  Some
  members were declined on purchases due to this error.

  The new credit lines are now in the system and your account is in good
  standing.  Your March statement will reflect the new credit line increase.
	
  We regret any inconvenience this may have caused you.
	
  Sincerely,                  [etc.]

I guess I was one of the lucky ones who didn't even notice the problem until
I received both letters simultaneously.  I would not have been at all amused
had I learned of this on an out-of-town trip trying to rent a car or something.

		       Conversations Said Taped
		      (United Press International)

  The government secretly monitored the home telephones of Robert C.
McFarlane after he stepped down as President Reagan's national security
advisor, according to an article in the Progressive magazine.

  The magazine article said a National Security Agency electronic device was
found in the sewing closet of McFarlane's home in Bethesda in January during
a sweep ordered by his attorneys.

  Spokesmen for the NSA and for McFarlane refused comment. The White House
said it would have no comment until it saw the magazine, which is to be on
newsstands Saturday.

  The magazine quoted intelligence sources as saying that phone conversations 
of senior U.S. officials have been recorded for "archival purposes by the
Pentagon and the CIA and for communication security by the NSA."

  In the article entitled, "The White House Tapes, Again," the magazine
quoted sources as saying the program produced "a still-undisclosed archive
of recorded conversations" involving Reagan, Vice President Bush, former
White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan and former National Security
Council staff members Oliver L. North and John M. Poindexter.

  The article, written by freelance reporter Allan Nairn, said
McFarlane, who left the White House in December 1985, had been falsely
told that a security unit on his home phone had been deactivated.

  It said the unit uses a computerized encryption device that makes a
call unintelligible to anyone trying to listen in without the proper
equipment and authorized code.

  The article said that the monitoring of top officials generally seems
to have been done on a basis of express or implied consent and
therefore would not appear to violate federal communications laws.

  In McFarlane's case, however, the monitoring continued after he left
the White House, the magazine said. A government team, according to
the magazine, removed the unit's handset from McFarlane's home, but,
unknown to McFarlane, left intact the system's control panel that
enabled NSA to monitor calls, and in turn, record them.

  After leaving the national security adviser's job, McFarlane continued to
have access to classified material as unpaid consultant until the
Iran-contra affair was disclosed in November.  He took a secret trip to
Tehran last May in a fruitless effort to free American hostages in Lebanon.

ReSent-To: RISKS@CSL.SRI.COM

Since my original message to Risks about the Sperry plan, I have visited
the FAA Certification Office in Seattle and, for other reasons, the Boeing
Commercial Aircraft Co. in Seattle.  The Boeing employees I spoke to told
me that they have rejected the Sperry plan for their software.  However,
it is planned to be used for a Category III autopilot for the MD-11.  This
autopilot is safety-critical for 30-45 seconds during autolanding.  There is
also great dependence on n-version programming for the fly-by-wire Airbus
320, but I have no details about the A320 software development such 
as the testing procedures used (except for a blurb in Aviation Week that 
states that n-version programming provides "optimum" protection against 
software errors in that aircraft).

To remind Risks readers, Sperry wants to use N-version software in place of
"white box" (structural) testing.  Black box (system) testing will still 
be performed.  System testing would be done "back-to-back."  Back-to-back
testing means that multiple versions of the software are executed on the
same test data.  If they all agree on the answer, it is assumed that they
are all correct.  

Kevin Driscoll writes in Risks 4.55 that this plan is not really so scary.
In order to follow the discussion, it is necessary to have some background
on aircraft software certification.

There is a document used by the FAA (and written primarily by the
manufacturers) called RTCA/DO-178A: Software Considerations in Airborne 
Systems and Equipment Certification.  It lays out the requirements for 
software development, testing, configuration control, and documentation.  
The requirements are pretty basic -- about what I would recommend for a 
good inventory program.  In general the requirements are: 

  (1) developing software requirements and verifying them against system 
      requirements [no requirement for any formality in the process];
  (2) using a design discipline or method [not specified as to which 
      one -- just says you need to use one] that makes software traceable, 
      testable, maintainable, and understandable;
  (3) doing a design review against requirements;
  (4) using an implementation technique that is understandable, testable,
      and traceable to the design;
  (5) doing requirements-based and structure-based tests including module 
      testing, module integration testing, and hardware/software integration 
      testing including a requirements coverage analysis and a software 
      structural coverage analysis [this is what Sperry wants to eliminate
      except for system test]
  (6) providing software configuration management;
  (7) providing a quality assurance plan.

The document specifies software function criticality categories of: 
   Level 1 (flight-critical: failure prevents continued safe flight), 
   level 2 (flight essential: functions reduce capability of aircraft 
            or ability of crew to cope with adverse conditions), and 
   level 3 (non-essential: failures could not significantly degrade 
            aircraft capability or crew ability).  

The difference in criticality level seems to determine what information
is provided to the FAA for certification and, in some cases, which of the
above requirements are enforced.  For level 1 software, for
example, the manufacturer must provide detailed information about the
verification that was done.  For level 2, in general only a summary
description of the process along with a statement of compliance must
be submitted.  For level 3, no assurance is required.  In terms of
certification effectiveness, independent evaluation is possible only with
information.  So providing just a statement of compliance seems to me
to imply that no external, independent evaluation is possible.  There is
no way to check that they actually did comply and that the verification
that was done was adequate and correct.  I certainly do not want to
imply that the manufacturers and subcontractors will not try to do the
best job possible -- after all, they have the liability and they are
decent human beings who care about human life.  The problem is that 
without external review we are depending on the competence 
of the people at these companies, and I am not as sanguine about the 
general state of software engineering knowledge and practice in industry 
as I am about the good intention of humans.  

So far, though, things are not really TOO awful, but wait ...
The problem seems to arise from one sentence (which was added between 
version 178 and 178A and seems to be the major change) that states 
"Using appropriate design and/or implementation techniques and
considerations, it may be possible to use a software level lower than
the functional categorization."  This is the kicker.  Sperry is arguing
that although the software autopilot is Level 1, they are using n-version
programming and therefore it can be treated as Level 2.  There is
also a phrase "the software level implies effort that ... may vary
within criticality level."  So they can modify any of the requirements
also, it appears, within level (given that the FAA agrees).  
BOTTOM LINE:  even those very basic requirements that are specified above
can be eliminated fairly easily.  Personally, I would require MORE than is
stated in DO-178A for both Level 1 *AND* Level 2 software development and 
verification.

As examples of what is possible, the DoD, besides requiring good software 
engineering practice, requires a safety and hazard analysis of the software.  
The Air Force and Navy also require an IV&amp;V by a qualified company (Logicon 
does a lot of this) for all nuclear systems [called Nuclear Safety Cross 
Check Analysis by the Air Force and Software Nuclear Safety Analysis by 
the Navy].   These IV&amp;V efforts are MUCH more rigorous than anything 
the FAA appears to be doing.  Note that the DoD requires proof of the 
safety of the software itself and not just proof that the developers have 
satisfied minimal development practices.

The most amazing part of the RTCA document is the fact that using a particular
method, such as n-version programming, can somehow magically change the
criticality level of the software (from flight-critical to flight-essential
or non-essential).  Since the function of the software does not change
with the development method, this appears ridiculous.  I can only assume
that they are arguing that the reliability will be so high that failures
will never occur and therefore the criticality of the function is irrelevant;
this is the only interpretation that makes sense to me.  But there is no
current software engineering technique that can guarantee such ultra-high
reliability! (including N-version programming). And since they dismiss in 
the document the use of any measurement techniques (they state that currently 
available methods do not yield results in which confidence can be placed to 
the degree required) and don't even mention any formal verification methods, 
there is NO demonstration required that they have reached perfection (or any 
particular level of reliability) using the particular design or implementation 
technique.  

In the Sperry case, their argument for N-version programming appears to
rest on a simplistic model presented by Larry Yount at an AIAA Conference
in Long Beach.  This model assumes statistical independence between failures 
of the n versions.  This assumption has been shown to not hold in
controlled experiments and, in fact, is not believed by most researchers 
in the field.  At a workshop this summer, Larry put up a chart that showed 
his model predicted 20,000 times improvement in reliability based on the 
use of n-version programming.  Since actual experiments have found at best 
only 7-10 times improvement, his figures appear to be patently ridiculous. 

Kevin Driscoll (Risks 4.55) states:

   &gt; In its letter to Sperry, the FAA says that this method "appears to be
   &gt; satisfactory" with the following constraints:
   &gt; a.  Level 1 must be used for paragraphs 6.2.2 (Requirements Development
   &gt; and Verification) and 6.2.3 (Design).
   &gt; b.  Formal configuration control must used and, if common errors are
   &gt; found, structural testing may be required for some or all of the
   &gt; modules.

Common errors have been found in EVERY experiment done so far in n-version
programming (at least, in all that have checked for them which is about 4
or 5).  The problem is that with only three versions of the software and the
use of back-to-back testing, the only common errors that can be detected are
those within only two modules.  Any common errors found in all three of the
modules cannot be detected (unless some outside method of correctness
determination is used).  In my experiment with John Knight at the University
of Virginia, we found common failures in up to eight independently developed
programs.  Also, any errors that can be traced back to the specification 
will, of course, have a tendency to manifest themselves in common between 
the versions.

   &gt; c.  Formal review and comparison of source code must be used to verify
   &gt; dissimilarity.  Where this is not feasible, Level 1 structural test
   &gt; and analysis must be used.

How does one verify dissimilarity?  In fact, how does one even define it?
Obviously the programs must be similar in that they are computing the
same function.  The only dissimilarity we really want is a dissimilarity in
failure behavior.  Syntactic dissimilarity is irrelevant.  Again, John Knight
and I found programs that used completely different algorithms to compute a
function yet failed on all the same input data.  The problem is that certain
input cases are inherently more difficult to handle.  For example, when
computing the angle determined by three points, programs tended to fail on
inputs where the points were colinear or coincident.  The errors were not
the same nor were the algorithms, but they failed on the same input data.
So looking to see that different algorithms are used is not adequate.  This
is the problem in talking about a concept like "dissimilarity" or "diversity"
without ever formally defining it;  there is no way to know whether you
have it nor any way to measure it.  It is similar to the problem with using 
the term "artificial intelligence" when the term "intelligence" remains
undefined.  One can merely claim that their program is intelligent and it
is difficult to dispute it (or to prove it either).  How does one prove or
disprove that dissimilarity or diversity exists?

   &gt; It seems to me that c. is the same as doing structural analysis. 
   &gt; Therefore, this method is not any less rigorous than "full" DO-178A
   &gt; Level 1.

I can see no relationship between verifying dissimilarity between two
or three programs and structural analysis of the correctness of a single 
program;  especially given that I know how to do the second but not the 
first.  I am not quite sure what Kevin means by "less rigorous."  Certainly, 
we have much more experience with structural testing than with n-version 
programming.  There is no evidence anywhere that structural testing is 
equivalent to n-version programming (e.g., that they detect the same errors)
nor that one can replace the other.  Although somewhat beside the point, 
I would argue that even the *FULL* DO-178A is not nearly rigorous enough for 
safety-critical software.

   &gt; d. Functional tests of the system must be performed.  It must be shown
   &gt; that the system will not have false alarms.

   &gt; However, how one complies with c. and d. I do not know.

THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT!  Sperry is suggesting replacing something we
know how to do with something nobody knows how to do and has never been
shown to work with the degree of effectiveness required.  I would certainly
feel happier if the Sperry plan were tried first on real software 
that was not Level 1 or Level 2 (by real software, I do not mean just
university or industrial experiments where the software is never used in a
real production environment).  I have few qualms about N-version programming
being used in conjunction with normal software development techniques
even on safety-critical software.  But I have grave reservations about 
eliminating any testing or other standard procedures on the basis of
using it.  The problem, of course, is that developing multiple versions
is expensive.  So I assume Sperry is trying to cut down on testing in
order to save money.  Unfortunately, I do not know how to develop
safety-critical software cheaply.  For the most part, greater reliability
and safety requires more money.  Just using some sleight of hand to relabel
the software as Level 2 or Level 3 instead of Level 1 does not make it
any less safety-critical.  And voting together relatively untested and
unverified single versions has not been shown (in the experiments that
have tried it) to guarantee high reliability or safety.  In fact, the
little experimental evidence available has shown that as the number of
errors in the individual versions increases, the amount of reliability 
gain to be expected fron using n-version programming decreases.

I am still worried despite Kevin's attempt at reassurance.

IN RISKS  4:56,  Hal Guthery  makes the laudable  plea that we component
makers should take into account that some applications  programmer  will
eventually want to make a `safe'  system out of our components.  He does
not expect a painter to be responsible  for the structural  integrity of
the bridge;  he wants  to be able  to take that for granted.  At risk of
straining  his metaphor,  I would not expect the painter to complain  at
the  architect's  specifying  rust-retarding  paint  for a steel  bridge
standing in salt water.

He suggests that modern parallel architectures (transputer systems)  and
languages (Ada,  occam)  are unsuitable,  presumably  less suitable than
others,   for  building   safe  systems:   the  assumption   being  that
``deterministic''  is a part of ``safe''.  The fault with this argument
is that often  one does  not require  entirely  deterministic  behaviour
from a system,  and that constraining  a design  to be deterministic  in
every  detail  may make  it harder  to understand.  The harder  it is to
understand something, the less likely one is to build it correctly.

Sadly,  the real  world  out there  beyond  the interface  chips  is not
particularly predictable in its behaviour,  and does not take too kindly
to being  told to wait,  and to do things  just so and not in some other
order.  While the ``world''  is a part of one's system, one must be able
to reason about non-deterministic  systems.  Would you really rather use
a sequential programming  language,  and not be able to write some parts
of the system (device drivers, interrupt routines,  the Lord preserve us
even operating system kernels) in the most natural and lucid notation?

If one is writing real-time programs,  and there really is more than one
thing  going  on at once,  then it turns  out to be very much easier  to
tell  how  long  it will  take  to run  a piece  of code  on  the  right
multi-processor machine than when multiprogramming a uni-processor.

At risk of sounding  like an INMOS salesman  (usual  disclaimers  apply,
not a penny do I get from them,  more's the pity)  they _do_  sell tools
for measuring execution times,  and in terms of the programmer's  source
code,  not in terms of the execution  times of instructions.  Leave  the
instructions  to the machine,  it knows  more about  them than you do or
ever wanted  to.  There _are_  hooks in languages  like occam to make it
possible  to reason  about the real-time  performance  of a program.  (I
would refer you in passing to a discussion in ``Programming  in occam'',
G.Jones,  Prentice-Hall  1987,  but  you might  think  I had an ulterior
motive :-)

The answer to questions  like ``why can't I install  my own scheduler?''
has  surely  to be that  this  is not  a question  that  an applications
programmer  should  know  how to ask!  In particular,  if one is writing
real-time  programs,  then the correctness  of one's code had better not
depend on how it is scheduled.

If we really  want to build reduced  risk systems,  we should  use those
(intellectual  and mechanical)  tools which make it easiest  to convince
ourselves and others that we are making the right system.  I counter the
slur (that  parallel  means  slippery)  with  the observation  that  you
should  not  necessarily   complain  if  your  toolmaker  offers  you  a
nutcracker  when you asked for a sledgehammer.  There may be more moving
parts in the nutcracker,  it may require more dexterity to use,  but the
humble tool fitter thinks he has learnt something about eating nuts, and
he may well not be entirely wrong.
                                                                      gj

From Wall Street Journal report of Florida Express CEO's statement:

    ``... computers in our own reservations office accurately displayed the
    availability of discount seats throughout our system, but the
    computers used by travel agents, who sell 65% of our tickets,
    erroneously indicated no availability of the cheaper fares on many of
    our flights.''

This apparently caused a significant drop in sales that may cause the
airline to lose money this quarter.  They indicate that the problem
seems to have been solved but give no indication of what the nature of
the computer problem was.

&gt; Subject: Re: Altitude encoders: $1500 for Mode C?  No, $750.

I hate seeing notices like this, because of the fear that, a month from now,
I'll hear Ted Koppel say "... The devices will cost aircraft owners $750..."

I suspect that the aircraft already had a transponder installed, and added
an altitude encoder to it.  And I'm all-fired certain that it had an
electrical system.

For those not familiar with General Aviation, many aircraft do not have
batteries or alternators.  Ignition spark is provided by magnetos.  The folks 
advocating mandatory altitude encoding transponders seem to forget that fact.

These aircraft are not that rare... at the airport where I kept my Cessna,
I estimate that 5% did not have electrical systems.  This airport is ten
miles from Sea-Tac International.  Let's see... $750 for the basic transponder,
$750 for the altitude encoder, $2000 for an electrical system, 25 hours
labor at $40/hr... $4500 upgrade cost for an airplane worth $6000.

Sure, and let's require everyone to install airbags in their older cars, too.

Relying on technology to solve a particular problem is nice, as long as you
don't ignore real world conditions.  Let the aviation community solve the
problem, using its own expertise.  There are too many self-appointed aviation
safety experts out there, like Ann Landers, whose only qualification is
that they fly on airliners a lot.

I've been reading the NTSB report on the Delta Tristar crash -- the one
prominently featured in "Why Planes Crash" -- as it's been serialized in
Aviation Week, and recently noticed something that hasn't received much
attention that I'm aware of.  After the Challenger disaster, it became
clear that NASA was compromising safety because the goal of getting the
flight rate up was inconsistent with taking all necessary time to ensure
safety.  The NTSB report pointed out something similar in the matter of
airliners vs. windshear.  Stripped of the aviation technospeak, one part
of the report says essentially:  "We are disturbed that most existing
windshear-procedures training tells pilots that the ultimate goal is to
continue the landing.  We feel that once control is regained, the proper
action is to abandon the landing and climb immediately to a safe altitude."

It seems to me that there is a significant general principle here:  if
safety is not part of the primary objectives, there will be a strong
tendency to treat safety problems as temporary aberrations, rather than
as indications of fundamental danger that may require abandoning the
primary objectives.

Here is a little more background about the ferry control problems.  This
may not be suitable for publication in mod.risks, but the USA Today article
seems to have missed some important issues.

The problem is as much political as technical.  A big part of the problem is
that the State of Washington doesn't have schematics or software
documentation for the control system.  Under terms of the contract, those
items are proprietary information and remain the property of the
subcontractor that designed them.  That subcontractor also went bankrupt and
was bought out by Marine Power &amp; Equipment.

As I understand it, it would be impossible to fix the computer systems
without the design info.

Another failure mode:  When loading and unloading, the ferry is held in
its slip by running the engines at idle.  The prop pitch control systems
would occasionally shift into reverse pitch, causing the vessel to move
away from the dock.  One car went into the sound in one such incident.
Others have nearly done so.

I have ridden several of the Issaquah class ferries, and survived.

How does one go about purchasing a computer control system for a ferry boat?

I keep looking for general significance in these failures and keep coming
back to the social inertia inherent in adopting or adapting to a new
technology.  There is simply not yet an infrastructure that can fully manage
computerization.

In general, I believe that in critical areas such as optimizing the behavior
of wheels in a car or landing an airplane, the computer has a large
advantage.  The issue is not one of whether these system will and should be
used.  It is a question of when we will have enough understanding to apply
these systems effectively with the proper engineering principles to deal
with failure modes, intuitiveness of interface etc.

In reading through the rest of the letters this week, I should amend my
previous letter by noting that we don't really do a good job of
engineering noncomputer systems.  Bridges used to fall down 40% of the
time until we learned to build them.  I was told (but have not verified)
that when building the Hancock building in Boston, the people spraying
concrete (or whatever) over the riveted beams would often get ahead of
the riveters and would not wait.  The building is still standing, though
did go through a period of plywood windows.

My vague memory is that the GOES satellites started failing prematurely
because of an unauthorized change to a component; specifically, that a
subcontractor changed the type of light bulb used in an optical encoder
on a gyroscope.  Someone with more spare time than I have could find this
in Aviation Week and Space Technology.

Another major incident of this type was when, once upon a time, some
helicopters started falling out of the sky (I believe they were large
Sikorsky helicopters--my memory is getting vaguer by the second).  This
was somewhat upsetting (especially for those killed as a result)--the
cause turned out to be an unauthorized (untested) change in a manufacturing
step.  The races for the main rotor bearing were supposed to be deburred
with a wire brush; the bearing manufacturer switched to Scotchbrite pad,
since it was easier to use, and seemed to produce the same results.  The
bearings started failing prematurely, and a number of unfortunate people
(mostly in the North Sea oil fields) discovered how poorly helicopters
fly when the main rotor bearing disintegrates.

Most of the contributors to RISKS seem much more frightened of software
risks than mechanical risks (the steer-by-wire discussion is a case in
point).  Perhaps it's worth keeping in mind that mechanical systems have
their problems, too:  it's especially worth remembering if you are planning
to use a mechanical system as the failsafe for some piece of software
wizardry ("Oh, no, Mr. Bill:  the emergency handwheel just came off in your
hand!  Watch out for the train... &lt;crunch&gt;").

The Minnesota Legislature is now using a spreadsheet as an educational
tool.  Legislators can put their favorite proposals in the budget, but
then have to find a way to pay for them.

The budget proposals made by Governor Rudy Perpich were used as a starting
point.  Dick Pfutzenreuter, staff director of the House Ways and Means
Committee, took those proposals and added relationships and comments for
many issues.  When using the program a legislator may change budget amounts
for any item, but then has to balance the budget or raise taxes.  Items are
labeled to remind users of the meaning of each number.

Pfutzenreuter says that about half of the House DFLers (non-USA readers: the
DFL is a political organization) have used the program.  The legislators
have tended to spend more for their pet projects while avoiding cuts in
education programs.  He also says that each has tried many budget
alterations, since it is so easy to do them on the spreadsheet.  The
Governor's staff has requested a copy of the program.

Technical notes: Pfutzenreuter got the Governor's proposals in Lotus
format.  He is using "The Smart Spreadsheet" by Innovative Software,
which is able to read Lotus disks.  Not all legislators have their own
computers yet, but many legislators simply used the program in
Pfutzenreuter's office.

From a long article in the Boston Globe, Mar 9, 1987:

"When the owners of the Seabrook nuclear power plant recently proposed
shrinking the plant's emergency evacuation zone from 10 miles to 1 mile,
they based their argument on what may be the most comprehensive computer
study ever done of a nuclear reactor.

"Engineers spent $4 million and 35 man-years of work assembling millions of
bits of data on Seabrook's design, construction and maintenance, then
plugged them into a huge main-frame computer programmed to simulate how
the reactor would handle anything that could conceivably go wrong.
What emerged was a 50-foot high computer printout analyzing 4.5 billion
possible accident scenarios, from minor valve failures to catastrophic
core meltdowns.

"A 4,700 page study concluded that with a one-mile evacuation zone,
the risk each year of a member of the public's dying from an accident
at Seabrook would be less than one in 10 million -- low enough, Seabrook's
owners said, to justify a smaller zone. ...

"If the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission accepts that logic and the courts
reject a likely legal challenge, the $4.5 billion reactor will be able
to open despite [Mass.] Gov. Dukakis' refusal to participate in what he
says is an unworkable evacuation plan.  There are six Massachusetts
communities inside the 10-mile zone, but none fall within the one-mile zone."

The article continues by discussing criticisms of the study, and "the
little-understood field of probabilistic risk assessment."

Over the weekend I attended a dance concert put on by a local college
company here in Pittsburgh.  It was announced before the show started that
the computer that controlled the lighting was not working, but the show
would go on.  However, only stage lights would be used so that the
audience would not get the intended effect and mood that color and spotlights
could give.  People were offered their money back--no one left.

I wonder what backup strategies are typically used for professional music,
dance, and theatrical productions.  For example, some people in the audience
wondered why the lights could not just be done by hand.  Do Broadway shows
use backup computers just in case of failure?

    [There have already been two big losers -- "Grind" and "Les Miserables",
    reported in earlier RISKS issues.  This is the old local-optimization
    false-economy problem.  One can economize with cheap computer control
    systems, but if they crash on you, the overall cost may be quite high.
    I imagine there is some backup here.  But, as you well know, there are
    many cases where the main system and the backup system both fail, or
    where it is the redundancy mechanisms themselves that fail! PGN]

Sensitive Intelligence Document Published On Magazine Cover

By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH
c. 1987 N.Y. Times News Service
    WASHINGTON - A picture on the cover of the current issue of The Foreign
Service Journal shows a readable copy of one of the government's most
sensitive intelligence documents, according to government officials.  The
Foreign Service Journal, published for members of the Foreign Service, is
generally available to the public and has a circulation of 10,000.  The
document, a copy of the National Intelligence Daily, which is produced by
the Central Intelligence Agency in traceable, numbered copies exclusively
for the president and a small circle of others with top-secret clearance,
was photographed on the desk of Ronald I. Spiers, the Under Secretary of
State for Management. Spiers was the subject of the article referred to on
the magazine's cover.  The CIA intelligence summary, which reports the
latest intelligence evaluations by the agency, was open to two pages,
apparently about the situation in Lebanan.

    A map of Lebanon was partly blocked by Spiers' left hand. He had some
hand-written notes partly shielding the print on the facing page, but
clearly visible at the bottom of the page was the number 121.  Some text as
well as codes, also at the bottom of the page, were not legible with normal
magnifying equipment, but a Congressional aide with a background in
intelligence said, ''Based on my time in the business, this is the kind of
thing you could blow up and clarify what the final thing is with not even
very sophisticated equipment.''  The aide continued, ''This is a major
breach of security.''  An aide to Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the
ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said,
''Anybody else in the government who did this would have been fired if this
had happened to them.''  [...]

As far as I'm concerned, people who fly on airliners only as passengers have
every right to complain about general aviation aircraft without
altitude-encoding transponders, since they seem to collide in mid-air with
airliners with alarming frequency.  I really get tired of this "I can do
what I want with my neck, why is the government trying to tell me what's
good for me?" routine.

The simple fact is that your actions put others (like me) under involuntary
risk, and preventing this sort of thing is the fundamental reason why laws
and governments exist. I don't care whether 5% or 50% or 100% of small
planes lack electrical systems; if they can't be flown without hazard to
other planes, then they shouldn't be flown at all.

I've been thinking about the nature of physical systems and the addition of
software to them.  The comments by Martin Harriman and the comments and
bridges and buildings moved me.

I am reasonably familiar with Sikorsky helicopters, and it makes me wonder
if we should should put information into software which takes long term
degradation into a software system.  It has some interesting consequences,
and it would be difficult to think of all of them out before hand.  Parnas
points out that computers are basically discrete systems (obvious
over-simplification), but real systems are less so.

Bio degradable software anyone?

  geraint%sevax.prg.oxford@Cs.Ucl.AC:
&gt; The answer to questions  like ``why can't I install  my own scheduler?''
&gt; has  surely  to be that  this  is not  a question  that  an applications
&gt; programmer  should  know  how to ask!  In particular,  if one is writing
&gt; real-time  programs,  then the correctness  of one's code had better not
&gt; depend on how it is scheduled.

Eh?  The real-time code I've heard about has depended very strongly on
tight control of scheduling -- cyclic scheduling of tasks and
strong control of priorities and sequencing of tasks.  Whether
the people writing real-time systems are "application programmers"
in the sense conventional in the US is another question...

As far as I remember, Martin Harriman is referring to the rotor failure on a
Bristow Helicopters' Sikorky S76A in Scotland.  The rotor hub has elastomeric
bearings, which were wearing prematurely, and the bolt on the inside of the
rotor shaft was taking shear as well as strain forces, whereas it was only
designed for the latter.  The inappropriate finishing technique to which
Harriman refers was a contributory factor in the failure of the bearing
under the shear loads. The wear was the main factor.  I believe that the
aircraft was also operating out-of-inspection, being ferried to a maintenance 
shop with an illegal passenger aboard.  The only moral relevant to RISKS 
would be not to take a free ride in aircraft that are out of inspection.

&gt;From: "Hien B. Tang" &lt;hbt@ICSE.UCI.EDU&gt;
&gt;Side note: Isn't the F-16 a fly-by-wire plane?  If electronic steering is
&gt;safe, and reliable enough for combat jets, why wouldn't it be safe enough
&gt;for everyday car?

	Several reasons. Primarily due to the fact that while a combat
jet is constantly maintained, your average car on the road is driven
until something breaks and causes it to be undrivable before repair is
even thought of. Also, there are a lot more cars of a given model on
the road than there are a given aircraft in the air.

	Second, your average F-16 pilot is well trained and knowledgable
about his aircraft, as is his ground support (though less so than the
pilot). Your average (American, though I have never seen any real evidence
that other countries do a better job) automobile driver is barely aware
of the way a car should be driven. How can it be otherwise? To get your
lisense in the US all you have to do is prove you exist, answer a few
questions, mostly about signs, and such, and then drive a total of
at most a mile at low speed. The most harrowing part of the test for
most people is the parking! But this may be irrelevant, what could
the driver of an automobile do if s/he suddenly found out that they
had no directional control? And what warning signs could they notice 
of impending (electronic) steering failure? 

	It certainly sounds like a nightmare to me...

    ... There are too many self-appointed aviation safety experts out there,
    like Ann Landers, whose only qualification is that they fly on airliners
    a lot.

This is scary to me.  The aviation community does NOT affect only itself.
The "mere" qualification that someone flies alot is certainly good enough to
give that person a legitimate interest in safety concerns.  If a solution
won't work, then it's up to you "real" experts to say why not, and to
explain it in a way that others will understand it.  Telling them to "stay
out" just doesn't wash.

The story referred to by munnari!csadfa.oz!davidp@seismo.CSS.GOV is
an old one: it dates back (at least) to the early or mid sixties. [Aside:
"The Choking Doberman, and other Urban Folklore" should be required
reading for RISKS contributors.]

The F-104 suffered a spate of crashes when it was first adopted by the
West German Air Force: the pilots thought that they were smarter than
the terrain-following radar with which the planes were equipped.  They
were.  However, the planes were faster than the pilot's reflexes.  After
a sufficient number of crashes, the cause was determined.

I also heard a similar story about early versions of the terrain-following
radar on the F-111.

  Since my RISKS contribution on the BBC-TV documentary on human error, I
have had a chance to find out somewhat more about some of the studies which
have been made of human errors, and on proposals for improved system
interfaces which would reduce the chance of human operator error. Some
sample references which other RISKS readers who share my ignorance of this
topic might find interesting:

  J. Reason. Recurrent Errors in Process Environments: Some Implications for
  the Design of Intelligent Decision Support Systems. In "Intelligent Decision
  Support oi Process Environments" (ed. E. Hollnagel et al) NATO ASI Series,
  Vol F21, Springer Verlag (1986) 255-270.

  D. A. Norman. Design Rules Based on Analyses of Human Error. Comm ACM 26,4
  (April 1983) 254-258.

  D. A. Norman. Steps Towards a Cognitive Engineering. Proc. Conf. on Human
  Factors in Computer Systems, Mar 15-17, 1982, Gaithersburg, MD.

Doubtless there are many other references, but I have not found any dealing
with the analysis of faults within computer systems arising from errors made
by their designer, which was my original hope. I checked with Jim Reason, who 
indicated to me that he does not know offhand of any such work. Incidentally,
his paper listed above, and one entitled "The Cognitive Bases of Predictable
Human Error" (Proc. Ann. Conf.of the Ergonomics Society, Swansea, UK, April
1987) used what I found a very interesting computer-like model of human
cognition, in order to "explain" observed patterns of human error.

   [Note that the entire April 1983 issue of CACM (which includes the first
   of the above Norman papers) is devoted to the humanization of computer
   system interfaces.  PGN]

The problems of building time-deterministic devices out of non-deterministic
components was debated at length during a recent IFIP WG10.4 meeting, during
a seminar on Hard Real-Time Systems, organised by Gerard Le Lann and Herman
Kopetz. The view of a number of us was that "time determinacy" was an
abstract concept, alright for abstract algorithms, but in general
inappropriate for real systems - certainly not systems and devices whose
components and/or design cannot be assumed to be absolutely faultless. Thus
we preferred to regard all performance figures, even so-called "guarantees",
as being probabilistic. Thus we viewed the task of the system designer as
that of satisfying him/herself (and others!) of the probability of some
given time constraint being exceeded remaining within some acceptable
figure, rather than that of "obtaining determinism from non- determinism".
Needless to say, even after the problem is recast in these terms, it will
usually still be formidable!

My wife is currently taking her MFA in lighting design, and I've run some of
the computerized boards -- so this is pretty much experience-based.

There are two kinds of "computerized" boards available today.  One kind is
designed with the computer built in; the other kind provides software and a
black box (usually just a bunch of d-to-a converters) to connect some sort of
PC (usually an Apple or IBM) to a pre-existing board.

In the first kind, you program light cues in advance.  Each cue is a set of
numbers (0-100) fed to dimmers.  The numbers represent the percentage of
maximum power fed through that dimmer.  Then you load up the program and by
pushing a single button, you move from cue to cue.  Once a cue is in place
("hot"), you can change it by hand, but changing hot cues is usually only
done in emergencies (like when a lamp blows out).  The board software
usually allows you to have a preset (the lights that are on while the
audience is entering the theatre) and to preview the next cue in a sequence.

The PC-based software usually does the same thing but often has more
sophisticated capability.  Some programs will allow you to construct cue
sequences on the fly by selecting out of a library of predesigned cues;
others allow modification of the cue just before it becomes hot, etc.

Now, to answer your question:  When the computer went down, the people in
the booth could not access the sequence of cues (and probably didn't have a
presetter on hand anyway).  What probably happened was that the board
operator set what's called a "standard wash" and left it.  Basically, he (or
she) didn't know what lights were supposed to come on when (stage managers
call the cues by number, which doesn't tell you what lights are used for
what cues).

This is an example of the RISK of not having paper copies of information
that's on-line and of the RISK of not having personnel available to do the
computer's job if it fails.

In my spare time, I play synthesizer with a local band in a large showroom,
and one of our techs here also works as stage hand in productions at the
fine arts center.  I have had exposure to the computer lighting systems...
and seen one fail.  The case you explained sounded a great deal like
problems other than simply the computer.  In all systems I have seen, all
lighting controls can still be done manually (perhaps not as quickly, but
you can use all the available lighting instruments).  The computer simply
digitizes the dimmer settings on the panel as it is programmed, and later
replays them in real time.  In either case, a real analog low-voltage signal
goes down a real wire to the dimmer (power) packs at the stage area which
control the lights.  It would seem better to leave the settings digital and
multiplex them on a single cable to the stage, but I have yet to see this
principle used (although it may in fact exist in a very large system).

The most RISKy component is the control cable leading to the dimmers
themselves.  If the computer goes bad, you still have manual control.
If the cable goes out, gets broken, etc., you really have trouble.  It
is possible to turn lights off/on manually at the packs, but that would
not be very feasible as a backup.

The new digital synthesizers are RISKy as well, speaking first-hand.
I own a Korg DSS-1 Sampling keyboard (not an advertisement) which has
512K RAM and a 3.5 inch double-sided floppy for sample/program storage.
When trying to change voices between songs during a stage black-out, I
inadvertantly pressed 'system save' rather than 'system load' and,
being in a hurry anyway (it takes 45 seconds to load), pressed the
verification without looking.  Out of personal stupidity, I had left
the disk write-enabled.  Realizing this, I attempted to abort the save,
only to corrupt the directory of the disk (when it rains, it pours).
Fortunately there was a backup disk (whew) but there was a considerable
delay (several minutes is a lot of dead air during a concert).

I rather miss the days when your worst nightmare was having a note out
of tune, or something relatively minor :-)

ReSent-To: RISKS@CSL.SRI.COM

Around 11:30pm local time (PST) on 9 mar 87, our local phone system (area
code 604, 736 exchange) died.  Calls in progress were disconnected.  After a
minute or two of no dial tone, it came back up again.  When the same thing
happened again about 3 minutes later, I called the operator and was told
"we've had a flurry of calls in the last couple of minutes".  All seems to
be ok now (an hour later).

The phone system in this exchange is an all-new digital one, installed
with considerable fanfare about a year or so ago.  I haven't heard any
reports of other problems with it, and line quality for modem work has
been excellent.

By a truly remarkable coincidence, at the time of the crash, I was scanning
our on-line Risks forum archive file via a modem over the phone, and had
read a couple of phone failure items only a few 10s of minutes previously.

It's interesting to consider what the odds are of having this sort of
accident happen while you're reading about the chances and/or hazards
of this sort of thing.  As it happens, they have been calculated by Luis
Alvarez for a somewhat similar situation, reading about someone's death
just after thinking of that person for the first time in a long time.  He
estimates of the order of 3000 such occurences per year in the US (this is
an order of magnitude estimate only, with a *large* error margin).  See
        Science 148, 1541 (1965)
for details.  Two followup items (in the context of the significance of
such occurences to "parapsychology") are
        Science 149, 910 (1965)
        Science 150, 436 (1965)

       [I recall seeing "China Syndrome" THE NIGHT BEFORE Three Mile Island.
       That certainly made an impression on me.  However, seeing "WarGames"
       the night before reading about a big computer security scam was much 
       less surprising.  Considering that telephone system outages do occur
       (but don't tend to get national news coverage), I guess your tale is
       not all THAT surprising.  The same goes for air traffic control outages
       -- see the next item.  But there have been numerous reports of 
       seemingly paranormal communications from people who have just died.

An ATC computer crashed yesterday, resulting in long delays in arriving
and departing flights at Hartsfield Atlanta Intern'l Airport on 9 Mar 87.
The main computer was down from 9:50 a.m. until 12:55 p.m.  The backup
system worked properly.  However, it does not handle flight-plan information,
which had to be done manually (and thus contributed to the delays).
(FAA spokesman Jack Barker said, "Safety was never a problem.")

   [There have been enough reports on the ATC system in RISKS lately that I am
   by no means including everything I find.  But I wouldn't want you to think
   everything was perfect.  And safety is never a problem unless it is a

A side note on the matter of skeptical software hiding the existence of the
Antarctic ozone hole:  the Jan 12 issue of Aviation Week notes that some
doubts have been raised about whether the hole is real.  The problem is that
there was a lot of volcanic activity early in the decade, and the dust from
it has been much more persistent at high altitude than anyone expected.  The
satellite instruments are not good at distinguishing dust effects from
changes in gas composition.

  &gt; ... The simple fact is that your actions put others (like me) under 
  &gt; involuntary risk, and preventing this sort of thing is the fundamental
  &gt; reason why laws and governments exist.  Phil

Wrong, Phil.  Pilot's actions place you at risk *only* if the pilots break 
the rules.  In the case of several midairs between commercial and private
aircraft, the "busting" of the Terminal Control Area by the private aircraft
(intentionally or unintentionally) played a major role.

  &gt; I don't care whether 5% or 50% or 100% of small planes lack electrical 
  &gt; systems; if they can't be flown without hazard to other planes, then 
  &gt; they shouldn't be flown at all.

I could use this argument to justify any safety item *at any cost*.  How about
$30k for an active collision avoidance radar for a $6k aircraft?  It would make
things safer, wouldn't it?  Clearly, there is a point of diminishing returns.
The $1500 (or whatever) cost per aircraft for a mode C transponder could be
better spend on training and enforcement.

&gt; The simple fact is that your actions put others (like me) under involuntary
&gt; risk, ...

I have several problems with this, but the main thing is to point out out
that it is clearly not the case that "small planes" without electrical
systems and/or transponders can't be flown without threatening innocent
airline passengers.  I expect that most such planes virtually never enter
the busy airspaces (i.e., Terminal Control Areas) where midairs tend to
occur.  One reason is that regulations ALREADY require radios and
transponders for aircraft operating in TCAs, as well as permission from the
controlling authority.

       [These last two sentences reach an apparently false conclusion.  
       (For example, Los Angeles and Chicago routinely report many such 
       incursions each day.)  There is a huge difference between regulations 
       and actualities -- which in general is often a problem system 
       designers tend to ignore!  PGN]

Airplanes will occasionally collide, as will cars and trains.  We should
indeed be working to reduce the RISKs, but in many cases (and I think this
is one of them) we should be focusing on the hard problem of making people
better pilots (and drivers, and programmers), instead of throwing money and
technology at the problem in order to appear to be doing something.
Especially when (again, as in this case) there are probably also technical
difficulties with the proposed "techological" solution (e.g., capacity of
the ATC system).

    [OK. Perhaps we have done enough on this for now.  People are most often
    the weak link in ATC, but technology can help.  However, if the people
    rely too much (or blindly) on the technology, then the existence of the
    technology may be debilitating.  PGN]

      Capsule Review of "Software Safety: What, Why, and How",
      Nancy G. Leveson, ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS, Vol. 18, No. 2

  "This survey attempts to explain why there is a problem, what the problem
  is, and what is known about how to solve it. Since this is a relatively
  new software research area, emphasis is placed on  delineating the
  outstanding issues and research topics." [From the Abstract]

I've often wished that there was a good survey of the RISKS field that I
could recommend to people who weren't as well informed on the subject as
I thought they ought to be.  I'm pleased to report that such a survey has
now been published in a widely accessible journal by a frequent RISKS
contributor.  Software safety is the central theme, but many other aspects
of risks to the public in computer systems are mentioned.  ("Mishaps are
almost always caused by multiple factors, and the relative contribution of
each factor is usually not clear.")

Regular readers of RISKS will find much of the material familiar.  But they
should appreciate the careful documentation of numerous software-related
mishaps and the perspective obtained by pulling back a little from our daily
batch of anecdotes and looking for general issues and principles.  The paper
is well organized, and lucidly written.  More than 100 references point
interested readers to more detailed and/or authoritative information.  There
is also a general bibliography with 28 entries.

Despite the title, this paper doesn't tell how to produce absolutely safe
software.  Instead, it tells how hard it is, and why it is hard. Activist
readers of RISKS will probably feel that it stops just short of some
obvious conclusions and calls for needed action.  (However, I'm sure that
it would not be possible to get a consensus of this group about what the
"obvious" conclusions and actions are.)

This happened to me several months ago, but I only just realized that it
might be of interest to this group.  My wife and daughter and I went to a
rather fancy restaurant here in LA.  We all ordered steak-type dishes and
specified various degrees of doneness, all on the rare side.  As we were
eating our first courses there was a short blackout, lasting approximately two
minutes.  The restaurant remained illuminated by the candles on the tables.

When the main courses came they were very overdone.  Our waiter took a
peek at the food and then called the manager.  The manager apologized
profusely and blamed the computer that controlled the kitchen(!).  As
far as I could figure out, he was claiming that the blackout wiped out
the memory of a computer which (among other things?) controls cooking
times.  When the power returned, the chefs had to try and recall how
long things had been cooking, and some mistakes occurred.

I have no idea if this was the truth or whether the manager simply
thought that a high-tech excuse would be most effective.

Since we were too hungry to wait for new dishes, we ate what we had
received anyway.  We were not charged for the meal.

I haven't had the opportunity to follow all of the discussion on the
electronic steering issues that have been in the Risks Forum.  I notice that
there seem to be two sides: those who are scared and those who believe that
the manufacturers will develop a safe product.  Look back at several of
those things that manufacturers should have caught: Pinto gas tanks, Audi
5000's sudden acceleration, Ford E-350 ambulances and their propensity to
catch on fire.  There are thousands of examples of such potentially
catastrophic hazards that have made it through the design and development
into manufacturing.  Every car manufacturer has had problems of this nature.
Yet, the tools and techniques for safety analysis of hardware have been
around for many years.  They can be very effective if properly applied.  Yet
we still have problems cropping up.  Now we are proposing to allow steering
to be controlled by software, control systems for which we do not have the
tools and techniques that exist for hardware systems.  Every software
engineer will tell you that it is impossible to eliminate all of the defects
in software: therefore, we have to ensure that the defects that remain do
not cause a safety problem.  Not a simple task.  The process has to start at
the concept stage.  The software requirements must take into consideration
the failure modes that can occur and develop traps to ensure that the system
fails safe.  The implementation of the safety requirements in the software
requirements must be thoroughly analyzed and tested.  Even then, it is
difficult to develop a "warm, fuzzy feeling" about this system.  Years of
development can be destroyed by a simple failure that results in a fatal
accident.

Several people have commented recently about errors in enhanced 911 systems
that resulted in misdirecting police, fire or rescue personnel.  In these
instances, a big safety issue is present.  In my capacity as Emergency
Services Coordinator for my county, I have been involved in investigating an
enhanced 911 system for us.  The system that has been proposed offers the
dispatchers the capability of entering information in addition to the
physical location of a caller into a master database.  This database is
located quite some distance from our locale and services a number of
jurisdictions.  Suggestions that have been made by our fire and rescue
personnel include inserting information such as handicaps or special medical
problems of residents, special problems that may be encountered in gaining
access to people (e.g., having to ford a stream), etc.  As the "good ideas"
expanded, it was suggested that people who may have toxic materials (farmers
with farm chemicals) or other hazardous materials (we have a number of gun
clubs that store black powder or reload their own ammunition), gun
collectors or others who may have valuables in their home, etc. be included
in this database.  Immediately I had visions of someone misusing the
database to commit crimes, etc.  How do we ensure the security of a database
of this nature when the people who are required to have access to it cannot
be trusted?  Recently, two local jurisdictions have had sheriff's deputies
arrested for participating in a burglary ring that has been functioning in
the area for 15 years.  Scary, isn't it?  And then there's Big Brother....

In my youth I worked as a stage manager and lighting designer/operator
for a number of summer stock (and winter broth) companies.  The most
complex show we ever pulled off had about 300 cues over a two hour
period.  (I do think the art suffered as a result.)   This was on
pre-computer but modern (1966) equipment, with 72 x 6 KiloWatt electronic
dimmer channels, and 4 presets (four slider pots per channel).  The
control room contained a desk with master controls, and a side-wing with
288 slider pots on it.  On our 300 cue show, we had 3 people operating...

When I later worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Montreal
(1972), the lighting system for Studio 42, a 600 seat auditorium, had 600
12 KiloWatt channels (one per seat :-).  The channels were connected via a
48 volt patch panel to 80 control levels.   The patch panel was a 600 by
80 matrix wherein the operator inserted a pin to make a connection.
(Multiple assignments picked the lowest numbered control level).
The 80 control levels had a primitive computer system for storage/recall,
but the one slider pot on the control desk could be driven to the level
of a recalled channel by a motor, and would detect the operator's touch
(capacitively) to permit the setting of levels.

Neither of these systems ever had all channels working at the same time.
The electronic dimmers were packaged in racks and racks of drawers, and
it was a simple matter to repair a vital channel by moving a drawer.
The 1966 vintage Strand Electric console had sufficient internal parallelism
that we lost channels and pots, but never the whole thing.  (I vaguely
recall a dual power supply).   The CBC system was another story, and
a fully qualified Group 8 (the top pay scale) NABET technician was always
in the building when Studio 42 was in use.  The lighting system failed
occasionally, but never took more than an hour or so to restore to operation,
since we stocked a full board replacement inventory.  In my five years there
it never failed on air.

I see current lighting control systems at the television trade shows.
They use multiplexed twisted pair to connect a small control desk
to `intelligent' dimmer boards.  Smaller systems build the dimmers
right in.  The control desk contains a microprocessor that operates
each channel, and reads levels from a floppy disc.  The key to making
these systems redundant is buying two control desks.   Individual
dimmer channels can fail, but that won't shut down a show.

The amount of rehearsal needed to choreograph the operation of a manual
lighting console is significant.  A failure of the modern control desks means 
the system is down, since there aren't manual controls any more.  (It's
usually possible to wire a channel on.)  The technical solution is simple (buy 
or rent another control desk for performances) but the people making these
decisions are often not technical (trust me), and view such backup as a luxury.

One of the most painful memories that I have:

Last fall, I attended a Pilobolus modern dance performance at Berlekey.
Their last segment was a performance of "Carmina Burana", accompanied by a
compact disk.  This is a long piece, perhaps 20 minutes.  About two-thirds
of the way through, when the performers were dancing "blind" (they had
various things on their heads), the disk skipped to a different section.
Many people didn't notice this, but I had seen the performance before and
listened to the music at home.  The performers were REAL good -- they
recovered perfectly and the show went on.
                                            [What an ORFFul experience!  PGN]

For about 2 minutes more, that is.  At that point, the disk went nuts and
started playing random 10-second bits of music.  Generally, just enough for
the performers to start to recover.  This went on for about a minute before
they gave up and turned off the "music".  But it seemed like an eternity,
with the poor dancers up there on stage, just thrashing.

I see the risks here as different from other risks associated with any other
pre-recorded music, because almost all other failures are not so
catastrophic.  With a record, for example, you can just nudge the needle and
continue.  On the flip side, it occurred to me that it was quite possible
that someone in the audience had, with them, the technology to fix the
problem.  Namely, a portable CD player, perhaps with the same CD.  An
amusing thought.
                                - Glenn Trewitt

    [Although off the subject of RISKS, this is of course a common
    failure mode of CDs -- not just a skip and a jump, but wildly
    erratic behavior.  Similar things happen in digital computer control 
    systems (as opposed to analog) -- slight errors may translate into
    wildly erratic behavior, e.g., a wild control transfer...  PGN]

[Me on Karn on mode C for all:]  (RISKS 4.61)

  &gt; ... I expect that most such planes virtually never enter the busy airspaces
  &gt; (i.e., Terminal Control Areas) where midairs tend to occur.  One reason
  &gt; is that regulations ALREADY require radios and transponders for aircraft
  &gt; operating in TCAs, as well as permission from the controlling authority.
  &gt;
  &gt;       [These last two sentences reach an apparently false conclusion.  
  &gt;       (For example, Los Angeles and Chicago routinely report many such 
  &gt;       incursions each day.)

I don't see how my conclusion is false.  My conclusion was NOT that
incursions do not occur.  The point is that an Airplane Without A
Transponder is not a greater threat to other aircraft IF it never goes in
airspace where a transponder does any good (busy terminal airspace or
airways).  Moreover, I have not seen anything to indicate that all or even
most incursions into TCAs are made by Airplanes Without Transponders.  Have
you?

     [Absolutely.  There seems to be lots of evidence that the incursions
     are by dingbat pilots, generally without appropriate avionics (adequate,
     nondefective, ...).  In the Aeromexico case, the controller was totally
     distracted by dealing with one dingbat, and ignored another -- BOTH of
     whom were transgressing.  PGN]

In my understanding (as a temporarily inactive Private Pilot) the only
thing that requiring Mode C on all aircraft does that the current
regulations don't is require Mode C on aircraft NOT operating in busy
airspace. If the current regulations don't work, this won't either.
As you noted, there's a difference between regulation and reality.
Transponders have to be turned on to work.  Clearly some TCA incursions
are made by planes with Mode C transponders - irresponsible/incompetent
pilots may fly all kinds of airplanes.

On the other hand, if the proposal is to have all aircraft equipped with
Mode C that operates AT ALL TIMES, then the proposal must also require
ATC to monitor all aircraft.  As others have noted, I think it
will be some time before the system can handle that, although that may
be a worthy goal.  Even then, incursions will occur.  And your
comment applies here:

&gt;...rely too much (or blindly) on the technology, then the existence of the
&gt;   technology may be debilitating.  PGN]

As a side note, my brother has been training to become an Air Traffic
Controller for about nine months.  He won't even sit down at a radar screen
for a long time yet.  New controllers must be completely familiar with the
"old" manual system, which is of course used when things break down
(actually it is always used; radar and computers are simply an aid).  My
impression from speaking with him is that the ATC system has a healthy
distrust of (at least some kinds of) technology.

&gt; In Europe there was a spate of (F-111?) crashes.  The apparent cause of
&gt; these crashes was pilots (1) believing they could fly the plane on their
&gt; own without the help of any dumb computer, (2) turning the computer off,
&gt; and (3) promptly flying into a mountain.
&gt; Any Hints?					DavidP

Don't know much about this particular case, but there is a famous story
about the early days of the F-111 in Southeast Asia...

The F-111 was the first fighter-bomber with Terrain Following Radar.  The
radar controlled the plane through the autopilot to "hug" the earth; flying
about 200 feet above ground level.  It would look far enough ahead, and if
an obstruction was sighted, the plane would pull up at the appropriate
moment at a pre-programed G level (for those interested in further details
of this type of flying, see the archives for rec.aviation).

The first combat crews were trained in the US, then send to Thailand to fly
missions to North Vietnam.  They had a high loss rate for night TFR
missions.  Then they found out why:

The TFR was set to fly the plane at 200 feet.  The TFR couldn't see trees,
and some trees in SE Asia grow over 250 feet high...

There has been a bunch of discussion about this in mod.os.minix; basically
within a year of the patent, it was released for Public Use, i.e. anyone
who wants to can use the setuid concept (which is why minix does). The
article there cited real U.S. Patent Office publications giving the details.
(I probably should have saved the article but didn't.) Anyway, I'm writing

the manufacturer who incorporated the feature, not AT&amp;T who invented it...

         [Response to comments of G. Jones and B. Randell:]

     It is a truism that we, as engineers can only hope to minimize the
probability of failure in the systems we build (assuming that you believe in
quantum mechanics). The relevant question is of course how to build systems
in such a way that we can have as much confidence as possible that they will
meet specifications with reasonable resources. To build a system which has
critical timing constraints, we can allocate resources carefully so as to
enable us to prove that the system will invariably meet the specified timing
constraints, ASSUMING that the hardware functions correctly and the external
environment does not stress the system beyond what it is designed to handle.
The fact that the hardware may not function correctly or that the operating
conditions imposed by the external world may exceed the design limits with a
certain probability DOES NOT absolve us of the responsibility to try to
allocate resources carefully so as to invariably meet the critical timing
constraints. Yes, performance figures are ultimately probabilistic. But if a
real-time software designer can at all help it, the source of uncertainty
should not be due to the adoption of a resource allocation strategy which is
outside the control of (worse still, not understood by) the software
designer.  I do not want my real-time program to cause a plane to crash or
an oil-drill platform to topple over in rough seas just because I cannot
predict that a tight loop takes twice as much time to run when the processor
decides to flush its data cache at an inopportune moment! I think this type
of predictability is the "time determinancy" that Scott Guthery was
referring to in his message. It has nothing to do with sequential
programming. It is a property that I certainly prefer to see in a
safety-critical system. I suspect you would too.

     There are many interesting and important research problems involved in
designing predictable real-time systems, i.e., guaranteed to meet certain
behavioral and timing specifications. Sometimes, the implementation language
can get in the way, e.g., see [Volz and Mudge 86], [Mok 84]. Having a
multi-processor system does not necessarily make it very much easier to meet
timing constraints. Even if you have one processor for each process, you
still have to make sure that the communication subsystem can deliver all the
time-critical messages. This communication problem is likely to be harder to
solve the more processors you employ. (Formulated properly as a
combinatorial optimization problem, a variety of this communication problem
can be shown to be NP-hard, but that does NOT mean that practical solutions
do not exist.) On the practical side, there are always the engineering
tradeoffs that need to be researched, e.g., should we use as few processors
as possible to meet the specifications so that we can have as many extra
ones around to replace ones that fail on-line? If we use one processor for
each process, will the power supply generate so much heat that the avionics
becomes less reliable because of higher operating temperature? If I am
writing a really tight timing loop (talking about microseconds, not
milliseconds), does it suffice to be able to measure execution time in terms
of the programmer's source code in a high level language? And how do I find
out how the on-processor instruction/data cache affects execution timing, if
I am allowed to measure execution time only at the high level language
level? There are also many other issues which are more theoretical in
nature, especially about the part the scheduler plays in satisfying
behavioral/timing specifications (more about this later?). All these need to
be studied carefully so that we can design real-time embedded systems that
the public can trust.

In Risks 4.62, mlbrown@nswc-wo cites several "things that manufacturers
should have caught" and mentions three, namely "Pinto gas tanks, Audi
5000's sudden acceleration, Ford E-350 ambulances."

Now from previous postings on Risks and elsewhere, it is clear to the
non-hysterical that there is no "Audi 5000's sudden acceleration" except
for that produced by the driver stomping on the accelerator.  (Experiments
where both the brake and accelerator were floored disprove the 60-Minutes
docu-drama theories.)  (And, to forestall weak replies that the "thing that
should have been caught" was only the pedal layout, I'll remark that I've
seen it stated and not denied that the Audi's pedal layout, while skewed,
is by no means the most skewed layout on the market.)

The perceptions about Pinto gas tanks, too, are largely the result of
public alarm (I might say hysteria), fanned by those in charge of selling 
newspapers. In actual government crash-tests, the Pinto  
  a) passed the government-defined government-given tests and  
  b) was not even at the bottom end of the vehicles that passed.

I haven't heard of the "Ford E-350 ambulances and their propensity to
catch on fire."

While I realize that a totally time-deterministic system is unachieveable
(on quantum theoretical grounds if none other) I am unwilling to simply
throw up my hands and hack code until everything seems to work correctly.  

My definition of a real-time system is a system in which time is a 
quantitatively managed resource.  The key word here is QUANTITATIVELY.
Scheduling is obviously the very heart of time management. Not only am 
I repulsed by the notion that people are to be told that there are 
questions that they may not ask, the correctness of a real-time program 
depends first and foremost on how it is scheduled.  Telling a real-time
programmer not to care about scheduling is like telling a scientific
programmer not to care about units.

In doing quantitative time engineering, I am prepared to work with 
tolerances and with probabilities.  If I'm working in microseconds,
I can do my calculations with some nanosecond slop.  I can also carry
out my calculations with probability distributions rather than values.
But I want to be able to make statements like the following at the end:

	"The time between when you start to depress the brake pedal
	 with velocity v until the brake shoe makes contact with the
	 drum is k milliseconds plus or minus j microseconds."
or
	"After you start depressing the brake pedal with velocity v
	 the brake shoe makes contact with the brake drum in at least
	 m milliseconds with probability n."

In other words, I want to provide my customers with the same sort of
quantitative risk assessment information that the people who build
medical systems (drugs, procedures, treatments, therapies, etc.) are
required to provide their customers.

In the work that I do, the execution time of one instruction counts.
For some of the machines I'd like to work with I am unable to obtain
either tolerance-bounded or probabilistic measures of instruction
execution times.  I had an opportunity to chat with the designer of the
Transputer recently.  Not only did he not know the execution time 
distribution the instructions, he didn't really care what they were.
This is not a directed criticism.  All of the advanced system designers
I've spoken with (processor, language, operating system, network, etc.)
abandon time determinism at the drop of a hat.  It's the in thing to do.

What I'm making a pitch for is quantitative risk assessment because
with it will come quantitative system engineering including quantatitive
time engineering.  We all praise safe systems and deride unsafe ones
but this is just Monday morning quarterbacking.  The question is how do
you build a safe one and avoid building an unsafe one.  The scientific method
seems to have worked well in other sciences, maybe it's time we gave it
a whirl.  Or maybe we just having too much fun playing in the silicon.

The French auto manufacturer, Citroen, has been selling cars with active
hydraulic suspension since the advent of the DS series in the late 50's.  It
probably used an analog computer, which is a little off the topic here, but
the benefits and risks might be of interest to people considering suspension
controlled by digital computer.

The suspension compensates to give better traction when going around
corners, down or up hills.  It does this by actively tilting the car closer
to upright.  The car rides high at city speeds for better clearance of bumps
and gets closer to the rode the faster you go, for better highway stability.
You can also flip a lever in the cab and have the car rise a foot off the
ground to go over snow, on dirt roads, etc..  It gets higher than a jeep.

The hydraulic system replaces the conventional car jack.  To change a tire,
you raise the car to its highest position, put something akin to a jack
stand underneath the middle of one side, and lower the car again.  The flat
tire rises into the air (RISKs: doesn't work right if you're on a hill, you
need someone to sit on the car if you are just trying to rotate tires).

The same facility allows the car to drive on straight roads with only three
wheels.  Thus, a flat doesn't cause you to swerve, and a blowout doesn't
cause you to go out of control (RISK: my father once drove for five miles on
a flat because he didn't know anything had happened).

As you might imagine, driving in a Citroen 15-20 years ago was a bit like
driving in a concept car.  And the suspension is only one of the advanced
features it had.

There are some interesting RISKs.  The car "settles down" after you turn off
the engine.  Since in city-mode it runs higher than most cars, you could end
up settling down on someone else's bumper.  The hydraulics will not lift the
car up in that case.  If you forget that you have the suspension in the
raised position and go on the highway, the car is not as stable as it would
otherwise be.

My father once had a break in the rubber tubes carrying hydraulic fluid
while on the highway.  All the warning lights in the car went on at once,
including a large red light that said "STOP".  The car remained stable, but
he lost power brakes, power steering, and power suspension all at once, and
had to get towed away.  A normal precaution was to carry an extra can of
hydraulic fluid around with you.

Scientists studying the problem from Antarctica announced some results that
were covered by TV news recently.  They said that products such as chlorine
dioxide were found at 50 times the expected levels, which indicates that the
ozone really is combining with chlorofluorocarbons and the need for action
is urgent.  I don't know how the measurements were made, but they seemed
convinced.

From: David Barto &lt;scubed!megatek!barto@seismo.CSS.GOV&gt;

Recently here at Megatek, we have had a couple of problems with our
phone systems.  Both are the fault of the operator NOT checking that
the information typed in was correct.  The first was mine, the second
someone else.

My mistake was in reversing 2 digits in the phone number.  Instead
of calling a computer, I called a person.  Every hour, for 4 days.
The person complained to the phone company who traced it to us.
I did not notice since I had 2 phone numbers to try, the first failed
and the second worked.  I thus ignored the problem, went to USENIX, and
while I was gone the problem was reported.  (See what you get for making
changes on a friday before going on a trip? :-)

The second was more serious.  To call a long distance number the prefix
was 1-919-XXX-XXXX, the person entering the number entered 91, followed
by 2 backspaces to enter the 1 long distance code.  The back spaces
were ignored and the resulting number was 911-XXX-XXXX.  Dialing 911
with a modem indicates you are a deaf person requiring help.  The
number was traced back to us (our rotary) and the first person to be
called and asked about it was ME!  (I made the first mistake, I made
the second one.  Sound reasonable... :-)  It was found to be another
machine doing the dialing, and was corrected.

In both cases the number written on the piece of paper was correct and
the number entered in the computer was wrong.  I wonder how often this
happens.  We are becomming more computer oriented (look at the number
of modem ads you see, and the number of PC and PC clones that are sold.)
Could this become a major RISK in the future, dialing wrong numbers
for hours on end?

What is "involuntary" about the risk?  When you step aboard a plane, you
know there's a risk that something will go wrong.  No one forces you on.

Does your argument also apply to cars?  Suppose I can afford to equip my
Rolls Royce with one of those new radar-based automatic braking systems,
making it much less likely that I'll plow into someone from behind.  Now,
don't I have the right to expect that everyone else out there will want to
make *ME* safer as well, by installing these systems in their cars?  The
technology is there, we could certainly cut down the number of involuntary
(think of all those innocent passengers) traffic deaths, if only people
weren't so selfish and independent-minded.  And we're not even talking here
about systems that cost more than the cars themselves, unlike some of the
aircraft collision-avoidance systems you want every plane owner to rush out
and buy.

Anyway, this whole discussion has little to do with computer system
risks, so let's shut it down.    [AGREED.  P.]

There has been a lot of discussion on RISKS recently about air safety.  I
have three questions that perhaps someone out there has more detailed
information about.

The first is the Automatic Landing System (ALS) that has been used in
Europe.  Could someone summarize what is known about ALS as far as RISKS is
concerned?  Is it (believed to be) a fail-safe system? Is it run by a
digital computer (with software :-) ) ?  Are there steps being taken now to
bring such a system to the U.S.?

The second question is about active controls on commercial jet transports.
Somewhere, I read that the new McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 (follow on to the
DC-10) will have relaxed aerodynamic stability, made possible by (naturally)
active controls.  What happens after a lightning strike wipes out all the
avionics (it has happened)?  It does not follow that if it is OK for the F-16,
it is OK for a commercial transport.  I assume that there won't be zero-zero
ejection seats for each passenger.

The third question is whether there any completely fly-by-wire transports
out there now? I have read that there is a version of the Airbus with
fly-by-wire, but it didn't say whether it also had conventional controls.
The same questions as above apply.

Back when I used do computerized cartography and terrain modelling I'd
heard a story (unconfirmed rumor, interesting scuttlebutt) that some
part of the F-111 lossage was due to active (and simple, low
technology) countermeasures.  In particular, one or more low altitude
airbursts with an appropriate mortar round (chaff? ) a couple hundred
meters ahead of the plane would cause a very strong terrain-like radar
return to suddenly appear.  The G force limiting in the program was
implicit, with the flight path obtained by filtering the observed
terrain into a smooth curve.  This worked great as long as the
observed terrain is really static and doesn't do anything strange.
When the terrain follower suddenly observed a "mountain range" appear
immediately ahead of the aircraft it panicked by trying to climb over
it.  The resulting acceleration could be well outside specs.

Since the planes tended to reuse routes such as valleys, the
implementation of this alleged countermeasure is simple.  An observer
with a phone alerts the mortar crews down route that a plane is coming
and sould arrive in X seconds.  The timing of the airbursts is
non-critical.  If the mortar crews get it right the wings fall off.
If they are too far in front of the plane it pulls up hard anyway
making it vulnerable to conventional AA.  Even if the AA doesn't get
the plane, the crew has just had a very disturbing experience.  Their
confidence in the terrain following system is shaken.  Their mission
plan might be screwed up possibly causing them to miss navigational
checkpoints.  They've got lots of excuses to abort and go home.

The immediate solution: program the system so that it ignores sudden
changes in terrain.  It wasn't obvious what would happen if there was
a real hill on the other side of the burst.  The smart money says
don't rely on terrain following in hilly terrain.

I've worked in several different theatres as a lighting 'techie', both as a
stagehand and as the lighting designer.  In at least two of the auditoriums
I've worked in, the lights were controlled by a computer; one was computer
assisted, the other was fully computerized.

In the computer-assisted setup, the computer was used to control fast,
highly complex fades and effects in addition to hand controlling of other
fades qued on often 'inspirational' actors.  This was a nice balance, as the
operator could override the computer at anytime with a full set of manual
controls (100+ channel 2 scene preset board).

In the fully computer controlled system, everything was done through the
computer:  setting levels, fade timing, special effects, etc.  It had a
ss/sd floppy drive on one side, and looked kinda like a tvi 910 terminal
with several slider controls instead of keys.  As long as the computer was
operating correctly, it was useable.  Unfortunately, it was originally
installed wrong (by a regular (subcontracted) electrician, not a specialized
theatre electrician) and was often unusable, aside from the "backup system".
It was eventually fixed, but still, when it goes, it's gone.

There was a (half-baked) backup of all 96 channels tied to twelve controls
(single scene, no presets).  If the computer died from heat or power glitch,
we'd turn the key over to 'backup' and hope that we could restart the
computer and return to the correct sequence without too much confusion.

In such systems, the lights often cannot be done by hand because 1) there
aren't enough hands (sometimes the case with over 100 seperate controls),
and/or 2) the system wasn't designed to be overridden.  In some cases, all
that's left to human control are the follow-spots, which do little for
flooding the whole stage.

Do I like working with computer lighting systems?  Of course.  They make my
work as a designer much more exciting with the effects that are possible.
Do I want full overrides, even if I don't have enough hands? You'd better
believe it!! --

    With the recent discussion of computer-controlled lighting
boards, I ask "How resistant to Electron Magnetic Interference
should these boards be?"  Not such as academic point as one would 
think.  An audio engineer friend of mine related this incident:

    He was running sound for the Broadway production of "A Chorus
Line" a few years back.  Then-president Ford came to a performance.
Secret Service men everywhere.  One by the sound board, one by lighting,
etc.  All is quiet until about the mid-point of the play.  Then the
Secret Service man standing by the lighting board (an early Nicholson
model I believe) got a call on his walkie-talkie.  To reply, he depressed
the push-to-talk switch, sending out a couple of watts of RF, and
Presto! the entire theatre was plunged into inky darkness.  Chaos
ensues, PERT guns are drawn, etc., etc.  It completely wiped out the
CMOS memory of the lighting board.

    Questions: should mil-spec EMI resistance be built into only military
equipment?  Who would have thought that a lowly theater lighting board would
be of critical national importance if for only a few moments?  Could a
high-tech John Wilkes Booth use some knowledge such as this for the next
asassination attempt?

    About 18 months ago here in Atlanta, a string of phone-related
accidents caused much confusion and consternation in the lives of
at least one family.

    To begin with: one of these "computerized" telephone sales pitches was
calling through a mid-town exchange offering "you have won a free Bahamas
vacation.  Just call xxx-xxxx!" As it was walking through the exchange, it
hit an unlisted number.  This phone was an emergency override number into
the metro Atlanta cable television system.  In the case of extreme
emergency, the Mayor or head of the CD would call this number.  The incoming
phone line would override the audio portion of ALL cable channels currently
in use.  It was about 10:30 a.m., so there wasn't as big an audience as if
it had been prime-time, but yes, all of Atlanta's cable subscribers were
informed they had just won a free trip.  Chaos ensued.  Especially for the
poor family whose telephone number was one digit different from the
call-back number.  Through no fault of their own they got one call every 20
seconds all that day.

    Reducing the RISK of this repeating itself could take place at any
step: Legislation limiting "computerized" sales pitches (this hasn't been
done), a security code on the emergency phone number (this has been done)
and for the poor lady getting the wrong numbers, not much.  If
any RISKS readers are unfamiliar with the design process that went into
the design of the Touch-Tone (TM) keypad, it makes interesting reading.
The designs were a speed vs. accuracy trade-off.  The lady could only
wish that The Labs had put a higher priority on accuracy.

This was sort of an information-age Orson Welles "War of the Worlds".

A little while ago there was quite a debate in RISKS about the comments in
the ACARD report concerning certification, and the use of formal methods,
for safety-critical programs. Last week's Computer Guardian (an insert in
the daily paper, The Guardian) carried a splendid article on this report by
Keith Devlin, one of their regular contributors, who is in fact on the
Faculty of the Department of Mathematics at Lancaster University. I and my
colleagues here enjoyed its content and style so much that, even though it
is somewhat lengthy, and the major points it makes are not new, we thought
that it should be offered to RISKS, in its entirety, so that the rest of you
can see what the UK national press is occasionally capable of!

  DISCRETE CHARMS OF APPLICATION

  Keith Devlin, The Guardian, 12 March 1987

  Flicking through a report produced by a research advisory council to the
  Cabinet Office recently, my eye was caught by some rather amazing figures.
  The subject under consideration was the use of mathematical techniques to
  verify the accuracy of computer programs - surely a laudable aim if ever
  there was one.  According to the committee who assembled this report, the
  current best practice in the creation of commercial software produces on
  average just one error in every one thousand lines of code in the final
  product.  (How does one convey raised eyebrow using the written word?)
  Given better verification techniques, the report went on, one could
  "realistically expect" an error rate of just one error per hundred thousand
  lines of code.

  Well, in these days of PR hype one does become used to extravagant claims,
  but this one must take the biscuit.  In a report that is presumably intended
  to shape future research directions, this is a ludicrous proposition to
  make.  Worse still, the report did not stop there.  The ultimate goal was,
  it appears, for the mathematician who certifies the said program as being
  "correct to within an error rate of 0.001%" to be henceforth held legally
  responsible for any future failures of the system (including the possibly
  lethal consequences thereof).

  Now, while I am in complete agreement with the idea of professionals having a
  responsibility for what they do, the fact of the matter is that the committee
  who prepared this particular report have not the faintest idea of just what
  mathematics is about, and their faith in the notion of a "rigorous
  mathematical proof" would be touching if in the present context it were not
  so potentially dangerous.

  To put it simply, a mathematical approach to the writing of computer programs
  is highly likely to result in better, more efficient, and more reliable
  programs, than would a less structured approach, but that is all.  There
  can be no, repeat no, question of such an approach giving rise to a
  guaranteed product of the kind suggested.  A mathematical proof of any
  reasonable length is just as likely to contain an error as is a computer
  program of the same length.  Mathematics helps.  It cannot cure.

  The writers of the aforementioned report would do well to read the article on
  program verification written by De Millo, Lipton and Perlis in the recently
  published book "New Directions in the Philosophy of Mathematics," edited by
  Thomas Tymoczko and published by Birkhauser Verlag of Basel in Switzerland.
  Indeed, in spite of its possibly daunting title, I can recommend this book to
  anyone interested in mathematics and, in particular, its relationship to
  computing.  Though - as with any compilation - there is some variation in the
  quality of the various articles, overall the book is worth getting hold of.
 
  One particular chapter deserves special mention, and that is the account
  of the "Ideal Mathematician" written by Philip Davis and Reuben Hersh.  As
  well as being hilariously funny, this succeeds in providing an uncannily
  accurate portrait of the typical, present day pure mathematician.  (Indeed,
  I suspect that its humour is a direct consequence of its accuracy.) Read it
  if you want to discover what characters like me to for the greater part of
  our working day.

  The Davis and Hersh piece is taken directly from their award-winning book
  "The Mathematical Experience," published by Harvester Press (Brighton) in
  1981.  If you have not yet come across it, make sure you do.  It is, quite
  simply, the best general book on mathematics that has ever been written. So
  good, in fact, that when I heard that the same two authors had written a
  second book, I wrote at once to the publisher asking for a copy to review in
  this column.

  When my copy of "Descartes Dream" by Davis and Hersh (Harvester, 1986) duly
  arrived, what a disappointment! Gone is the life and vitality of the
  previous book.  The short, unstructured chapters I found dull and
  unrewarding; the theme suggested by the title and the introductory chapters
  barely discernible in the rest of the book; and some of the writing is just
  plain bad.  (I hope it is just the effect of trying to follow a huge
  success, and before long another gem will be on the way.)

  Somewhat similar to "Descartes Dream" is another new book from Birkhauser:
  "Discrete Thoughts" by Mark Kac, Gian-Carlo Rota, and Jacob Schwartz.  But
  where Davis and Hersh fail to convey any feeling of the vitality of
  mathematics in what they write, the assorted articles in this compilation
  are full of life, and consequently enjoyable to read.  Anyone interested
  enough to read this column regularly should get a lot out of this book,
  written by three of the world's best mathematicians/computer scientists.  So
  too should all those professional mathematicians who take their art too
  seriously, and those whose expectations of mathematics are far in excess of
  reality.  But this is where I came in.

Excerpt from ``Risky moments in the money markets'' in U.S. News &amp; World Report
of March 2, 1987

   According to the New York Fed, Wall Street's average daily volume of bank
wire transactions totals at least $1.2 trillion---an amount equal to one
quarter of the U.S.'s total annual economic activity---and could be as much as
$500 billion a day higher, though no one really knows.  Even at the lower
figure, that's five times the daily flow since the start of the decade.  Each
year, transaction volume leaps by nearly 25%, or double the annual growth rate
in the 1970s.  [...]

   The obvious fear is a financial accident that could bring the system down.
Banks must settle accounts daily, and a failure to pay up by one could cause a
chain reaction of problems for others.  Close calls in settling are more common
than is generally known.  A Federal Reserve Board official acknowledges the
number of ``breathless moments'' averages 10 a year.

   One of those scary scenarios developed in 1985, when the government-
securities market was severely disrupted by a computer software ``bug'' at the
bank of New York, preventing settlement for a day and a half.  Only a $23.6
BILLION [my emphasis] emergency loan by the Fed got the wheels unstuck.  [...]

   Each day, billions of transactions move from country to country over a pair
of wire systems: The Clearing House Interbank Payments System, called CHIPS,
operated by 140 banks specializing in international finance, and the Federal
Reserve Systems's Fedwire, which links 7000 domestic banks and does the
bookkeeping for Treasury securities transfers among banks.

   The electronic linkages make it possible for money to whiz from computer to
computer so quickly that the same dollars can be used to finance up to seven
deals a day, compared to two in times past when paper checks were the principal
method of payment.  [...]

   One danger signal: Last year's daily transaction value was 24 times greater
than the amount of reserves banks had on deposit with the Federal Reserve
System, up from a 9.4 multiple in 1980.

   It has become common practice for banks to go deeply into hock each day,
often exceeding total assets in anticipation of payments they will receive
before it is time to balance their books at closing.  Such ``daylight
overdrafts'' account for as much as $110 billion to $120 billion on the
Fedwire and Chips.  [...]

   What makes the climbing debt even more unsettling is that payments move over
CHIPS and Fedwire systems that [Gerald] Corrigan [, head of the New York
Federal Reserve Bank,] describes as a ``hodgepodge of facilities, equipment,
software and controls that have little in common with each other.''  Even if
the hodgepodge is capable of handling the flow now, Corrigan and others worry
about it remaining adequate if the transaction volumes continues to grow as
astronomically as it has in recent years.  ``The money spent on computer
systems has not kept pace with the tremendous explosion in electronic
payments,'' says a Fed official.

Interaction with Computers, edited by H.T. Smith and T.R.G. Green, Academic 
Press, 1980, paperback, London and New York editions.  The book is a nice and 
diverse collection.  Rasmussen discusses operator error, but not designer 
error.  The chapter by Green, "Programming as a Cognitive Activity", touches 
on errors in program design.  He criticizes a paper by Mills that implies that 
topdown design is the way to design good programs and praises a 1976 paper by 
Denning that rejects the proposition that the process of creating a 
well-structured design is (in general) well-structured.

I have to give a pitch about software environments for developing scientific

Can anyone provide me with anecdotes (all names will be withheld) concerning

environments/automatic programming in the scientific context, I'd appreciate

In RISKs, you proposed some interesting scuttlebutt about mortar rounds and
TFR.  From what I know about the workings of radar, I would tend to be
skeptical of the incident because radar systems have to take things like the
dielectric constant of materials in account [slightly more complex than this
but I'm not here to talk about radar] ("earth" differs greatly from chaff,
and moving earth (explosion debris) is even different than static; earth
particle size is also significant), but what is interesting is what we don't
really know about radar.  I say, "I am skeptical," not "You are are wrong."
What the radar/avionics person would tend to do would be to go empirically
check this out.  All aircraft are checked out in chambers to determine their
base radar signature (empirically) because we don't have good models on
radar return.  So I would think the people at Hughes (Hugh Aircrash ;-)
would have tested their radar under this circumstance as soon as it was
proposed.  BTW this is what is now also done for EMP testing.

A colleague of mine recently lent me the following:

Understanding Systems Failures, by V. Bignell and J. Fortune 
(Manchester University Press) 1984 (p/b).  To quote from the blurb on the back:

   "This book outlines a common approach to the understanding of many
  different kinds of failure: failure of machines, of individuals, of groups
  and businesses.

    "A dozen case histories are discussed by the authors. They range from the
  accident at the Three Mile Island power station to the collapse of
  Rolls-Royce and the sinking of a North Sea rig, each a result of a variety
  of faults and failures. Failures are then analyzed through an approach based
  on the identification of the systems that failed and a comparison of these
  with a variety of standard systems.

    "The stories of many of these failures have never been written from such a 
  perspective before, and this is the first time that a wide range of
  studies has been brought together to provide an understanding of failure
  in its widest possible sense.

    "Understanding Systems Failures is the set book for the Open University
  course T301, 'Complexity, Management and Change: Applying a Systems
  Approach'. It will be useful to students and teachers of management,
  business studies, administration and engineering."
  
The above seems a fair description to me. There is, as far as I can tell,
nothing explicitly related to computers in the entire book, but it is
nevertheless a book which might be of interest to the RISKS community - it
would, for example, provide a good (and cheap!) source of quite detailed
background factual material for students who were being required to analyze
what part computers might play in decreasing (or increasing!) the likelihood
and seriousness of various types of system failure.

The cover story of the March 16, 1987 issue of US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT
is a long and colorfully-illustrated story on various high-technology
tactical weapons.  The story is somewhat informative but isn't real clear
about which weapons already exist and are deployed, which are in development
now, and which are just gleams in someone's eye.  In particular, the article
blurs the distinctions between what appear to be three rather distinct 
categories of weapons:

1. Precision guided weapons - The soldier selects the target and guides
the weapon all the way to the target.  These include the TOW optic fibre
guided rockets and the various laser-guided bombs (which work because someone
focuses light on the target, which the bomb homes in on).  These are by now
deployed all over the place and often work well, although they are not 
panaceas.  A difficulty is that the soldier must often remain exposed during
the whole flight time of the weapon.

2. "Fire and forget" weapons - The soldier selects the target, but the weapon
guides itself to the target.  This is significantly harder.  The most 
effective examples seem to depend on the target making itself very 
conspicuous, for example the HARM anti-radiation missiles that home in on
radar beacons.  The article also describes AMRAAM,  an air-to-air missile of
which it is said "a pilot can fire as soon as he detects an enemy aircraft.
He can immediately steer clear while the missile tracks and kills the enemy
with no further help." The story says AMRAAM is "costly and controversial"
but is "now being tested."  Is this for real?  I vaguely recall hearing
about AMRAAM off and on for many years, and thought it was in a lot of
trouble, a bit like the Sgt. York.

3. Autonomous weapons - The weapon itself selects the target.  I have a lot 
of trouble with this one.  For one thing, it is obviously a lot more difficult
technically than even "fire and forget;"  The article rather blurs this 
distinction.   The article says, 

"Smart bombs that require human control might not be good enough. ... A simple
stick-figure picture of a target, such as a railroad bridge, is put into one
"autonomous guided bomb" under development.  Launched at very low level with
a strap-on rocket, the bomb flies a preplanned route until it sees something
to attack that matches its computer's picture."

Does anyone recognize the project refered to here?  Is this thought feasible?
Based on my understanding of the state of the art in image understanding, I 
would have thought not.  Does this possibly represent some reporter's 
understanding of some rather speculative document like the 1983 DARPA
Strategic Computing Report?

Another autonomous weapon which is evidently farther along is SADARM:

"The Army's Sense and Destroy Armor (SADARM) smart-weapon system uses
advanced radar, heat sensors, and a miniature onboard computer ...  Fired
from artillery, ... the submunitions, each a small, self-contained weapon,
would pop a small parachute and spin slowly down as it scans for telltale
signatures of self-propelled guns.  Once it sensed the presence of a target,
it would aim for the center and fire an explosively formed slug of
metal that slams into the lightly armored top of the vehicle, filling the
crew compartment with a hail of deadly shrapnel."

What are these "telltale signatures?"  Are they all that discriminatory?
Elsewhere, the article implies that distinguishing tanks from trucks and
jeeps is not much of a problem.  Is that true, _in the context of this
kind of weapon_?

The article strives for journalistic balance in the usual way:  Proponent
A says these are necessary and would be effective, critic B charges they
may be ineffective and we should not become too dependent.  What I find
missing is the notion that perhaps such judgments need not be based on 
personal opinion, that it ought to be possible to design tests that determine
these things.  That is, maybe A is right and B is wrong (or vice versa).
I assume the people who work on these understand that, but
the concept never really appears in the article.  Also, the article implies 
that the strategy and doctrine of relying rather heavily on this kind of
stuff is almost dogma by now, rather than still being provisional and 
much debated in strategy circles.  Is that true?

The article is especially good in in explaining why such weapons are thought
necessary: 

Population trends tell the story ... West Germany has the world's lowest
birth rate. ... By 1994 the draftee pool will shrink nearly in half.  In 
America, political realities impose an equally inflexible obstacle.  "How 
far do you think a President would get who wanted to reinstate the draft,
expand the standing armies by three or four times, and deploy a major portion
of that force overseas?" asked Joseph Braddock (of the defense think-tank,
BDM).  "We don't have much choice," adds former Defense Secretary Harold 
Brown.  "We've got to choose quality over quantity."

According to page 22 of March 16th's Wall Street Journal, Volkswagen may
have lost over 259 million dollars due to foreign-exchange contract fraud.
According to the article, the fraud involved "the erasure of computer
data and tampering with computer programs."

      I want to share an experience that I am having with a health problem
connected with my work.  I am a programmer and spend a lot of time at a CRT.
I am not technology-phobic, but I have been enlightened by my chiropractor
that CRTs can be dangerous.  Many CRTs in my work situations are placed low
enough so that my neck must be tilted at a *very slight* angle.  I have been
experiencing neck stiffness on and off over the last two years...it
frequently bothers me for as much as a week at a time.  My chiropractor
tells me that holding my head in a fixed position at that angle --- even as
slight an angle as it is --- for a long time is probably causing that
stiffness.  It so happens that I must hold my head at nearly the same angle
when I play piano and look at music on the music rack of the piano.  I am
changing my behavior quite a bit; I have raised the CRT on my main
workstation so that it is at eye-level; if the computer I am working at
can't be adjusted that way, I look down with my eyes instead of using my
neck.  For piano playing, I tape the music up higher on the rack, or just
memorize things in order to avoid holding my head in that deadly fixed
position.  I think that it is helping.

	If this doesn't afflict you, then that's great.  But I would guess
that in general the position of CRTs in most work areas are placed with
complete disregard for healthy neck position, and as a result many
programmers are in danger of getting this reaction.  Maybe 10 years from now
we'll see photographs of computer work environments and experience the same
kind of dismay we get when we see photographs of turn-of-the-century
sweatshops.  Think of it this way:  would you want to watch *television*
with your neck at that angle (not to mention with the screen so close to
your face)?

    [RISKS has explored this topic several times.  The evidence is mounting
    that there are hazards in using terminals.  Among my acquaintances, I have
    recently run across an orthomolecular physician who after setting up
    a new color display and working on it for 16 hours straight discovered
    serious physical damage to one of his eyes.  Another person (with serious
    candida albicans problems, and thus greatly increased sensitivity to
    his environment) finds a strong sensitivity to fumes from his PC --
    possibly from the power supply.  Headaches, backaches, neckaches, and
    certain internal problems are also linked or aggravated by extensive
    terminal use.  So, perhaps in the future terminals will come with a
    warning: computers may be habit forming and hazardous to your health.  PGN]

While I find computerized sales pitches obnoxious, I find it amazing that
the Atlanta cable TV system would have a dial-in number that overrides the
system without a password required.  It is very easy to misdial a phone
number.  But, as has been a theme of my earlier letters, the phone system
represents a misunderstood technology.  A secret phone number itself does
protect against certain classes of malicious attack, but is very vulnerable
to accidents.  Given the number of wrong numbers I get on my phone, I'm
surprised that Atlanta has not already been treated to confused callers
broadcasting to the city.

   [There are indeed many risks associated with unlisted phone services.
   A variety of existing services offered are accessible either accidentally 
   or intentionally from unexpected sources.  (Steve Jobs' latest endeavor
   also has a whole bunch of associated risks.)  The phone service that lets
   you call your home computer and then punch some more digits that turn 
   on the oven or unlock a door for the delivery man is one example.  The
   phone service of having your pacemaker battery checked remotely by a
   computer that interrogates it in a diagnostic mode is another.  Believing 
   that an unlisted phone number will not get called is of course utter
   folly.  My unlisted home computer number gets about a call-a-day's worth
   of wrong numbers.  The scanning phone solicitors are extremely agressive.
   In the Atlanta case we again have an example of a risk that was not
   anticipated, and discovered only after it was accidentally triggered.  PGN]

My new unlisted phone number contains two adjacent '9's.  Just about all of
the wrong numbers that I get are caused by somebody's '9' key
double-clicking. I'm giving serious consideration to changing to a phone
number with no repeated digit.

     [I hesitated before including this one, but then decided there is an 
     interesting problem in coding theory.  Perhaps phone companies could
     offer an eight-digit number for those seeking a redundant digit to
     reduce wrong numbers.  But, the algorithm would have to be carefully
     chosen to detect as many transpositions, accidentally repeated digits,
     and adjacent (with respect to the keypad and the rotary dial) digits as
     possible.  I would subscribe at a reasonable price.  PGN]

A friend of mine deposited her paycheck using the bank's ATM machine.  When
she signed her paycheck, she also wrote the account number on the back.
Unfortunately, she interchanged two numbers, so the check was deposited in
some random person's account.  The ATM machine gives her a receipt that
basically says that her deposit was accepted, so she went off and assumed
that the check was deposited correctly.  Well, of course the bank didn't
bother to verify that the account number written on the back of the check
matched either the account number printed on the ATM slip (included with
deposits) or the account name.  They just blindly took her word for it.

After quite a hassle and a couple of bounced checks, things were straightened
out, but it took quite a bit of time and much embarrassment.

I can think of two problems here.  The redundancy of having a name
associated with your account and the further redundancy of having the ATM
print a special deposit slip to be included with each deposit is pretty
useless if people aren't going to check them.  The other problem is it
introduces an incentive to *not* put your account number on the back of your
check, and instead depend on the ATM slip to furnish this information, thus
increasing the dependance on automation.

By the way, the bank stated that it was not at fault here.  I'm not so sure,
after all, it should have detected the discrepancy.

Regarding the recent discussion of the RISKS of computers and telephones:
Several years ago, when I lived in Victoria B.C., the local telephone sales
organizations (e.g. "Buy the XXX vacuum cleaner") purchased a computer which
called up various numbers to make its pitch. The problem with the system was
that it would not release the line, even if the potential customer hung up.
In one case, a mother was prevented from calling for an ambulance while her
child was choking. Fortunately, the child survived. Soon after, laws were
passed requiring the dial-up computers to hang up when the customer did.

In the cyclic process of deciding on how much to include in RISKS, I have
once again been turning up the threshold due to an increase in somewhat
marginal material.  I realize that the masthead guidelines are in EVERY
issue, and therefore perhaps only new readers pay attention to them.  On the
other hand, I believe that the RISKS Forum serves a very useful purpose in
tolerating open discussion, even when some of it is not quite accurate -- we
all learn from the ensuing discussion.  Therefore I hate to stifle openness.
But I also get complaints when RISKS issues get very long or very frequent
-- and besides it is tough on me trying to keep up with all of you when you
get into FLOOD MODE on a popular issue.  So, try to stick to the guidelines.

By the way, I received messages from ONLY TWO of you questioning my command
of the English (american) language in the masthead item in <A HREF="/Risks/4.63.html">RISKS-4.63</A>:

The use of "load" instead of "lode" was quite intentional (I try not to

some of you as an editorial comment.

When I was in Junior High School (about a decade ago), I was working in the
school library when they instituted the magnetic tag approach to security.
Well, naturally, those of us who worked in the library, immediately started
trying to determine how to defeat the system.  It didn't take us long to
discover that a hard rap on the spine of a book against a desk or table
sufficiently scrambled the magnetic elements that the book would pass
through the detector.  Because the system is so easy to defeat, it's
actually easier to steal books now because you can be reasonably sure that
the bookstore employees have enough trust in their system not to watch what
people carry in and out.

    From Ronald J Wanttaja:
    Ann Landers has a right to her opinion.  But what do I say when someone
    mentions that "Ann Landers says we gotta ban the little aircraft?"

You explain to them why banning little aircraft is not the solution.  I
agree that it is difficult, but telling them to go away (as I am sometimes
inclined to do myself) is a sure way to polarize the community.

    Similarly technical decisions are best left to those technically qualified.

Perhaps.  But when the "unqualified" (such as Congressmen [...]) are ultimately
the ones who make the decisions, you ignore them at your own peril.

LOS ANGELES TIMES, March 18, 1987
RICH CONNELL and TRACY WOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

   The financially troubled Southern California Rapid Transit District
has created a phantom warehouse to "store" more than $1 million in lost,
stolen or misplaced bus parts, RTD employees have told The Times.
   The dummy warehouse, as some RTD employees also all it, was devised
nearly a year ago and exists only in the RTD's computers -- a kind of
accounting limbo for lost materials that at other transit agencies are
promptly acknowledged and written off as losses.  RTD workers charted
that the ghost warehouse, labeled "SD14", is symptomatic of management
efforts to hide mistakes with little regard for public cost.
   "It makes [RTD middle managers] look good to higher-ups ... .  You're
not losing as much money on paper," said one warehouse employee familiar
with the system.
   John Richeson, RTD's assistant general manager, the district's
overseer of inventory, said he learned of the non-existent warehouse
only last week as a result of inquiries by The Times.  However, he
defended the bookkeeping maneuver as a good idea for handling "inventory
that is not in the location it is supposed to be."
   RTD managers acknowledged that the non-existent warehouse is an
unusual bookkeeping procedure, but they insisted that it is neither
improper nor deceptive.  Richeson said that to characterize the district
as hiding its inability to control inventory is "not the proper
interpretation."
   The list of missing parts in the phantom warehouse has grown from
zero nearly a year ago to more that 500,000 items worth $1.28 million in
bus and office supplies on hand.  RTD officials said that hunting down
the missing supplies and trying to determine how much has been stolen
and how much has been misplaced has been a low priority because the
search would be too expensive and time consuming.
   "The dollar value certainly is not substantial in terms of the
overall inventory or the overall volume of things we are doing,"
Richeson said.
   However, the fuzzy status of materials moved to the non-existent
stock area creates other problems.  It is now more difficult for transit
police investigators to know quickly when parts are truly missing and
possibly stolen, said RTD Police Chief James Burgess.
   "That's one of the problems we do encounter with this system," he
said.  [...]
   RTD managers inserted the phantom warehouse into the district records
after a systemwide inventory of bus parts was taken last April.  The
inventory supposedly produced a complete tally of RTD bus and office
supplies, from which accurate computer records of parts on hand were
produced for the first time.
   However, several sources familiar with warehouse operations said the
inventory served mainly to reveal the lax controls on parts and
supplies.
   "It was a complete disaster," said one, explaining that a lot of
material listed in inventories could not be found.
   In other instances, RTD officials acknowledged, inventories that were
on hand may have been overvalued.
   "The inventory was meaningless," said another source who participated
in the inventory   [...]
   Almost immediately after the inventory adjustments were made to the
books, parts began disappearing again, causing new problems.
   A computer system that is supposed to automatically replenish parts
when they are needed began refusing to place some orders.  Since
disappearing parts were not being removed from inventory lists, the
computer showed the district had those parts on hand.  But stock clerks
checking the shelves were unable to find them.
   Faced with a parts-purchasing bottleneck that could sideline badly
needed buses, district employees began making expensive rush orders for
special overnight deliveries from manufacturers.
   Partly in response to this new set of inventory problems, RTD
management placed the phantom warehouse on its books.  They listed it as
SD14, the kind of computer label used to designate an actual warehouse
at a specific location.  SD14 was inserted in a column of real warehouse
listings, with nothing other than its number to set it apart, for
example, from SD10, the computer designation for a storeroom at a bus
yard near downtown Los Angeles.

ELECTRONICALLY 'SHIPPED'
   Wayward parts were thereafter electronically "shipped" to the new
warehouse, freeing the central computer system to reorder parts to keep
the system's 2,800 buses running.
   In addition, the fake storage area has eased the pressure on managers
to account for missing parts.  In the past year, they no longer have had
to "write off" all the parts they could not find and were able to
minimize unexplained losses in their budgets.
   RTD officials insist that the chief purpose of the phantom warehouse
was to ensure that a detailed investigation of missing materials could
be made.  Maynard Walters, RTD director of purchasing who authorized
creation of the ghost storage depot, recalled telling his staff, "I
don't want it [written off as a loss].  I want it put in an account and
held there so I can have a report on why it's not there."
   However, after 11 months, officials say they have not had the
manpower to track down all the errant parts and supplies assigned to
SD14.
   "We have a certain amount of personnel that we can spend finding all
of these things...," said James Connolly, the RTD's materials manager,
who set up the fictitious warehouse.
   Gradually, SD14 grew until it had three or four times the parts and
inventory value of other satellite stockrooms.
   
ARGUMENTS ERUPTED
   So real did SD14 appear, that for months, warehouse clerks and
mechanics unsuccessfully tried to retrieve needed parts from it -- and
even got into arguments with higher-ups over why supplies stored there
could not be delivered.
   "I couldn't figure out what it was," one RTD warehouse worker said.
"I'd look on the computer screen [for parts].  It would say nobody has
them but SD14.  I'd say why can't we get them from SD14.  [Eventually, I
was told] SD14 doesn't exist."
   As time went on, the phantom storehouse became a running joke among
warehouse workers.  The instant any part was misplaced, someone would
suggest, "look in SD14," employees said   [...]

NEW FACILITY
   As part of a sophisticated parts-tracking system at the new facility,
computer-guided robots will store and retrieve all parts, keeping an
accurate, running inventory as they go, RTD officials contend.
   "It's just like night and day in terms of the ability to control
things," Richeson said.
   Other RTD employees are less confident.  They point to management
shake-ups and earlier highly touted state-of-the-art systems that have
not solved inventory control problems.
   One RTD worker, referring to the new high-tech warehouse, said,
"There'll be problems there we haven't even anticipated, that will be
magnified tenfold."

ReSent-To: RISKS@CSL.SRI.COM

I'm working on a paper entitled:

	Overcoming Information Overload with Technology
		     (Why It Can't Work)   ,

talking about mostly (from the abstract):

    Most of the solutions that are commonly posed to the problem of
    information overload are to ``build better mousetraps'', the
    hope being that the technology will catch up and allow us to
    sift through enormous amounts of data easily.  I believe that
    not only is this thinking flawed, but dangerous, and discuss the
    inherent problems from both a technological and cultural perspective.

and would be most interested in any thoughts readers of this digest
had about this subject matter.  (It's for the upcoming Directions and
Implications of Advanced Computer Systems conference in Seattle) (not
that I've had it accepted yet, or anything...)

I'm especially interested in horror stories people could tell me about
relying on information filtering systems and finding that they actually
weeded out critical information...  Thanks!

The most likely cause of a problem is OZONE.  Created by "high" voltages, it
is commonly associated with sparks and (particularly A.C.) motors.  Given
that the average PC circuit board or disk doesn't do much sparking (one
hopes!) a possible culprit is the fans commonly on power supplies or other
equipment in PC's.  These are usually driven by A.C. motors.  If the fan(s)
brushes are sparking internally (this will generally be invisible from
outside inspection), considerable ozone can be created--this is very
irritating to some people and generally not great for anyone (ozone is one
of the commonly measured components of air pollution).

One of the most common causes of neck pain is anxiety (stress).  Excessive
worrying about daily use of a CRT might bring on or exacerbate neck pain,
might it not?

Recently an ATM machine (operated by the CA$H Network) confiscated my
card.  Here's what happened:

I entered my password, but didn't press the keyboard hard enough, thus
losing the first digit.  Realizing what had happened, I pressed CANCEL,
and the machine ejected the card.  Since I just wanted to try again, I
poked the card part-way back in, rather than taking the card out as the
machine instructed.  The machine didn't "accept" the card, i.e. the
motor which normally pulls in the card didn't operate.  At that point I
realized the machine wanted me to take out the card, but by then there
wasn't enough of the card exposed for me to get a grip on it.  After I
had fiddled with it for about a minute, a helpful bystander pushed the
card all the way in, and the machine promptly informed me that it had
taken the card and that I should contact my bank.  I guess the machine
thought I was tampering.

By the way, the person at the bank told me that when an ATM machine
seizes a card, it chops it in two, so I have to wait a couple of weeks
for a new card.  Meanwhile I've opened an account at another bank so
I'll have another card for a different ATM network.

In reference to the person whose ATM deposit went into the account written
on the back of the check, rather than that associated with the ATM card:

   A few months ago, I had precisely the opposite experience: after
carefully filling out the deposit envelope, checking the "Checking
Deposit" box and writing the account number for the checking account,
I inadvertently punched the "savings deposit" button on the machine,
and sure enough that's where it went, much to the detriment of checks
drawn over the next week. Though I confess I failed to study the
deposit receipt closely enough to detect the discrepancy, I was
a bit surprised that the conflicting information didn't set off
red flags somewhere.
   A query directed at one of the people who opens those envelopes
received the response "Oh, we never look at what's written on the
envelope". I never did receive a satisfactory answer as to:
 1) why, given a choice, information requiring 10 penstrokes (and
    presumably a bit more thought) should be ignored in favor of
    information requiring only a single button-push (presumably
    much more susceptible to accident)
 2) (the larger question) why redundant information which could
    be useful for cross-checking is requested but ignored. It seems
    to me that this latter is a classical issue in hardware,
    software, and humanware systems.

A recent article ("Telephones: Learning Some Manners"; The Economist, March
14, 1987, pg. 82) discusses a pilot project at three exAT&amp;T local operating
companies of a system called Local Area Signalling Service (LASS).  The new
technology is a "line history memory" at the originating line's switch which
records the number dialed.  This number can be queried by the receiving 
line's switch. Some of the capabilities require a new instrument with display
but most do not.  The article quotes $5/month marginal cost.

The big gain is in reducing the current invasion of privacy.  Most people 
wouldn't admit physical persons into their home before determining their 
identity, but we don't know who we are going to talk to until we answer the
phone.  Other tricks include:

Got a busy signal? Punch a code for automatic reconnect.  When both caller
and called lines are free, the system calls the caller and asks if the call
should be completed.  Several calls may be pending.

Pick up the phone just in time to hear the other end disconnect?  Ask your 
local switch to call him/her back.

The incoming identifier phones would be useful to mail order houses etc. to
verify the origination of a call, as well as the privacy application.  (The
article also points out that it will prevent calling your spouse from a bar
with a fib about working late.)

The local switch could also contain a "screen list" of numbers for special 
treatment;  selective call forwarding, call waiting, or exclusion.  (The
original system gave a message "At the customers request, your call is not
being completed" to excluded callers. This annoyed a lot of people, so it 
was changed to a "fake" ring-no-answer.)

The article also points out that over half of all nuisance calls are placed
from home.  The new system will discourage that sort of thing.

I discussed this article with a friend, who made two interesting assertions:

1)  The information (calling #) is already available, and is encoded somehow
    just prior to the ring spike on the receiving line.

2)  He was told by manufacturers of telephone sets that a feature to display
    this information on the recipient telephone was against current FCC 
    regulation.

Such a system opens and closes many abuses of the phone system. The article
mentions nuisance calls and mail order verification.  I don't see any 
obvious risks to the new features, but I can imagine weird combinations of
screens leading to unintended results.

Can anyone comment on my friend's assertions, or know which three operating
companies were involved in this project?

The issue of automatic callers releasing the phone line is actually 
a people issue rather than a technology issue.  Most telephone companies
will release an incoming call when the recipient has hung up for about 15
seconds.  This does not depend on the caller hanging up.  When I was a kid,
we knew that we could move from one phone to another as long as we did so
in less than 15 seconds (and were the recipients of the call) rather than
the callers.

The problem comes when the call is unwanted.  The recipient generally hangs
up for as long as it normally takes to get a dial tone (1-2 seconds) and then
goes off-hook, to "check" and make sure that the call was dropped.  Naturally,
it was not.  The recipient goes on hook for another two or three seconds and
checks again.  Call still connected.  Panic sets in and a feedback loop
ensues.  The recipient is unable to drop the call, not because the line
is being held from outside, but because s/he does not know how to do so.

When I get an unwanted call, I hang up, and walk away.  I admit that the
parent trying to call an ambulance does not have this presence of mind,
but in truth, it would work.

This is not to imply that I approve of automatic telephone solicitors.
I consider them to be one of the few things worse than human
solicitors.

I was recently cleaning up my files in preparation to moving to Europe for
a year, and came across the following insert in a phone bill from some time
ago (a year or two, judging by the stratigraphy).  I thought it might be of
interest to RISKS readers.  My phone supplier is Bell Canada (I'm in Ontario).

        Are you offended by recorded telephone solicitation calls?

        To help regulate the number of unwanted phone calls coming into your
        home or business, ground rules have been established by the Canadian
        Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) governing
        automatic dialing and announcing devices (ADADS) _when used for
        telephone solicitation purposes_. [italics in the original..mw]

        ADADS are ... [explanation of what they are and what they do...mw]

        Now, before the pre-recorded message starts, you must be informed
        of the nature of the call, the identity of the caller, and that you
        may end the call by hanging up.

        Within 10 seconds of [your] hanging up, the ADAD must disconnect
        from the line.  ADAD calls may be made only between
        9:30-20:00 weekdays, 10:30-17:00 Saturday, 12:00-17:00 Sunday.

        [two more paragraphs explain how and to whom you complain about
        violations, and the fact that organizations using ADADs have been
        warned what violations will do to their phone privileges...mw]

Somehow, having just had the time to catch up on the last dozen issues or so
of Risks, the following seems appropriate.  My last flight back from DC
Thursday afternoon had one of those chatty pilots, which I'm never sure I
appreciate or don't.  Anyway, once we were well underway he boasted about
all the wonderful features of the 757.  (I'm not knocking the plane:  as a
passenger I like it.)  After talking about how the thrust is half the weight
(mass, technically) of the loaded plane, the seven-color radar that spots
precipitation and turbulence, etc., he then added (paraphrased), "and this
plane has over a 100 on-board computers for your comfort and safety; for all
you know you may be sitting on one right now." That almost ruined the whole
flight! (at least, I pondered over it quite a while.)

Look up if you want to see the real RISKs in many theaters.  The failures in
computer lighting systems discussed recently may cause inconvenience or
economic loss, but failures in the computerized winch systems used to "fly"
scenery have the potential to cause serious bodily harm.

The typical arrangement for flying a piece of scenery is to attach several
lines (e.g. 3/16 wire rope) to it, run these lines up to the stage ceiling
around pulleys to the drum of an electrically powered winch.  The winch is
controlled remotely either manually or in more sophisticated systems by
small computers.  These computers can be preprogrammed with the flying
sequence for an entire performance in a way very similar to the programming
of lighting systems. The scenery being flown can be quite heavy.  The
electrical winches are supposed to be failsafe, i.e. a brake is
automatically applied if power or control is lost.

One of the first such systems was installed in the Loeb Theater at Harvard
in the early 1960s.  It had several interesting failure modes including one
in which the winch went into "full speed up" mode and tried to pull the
scenery through the pulleys in the ceiling.  This continued until the wire
rope snapped and the scenery went into free fall.

Somebody mentioned a NY Times article about our good 'ol Northworst Airlines
that described an incident in which there was an all-channel failure of the
computer system on a DC9 (must have been an MDA80) which led to the loss of
all attitude display.  Supposedly the airliner was led into Toledo airport
by a general aviation aircraft (!).  Anybody have any details on this?

Gregory Sandell's submission prompted me to mention the main problem I have
had with VDU use; namely, eyestrain.  I used to find that after a day at
work my eyes would be very tired.  About a year and a half ago, I saw an
article on the net suggesting that a good way to reduce eyestrain associated
with terminal use was to reduce the amount of light striking the screen as
much as possible.  So, my office-mate and I implemented the following
measures (adapted from suggestions in the original article, which unhappily
I no longer seem to have):

	* Keep all windows well covered during daylight hours.

We have venetian blinds on our window and closing them completely is
reasonably satisfactory.  It would be better if we could exclude even more
light, though.

	* Turn off all overhead lighting.

Our room is lit by fluorescent lights which are quite bright.  With them
turned off and the blinds closed, it gets reasonably dark.  The darker the
better.

	* Use desk lamps, but _keep light from them OFF the screen!_

We each purchased two spring-arm type desk lamps to illuminate the work area
on our desks.  Reading material on the desk is probably easier than before,
as the desktop is actually better illuminated now than it was by the
overhead lighting.

Our experience with this has been very positive indeed.  Both of us have
completely ceased to suffer from eyestrain.  And I also find the dimly-lit
environment to be much more relaxing than it was when it was brightly
illuminated.

I would like to thank the poster of the original article, whose name I
unfortunately don't know, and thoroughly recommend this approach to anyone
who suffers from eyestrain due to VDU use.

   (Several of them have conducted reasonably careful experiments that
   seem to pinpoint that sensitivity.)  I will not speculate in this
   forum on what the possible neurophysiological causes might be, although

On Sunday 22nd March an Australian activist group using a radio frequency
scanner intercepted and recorded an unencrypted car phone conversation
between a federal opposition shadow minister and a state opposition leader
(both members of the Australian Liberal Party). The conversation referred to
the Liberal Party federal leader in what has been euphemistically termed
`colourful language' and discussed his intended political demise.  The group
released the tape to a Melbourne newspaper that proceeded to publish a
number of juicy excerpts.

Today the federal shadow minister was fired from his party post, and the
chance of an election being called by the Prime Minister to take advantage
of opposition confusion was regarded as having doubled from 15 to 30%.

Federal police are considering whether to press charges under the
Telecommunications Act that broadly covers such interceptions. The fine?
$5000 maximum. Good value for altering the course of the country's politics,
although it's not clear that that was the intent.

I can offer two pieces of information, neither of which answer the questions
completely.

1) the 911 emergency number in Toronto displays the number from which a call
was made.  It does this for a wide variety of originating exchanges (but I
don't know if it does it for all exchanges).  I have been told, by people
who are more knowledgable about phones than I, that the number is sent on
the same circuit as the phone call.  They claim that almost no gymnastics
were required to make this work.

(The phone company also makes a database of phone numbers and addresses
available to the emergency service, so that numbers are quickly turned into
street addresses.  That clearly wouldn't be available to the average
business or home.  But that is a different matter.)

The implications are that (a) exchanges send the origination phone number
along with the call, and (b) exchanges can relatively trivially send the
information to the customer phone, and (c) the customer phone can decode
the information while the phone is still ringing, and (d) it's not illegal
in Canada for emergency use.

2) The University of Toronto recently switched over to a Centrex III system.
Certain (secretarial) phones can now display the number called and the
number calling.  The number calling works only if the call originated within
the centrex exchange.  It is not clear whether the restriction is technical
or legal.  The implication is that it's not illegal in Canada for calls
originating within an enterprise.

It is clear that, if such a telephone were to become a consumer item, it
would change the whole way we deal with telephones.  I could refuse to
answer calls from people I didn't want to speak to right now.  In fact, I
would probably program the micro in the telephone with a phone list of
people who were and weren't allowed to disturb me.  There would appear to be
many human engineering problems to solve there.  And many computer RISKS.

&gt;The issue of automatic callers releasing the phone line is actually 
&gt;a people issue rather than a technology issue.

As far as I know it depends on the "office" (telephone company term for
switching equipment) connected to your phone.  In the NW US 
there are three types: mechanical, ?, and electronic.  A mechanical
office will hold the line open as long as the caller has his/her phone off the
hook regardless of the callee's actions.  An electronic office will close
the connection as soon as either party hangs up.

&gt;Panic sets in and a feedback loop ensues.

However, I do agree that this can be a problem in any human system.

	Clearly, different banks do things different ways.  Some time ago I
wanted to make a mortgage payment at an ATM but couldn't find the right
menu item.  When I called for help, they told me to just pick any of the
"deposit to ..." or "payment to ..." items.  It seems that at least for the
case of you making a deposit or payment, they totally ignore which button
you pressed; it's what's on the slip that matters.  In fact, it doesn't
even matter which slip you use.  They type of account is encoded in the
account number.  When I needed a "deposit to X" slip once and they didn't
have any, I was told to just use a "deposit to Y" slip and write the proper
account number on it.

	The question is, doesn't this represent a real risk to the consumer
(although, maybe not truly a computer-related risk)?  I'm pretty ignorant
of the ways of banks, but I've learned how my bank works.  If I go to a
different bank, I'm probably going to assume they work the same way, which
probably means I'll get burned at some point.

A year ago I happened on a remote gasoline station that allowed the
customer to pay with an ATM card.  After paying it occurred to
me that this scenario was ripe for fraud.

How do I know that this ATM reader is really part of the ATM network?

Think about it... 

First I let it read the bits off of my card and then I give it my secret
PIN number.  What is to stop some unscrupulous person from rigging a fake
reader and duplicating my card (they already have my PIN number)?

Hmmm..  a few scandals like this and I bet we see smart cards with
challenges and counter-challenges being exchanged between the card and the
banking system.

   [This is of course an example of the mutual suspicion problem that
   Mike Schroeder worked on in the 60s.  Yes, you must trust the ATM
   apparatus, whether it is trustworthy or not.  The same is true of
   any store that takes one of your credit cards, even with no computer
   in the loop.  This is an old risk, but if RISKS never included 
   discussions of old risks, our newer readers would be cheated.  The
   safest solution is to avoid using such facilties, the next safest is
   to audit the records carefully.  PGN]

Mechanical Engineering 2/1987 is the "What went wrong?" issue with
articles on the Thresher and Chernobyl.  Reading about Chernobyl makes me
cringe.  Again and again, "clear violation of operating procedures".

ME 2/1986 caught my eye with an article on space power and propulsion
systems, but within it were articles on "The Dangers of CAD" [In the past,
any discrepeancy between computer results and measured performance was
traced down with an almost religious fervor.  This zeal is still
appropriate], human guided industrial "robots" (with some remarks on safety
systems buried in there), and a study attempting to determine the safe speed
for an emergency vehicle to enter an intersection (can the siren be heard?).
Not all of these things are RISKS from computer systems, but I found it
made interesting reading.

For bank troubles, I sent a check paying part of my bill to the insurance
company, but they imprinted the entire amount on it for machine consumption
(about 6 times more than the amount I intended).  I actually figured this
out before bouncing any checks because my account dipped rather
surprisingly, but I spent a thin month trying to convince the bank or the
insurance company that there might have been a mistake ("No, no, that
couldn't have happened.").  My bank rather quickly corrected my account when
I showed them the cancelled check, but I'm sure it could happen again.  You
can be sure that I took my sweet time getting the rest of the money back to
the insurance company.  Of course, the source of this error was human, but
it was compounded by blind faith in computers (and the efficiency of
computerized check processing).

   [This is a longish "summary", but serves a useful purpose in putting in
   perspective some of the previous messages on this subject.  PGN]

Going through recent back issues of the Toronto Star, I found an article
of about one full page about the Audi 5000S controversy, by the Star's
automobile columnist Jim Kenzie.  It was printed March 7, pages E1 and E15.
At PGN's suggestion I supply a summary of the article's content.

* All the drivers interviewed on TV said the acceleration occurred upon
  shifting from P/N to D/R and that they had their foot hard on the brake.

* Paul Ast claims that failure of the idle stabilization valve can cause
  the engine to surge to 4000 rpm independent of the accelerator; William
  Rosenbluth claims that foreign matter in the transmission control valves
  can lead to a pressure buildup that pushes a rigid part of the throttle
  linkage that is only supposed to be pulled.  These explanations conflict.

* Audi says there were no skid marks in any of the incidents, accelerator
  pedals were bent, they can't reproduce Ast's problem, and Rosenbluth's
  would involve severe transmission damage but the affected cars are new.
  Therefore they claim driver error and have recalled the cars to fit an
  interlock so you can't shift out of P without applying the brake.

* Kenzie (the columnist) revved an Audi 5000S up to 4000 rpm and put it into
  D while holding the accelerator steady.  The car did not run away but took
  several seconds to reach 10 mph.  There was also a lot of noise from
  the 4000 rpm idling, and a loud thump when the transmission engaged,
  which none of the victims apparently reported.  So much for Ast's theory.

* Kenzie then pressed the brake and accelerator, all the way, simultaneously.
  The car revved up to 2700 rpm but stood still.  Finally he took it up to
  30 mph and did the same thing.  It stopped.  None of the victims, or their
  lawyers, has suggested a simultaneous temporary failure of braking, so it
  sure seems that Audi is right and the victims wrong.  Probably they are
  simply repeating the same mental error they made originally.

* Some past Audis did have a minor unwanted-acceleration problem due to floor
  mats fouling the accelerator.  Also, Audis used to have the brake and
  accelerator pedals close together and in the same plane so they could
  be "heel-and-toe" operated, but not since 1982 here, because most are
  sold with automatic transmission anyway.  But these things could tend to
  make people more likely to blame the car when it is an Audi... a bandwagon
  effect.  It is also possible that some "victims" are simply out for money
  in a class-action settlement.

* According to Tom Lankard of AutoWeek, the majority of Audis involved were
  newly bought, many by people switching from GM cars, which have the brake
  and accelerator much less close (so if you miss the brake you don't hit the
  accelerator).  Many drivers were short, which would aggravate any confusion.
  [Does "many" mean "a statistically significant fraction"? --MSB]

* Kenzie doesn't know why the accidents only happen when starting from rest,
  but points out that once people are driving they already have their foot
  on a pedal and this provides a reference point.  [He doesn't address at
  all the people who said they had BOTH feet on the brakes -- but at this
  point I'm willing to call them mistaken. --MSB]

The above is shortened about 80%.  Kenzie's conclusion is worth giving in full:

  There is one party who DOES have guilt dripping from every pore, and
  that's television journalism.  The 60 Minutes piece was shoddy in the
  extreme -- yellow journalism, in full color.  They had convicted Audi
  before the show even began.  Their story was grossly slanted, full of
  innuendo and witness-leading.

  The Today Show was only slightly better.  They at least identified the
  prosecuting "experts" by name on screen, and had them explain how their
  theories worked.  But Rosenbluth's credibility was destroyed when he
  "proved" how the Audi could accelerate due to hydraulic excess trans-
  mission pressure.

  First, without letting the audience know, he deliberately jammed both
  the normal pressure relief valves and the "fail-safe" backup ones in
  the car, which had been involved in two previous "incidents" and which
  still, for effect, had its left front fender missing.

  He tried to prove that it could happen -- not that it did happen.
  Second, he lightly brushed the brakes enough to turn the brake lights
  on for the camera, implying that the brakes couldn't stop the car from
  accelerating across the road into a ditch.  He said he had to shut the
  engine off to stop the car.  As I have previously noted, this is
  completely false.

  Only [the Canadian show] Market Place even attempted the tests that I
  did, which prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the brakes will hold
  the car regardless of throttle opening.  Still, they devoted about 10
  seconds out of an eight minute piece to this vital fact.

  The public -- let alone Audi -- deserves better than this.

PGN's comment on the light spectrum from fluorescents ignored another
"feature" of fluorescents: stroboscopic distortion.  Take a small, bright
object (like a pencil) and wave it back and forth under sunlight or
incandescent light; you'll see a blur.  Do that under flourescents and
you'll see several copies of the object.  Get the frequency right and you
can even read the lettering on the pencil.

This means that movements (including the ones caused by your constant
eye motion) that would normally be smooth blurs (no feature to attract
your auto-focus mechanism) work in jumps that can cause your eye muscles
to try to track them.

An earlier posting on VDUs suggested keeping them at or above eye level.
There is another good reason (besides neck strain) to do this.  Our
eyes were evolved for light coming from above.  You'll notice your
upper eyelashes are longer and thicker than the lower.  And if you shave
off your eyebrows and spend much time outdoors, you'll suffer eye damage
(bet you thought eyebrows didn't have any function).

I keep my crt on an empty IBM PC box.  This puts the bottom of the screen
about level with my eyes.  And most of the light--both from the screen
phosphors and room light reflected off the screen--comes from above, as
it should.  I seem to be able to work more comfortably this way.

                                  [Me too.  Excellent advice.  Thanks.  PGN]

   Since I started working as a professional computer programmer, my
eyesight has deteriorated from better than 20/20 to 20/60, with the bulk of
that change (20/20 to 20/40 coming in the first 4 months).  I have seen 3
different opthomologists who all agree my eysight degradation is due to
excessive reading, but have been unable to stop the decay with glasses,
excercise or drugs.  I have now been at it 2 summers + 1 year since the
first problems, and have little hope of reversing the damage even if I give
up reading all together.  While this injury is not necessarily related to
CRT's, it is indicative of injuries that are occupational hazards with
little hope of avoidance.  My choice was to either lose (to some extent) my
eyesight or switch to another profession.  Until I am able to support myself
some other way, I pretty much have to sacrifice my eyesight.

		  IFIP CONFERENCE ON COMPUTERS AND LAW
       A Technologist's Guide Through Legal Pitfalls and Pathways
	    October 21-23, 1987 at Santa Monica, California

Sponsors:  IFIP Technical Committee On Computers and Society and
	   Los Angeles County Bar Association Law and Technology Section

WHO'S IN CHARGE:

Technology, law or the professional?

Technical and policy professionals are being forced to confront a maze
of nascent legal realities and threats.  These span private contracts,
tort liability, the public interest, iminal prosecution, and myriad
other issues and relationships, and encompass the regulation and
protection of technology and data as derived from economic and political
rights.  Yet many problems are ill-defined and solutions are not widely
recognized.

CONFERENCE AIMS:

To bring together computer and information professionals who must make
technology-based decisions and lawyers who are faced with representing
their interests in order to identify common problems, to explore the
dimensions of their alternatives, and to understand the consequences of
their responses.

SUGGESTED TOPICS:

Taxation and computing
Protection of intellectual property rights
Information-system imes and defenses
Legislative policy and technical issues
Telecommuting and independent contracting
Export-Import controls
Computer security---fact and fiction
Civil vs. criminal remedies: Victim options
Computer policy in developing nations
Government information policies
Database abuse: Public responsibility and private gain
Recognizing and minimizing exposure for product and service liability
International contracting for hardware, software, and computer services
Malpractice potential: Computer delivery of professional services
Resolving computer-contract disputes: Techniques and standards
Emerging technologies:  Enyption, artificial intelligence, networks, and
	other problem areas
Public (dis-)service: Automating the criminal justice system
Independent verification and validation of computer generated information

    Papers should strive to report important experiences and to identify
    key, open areas.  We encourage tutorials for non-specialists, and
    presentations supported by check-lists and procedural guides.  We
    also solicit panel-discussion proposals.  Provocative comment is
    welcome.

HOW TO SUBMIT:

Original papers of up to 5000 words (20 double-spaced pages) are
invited on the above and related topics.  Papers which highlight actual
user experiences, with specific legal entanglements or solutions, are
preferred over abstract explorations.  Papers will be refereed and
accepted papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings.  Format
instructions for camera-ready copy will be provided when the paper is
accepted.  Please send FOUR copies of the paper, including a 300-500
word abstract, to the CONFERENCE CHAIR, Michael M. Krieger, P.O. Box 24619, 
Los Angeles, CA 90024, 213-394-4356, Internet: complaw@math.ucla.edu

Theatrical riggers are not the only people in the world with computer-
controlled motors. 

Some friends of mine set a good example when they retrofitted computer
controls onto a mechanical stereo-interpreter. This machine is used to make
topographical maps from aerial photographs ("stereo pairs", hence,
"stereo-interpreter").

The machine had a mechanical stage, with arms driven by ultra-precise worm 
gears. The stage had mechanical stops - that is, solid objects which the arms
would have to run into before leaping onto the floor. My friends changed the
drive, of course, and the resulting machine was quite fast. I recall seeing
the arms travel six feet in under a second. (This includes decelerating
to a stop.)

The machine acquired several layers of computer equipment. At the low level,
there was a microprocessor per motor, and detection hardware so that precision
could be obtained by feedback. At the higher level, of course, one made maps.

The design incorporated simple limit switches. These switches tripped
when the arms got out of bounds, and shut off the power to the motors.
The basic idea was to keep the arms from hitting the mechanical stops at
high speed. This would prevent damage to the arms, and also, would prevent
then from bouncing over the stops and onto the floor.

The wise thing that my friends did, was to install the limit switches FIRST.
The computer interface to the limit switches was added LAST.

In the course of the project, it was noticed that there was a single major
failure mode. The arms would go past the limit switches at maximum 
acceleration. This was the result of practically anything - timing glitches,
byte-ordering bugs between machines, reading a device register while it was
rippling, you name it. 

I heard a related story from a friend working on irradiation therapy machines.
He reported that an older machine of theirs was once involved in an tragedy.
Reportedly, a patient had been killed because the hydraulics ran away, and
crushed the patient against the radiation shielding. The operator had hit the
emergency-off switch, AND IT DIDN'T WORK. The switch removed power from most
of the machine - but not from the hydraulics.

And then, there is the story that I heard about a real-time programmer who
was computerizing a fish-filleting factory. As I heard it, a side effect of
debugging was that he got to feed every stray cat in Stockholm ...

                       [This is somewhat marginally relevant, but 
                       it seemed worth including anyway.  PGN]

I happened upon this in the New York Times (3/21/87, p. 12).  '... [I]n
February, The China Daily reported this week, ... a woman trying to
copy an obscene film called "Massage Girl" at a television station
inadvertently broadcast 20 minutes of the movie to homes throughout
Guangdong Province.  The woman was arrested.'

I live in a state where the attorney general's office has spent
$600,000 in public funds to appeal a ruling that the legislature's
cable TV censorship law is unconstitutional, and where a local
newspaper that has recently stopped printing the controversial comic
strip Doonesbury is now debating whether to continue to buy the strip
and not publish it so that the population at large need not suffer from
its presence.  An 'inadvertent broadcast' like the one described above
could have a serious impact on civil liberties here, especially if it
occurred on a cable channel.

This topic was discussed at length in the TELECOM list.  Some items ...

	"I discussed this article with a friend, who [asserted that]
	the information (calling #) is already available, and is
	encoded somehow just prior to the ring spike on the receiving
	line."

There is no truth to this statement.  Under normal circumstances, when
the originating and receiving exchanges (CO's) are different, the
receiving exchange has no way of knowing the origination number.

	"I don't see any obvious risks to the new features."

On of my concerns is that, with these features, I can no longer keep my
unlisted phone number private.  If I call a local department store to
get their price on a pair of shoes, I may start getting unsolicited
shoe sales calls from all over.  Merchants would be motivated to
collect and sell lists of phone numbers of consumers with particular
interests, just as they now collect and sell mailing addresses.  (And I
can't make use of that "call screening" feature; what if my daughter is
in trouble and tries to call home from a phone booth?)

MORE:  Re: Michael Wagner (<A HREF="/Risks/4.67.html">RISKS-4.67</A>)

  "1) the 911 emergency number in Toronto displays the number
  from which a call was made...

An originating exchange sends the information only when it's using the
special 911 subsystem.  (At my exchange this goes out on a special
trunk directly to the 911 center, it doesn't travel between exchanges.)
The implications don't follow.

  "2) The University of Toronto recently switched over to a Centrex III
  system.  Certain (secretarial) phones can now display the number called and
  the number calling.  The number calling works only if the call originated
  within the centrex exchange.  It is not clear whether the restriction is
  technical or legal...

It's technical, that's the Centrex system talking to itself.

At first glance, it seems simple to be told where your caller is calling from.
All that one needs is a small display: after all, exchanges are computerized
now, aren't they ?

Well, yes, new ones are. Also, new exchanges tend to be bigger: several
exchange numbers are implemented by a single office, rather than being
one-for-one. And, of course, if all the action occurs within a single
exchange, then the features that are offered are just a Small Matter Of
Programming.

However, old phone exchanges are still with us. Projected reliability
used to be stated as outage-time per forty years !  Also, old designs
were being built until recently. For example, Bermuda bought a mechanical
stepping exchange (from Philips) in the early 1970's.

When authorities try to trace phone calls, the major stumbling block is
usually that the call has crossed one or more boundaries between exchanges.
Tracing then becomes a serial process, and it used to involve a human
at each physical location. A person wishing to (say) utter death threats
was quite difficult to catch, particularly if rural equipment was in the
chain.

Of course, we will eventually resolve these problems. Mad bombers will
respond by using pay phones, unattended autodialers, and other tactics.

    According to _High Technology_, a caller placing a call from an unlisted
phone can prevent the number from being displayed on the destination phone
by entering a code.  The phone company equipment still gets the number
though, so the person being called can call still call the person with the
unlisted phone number (using a feature which dials the number of the most
recent incoming call), although there is no (legitimate) way to actually
determine the unlisted number.

  &gt; As far as I know it depends on the "office" (telephone company term for 
  &gt; switching equipment) connected to your phone...  An electronic office will
  &gt; close the connection as soon as either party hangs up.

Actually, this is not true.  For most electronic exchanges in the U.S., the
connection is held until about 20 seconds after the called party hangs up, or
whenever the calling party hangs up.  This is supposed to let the answering 
party hang up one phone, move to a different room and continue using another.  
The timeout is reset every time the phone goes off-hook.  This causes the
apparent inability to get rid of the incoming call.  The best solution to
obnoxious electronic calling machines is legal - ban the damn things!

18 Arrested for Altering Their Mobile Phones
By LEONARD BUDER, c.1987 N.Y. Times News Service

    NEW YORK - In a federal attack on a crime made possible by the latest
technology, 18 New Yorkers were arrested Thursday on charges of using
illegally altered memory chips in their mobile telephones so they could
make calls without being charged for them.
    Also arrested were seven others who, the authorities said, illegally
reprogrammed the chips and placed them in the mobile telephones. Such
telephones can be installed in vehicles or carried by individuals.
    It was the first time anyone in the country had been arrested for this
kind of crime involving cellular telephones, said Thomas L. Sheer, the
assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who is in
charge of the New York office.
    He said the problem of fraud in the cellular telephone industry had
grown significantly in the last six months and that Thursday's arrests
were the result of ''the first of a series of initiatives'' being
undertaken by the bureau and the Secret Service to counter fraud in
emerging technologies.
    ''Every new technology carries with it an opportunity to invent a new
crime,'' said Laurence A. Urgenson, the chief assistant U.S. attorney
for the Eastern District of New York.
    The first commercial cellular mobile telephone service began late in
1983. According to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, there were nearly 682,000 customers of such phone services
at the end of last year.
    Sheer said the government was making ''aggressive use'' of a federal
statute dealing with ''Fraud in Connection with Access Devices,'' that
was originally intended to combat credit card fraud but is now being
interpreted to cover frauds involving all computer-based or
computer-assisted systems.  [...]
    The 18 people who had the illegally altered chips installed ''awoke
this morning to find that their cellular telephones had been
disconnected'' electronically, Sheer said at a news conference held at
the bureau office at 26 Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan.
    ''They're going to get one phone call today,'' the FBI official added
- referring to the call a person is permitted to make after being
arrested - ''but it's not going through from a cellular telephone.''
    The officials said the arrests followed a six-month investigation that
involved the use of a confidential informer who installed the chip and
federal agents working under cover. The authorities acknowledged the
cooperation of the Nynex Mobile Communications Co. in the
investigation. Sheer said the investigation was assisted by ''recent
technological advances in computerized telephone-switching equipment
and billing systems.''                                            [NB!!]
    Sheer said that the fraud, which was not the product of an organized
conspiracy, cost local mobile telephone companies about $40,000 a month and
that nationwide, carriers of cellular services were losing about $3 million
a year because of frauds.
    The authorities gave no details about the alteration of the chips. [...]
The most serious charge that could be brought against each carries a maximum
term of 10 years in prison and a possible fine of $250,000.
    Sheer said the installers usually charged $500 to reprogram and
install two memory chips in a cellular phone. The chips, in their
unaltered state, are sold in computer equipment stores at a price of
two for 89 cents, an FBI agent said.
    According to the federal authorities, each cellular mobile telephone
has a memory chip containing a mobile identification number, or M.I.N.,
and another containing an electronic serial number, or E.S.N. When a
mobile telephone call is made, the two numbers are automatically
transmitted to the mobile carrier.
    The mobile carriers make a computer check of the E.S.N. to see if it
is valid. If it is, the call goes through and the cost is billed to the
billing number provided by the M.I.N. chip.
    By using illegally reprogrammed chips, the federal complaint said,
other people were billed for calls made by those participating in the
fraud.  [...]

From a Boston Globe editorial, 27 Mar 1987, on the local subway system:

  Of the MBTA's four lines, only the Orange Line trains now run consistently
  on time.  In fact, the Orange Line has one of the best on-time records in
  the nation -- a record that some of the line's old-timers fear will be lost
  when the antique manual-switching equipment is replaced by computerized
  signals later this spring.

On the same issue's op-ed page, M. R. Montgomery writes about a
geophysicist's proposal for robotic exploration of Mars:
 
  The lowest estimate for getting a robot to Mars and back is $10 billion, and
  if you wonder why it's a nice round number, it's because the real cost is an
  unknown double-digit billion -- and 10 is the lowest one you can float, even
  in front of a Mars-starved country.

  ... A lot of tiresome hogwash being floated about the benefits of
  robotic exploration of Mars, of which the worst is the assertion that the
  way to make advances in human-serving robots is to build one whose main
  function is to go 50 million miles to pick up dirt.
  ... If you wanted to benefit mankind by improving robotic science,
  you should start out with something really complicated, not something
  trivial that is only expensive because it's happening 50 million miles away.
  You could build a seeing-eye dog robot that understood the difference
  between First Street and First Avenue, between the inbound streetcar and the
  outbound cars, and never, ever, had to go to the bathroom.

  But that would mean spending $10 billion on the visually handicapped, which
  is not nearly as much fun as spending it on athletic men and women in silver
  suits, and, all in all, even less enjoyable than spending it on our
  geophysicists.

The addresses are valid.  It just happened that our DECnet node database was

In RISKS 4.63 David Barto writes about experiences with auto-dialers, then
asks:
       &gt;Could this become a major RISK in the future, dialing wrong numbers
       &gt;for hours on end?

Scott Watson, the author of the Red Ryder terminal communications program for
the Mac, describes just what can happen when you turn an autodialer loose on
the world without making sure you're dialing the right number.  (From the Red
Ryder 8.0 manual, by Scott Watson, reprinted without permission.)

     "When I used to operate a BBS in my home, it had the bad habit of
     crashing every day or two....  It was easy to tell when the BBS
     crashed, because some jerk would then decide to start redialing my
     voice line (just to see if there was a BBS connected _there_, I
     suppose).  Of course, he turned off his modem speaker... and there-
     fore couldn't hear me screaming "Hullo?" (or much worse)....  One
     night, I got _very_ angry and answered the phone - twice per minute -
     for over three hours.  I suspect he got the message when his phone
     bill arrived the next month - I hope he was calling from Boise."

If your modem doesn't have a speaker, (or doesn't respond "NO CARRIER")
you can listen in on a cheap phone plugged into the appropriate jack to
make sure you typed your number in right.  Look before you leap.

It actually gets worse.  It turns out that many (most?) banks ignore (or at
least _used_ to ignore; hopefully they've learned, but I wouldn't bet on it)
what's _written_ on the check/deposit stub/whatever if that field is already
encoded in the magnetic character information at the bottom.  For example,
if there's already a "from" account encoded there, the operator isn't ask to
enter one.

Well, there's a slight bug in that system...  What happens if someone goes
into a bank branch, walks out with a stack of the blank "courtesy" deposit
slips, takes them to a "shady" printer who encodes the person's account into
the "to" field at the bottom of the form, and then replaces the forms in the
bins in the bank.  Eventually (within a few days, usually) this will get
noticed, but assuming that all the doctored forms get used within a single
day, and that many (most?) of the deposits falsely credited to the crook's
account clear within a day or two, one could drop of the forms one day, and
withdraw a substantial amount of cash a day or two later...

Now, some banks have dealt with this by not offering the "courtesy" forms
any more.  Others have presumeably (hopefully!) dealt with it in other ways,
with which I'm not familiar.  But I wouldn't be surprised if this scam would
still work with a significant number (5 or 10%?  Even 1% would be useful, if
one knew which 1%...) of banks...

Comments?  Is my information out of date?  I have an aunt who is a teller
for First Interstate Bank (side comment: isn't "FIB" a _wonderful_ acronym
for a bank?  :-), who told me some of this stuff, and I got other parts
of it from several different books on electronic security (unfortunately,
I don't remember the titles or authors of any of them..).

Rocket Shot Down By Faulty ``Star Wars'' Weapon
By Lou Flirpa
Associated Press Writer

	WASHINGTON (AP) _ Reliable Pentagon sources have reported that last
Thursday's explosion of a $78 million Atlas-Centaur rocket carrying the
$83 million military ``FltSatCOM'' communications satellite was in fact caused
by a ``minor malfunction'' in a highly secret experimental Strategic Defense
Initiative beam weapon, commonly known as ``Star Wars''.
	``We're not sure yet what happened'' said one highly placed source,
who spoke on condition that he not be identified. ``But we think the
autonomous boost-phase battle station we launched on Delta last year mistook
the Atlas for a Soviet ICBM and shot it down. Naturally we all feel pretty bad
about this. Gosh, we're real sorry. Really.''
	Speculation had been mounting after the launch failure that the Atlas
had been hit by lightning.  According to sources, however, ``a charged
particle beam weapon is essentially an artificial lightning machine.''
	Since the launch took place in a rainstorm, it was easy to jump to
the conclusion that lightning struck the vehicle, the sources said,
especially since no one actually saw the explosion because of the cloud cover.
	While the exact cause of the ``malfunction'' has not yet been
determined, there is early speculation that the on-board ``clock'' of the battle
station was incorrectly set five hours ahead of ``universal'' time instead
of five hours behind, leading it to ``believe'' it was over the Soviet Union
when it was really over Florida.
	``It looks like some of our scientists got confused over which way the
earth turns. I guess they found out the hard way,'' said another source.
	SDI director Lt. General James A. Abrahamson was reported to have
``mixed feelings'' when told of the accident.

In the epicycles of RISKS, I think we are ebbing.  12 recent messages to
RISKS were slight variants on earlier ones, and I have decided (of course,
very arbitarily) to blow the whistle.  Sorry to those of you who composed
careful messages that are not included in this issue.

I conducted a few informal polls, and feel (at this point in RISKS) that I
have been too permissive lately, and have even lost a few readers who cannot
devote the time to screening (literally).  Thus (for a while, at least), I
will try to include only the more incisive contributions.  (You may notice
that I try to put the more exciting things FIRST -- unless they are very
long, in which case I tend to put them LAST.)  On the other hand, fear not
for withdrawal symptoms -- some new disaster always tends to happen, and we
are off again in another direction...

By the way, there was this response to my earlier note on this metasubject: 
  
  From: AGRE%OZ.AI.MIT.EDU@XX.LCS.MIT.EDU
 
  I'd like it to enter the culture that whenever someone runs into an
  incredibly obscure bug, they feel a sense of responsibility to share it with
  the community, to save others the same hassle and danger.  RISKS could
  become the customary channel for this.

Following are a few messages that I let slip by.

Recently, a stagehand was severely injured in a Melbourne theatre.  He was
on a stage-ladder.  These are large, free-standing ladders that are wheeled
from place to place on the stage to facilitate access to the grid area above
the stage.  The ladders are massive, very stable and hydraulically operated.
The accident occurred when someone activated the computerised stage moving
system.  This system allows sections of the stage to be raised, lowered and
moved about.  The ladder was at the front of the stage, the parts of the
stage that were intended to be moved were at the rear.  A mistake was made and
one of the sections that the ladder was standing on was moved.  The ladder
toppled and the stagehand suffered a fractured skull and a broken pelvis.
It was fortunate that no one else was hurt.  Standing orders are not to move
the stage when there are people on it, but this is commonly ignored.

    The most likely cause of a problem is OZONE..

Induction motors don't generate ozone, and those are the type used in
computer fans and [probably] disks.  A more likely source of ozone is the
CRT high voltage.

There may be other sources of fumes in a PC, such as undried solvent
-- does anyone know anything about this?

All right, already.  My pilot ("Overconfidence in Airplane Computers")
was more right than I:  the thrust of the plane IS measured in the same
kind of units as its weight, and to say that one is half of the other is
a meaningful statement (the plane takes off with half the acceleration
it would have if it were dropped off a cliff).  My only defense is that
as a defrocked physicist I'm so used to people getting mass and weight
confused that I automatically assumed it had happened one more time.
The letters can stop.

   [Included for the reference.  Perhaps it will stave off further repetition.]

Brent Chapman makes reference to magnetically encoded deposit slips, and
the interesting differences between human and machine interpretation
of the same piece of paper.

In one story, a customer surreptitiously laid out courtesy slips
on the bank counters which had been magnetically encoded with his account
number. It ended in the customer's withdrawal of $100K of others' money and
his subsequent disappearance. Such actions have, apparently, taken place
in several banks.

In another case, a cheque had been magnetically encoded with a valid bank
branch code (and a bogus account number) that was different from the name of
the bank on the cheque paper. The perpetrator had originally deposited a
large sum of money in the bank indicated on the cheque paper.  Then he
opened bank accounts in a number of other banks using these cheques. Owing
to machine-sorting each cheque bounced back and forth between two banks,
with an associated transit time of two days per rebound. The machine at one
end could not validate the account and hence dumped it into a pool for
manual sorting, where the human response was to assume a simple routing
error (because the bank name on the cheque was certainly not theirs), at
which point it was sent to the named bank. At the named bank the cheque was
machine-sorted for final clearance, and since it was coded for another bank
(the first one), it was automatically directed (back) there. The hoax was
only discovered because the well-travelled cheque became too frayed by
machine handling to be further automatically processed. Having had a number
of such cheques accepted for deposit, the depositor had made withdrawals and
had disappeared with $1M by the time of discovery.

These stories, and a number of others are recounted in a ``delightful'' little
book called Computer Capers (Mentor, 1978 - no ISBN) by Thomas Whiteside.
Most of the material appeared originally in The New Yorker. Whiteside has
a good bibliography for titles published between 1966 - 1977, but
the book is clearly now a bit dated. White-collar crimes have undoubtedly
advanced beyond the ``stone tools and knives'' stage of ten years ago, but
you can be sure that we won't hear about them from the banks, etc.

Before assuming nonsense, one might try reading the article under the
headline.  It explores a series of design approaches with the common theme
that safety mechanisms should be driven by simple, passive, inexorable laws
of physics rather than being complex gadgetry in themselves.  (For example,
place the entire reactor system under water so that faults that would
usually produce loss-of-coolant failures tend to instead produce
too-much-coolant failures.)

Whether or not the specific technical ideas are competent I can't judge, but
the notion of designing safety measures that are simple and inevitable seems
something that people concerned with computer RISKS should want to ponder
rather than laugh at.

Yes, indeed, I certainly agree that one should understand something well
enough before making light of it.  In fact, the IEEE Spectrum article is
quite significant.  Use of inexorable laws of physics is a marvelous idea --
if those laws are in fact complete, correctly understood, immutable, and
nonbypassable...  The principle is excellent in the small.  The practice may
not be so easy to guarantee in the large.  [See also Henry Spencer's message
below.]

I would like to add something that addresses not the inexorability, but
rather the limitations of the environment in the case of large-scale nuclear
power (to which this technique has not yet been applied):

   1. People are not infallible, and are certainly not "inherently safe".
      Incompent or careless people might make an "inherently safe"
      nuclear reactor ACTUALLY UNSAFE.  PBS' All Things Considered on 3 Apr
      87 concluded that BAD MANAGEMENT was probably the biggest source of
      problems.  Bad management is quite capable of rendering a system
      inherently unsafe, e.g., as a result of unwise cost-saving measures.
      (Philadelphia's Peach Bottom plant was just closed by the NRC; a
      surprise visit found the operators sleeping on the night shift.
      The PBS program also noted a safety system installed backwards.)

   2. The inexorable laws (in the small) may be circumvented under actual
      environmental conditions, i.e., to the system in-the-large -- via
      accidents, sabotage, earthquakes, carelessness, and improper maintenance,
      as well as bad management and other human behavior noted above.

[  3. Despite claims to the contrary, nuclear waste disposal appears to be
      at least LONG-TERM RISKY, and may prove to be INHERENTLY UNSAFE.  There 
      appear to be no really appealing solutions in the long run, but that
      argument is beyond the scope of RISKS.  I toss it in simply to
      illustrate the holistic nature of the problem and the nonholistic
      nature of the assumptions of infallibility.  ]

It does seem that assumptions are being made about the INFALLIBILITY of the
technology.  I quote from the Spectrum article:

  "If a major system fails, for example, the core is flooded automatically
  with coolant that flows under immutable laws of gravity and thermohydraulics,
  not under propulsion by mechanical pumps and electromagnetic actuators."

If applied to nuclear power, does this ignore all sorts of fallibilities?
Are there not still combinations of mechanisms and components that might
fail, e.g., if the coolant suddenly springs a major leak, or if during
maintenance reliance on the "INHERENTLY SAFE" physical principles must
temporarily be circumvented, or if people do not always behave reasonably,
as assumed?  The notion that it is possible to design something that is
"100% reliable" UNDER ALL POSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES is clearly unrealistic.
But, even "99.9999% reliable" is not very good if the .0001% case can be
provoked accidentally or intentionally by a specific combination of
plausible circumstances (whether anticipated or unanticipated).  Of course,
A VERY REAL RISK LIES IN BELIEVING IN THE INFALLIBILITY OF TECHNOLOGY.

Nevertheless, the cited April 87 IEEE Spectrum article is worth reading, and
Jerry's points are very well taken.  For those technologies in which risks
can be substantially reduced by using homeostatic processes, that should be
encouraged.  (Although nuclear power has not yet been so based, the article
makes an important point that it should be!) A good example of homeostasis
is the human body, which is basically self-regulating -- except that when it
breaks down, all bets are off.

(To the reader:  I know that Jerry doesn't believe in the infallibility of
technology.  I am not trying to shoot a straw herring in the foot.  This
message is by way of further discussion.)

Not so, actually.  The things actually exist, and the term accurately
describes them.  You could take a sledgehammer to the controls and nothing
much would happen.  U of T has one.  Apparently if you're the last one to
use it Friday afternoon, you just lock the door behind you and leave it
unattended for the weekend.  Unlike power reactors, the design is inherently
stable:  an increase in temperature causes a decrease in reaction rate, so
nothing you can do will make it overheat.  Unfortunately, the design does
not scale up well and hence isn't useful for power plants.

I'd like to pass along one which happened to me and indicates the risk of
interactions between computers and mechanical components in automated
systems.  A few months ago I used an ATM to pay a bill.  At the end of the
transaction, the machine said to:
              "REMOVE CARD TO QUIT OR PRESS OK TO CONTINUE".
I was done, so I pulled out my card and started to leave.  I took a few
moments getting my credit card back in my wallet, then had one of those
"What wasn't that??" feelings.  The door on the ATM hadn't gone down.  The
mechanical switch which shows whether my card is or is not in the machine
had stuck and the ATM was patiently waiting for my next transaction.  I
aborted it by pressing a "CANCEL" button.  Had I not done that, anyone
passing by (this machine was outdoors) could have pressed a few buttons and
paid their own bills from my account or pulled out my daily cash limit.
Lesson: verify that the machine is doing its thing.
                                                  	Don

    [Despite a RISKS moratorium on routine ATM stories, this one is worth
    including as an example of an uncompleted supposedly atomic transaction
    with nasty side-effects.  Another example of inconsistency between the
    state of the software and the state of the hardware was the THERAC 25
    therapeutic radiation device: you recall that the software thought it
    had switched the device to X-ray mode (1,000 rads), but the device was
    still in electron-beam mode (up to 25,000 rads) at the moment.

Just as radon gas comes from cement walls and formaldehyde comes out of new
housing walls, carpets, and some modular furniture, there are gases that
are emitted from electronic appliances.  I do not know what they are, but
suspect they come from the plastic cases, and probably the circuit boards
and capacitors.

I know someone who is highly allergic to chemicals, and can smell these
gases.  They are more prone to be emitted when the computer is on, since
it is warmer.

Recently there has been considerable publicity given to a fire that took
place in a computer room at the Open University HQ. The fire destroyed a VAX
and all its back-up tapes that were stored in the machine room. The
interesting thing about this event was the various reports of the problems
caused by the loss of the filestore back-up.  Initial (non-trade) press
reports talked about people losing 15-20 years of research, this was then
whittled down to two to three years (in the trade papers) and eventually
seems to have come down to a couple of months as most people had personal
back-ups of critical data!!

Some strange recent events in England seem computer- and defense-system
related, although in a diffuse and rather mysterious way.  At this point any
commonality among 6 different cases must be considered speculative.  However,
the "pure coincidence" explanation is not too satisfying, and certainly
whets the appetites of conspiracy or collaboration theorists.  The following
is reported here for the RISKS record, awaiting any further clarification.

  August 1986: Vimal Dajibhai, 24, programmer with Marconi Underwater Systems,
  reportedly working on Britain's self-guided torpedo Stingray missile.
  Found dead beneath a suspension bridge.  (No cause identified.)

  October 1986: Ashad Sharif, 26, computer expert with Marconi Defense
  Systems, bizarre death, seemingly suicide.

  January 1987: Richard Pugh, computer design expert, found dead in his home.

  January 1987: Avtar Singh-Gida, 26, disappeared in northern England while
  conducting experiments on submarine warfare equipment.

  22 February 1987: Peter Peapell, 46, metallurgist involved in secret defense
  work, died of carbon monoxide poisoning.  (Wife doubted it was suicide.) 

  30 March 1987: David Sands, 37, computer expert working for a Marconi
  subsidiary on an air force defense system, killed when car crashed into cafe.

The British government claims there is no evidence linking the cases.
However, Home Secretary Douglas Hurd has ordered police involved in these
cases to contact each other.  [Source: SF Chronicle, 6 April 1987]

From Business Week, April 13, 1987:

The sale of Consolidated Rail Corp. almost blew some fuses at the
Treasury Dept.  Because Treasury's computers can only handle single
transactions of up to $1 billion, underwriters had to break the $1.6
billion from the public offering into two parts before electronically
transferring the funds to the government.  The underwriters, led by
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., got a nice chunk of change sent their way too --
$70 million in fees.

[I'm surprised that someone was smart enough to know about the $1
billion problem before it really did "blow a fuse".  Who knows where
the $600,000 million might have ended up!]

If I understand correctly, such principles are used outside of the lab.
According to two books I have read (_The Hunt for Red October_, and
_Submarines_), all American subs and many Russian subs operate the same way.
When you draw more power out, the coolant loses heat and moderates neutrons
more effectively, increasing the chances of causing fission, increasing the
heat output. When your power requirements decrease, the coolant heats up,
does not moderate the neutrons as well and the rate of fission goes down.

An ingenious mechanism but not failsafe as the US Navy has implemented
it. One worse case scenario, for example, is a loss of coolant. If
necessary, the reactor can be opened to the sea, an infinite heat
sink.  But by the principles described above, the reaction goes to
full power and may progress beyond the point that the flow of sea
water can handle. There is a good description of this in THFRO. 

Nevertheless, it would seem such principles, when practical, are preferable
to the inherently unstable airframes typified by the F-16 and X-29 fighter
planes. As long as people don't put all their faith in them.

There is a risk to using flight control computers in military aircraft that
I believe hasn't been noted on this list so far. The most relevant instances
are in the F-16, F-18 and F-20 aircraft. Two F-20 aircraft have been lost
while in airshow routines or practices.  The computers are designed to limit
control actuations so that the aircraft do not enter accelerated stalls at
high G-forces.  The control actuations are limited also to approximately 9g
positive, since this is currently the limits that a pilot can withstand
using current equipment, without losing consciousness. The rate of onset of
g forces also contributes to the possibility of losing consciousness.  An
F-20 is capable of attaining at least a 6.2g per second onset rate.

The risk is that a pilot may plan on losing some brain function to
g-forces, without risking that the plane will go out of control in the
maneuver. This possibility is entirely due to the presence of the
flight control computer. It leads pilots to enter maneuvers in which
they do in fact lose consciousness, inadvertently.  The F-20 has
crashed twice in airshow routines, after the same potential 9g pull-up
maneuver, and in the second instance, at Goose Bay, Labrador, the
Canadian equivalent of the NTSB found that the pilot's loss of
conciousness was directly responsible for the crash.

Were the flight control computer not to assure maneuvering within the
envelope in the event of an extreme g maneuver, no pilot would risk
loss of control through impaired function, unless in combat.
One, possibly two F-20s and their pilots have been lost through 
risk-taking while relying on a computer. I understand that pilots
have been lost in the F-16 and F-18 in similar situations.

According to the advertisments, the version of the HP-41 that is used on the
Space Shuttle has a different plastic in the case, which will not outgas
under vacuum conditions. Is this a similar problem?

I just had a small round patch of skin cancer removed from my face, under my
right eye. I am under 30 years old, and the surgeon said it was highly
unusual for someone my age to have such a problem. He said my skin must be
highly sensitive, and I would have to be real careful about exposure to the
sun in the future, using a blocking sunscreen preparation.

But I am not a heavy tanner or beach-goer. I don't even spend all that much
time outdoors. Then the surgeon said, "Oh, you work around computers all day
long, don't you?"..........and I am now faced with the frightening
possibility that my ten years of hacking in close proximity to CRT's is what
gave me skin cancer.

I have seen references to studies about the potential danger from CRT
radiation but I never paid any attention before. Now I'm inclined to look
into the subject - I don't want another skin cancer! The surgeon asked
whether it was possible to get a screen with lead shielding on it.

The cancerous growth has been on my face for at least a year, possibly
longer. I used VT52's starting in 1977 or 78, Foxes, H19's &amp; VT100's, then
primarily a monochrome IBM PC starting in 1981 or 82 for three years. In 1984
I got a Sun 2 workstation, in 1985 I got a pre-release IBM RT. Would the
workstations emit more radiation, from their larger screens, than the PC or
terminals? Are some brands better shielded than others? Would some different
placement angle help lower the dosage hitting my face?

I thought the following article would be of interest to RISKS readers.  
The risks of people disposing of equipment who are unfamiliar with the
technology used there in can lead to all sorts of interesting problems.  GWD

From COMPUTER CURRENTS, Vol 4 #22, 7 April 1987, p68  from the NEWSBYTES
UK section by Steve Gold,

            BARGAIN COMPUTER HOLDS STATE SECRETS

OXFORD, UK - Irangate had nothing on this one.  The "London Times"
revealed last month that an Oxford student got more than he bargained
for when he bought a second-hand computer for 45 pounds ($68) at WS
Surplus Supplies in his home town.
     Upon booting the used 64K CP/M computer, Mark Storer found an
array of expensive programs available, as well as more than 1,500
files still intact on the machine's 40Mbyte hard disk.  When he peeked
at the files, Storer realized the computer's origin - The Royal
Signals and Radar Establishment in Malvern, Worcestershire.  
     Aside from being a Ministry of Defense establishment, the Malvern
site carries out some very hush-hush research into the kind of things
we can't print.  Suffice it to say that the files included lists of
base personnel, their job descriptions and personal history, and a
full inventory, with costs, of the base since 1980! 
     "They effectively let me walk inside the base and look through
their files," said Storer, talking to the press of his find.
"NewsBytes UK" understands that the machine has now been returned to
the Defense Ministry and that a full investigation is under way.

From the Friday, 27 March 1987 edition of *The Providence Journal*:

        Union official sues Journal for probe into background

PROVIDENCE - The interim administrator of the Providence Newspaper Guild is
suing the Providence Journal Co. and Equifax Inc.  for $1,050,000, alleging
that they illegally used computerized personal information about her as part
of an investigation into her background.

In a suit filed Monday [ 23 March ] in U.S.  District Court, Susan Zucker,
the interim administrator, said that the newspaper employed Equifax to
conduct an investigation aimed at providing information on her "character,
general reputation, personal characteristics, financial characteristics,
mode of living, strengths and weaknesses, estimated net worth, financial
difficulties, home surroundings and credit record."

Zucker asserts that Equifax submitted a report containing such information
to the Journal company.

She said both companies violated federal law governing how such information
may be used, because she was never an employee of the Journal Company nor a
candidate for employment, and because she never gave the newspaper nor
Equifax permission to review her background.

        [ Neither of the companies would comment. ] ....

I found this notable not only because of the alleged misuse of computerized
records, but 1) because of how much information about details of the case
was not reported, and 2) that the charged newspaper printed the article at all.

A recent report claims that the system installed at West Drayton (which
controls Heathrow) fails several times a month. The hardware was installed
in 1971 and the only other working version of it (in the UK) is in the
Science Museum!! The report says that if the computer were a plane it would
have been grounded years ago and that the CAA are not even handed about this
situation. (They do admit that the near misses that occur are mostly due to
operator error). A spokesman from the CAA has refuted these claims stating
that there have been only two failures in 3 months due to software and one
failure due to a faulty power supply. He also claimed that the hardware was
not obsolete but that it was due for replacement in two years time.

The report was produced from confidential interviews with air traffic
controllers by the Institute of Medicine and Avionics (??????)

Sorry if this is a bit vague - it's second-hand information.   Lindsay

I noted two items recently of interest here.

1. Operational errors by U.S. air traffic controllers increased by 18
percent in the three month period that ended March 26, as compared with the
same period a year earlier...  Many of the errors appear to be caused by
poor cmmunication, lack of coordination and ineffective use of equipment.
[From an internal FAA message from Keith Potts, associate administrator
for air traffic control, SF Chron, 9 April 1987]

2.  Air near-misses were up 29% in 1985 (758) over 1984 and up 42% in 1986
(839) over 1984.  [PBS, 9 April 1987]   Another source cited 866 near air
collisions in 1986, with 497 near-misses on the ground.  It also noted that
the shortage of controllers had resulted in their being paid overtime three
times as much as previously...  [SF Chronicle, 10 April 1987]

In RISKS 4.72 Phil Ngai &lt;{ucbvax,decwrl,hplabs,allegra}!ampcad!phil} writes
about reactivity control in American nuclear submarine reactors.  In
addition to those, all NRC-licensed reactors have the negative temperature
coefficient of reactivity he describes.  Also, when pressure is lost the
boiling in the core greatly reduces reactivity.  It also ensures heat
removal with the coolant pumps out of action, provided the vessel and
pipes are full of water.  Kraftwerk Union even has a natural convection
reactor without any pumps.  These are good examples of inherently safe
systems, provided water flood can be assured, as in a bathtub design.

Flooding a naval reactor with seawater would shut it down since the
chlorine in the water absorbs neutrons.  I believe that river water would
not give a sure shutdown unless the pollution level was quite high.  In
commercial reactors there are large reserves of water loaded with borate,
a strong neutron absorber, to be actively injected into the core.  Active
injection is not inherently safe.  A bathtub would be better.

From RISKS 4.72:  (_The Hunt for Red October_, and _Submarines_) ...

The author of "..Red October" has never been underway on a US submarine.  He
has talked to a lot of people, and taken a civilian tour certainly.  He
makes a great yarn, and invents some plausable explanations, but (unless
someone PUT IN those gross errors I noted) he guessed it all.  The reactor
coolant is regulated to within a few degrees, and in operation is held much
more closely than that, with some variation, soon corrected, upon a change
in bell (speed order).  It may be that the author knew this, since it is
obvious that thermal stress is undesirable, but needed a way to have a core
meltdown for plot reasons. (there is also NO installed way to flood the RC,
submarines BARELY float as it is) Since this is not in line with comp.
risks, the subject should be dropped from this forum.  I would like to offer
my services as a source of correct information in the future.  I won't give
away secrets, but it will be the truth.  If you, or anyone else has
questions on the errors in that book, or US attack submarines in general,
feel free to write to me.  This is not the first time I have gagged on a
statement on submarine operations or equipment as posted in this group.

I don't see this as a risk that can be eliminated without a whole lot of
sensing and evaluation of the pilot's real-time condition.

The G-limits programmed in operate on the assumption that the pilot is
actively helping keep himself concious... there are physical acts a pilot
can take under that will help keep him concious while undergoing Gs.  In 
the Candian F-20 crash, the report mentioned that the pilot had flown the
sequence several times that day, and that he was probably somewhat
fatigued.  It speculated the pilot may have not been as enthusiastic with
his anti-G straining, and the G-induced loss of conciousness resulted.

Obviously, the flight computer needs to sense the pilot's physical state,
and back off the Gs if the pilot shows signs of going under.  Fighter
pilots are not going to like this, of course, since it takes an element of
control out of their hands.  The problem of how to hook up the appropiate
sensors to the pilot, while allowing him full freedom of movement and
quick, *gentle* disconncection during ejection, is left as a problem for
the reader...

&gt;The risk is that a pilot may plan on losing some brain function to

I think the causality is blurred in this example.  I think this is more a case
of risk-taking overriding risks (trying).  High performance aircraft like the
F-16 are actually capable of even greater G turns.  We have an aircraft name
the HiMAT which I think will take a 20G, but it is a remotely piloted vehicle. 
When you use words like "due to" and "leads," these are implications against
the computer when in fact pilots are pushing their bodies' envelopes and not
the plane's envelope.  [The computer "made me do it"?]

&gt;Were the flight control computer not to assure maneuvering within the
&gt;envelope in the event of an extreme g maneuver, no pilot would risk
&gt;loss of control through impaired function, unless in combat.

See Top Gun.  Try also "simulated combat."  I don't vouch for the realism
of the movie only the personalities of this type of flyer (push the limits).
Remember, the computer is NOT programmed to take the controls
from the pilot in event of backout, and it's not clear to me that it
should [Pilot's associate for pilots out there?].

I decided to comment about this note because it was from Peter (a known
risk-taker) when some friends and I met him (we went to do the same rock
[climb] down in Pinnacles Natl. Mon. [separate parties]).  I think
the situation is somewhat like putting a computer on own's back which
prevents one from climbing above some rating (while trying to push one's
skill ever higher).

Cable TV risks attributed to software, and subsequent risks of bodily harm --
From the San Diego Evening Tribune (TV/Radio critic's column), April 9, 1987:

  Pay per view.  It's as important to some people as their telephones, and
  when it doesn't work as well, they get very unhappy.

  Like Monday night when the Sugar Ray Leonard - Marvin Hagler
  middleweight title fight live from Las Vegas went down for the count in
  thousands of San Diego households.  In what Cox Cable general manager
  Robert McRann calls "a software problem...a programming mixup," 4,510
  customers missed part or all of the fight after they paid $30 to $40 for
  pay-per-view coverage.

  People got so upset that Cox had to call the cops when some 300
  frustrated people began milling around the lobby at Cox's Euclid Avenue
  headquarters.

Apparently all ended relatively well.  No violence was reported, and Cox
customers got refunds and/or vouchers for future cable pay-per-view
events.  Cox spokespeople asserted that this was their first serious
problem in over two years of pay-per-view baseball games, movies, and 
other special events such as the recent Wrestlemania, for which over
10,000 people (!) signed up.

     [The following message was submitted to RISKS by 6 different people.
     I initially thought it might already have been widely circulated, but 
     its repeated receipt has led me to include it here anyway.  PGN]

By now, many of you have heard of (or seen) the broadcast message I sent to
the net two days ago. I have since received 743 messages and have replied to
every one (either with a form letter, or more personally when questions were
asked). The intention behind this effort was to show that I wasn't
interested in doing what I did maliciously or in hiding out afterwards and
avoiding the repercussions. One of the people who received my message was
Dennis Perry, the Inspector General of the ARPAnet (in the Pentagon), and he
wasn't exactly pleased.  (I hear his Interleaf windows got scribbled on)

So now everyone is asking: "Who is this Jordan Hubbard, and why is he on my
screen??"

I will attempt to explain.

I head a small group here at Berkeley called the "Distributed Unix Group".
What that essentially means is that I come up with Unix distribution software
for workstations on campus. Part of this job entails seeing where some of
the novice administrators we're creating will hang themselves, and hopefully
prevent them from doing so. Yesterday, I finally got around to looking
at the "broadcast" group in /etc/netgroup which was set to "(,,)". It
was obvious that this was set up for rwall to use, so I read the documentation
on "netgroup" and "rwall". A section of the netgroup man[ual] page said:

  ...

     Any of three fields can be empty, in which case it signifies
     a wild card.  Thus

                universal (,,)

     defines a group to which everyone belongs.  Field names that ...
  ...


Now "everyone" here is pretty ambiguous. Reading a bit further down, one
sees discussion on yellow-pages domains and might be led to believe that
"everyone" was everyone in your domain. I know that rwall uses point-to-point
RPC connections, so I didn't feel that this was what they meant, just that
it seemed to be the implication.

Reading the rwall man page turned up nothing about "broadcasts". It doesn't
even specify the communications method used. One might infer that rwall
did indeed use actual broadcast packets.

Failing to find anything that might suggest that rwall would do anything
nasty beyond the bounds of the current domain (or at least up to the IMP),
I tried it. I knew that rwall takes awhile to do its stuff, so I left
it running and went back to my office. I assumed that anyone who got my
message would let me know.. Boy, was I right about that!
After the first few mail messages arrived from Purdue and Utexas, I begin
to understand what was really going on and killed the rwall. I mean, how
often do you expect to run something on your machine and have people
from Wisconsin start getting the results of it on their screens?

All of this has raised some interesting points and problems.

1. Rwall will walk through your entire hosts file and blare at anyone
   and everyone if you use the (,,) wildcard group. Whether this is a bug
   or a feature, I don't know.

2. Since rwall is an RPC service, and RPC doesn't seem to give a damn
   who you are as long as you're root (which is trivial to be, on a work-
   station), I have to wonder what other RPC services are open holes. We've
   managed to do some interesting, unauthorized, things with the YP service
   here at Berkeley, I wonder what the implications of this are.

3. Having a group called "broadcast" in your netgroup file (which is how
   it comes from sun) is just begging for some novice admin (or operator
   with root) to use it in the mistaken belief that he/she is getting to
   all the users. I am really surprised (as are many others) that this has
   taken this long to happen.

4. Killing rwall is not going to solve the problem. Any fool can write
   rwall, and just about any fool can get root priviledge on a Sun workstation.
   It seems that the place to fix the problem is on the receiving ends. The
   only other alternative would be to tighten up all the IMP gateways to
   forward packets only from "trusted" hosts. I don't like that at all,
   from a standpoint of reduced convenience and productivity. Also, since
   many places are adding hosts at a phenominal rate (ourselves especially),
   it would be hard to keep such a database up to date. Many perfectly well-
   behaved people would suffer for the potential sins of a few.

I certainly don't intend to do this again, but I'm very curious as to
what will happen as a result. A lot of people got wall'd, and I would think
that they would be annoyed that their machine would let someone from the
opposite side of the continent do such a thing!

&gt; The risk is that a pilot may plan on losing some brain function to
&gt; g-forces, without risking that the plane will go out of control in the
&gt; maneuver. This possibility is entirely due to the presence of the
&gt; flight control computer...

Not very plausible at the current state of the art.  The flight control
computers are *not* capable of preventing the aircraft from going out of
control; they merely prevent one or two specific types of failure (e.g.
breaking the aircraft) that are so clearly undesirable that they can be
unquestionably ruled out.

In fact, because the problem has gotten a lot more visible of late, serious
consideration is now being given to *awarding* the flight-control computers
such powers, to save the aircraft and the pilot!  The tentative intent is
to sense unconsciousness in some manner, signal the pilot that the computer
thinks he is unconscious, and if this brings no response, to take over and
restore (at least) level flight.  Nobody, repeat nobody, is suggesting that
the computer try to continue the maneuver the pilot was attempting.

&gt; ...The F-20 has crashed twice in airshow routines, after the same potential
&gt; 9g pull-up maneuver...

Several other crashes, such as that of the British Aerospace attack-configured
Hawk prototype, have been tentatively attributed to G-LOC (G-induced Loss Of
Consciousness).  And there is considerable suspicion that it may account for
other unexplained crashes of very-high-performance fighters in recent years.

What is new about the recent fighters is that they can get into high-G
situations much more suddenly than older planes could.  In older fighters,
loss of blood flow to the brain was gradual, and symptoms like tunnel vision
could be relied on as warnings.  The new fighters can pile on the Gs so
quickly that blood flow cuts off almost instantaneously, leaving the brain
running on stored oxygen for a moment and then suddenly losing consciousness
when that runs out.

&gt; Were the flight control computer not to assure maneuvering within the
&gt; envelope in the event of an extreme g maneuver, no pilot would risk
&gt; loss of control through impaired function, unless in combat.

"Within the envelope" does not equal "under control", as the F-20 pilots
assuredly knew.  I find it extremely implausible that they deliberately
risked loss of control by relying on the computers; the computers (well,
actually, the programs) aren't that good and the consequences of going
out of control can be too final.

The "Subject:" field is the title of a paper, by R.L. Enfield, in Technology
Review 90,3 (April 1987), pp.36-43.  The paper is worthwhile as a readable
account, for a general audience. (The author is stated to have a led a study

&gt; The sale of Consolidated Rail Corp. almost blew some fuses at the
&gt; Treasury Dept.  Because Treasury's computers can only handle single
&gt; transactions of up to $1 billion...

This is reminiscent of the famous, possibly apocryphal, disaster that hit
the airline reservation systems when the first 747s entered service.  It
was the first airliner that could carry more than 255 passengers...

To keep some perspective on this, note that there is no unusual incidence
of skin cancer among TV program directors, who also spend their lives staring
at monitors at close range -- often older, less-well-shielded monitors.

&gt; The surgeon asked whether it was possible to get a screen with lead shielding

Add-on shields exist, I believe.  It is not clear that they are worthwhile.
Modern monitors have to meet quite severe X-ray emission limits.  Consider
having the X-ray output of your display measured first.  Somebody at CMU
ought to be equipped to do this.

&gt; Would the workstations emit more radiation, from their larger screens, 
&gt; than the PC or terminals?

There isn't *necessarily* any correlation with screen size.  X-ray energy is
related to beam accelerating voltage; intensity is proportional to beam
current.  A bigger screen will need higher current to get the same
brightness over a larger area, but will also spread the emissions out more.
At first glance I suspect that size won't make much difference overall.
Voltage is chosen by several criteria, but I don't think size has a lot to
do with it.  I am not an expert on CRT design, mind you.

&gt; Are some brands better shielded than others?

Different brands using the same monitor will be similar, and it's not always
easy to find out who Sun (for example) buys monitors from.  I would expect
to see little variation in any case.

&gt; Would some different placement angle help lower the dosage hitting my face? 

Probably not.  Distance will make a difference, as will shielding (even a
sheet of glass -- soft X-rays are not very penetrating).

Don't overlook other possible causes:  chemical emissions, acceleration of
dust particles by static electricity, or sheer chance.  Granted that the
doctor said it was unusual; many unusual things happen every day.

&gt; ... eventually [the loss of work] seems to have come down to a couple of 
&gt; months as most people had personal back-ups of critical data!!

It should be noted that this isn't invariably true.  When U of T had a major
fire ten years ago, far too many things -- including some valuable software
products -- existed only in one building, the one that had the fire.  We
were lucky:  most of the computer facilities received only minor water and
smoke damage.  (In fact, the Unix system stayed up through it all, going
down only when the power to the whole building was cut, after the fire was
largely under control!)

An awful lot of people suddenly became much more conscientious about offsite
backups (and fire safety in general) after that.  I do wonder how long the
effect lasted, though.  The building has been rebuilt, and now has many
more computers in it.  How many of them have complete offsite backups?

From: Ken Ross &lt;munnari!mulga.oz!kar@seismo.CSS.GOV&gt;

A little while ago, I went to the bank to withdraw $1200 to buy a saxophone.
I filled in a withdrawal form and presented it to the teller. He punched the
data into his terminal, debiting my account $1200.  He then asked what
denomination notes I would like. "Unfortunately," he said, "we're out of 50's
and 100's." (Here in Australia, we have notes with the following denominations:
$100, 50, 20, 10, 5 and 2. Smaller denominations are in coins.)

I did not want to carry sixty $20 notes around with me, and I didn't want a
bank cheque either. I asked him to "undo" the transaction, and said I'd come
back later. The teller assured me that the only way that it could be done
would be to redeposit the $1200 into the same account. So, that is what
happened.

In the state of Victoria (where the story takes place) there is a
state tax of 3 cents in every hundred dollars on deposits. Thus the net
effect of the whole affair was that I paid 36 cents tax. 

I didn't bother pursuing the matter; a postage stamp costs 36 cents.
However, there is a potential risk here in the definition of when a
transaction has occurred. I am not a lawyer, but I suspect that legally a
transaction is not complete until both parties involved are "satisfied".
Hence the withdrawal of the money was not complete at the stage when the
teller informed me of the unavailability of high-denomination notes. As I
could reasonably expect to get high-denomination notes, I should have been
able to abort the transaction at this stage.

But, because it had been entered on the computer, the transaction had been
completed as far as the bank was concerned.

If the computer software had been better designed then there should have
been a mechanism to abort the transaction right up until the customer
leaves. I do not think that a feature like this would cause any further
problems, although I am not familiar with bank procedure.

   [Even though the case is small peanuts (or eucalyptus pods?), it
   illustrates a general problem: the need for a complete transaction UNDO
   that leaves NO adverse side-effects.  It is not really so much a case of
   an improper atomic action.  On the other hand, the bank might take the
   attitude that TWO transactions were required, and therefore it needed to
   charge for BOTH!  PGN]

The essence of the latest Computer News story is that a mysterious Ministry
of Defence department has begun an investigation into the affair.  ``The MoD
is adamant that the investigation involves its own "Serious Crimes Squad".
It also suggests the enquiries involve alleged fraud on defence contracts.
Yet MPs, and even MoD press officers were at first unaware of the existence
of the squad.  A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: there is nothing
sinister. The Serious Crimes Squad of the Ministry of Defence was first
mentioned in the Police Almanac 10 years ago.  But library files do not show
that the squad has been involved in any previous allegations of fraud in
defence contracts.''  (The story goes on to mention that the investigation
is based at Portsmouth, where Sharif, who was found hanged, is known to have
worked for Marconi Underwater Systems.)

Henry Spencer notes that the flight control on an F16 (etc) does not
prevent the pilot from losing control of the aircraft.  He is correct
to the letter. To my knowledge, there is no aircraft yet built which
is guaranteed to be stall-free, spin-free and tumble-free.

Let me be more precise, and unfortunately more lengthy. I was trying
to convey the idea that because of fly-by-wire design decisions, there
are different risks to flying a new-generation fighter.

An aircraft may enter an accelerated stall at high speed in a sharp turn. An
F16 airframe is certainly capable of this, but is control limited since the
pilot probably isn't. The pilot believes he or she may thus roll and haul
back, strain and black-out, and not have to cope with an accelerated stall
while having no vision.  With real control actuators in the F16, a pilot
would have to be much more sensitive on the stick, and probably couldn't
plan to tolerate routine black-outs. The risks have changed - pilots now
sometimes lose consciousness, and have little or no motor control for up to
a minute when they regain it. That's a dive into the ground from 60,000 feet.

This is rather like the ATM example.  Usually the transaction is finished when 
you remove your card, but not always, it seems. With a real teller it would be.
But a real teller might make a transcription mistake.  The risks have changed.

The Airbus example is relevant here, also. Using computer direction to
maintain maximal angle of attack on a go-around might lead to disaster if in
a microburst rotor, since the winds change faster than the aircraft can
respond (as in the DFW accident). I'm sure the airbus people would have
thought of that - except that we don't yet know what exactly happens in a
microburst, so how can we be assured of the control logic? The computer
controls the aircraft better than a human can follow a flight director, but
a human can improvise, sometimes, in these unknown situations.  The risks
have changed - but maybe I'm preaching to the converted?

From the "Safety" column in the March 30 Aviation Week and Space Technology,
the magazine-provided abstract follows: 

Northrup Corp.'s F-20A Tigershark prototype fighter aircraft was flying an
authorized practice demonstration at the Goose Bay Airport, Labrador,
Newfoundland, on May 14, 1985, in preparation for performances at the
upcoming Paris air show.  During the final aerobatic maneuver of the 5-min.
flight, the aircraft deviated from the planned profile and entered a shallow
wings-level descent.  The descent continued until the aircraft struck the
ground, killing the pilot, David Barnes.

The Canadian Aviation Safety Board determined that the Northrup pilot became
incapacitated during or following the final high-g pull-up maneuver and did
not recover sufficiently to prevent the aircraft from striking the ground.
Initial portions ran in Aviation Week and Space Technology Mar 23, p. 75;
Mar 16, p. 89.

[[[End of Abstract]]]

This 3rd part of the series presents the conclusions of the CASB.  This is
related to Risks only in that previous contributions have suggested that
pilots were beginning to depend on the computer to save them in GLC
(G-induced Loss of Conciousness) situations and the CASB findings *do not*
support this hypothesis.  In fact, this civilian pilot "had not received
formal aeromedical training pertaining to the GLC phenomenon and no evidence
was found that GLC training was required prior to participation in high-g
demonstration flights."

There were also pilot medical conditions and other contributing factors.  It
would seem that this was a training and human risk, rather than a
computer-related risk.

1.  A couple of weeks ago, my VCR started "malfunctioning."  It would turn
the TV screen to noise whenever I pushed the TV/VCR button to TV (it does
not record without the "TV" being "on"), and so would not record.  It also
did not play back.  I got a picture (very muddy) and not much sound.  Since
my son (age 2.5) had been "playing" with it the day before, I tried to find
out what he had done (if anything).  I checked the connections, a few
buttons in the "control panel" in front, the channel on the front (with
cable, you just leave it on channel 3), but could find nothing wrong.  I did
not look in the manual for instructions on initial startup.  The problem?
The channel select IN BACK, a small switch which selects either channel 3 or
4 had been switched to 4.

Last week, my radio in the car starting "malfunctioning" (the normal stations 
were not coming in, etc).  I still had not learned the VCR lesson, and it
took me several days to find out he (my son again) had hit the FM/AM button.

If I had a simple checklist, I would have easily and quickly solved both of
these "problems." Now I am wondering about more complicated systems
(airplanes, power plants, etc.).  What kind of things are on their
"checklists"?  The simple variety (check fuel gauge), or more elaborate items?

Radiation risk at airports?

   On Saturday, April 18, the major wire and news services carried a story,
attributed to the New York Times, saying that the FAA was about to start
testing of a prototype neutron beam-based system for detecting the nitrogen
in explosives that might be in luggage/cargo loaded into plane cargo holds.
This is a computer-based system that bombards luggage or other cargo with a
"beam of slowed neutrons" and uses a computer system to analyze the
signature of the resulting gamma radiation emissions to characterize for the
potential presence of explosives.

   The Associated Press inaccurately suggested that the manufacturer of this 
equipment was a firm named "Thermedics."  The actual NYT article gives much 
more detail and accurately names the manufacturer as "Science Applications
International Corp." of Sunnyvale.

   Some months ago, when this technology was originally mentioned in the
press, there was some discussion of the radiation problems inherent
with this sort of technology.  While one would assume care would be
used to make sure animals traveling as cargo are not subjected to
a neutron beam, the problem of secondary radiation effects on the
clothes, foods, medications, and everything else that travels as
cargo/luggage seems to be glossed over by the press.  While normal
X-ray technologies do not produce secondary radiation at conventional
power levels, neutrons are extremely energetic and in fact this
explosive detection system appears to be depending on secondary
radiation for its very operation!

   When this system was first discussed in the press some months ago,
there was mention of the problems of cargo and luggage becoming
"slightly radioactive" as a result of being subjected to the "slowed
neutron beam."  The current discussion in the press seems to be avoiding
this issue entirely, instead mentioning that the people operating
the equipment will not be subjected to more than "government standards"
for radiation exposure (many persons seem to feel that these standards
allow far too much exposure as it is).

   The question then, for anyone who understands this technology or knows
about Science Applications International, is: what will happen to luggage,
cargo, etc., possibly including foods and other items that can be ingested
or will be in close proximity to persons for long periods of time, after
passing through such neutron beam systems once or possibly many times in the
course of complex or multiple trips?  Are airline passengers to be subjected
to the radioactive luggage and cargo simply because the emission levels meet
"government standards"?  Will the frequent traveler be at greater risk than
the occasional traveler?  What is the real story about these systems?

     In case you're wondering who will be the first guinea pigs for this
technology, it's the folks in the SF Bay area.  San Francisco International
(SFO) is slated to get the first prototypes of these devices sometime quite
soon for at least a 4-week trial.  The equipment is then to be tested at
other major airports and the FAA hopes to have it in widespread use within 2
years.  Apparently the prototypes to be tested are "improved" versions of an
earlier model that required 30 seconds per test--the new equipment bombards
the target material for 6 seconds (possibly longer if the typical conveyer
and luggage problems cause clogs on the transport system).  Of the two
prototypes, one supposedly uses a continuous neutron emitter based on an
internal chunk of some radioactive material, while the other uses a
"turn-offable" system for generating the neutrons.

   Can anyone out there shed some light on the risks associated with this
technology?
               [The computers in this system may or may not present risks, 
               e.g., if the computers are involved in control, or if the 
               signature analysis is faulty.  In any case, the risk issues
               are interesting enough to warrant some KNOWLEDGEABLE
               discussion here.  Let's avoid SPECULATIONS, PLEASE.  PGN]

To: darrell@beowulf.ucsd.edu, mod-back

    I'm curious: how can you fake a posting without being root?  When I post
    anything to mod.os (er, excuse me, comp.os.research) I'm always listed as
    the sender.  Not wanting to be the bad guy I've never tried to crack it,
    but I am curious as to the hole that causes the problem.

Darrell asks an interesting question, and I might as well let everyone know
while I'm at it.

As background, be aware that USENET has a major security hole, in that there
is no way for the program rnews to know where a message came from.  It has
to implicitly trust the information in the header of the message.  While
uucp does site verification across the net, that information is not passed
along through uux to the executed program on the other side.  It has to
trust the data it gets.

This leads to a trivial hack for creating bogus and untraceable messages.
Take an existing message (I borrowed this one from mod.announce):

	Path: sun!cbosgd!mark
	From: mark@cbosgd.ATT.COM (Mark Horton)
	Newsgroups: mod.announce,news.announce.important
	Subject: mod.announce is being renamed news.announce.important
	Message-ID: &lt;3525@cbosgd.ATT.COM&gt;
	Date: 13 Apr 87 15:09:20 GMT
	Organization: AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, Columbus, Oh
	Lines: 9
	Approved: mark@cbosgd.MIS.OH.ATT.COM
	Xref: sun mod.announce:24 news.announce.important:1

This is your template. Now, change the header lines to fit, and delete the
Xref line:

	Path: cbosdg!mark
	From: mark@cbosdg.ATT.COM (Mark Horton)
	Newsgroups: mod.announce
	Subject: Newgroup renaming is a failure, film at 11.
	Message-ID: &lt;3.14159@cbosdg.ATT.COM&gt;
	Date: 1 Apr 87 00:00:00 GMT
	Organization: The Backbone Cabal, Inc.
	Lines: 9
	Approved: mark@cbosdg.MIS.OH.ATT.COM

Don't worry about the # of lines, inews will be nice enough to adjust it for
you.  Store that in a file, add the message body to it, and execute:

	% /bin/rnews &lt; file

rnews will read it just as if it had come over the network, and install it.
It believes everything you said in the header.  When it passes it along, the
Path: becomes "sun!cbsogd!mark" and it gets passes along just like a real
message.  The only place where this is traceable is the Path variable,
because you can see that my site is at the beginning of the list of real
paths.  You can avoid this in a couple of ways if you want to be real
sneaky:

	o the kremvax syndrome:  instead of having a single address in the
	path, put in a bunch:

	    Path:  kremvax!nsacyber!prarie!wobegon!himom!cbosdg!mark

	depending on your ingenuity, you make make it almost impossible to
	tell where the message joined the net for real.

	o drop out of the loop:  even more fun, rather than execute rnews on
	YOUR site, execute it on someone else's.

	    % uux - -z ihnp4\!rnews &lt; file
	
	the Path is now "ihnp4!cbosdg!mark" and your own site is nowhere to
	be seen.  Completely untraceable, unless someone wants to compare
	uucp's LOGFILE entry times with news 'log' entries and backtrack.
	Which assumes that they figure out it is happening before they flush
	the logs.  And that they have the time, and care.

That's how you forge messages.  And as long as the uucp links exist, there
is no way to fix this, because a vital piece of information isn't passed out
of uucp.

The possibilities are endless, of course.  You can not only post April
Fool's messages, but post messages FOR people that they can never prove they
didn't post.  completely untraceable.  You can change your name, your
machine, your religious background, all untraceable.  Possibly even skip out
on child support, if you find the right control message.  

Kids, don't try this at home!  These people are paid professionals, and know
the risks involved... (grin)

The only place you can be traced using chuq's "posting techniques" is the
log files.  In the `uux - -z ihnp4!rnews &lt; file` example, the machine and
user name will appear in ihnp4's LOGFILE or HDB's uucico, and uuxqt logs.

I'm not sure but have a funny feeling one can trace the user (by logs) if he
posts it on his machine, beside having his machine on the path list.

The brahms people did a good job of tracking down a person faking articles
by using log files.

&gt; I did not want to carry sixty $20 notes around with me, and I didn't want a
&gt; bank cheque either. I asked him to "undo" the transaction, and said I'd come
&gt; back later. The teller assured me that the only way that it could be done
&gt; would be to redeposit the $1200 into the same account...

This may be a people problem rather than a software design problem.

I spent the first three years of my career writing communications
interfaces for ATMs for one of the major computer vendors.  In the process,
I became familiar with the computing systems of several Washington, D.C. 
banks.  For each transaction type, there is a "correction"
transaction code that will reverse the effects of its corresponding
"normal" tran code.  This follows manual accounting procedure that requires
errors to be explicitly backed out by a separate entry rather than simply
erased.  At least two of the banks that I did work for monitored their 
tellers to keep track of who made errors, when, what kind of error, etc.
If Ken Ross's bank has a system like this, and the tellers are aware of it,
they might prefer not to use a correction transaction that will show up on
a report to their supervisor.

The April 1987 issue of the Hewlett-Packard Journal contains a short
(four page) article entitled "Reliability Theory Applied to Software Testing."

From the abstract:
    The execution-time theory of software reliability is extended to
    the software testing process by introduction of an accelerating 
    factor.   It is shown that the accelerating factor can be determined 
    from repair data and used to make prerelease estimates of software 
    reliability for similar products.

The article describes how the model was applied to the firmware for two
HP terminals.

ABACUS, vol. 4, no. 3, Spring 1987 contains the results of ABACUS
Competition #3, which invited readers to submit actual examples or
parodies of software disclaimers of warranty.

The winner is included as a format example in the user manual of the
Horstmann Software Design product, ChiWriter:

  Cosmotronic Software Unlimited Inc. does not warrant that the functions
  contained in the program will meet your requirements or that the
  operation of the program will be uninterrupted or error-free.

  However, Cosmotronic Software Unlimited Inc. warrants the diskette(s) on
  which the program is furnished to be of black color and square shape
  under normal use for a period of nineyt (90) days from the date of
  purchase.

  NOTE: IN NO EVENT WILL COSMOTRONIC SOFTWARE UNLIMITED OR ITS
  DISTRIBUTORS AND THEIR DEALERS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES,
  INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFIT, LOST SAVINGS, LOST PATIENCE OR OTHER
  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

The runner-up is from the Haven Tree Software Limited program Interactive
EasyFlow:

  We don't claim Interactive EasyFlow is good for anything--if you think
  it is, great, but it's up to you to decide. If Interactive EasyFlow
  doesn't work: tough. If you lose a million because Interactive EasyFlow
  messes up, it's you that's out the million, not us. If you don't like
  this disclaimer: tough. We reserve the right to do the absolute minimum
  provided by law, up to and including nothing.

  This is basically the same disclaimer that comes with all software
  packages, but ours is in plain English and theirs is in legalese.

  We didn't really want to include any disclaimer at all, but our lawyers
  insisted. We tried to ignore them but they threatened us with the attack

These remind me of the software order form I received some years ago

From: Jerome H. Saltzer &lt;Saltzer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU&gt;

Joseph Beckman suggests that his VCR and auto radio problems might be
reduced by checklists.  Probably so.  There is a more subtle technology RISK
hiding here, one that I notice almost every time I find that a computer has
appeared in the control path for an auto radio, a VCR, an automatic washer,
or a toaster oven: the device acquires a whole host of new features,
options, and state memory that it didn't use to have.  As a result you can't
run it without a checklist.

Lots of things don't need a checklist.  My old toaster certainly didn't need
one.  But judging from the frequency of mistakes, my new one seems to.  A
real RISK arises when someone hi-tech's a traditional design, pushing its
functional spec over the threshold at which the average user needs a
checklist to run it, and then sells this improvement to an unsuspecting and
unprepared user community.

   [Jerry, Many thanks.  This raises the desire for CONSISTENCY of code with
   specifications where the system must do NO MORE AND NO LESS than
   specified.  Of course, it is likely to do all sorts of things that are
   not specified, and therein lie all sorts of risks.  Trying to specify the
   action required for EVERY STATE in the state space is an important but
   very difficult task.  (How many of you have fallen on the EMACS bug that
   results in your being totally HUNG, where even ^G does not work?  
   &lt;Don't answer.&gt;)  PGN]

Two added notes to existing topics.

There is a recent Aviation Week which mentions a program to make
even more maneuverable planes (but not higher G), but I still
wonder if it's not more a matter of screening pilots to withstand
force.  Not unlike recent DARPA comments that maybe 1 in 3
programmers can program new parallel architectures.

Regarding checklists: we have some automated checklist work here.
Originally they thought they wanted to put more control into the
checklist but decided to separate the control from the check (safer).
We should make things easier to use up to a point.

I refrain from comment on slow neutrons.  I would worry more about film
than food (but that's not my area).  SAIC is a scientific body shop
with offices all around the country.  I was approached by them to work
as a contractor at a spook Agency.

Tom Perrine thinks I am suggesting that pilots are willing to risk
GLC episodes in the new planes. I am not suggesting this.

I am suggesting that they are more willing to risk a black-out,
since the danger of accelerated stalls is moderated.
Consequently they risk GLC episodes when they are tired, hard-worked,
or simply (according to the air force) away from it over the weekend.
A computer is in the loop. My argument is that it makes the scenario
more likely.

One possible source of confusion - a blackout is not a loss of
consciousness. Blackouts are loss of vision, caused by the
collapse of the retinal arteries, and are easily reversed by
unloading the Gs.

    I can't imagine anything worse that one could do to luggage than bombard
it with slow neutrons.  The last time I flew commercial, I was carrying
about $200 worth of motion picture film in my luggage, and I would be very
upset if it had been fogged.  Lots of vacationers carrying their vacation
pictures will be very upset.  Next time I'm taking the lead sheathing...
    In addition, what happens to digital electronics when they are hit with 
slow neutrons?  I assume the levels of radiation are low enough not to
permanently damage watches, calculators, etc., but it may well be enough to
change the state of logic.  Logic, like the digital timer used to set off the
explosive device that was hidden in the luggage, which goes off in the airport.
    A machine which detects nitrogen chains may also detect things like
ammonia if it cannot discriminate between long and short chains.  Some
explosives (like ammonium nitrate) are reasonably safe when not in the
presence of an activator, and have reasonable industrial uses.  Pity the
fertilizer salesman whose sample case is confiscated.
    Worst of all, this could lead to a false sense of security; there are
lots of nitrogenless explosives out there.  Two-part explosives aren't
all that hard to come by.
    I don't like the idea of pumping hard radiation into luggage.  It's just 
a bad idea in general.  Might be good for disinfecting your clothes, though.

Paraphrasing a well-known motto:
The Benefits to Individuals in Computer Systems

'Hackers' hit the Jackpot, by John England
The Sun, Melbourne, 23-Apr-1987

BONN, Wed. - Computer experts have cracked the codes of West Germany's most
popular poker machine.
  They are selling computer print-outs giving the machine's play programs
for $6500 and people are embarking on money-spinning raids on pubs and
amusement arcades.
  Even better, if a person is caught using the system there is nothing to fear.
West Germany does not have a law saying it is illegal to fool a machine.
  The ruse came to light when three students made a "hit" on a Cologne pub
which has four machines.
  Police were called after the students won the jackpot on each of the machines
within minutes and a search revealed a computer print-out giving the machines'
play programs.
  Police believe the students, from Brunswick University where a technical
department checks poker machines to make sure they comply with the payout law,
were the "hackers" who cracked the code.
  The makers are hurrying to change their programs but, as a spokesman
admitted:  "You can't fix 160,000 machines overnight - or stop the hackers
cracking the new code!"

Summary: BEWARE!!!  Computers gone mad!

	Fidelity Investments has a feature on their Mutual Funds called
the Money Line.  Every quarter or every month their computers will call
the computers at your bank and withdraw a specified amount of money from
your checking or savings account and invest it into a particular fund.

	I have been severely victimized by this feature and have lost
control of my checking account because of it.  As a warning to the rest
of you here is my story:

January 1986
	I sign up for 3 of Fidelity's funds and invest some $.  I ask for
the Money Line feature (once every quarter) on each account and give them
my electronic banking number and checking account number.

May 1986
	Investments doing well.  Money Line feature on each fund was never
activated.  I invest in one more fund, Magellan.  This time I specify NO
Money Line feature.

July 1986
	Money is withdrawn from my checking account without warning.  A
statement shows up saying that the Magellan fund now has that money.  I
call Fidelity customer service and asked for this to stop.

October 1986
	Money is again withdrawn from my checking account without warning.
For the first time in my life my checking account is overdrawn because
of this withdrawl.  I am fined by the bank.  I call Fidelity and ask them 
to stop.  I write them a letter telling them to stop.  I withdraw all my 
money from Magellan.  The beast should be dead.   But .....

January 1987
	Money is withdrawn from my checking account and placed into an
otherwise empty Magellan fund account that still exists.  This withdrawl
causes a check to bounce for the first time in my life.  I call Customer
Service.  They refer me to the Research Department.  Research gets back
to me later and assures me that everything will be stopped.  TWO MONTHS
later I get my money back.  Meanwhile, I am fined by my bank for the
bounced check and embarassed in front of the company I paid it to.
Is the beast dead?   Noooo ...

April 1987
	Money is again withdrawn from my checking account without warning.
The Money is put into a NEW Magellan account in my name.  I transfer the
money out.  I visit the office of my bank where my account is.  I ask them
to cancel this connection to account.  The flesh and blood people say they
cannot help me and give me a phone to call Customer Service.  Customer
Service identifies the automatic debit feature on my account and puts a
"STOP order" on it.  The operator then says that she cannot guarantee
that this will prevent the access from occurring again.  She says that
if the Fidelity computer asks for its money again, the bank computer will
probably give the money to it.  I'm furious.  I complain to the flesh and
blood people.  They say there is nothing they can do.

Epilog
	I am taking all of my money out of Fidelity to punish them for this
and to avoid future problems with them.  I will be cancelling my account
with the bank and moving it somewhere else.  Only then will I kill the
beast.  I hope ...
                 	BIG BROTHER IS HERE AND HE IS A COMPUTER!!!

I appreciate the comments of Beckman and Saltzer on inappropriate
technology in VCRs, toasters, etc.  I, too, have found it inordinately
difficult to program our "7-day programmable" VCR.

The telephone offers another case.  Our "Dimension/1" system happily
takes a half dozen codes for call forwarding, camp-on, holding, etc.,
with zero feedback as to its internal state.  Just for spite, it gives
you a little chirp as you realize you forgot to reset call forwarding
and your call has flown off to the other end of the building. 

You can also get into exotic telephone situations with banks and mutual
funds, as you can transfer five figures of cash between accounts without
being *quite* sure afterwards what you have done.

A simple rule would be that any user interface should have visual output
that is in line with the complexity of the transaction.  Visual because
an entire transaction can be viewed at once.  VCRs are lately using the
TV screen for state indication, and financial institutions are providing
PC access for their customers.  Both are hopeful developments.  I just
don't know about smart toasters.  Can they scorch ascii on your
crumpets?

It seems maintenance is one of the biggest problems in software, and not
uncommon to software.  If there is any one area where we could use
checklists, and where software people [and others] fall down, it is in the
area of long-term maintenance.

  &gt;One possible source of confusion - a blackout is not a loss of consciousness

The problem is there is a lag associated with loss of vision and loss
of unconsciousness which does not travel at the speed of light.  I would
suggest it is not as easily reversed as implied.  Better to stay far away.

  Subject: Neutron beam detection [RISKS 4.75] (Scott Dorsey)
  &gt;In addition, what happens to digital electronics when they are hit with 
  &gt;slow neutrons?  

Yes, interesting indeed.  You may have just justified the use of GaAs
circuits for home use.  This is especially critical when you consider we can
sputter layers 20 atoms thick when hitting these atoms with neutrons.

	I did an experiment with neutron radiation for a physics laboratory
while I was in college.  It may shed some light on this issue.

	For the experiment, a silver dime was placed in a device called a
"neutron howitzer" and irradiated with neutrons for approximately one
minute.  The dime was removed and the gamma radiation emmisions were
monitored.  As I recall, the half-life of the radiation was about thirty
seconds (it was very "hot" upon removal from the howitzer).  After about
three or four minutes the gamma radiation decayed to background levels.  The
latex stick which held the dime in the neutron howitzer showed no sign of
radiation at all.

	Thus, I doubt that there would be any lasting effect on clothing and
food from low energy neutron radiation.  The device we used to irradiate the
dime was in a refridgerator-sized can of lead and used plutonium to generate
the neutrons.  The device that is proposed for airport use is of
considerably less power.

	However, there would be considerable hazard to an airport worker
stationed near the neutron emitter.  I foresee lawsuits a-plenty when a
baggage handler working near the bomb detector gets a nasty disease or
produces afflicted offspring.

While I'm not sure we should be revealing all this, it is possible
to go even further and make forgeries that can't even be traced by
looking in the logs.

If you are root on your machine, you can change the machine's site
name, so that it pretends to be another machine.  If the remote site
you are calling has a general uucp login, nothing prevents you from
saying, "hi, I am site ihnp4, and here are some transactions."

cbosgd does have such a general login.  If you insist on a different
login (with password) for every network partner, than that can be safe
IF you have a version of uucp that does security checks on the names.

I think lots of people have got secure uucp mail, at least within
their organization, these days.  I don't think they do with news.

&gt; That's how you forge messages.  And as long as the uucp links exist, there
&gt; is no way to fix this, because a vital piece of information isn't passed out
&gt; of uucp.

Well.... I disagree on a minor point.  A news system could allow only
user "news" to get at rnews, and only allow user "news" incomming access
to uuxqt.  (With perhaps similar arrangements for mail.)  This means
that uux would not be allowed for anything but news or mail, but it
would plug the security hole.  So, revise Chuq's point to be "as long as
the uucp links on news systems need to be used for anything but news and
mail, there is no way to fix this."

At least... I THINK so.                  Wayne Throop

   [I am suppressing a bunch of other messages on this subject.
   It is important that you all be aware of the risks, although the
   nuances in trying to avoid them are probably beyond the interest of 
   our readership community.  Suffice it to say that most of the alleged
   solutions still have significant windows of vulnerability. PGN]

I'm another user of Fidelity's Money Line, and am now just a tad more
nervous.  This last horror story confirms my latent suspicions. 

Fidelity EFTS transfers can be initiated automatically via their "FAST"
telephone system.  By calling an 800 number, and entering a sequence of some
20-30 digits, you can (1) get the status of your account (balance, last
investment, redemption, and dividend), (2) transfer between two existing
accounts, (3) transfer into a NEW account (in any of 60+ funds), and (4)
initiate an EFTS transfer from your bank account (if preauthorized).
Apparently all Fidelity accounts are born with FAST access.  All you (or
anyone else) need to commit fiscal mayhem are your Fidelity account number
and a security code which (are you ready for this?) consists of the last 4
digits of your Social Security Number.

All of Salander's troubles might have come from a malicious "friend" on the
telephone.  Even without slurping up funds from the bank, such a prankster
could create dozens of accounts for you in obscure funds. (Everything is
confirmed by mail, of course.) 

I had thought that the 24-hr human assistance line would have been
sufficient to correct any random computer errors.  Their attitude has been
good, in my experience.  However, one particularly chatty operator did let
on that, while she thought the FAST service was generally good, she
strongly recommended calling the assistance line for transactions.  "The
computer line has no backup," she said. 

I note that my discount brokerage is similarly lenient in telephone
transactions.  They don't have touchtone transactions, but they do take
orders over the phone with only my account number and no independent
verification.  There outta be a law.

And now my bank has installed "TeleService" with features similar to Fidelity.

Thank you for sharing your story with us.  But why didn't you handle the
problem with the bank from the beginning?  Around here, I don't think a
bank can release funds except upon your authorization; and if you revoke
that authorization, they may no longer release funds.  

Then, upon occasion of the very first error, you simply close the bank account 
and withdraw all your money.  Fidelity is left "holding the bag," as it were.

I hope that, by sharing our experiences with the risks of computer systems, we
become more savvy at dealing with them.  We're users as well as developers.

   [I think we must all respond more forcefully when confronted with such
   human-caused and other computer horrors.  Perhaps a Ralph Nader-like
   group might be appropriate, but individual action can also have an
   effect, especially in quantity -- carefully worded nasty letters,
   withdrawals of accounts, threats of lawsuits, and so on.  PGN]

Brad writes that there is no way to make USENET news secure, which is
perfectly correct (as has been pointed out.)  He goes on to say that "I
think lots of people have got secure uucp mail, at least within their
organization, these days."  Sorry, 'taint so.  First, on any BSD UNIX system
except 4.3, and probably on any other UNIX V7-based system, mail on any
machine can be trivially forged, because they all use the "getlogin()"
routine to determine the sender.  (4.3 does it right -- it uses
"getpwuid(getuid())".)  Look at that routine sometime -- it's one of the
easiest to spoof.

If you have an SMTP mailer, things get to be even more fun.  SMTP does not
do verification! Just connect to your SMTP mailer as would a foreign host,
and you're off.  (To test this, we forged a letter from Opus the Penguin at
WhiteHouse.ARPA -- this was before domaining -- asking someone for pickled
herring heads for lunch, but if none were handy, for anything but squid.
Confused the heck out of the recipient until he asked the local mail guru,
me, what happened.)

There is an effort by the Internet Advisory Board Task Force on Privacy to
do something about protecting mail privacy and allowing it to be
authenticated.  The task force proposal will be transparent, so it can be
dropped onto any SMTP implementation.  If you're interested in this, grab a
copy of RFC 989 from the NIC.

Perhaps this is all fallout from cost-effective technology in one area
far outstripping advances in others?  It is marvelously cheap to
implement functions in silicon, but actuators and displays are still
(relatively) expensive.

Thus one has the digital watch with 37 functions, each accessed by some
unique manipulation of only four buttons.  For the VCR, providing a
screen display requires a (fairly inexpensive?) character generator, but
what about for a (non-video) telephone?

From a human factors viewpoint the effective bandwidth of the interface
limits the number of truly useful functions.  But from a marketing viewpoint
the ability to advertise a maximum number of (technically useful) functions
is very attractive, and may carry the day.  I suspect, therefore, that this
is going to get worse before it gets better.

I would like references to material about

	(a) pros and cons of certification 
	(b) efforts related to certification
	(c) certification methods
	(d) current practice in other fields
	(e) history of certification in other fields

Depending on the length of the resulting bibliography, I'll either 
post it to RISKS or post an announcement about it.  

Thanks in advance.

           RELIABILITY AND RISK:  COMPUTERS AND NUCLEAR WAR
                 A 34-minute slide/tape presentation

Reliability and Risk...
   ...investigates whether computer errors in key military systems--some of
   them unpreventable errors--could trigger an inadvertent nuclear war.

   ...features technical, political, and military experts discussing the role
   of computers at the heart of civilian and military systems, from the space
   shuttle to nuclear weapons to Star Wars;

   ...describes the ways in which all large, complex computer systems make
   mistakes--often unexpected and unpreventable mistakes:
     o The 46-cent computer chip failure that led to a high-priority
       military alert.
     o The software error that led to the destruction of the first Venus probe.
     o The design flaw that caused a missile early-warning computer to
       mistake the rising moon for a fleet of Soviet missiles.

   ...explores the growing reliance on computerized decision making and how a
   computer error could trigger a disaster, especially in a time of crisis.

   ...explains why we should not rely exclusively on computers to make
   critical, life-and-death decisions.

   ...uses straightforward language and graphics and is recommended for all
   audiences.  No technical knowledge is required.

   ...received a Gold Award in the Association for Multi Image New England
   competition in November, 1986--the largest multi-image competition in the
   country.

Speakers in Reliability and Risk include:

o Lt. General James A. Abrahamson, Director, Strategic Defense Initiative
  Organization (SDIO)
o Lt. Col. Robert Bowman, Ph.D., US Air Force (retired), Former Director,
  Advanced Space Programs Development
o Dr. Robert S. Cooper, Former Director, Defense Advanced Research Projects
  Agency (DARPA)
o Dr. Arthur Macy Cox, Advisor to President Carter, SALT II Negotiations, and
  Director, American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations
o Admiral Noel Gaylor (retired), former Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet
o Dr. James Ionson, Director, SDIO Office of Innovative Science and Technology
o Severo Ornstein, Computer Scientist (retired) and Founder, Computer
  Professionals for Social Responsibility

Somewhen on Tuesday afternoon, 28 April, someone plugged some equipment 
into the circuit used by CSL.SRI.COM.  The result was not only blown fuses,
but a physically destroyed disk on CSL.  We currently have a patchwork
system cannibalized from another system, with a very small disk, and thus
I am running without most of my macros, history files, etc. (just the files 
created in the last month).  We will not be back in regular service until the
END OF THE COMING WEEK, so please bear with us.  Mail received by RISKS after 
early Monday evening 27 April, but before the crash, was lost.   Mail sent to
RISKS by you during the outage was either returned undelivered, or else queued 
and eventually received, depending upon mailer whims.  Grumble.

Because of the slowness of mail here, the habit of paying your bills
by a 'permanent order' to your bank have become very popular; many
utilities also give discounts if you choose to pay your bills in that
way, since they are assured of getting their money - no bounced or bad checks.

However, a common experience is that it is very hard to cancel such an order - 
you have to keep badgering the bank until your request gets all the way through
to the data processing center, and even when you think everything's ok someone 
loads an old backup tape, and your stone rolls back to the bottom of the hill.

Sometimes the only way is to close the account, but when you have as many
as 10 such orders, that's also complicated.

You may recall the extensive discussion on Risks a few months ago
about computer-controlled airplanes.  It seems, that if the plane was
on the ground and you told the computer to raise the landing wheels,
it did so -- crashing the plane.

I recently bought the "Flight Simulator" computer game for my home
computer.  While parked on the ground, I told it to raise the (simulated)
landing wheels.  It did so, crashing the (simulated) plane.

(If you haven't seen it, "Flight Simulator" is an impressive piece of work.)

Paul Stewart's contribution on airport luggage scanners which use slow
neutrons to detect explosives reminded me of a phenomenon which
plagued a company I once worked for.  The product we sold was a
satellite navigation receiver which used the old Transit constellation
of satellites to provide position fixes for commercial ships.  Many of
these systems were sent around the world to be installed wherever a
vessel happened to be at the time.

After a couple of years, we began to notice that our overseas dealers
frequently had systems fail out of the box with invalid EPROM checksums.  
Machines installed within the U.S. virtually never failed in this way, even 
though they were built with parts from the same vendor and datecode lot.  
Spare PROM sets became a standard part of everyone's service kits.

Finally someone collected enough data to correlate these failures with
the distance a system traveled by air freight; the dealers farthest
from home usually saw the most failures.  I seem to remember that
flights over the polar routes did the most damage.

One of our engineers had a background in nuclear physics and
power engineering; the best theory he was able to propose was 
that high energy particles in the upper atmosphere occasionally 
hit heavy metal atoms in the ceramic chip packages and kicked 
out slow secondary emissions which corrupted cells in the EPROMs.

Has anyone else had first-hand experience with this phenomenon?
Can someone with adequate theoretical knowledge offer another
hypothesis?  Do the FAA's new bomb detectors pose a similar threat?

   ....a computer-based system that bombards luggage or other cargo with a
   "beam of slowed neutrons" and uses a computer system to analyze the
   signature of the resulting gamma radiation emissions to characterize for the
   potential presence of explosives.

I have been licensed by the US NRC as a nuclear reactor operator (I have
since allowed this to expire), and was once the chief programmer and
statistician on a science project which used this technique to monitor
trace element pollution in tree rings.  The method is known as Neutron
Activation Analysis (NAA).  It is based on the propensity of an atomic
nucleus to absorb a neutron and thereby transition to another isotope of
the same element, but with the next higher atomic weight.  The resulting
isotope is often energetically unstable, and often decays to a stable
state by emitting a gamma ray at a frequency characteristic of the
isotope involved.  (This is a slightly different mechanism from the
propensity of plutonium-239 and uranium-235 to absorb a neutron, become
unstable, and fission.)

The neutron capture coefficient (known as the "cross-section") is a
characteristic property of the elemental isotope, and can be looked up
in tables of physical constants (e.g., the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and
Physics), as can the stability, decay mode, frequency, and half-life of
the resultant isotope(s).  The cross-section varies widely across
isotopes (a spread of ten orders of magnitude!).  As some naturally
occurring isotopes transition to other stable isotopes and some have
miniscule cross-section, activated gamma radiation will result only in
some (this means many) cases.

For short irradiation times the amount of any given isotope created is
the product of the neutron flux (intensity), the time period irradiated,
the amount of the element present, the proportion of the element
occurring as the precursor isotope, and the precursor isotope's capture
cross-section.  (Note that if the flux is extremely low very little of
the radioactive isotope will be created.)  If the resulting isotope is
unstable, it will emit radiation at a characteristic frequency and
half-life, also obtainable from tables.  The shorter the half-life the
more intense the short-term radiation, the longer the half-life the
longer the radioactive isotope persists.  By measuring the radiation at
a particular frequency of interest and subtracting the ambient
background, it is possible to calculate the amount of a given element
present in the original sample.

      The question then, for anyone who understands this technology or knows
   about Science Applications International, is: what will happen to luggage,
   cargo, etc., possibly including foods and other items that can be ingested
   or will be in close proximity to persons for long periods of time, after
   passing through such neutron beam systems once or possibly many times in the
   course of complex or multiple trips?

Almost all of the above will become slightly radioactive, the degree to
which being essentially determined by the neutron flux characteristics,
exposure times, and elemental content of the irradiated matter.  Bodily
damage from radiation results mostly from the accompanying ionization,
in which chemical bonds are disrupted by the high energy levels and
chemically reactive ions are created.  Food is particularly worrisome
because most of the radiation is absorbed internally, and because the
body has mechanisms that produce high local concentrations of certain
elements (e.g., iodine in the thyroid, calcium in the bones, etc.).
Common isotopes in food having high natural abundance, reasonably large
cross-sections, and medium half-lifes (hence, readily made radioactive)
include sodium-23 and chlorine-37.  Common metals with similar
properties include aluminum-27, copper-63 and -65, zinc-64, silver-107
and -109, gold-197, mercury-202, and several of the trace elements used
in making stainless steel.

   Are airline passengers to be subjected to the radioactive luggage
   and cargo simply because the emission levels meet "government standards"?

Well, yes, but this has to be kept in perspective.  For example,
"government standards" are typically less than the ambient background
due to cosmic rays, etc., and also less than the incremental increase
due to living in a brick house (because of trace radioactive elements
and isotopes present in the brick from the earth), living in Denver
instead of New York (because of the greater exposure to cosmic rays from
less atmospheric shielding), or a medical X-ray.  This does *not* mean
that they are harmless --- the effects of low-level radiation are *very*
poorly understood and the health aspects, if any, somewhat
controversial.  Of especial concern is genetic damage due to ionization
and resulting disruption of chromosomes.

   Will the frequent traveler be at greater risk than the occasional traveler?

Yes, given the perspective about ``risk'' above.

   What is the real story about these systems?

I cannot answer this question, only discuss the underlying technology.
The "real story" depends on (1) physical parameters such as exposure
time and neutron flux characteristics which are not provided in the
story, and (2) medical effects of low radiation levels, which are
poorly understood and controversial.

       A machine which detects nitrogen chains may also detect things like
   ammonia if it cannot discriminate between long and short chains....

For virtually all purposes nuclear processes are completely decoupled
from chemical ones, and so the technique cannot discriminate between
long and short chains.  It is in fact unlikely that nitrogen is being
detected in this way.  99.63% of natural nitrogen occurs as nitrogen-14,
which on neutron capture transitions to nitrogen-15 which is stable.
0.37% occurs as nitrogen-15, which has an insignificantly miniscule
capture cross-section.  This makes sense when you think about it, as
otherwise the nitrogen in the air would render the technique worthless.
Rather, it is more likely that some readily-activated rare-earth element
associated in trace quantities with explosive manufacture is what is
actually being detected.  This is done, e.g., in studies which wish to
monitor the lead deposition from gasoline even though lead is
essentially inactivable.  These studies look instead for vanadium, which
occurs in gasoline in trace amounts but is readily activated and
detected.

   	I did an experiment with neutron radiation for a physics laboratory
   while I was in college .... a silver dime was placed in a device called a
   "neutron howitzer" and irradiated .... it was very "hot" upon removal

As mentioned above, silver activates rather nicely.  Typically this
experiment measures the two different half-lives associated with the two
different silver isotopes which are activated.

   The latex stick which held the dime in the neutron howitzer showed no sign 
   of radiation at all.
    
Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, the basic elements of complex
carbohydrates and many polymers, are all essentially inactive under neutron 
irradiation.  In any case, for a physics experiment the holder would be chosen 
to be inert, so as not to compromise the experiment with spurious radiation.

   	Thus, I doubt that there would be any lasting effect on clothing and
   food from low energy neutron radiation.

This is not a justified assumption without additional technical
substantiation.  It depends critically on what elements are irradiated,
for how long, and within how strong a neutron flux.

The following article was in the (Portland) Oregonian, 1 May 1987.  I'm not 
quite sure what to make of it, except that I can't quite believe it.  This 
looks like the kind of information abuse that people (myself included) would 
say "couldn't happen, because people are more reasonable than that."

  PNB CANCELS 976 NUMBER FOR PERSONAL-DATA COMPANY

  Seattle (AP) -- Pacific Northwest Bell has canceled the 976-prefix toll-call 
  number of a Seattle company that obtains and sells information about 
  individuals.  The company had sent post cards to thousands of Seattle
  residents, offering to delete data about them from company files if they
  called the telephone number--a call that cost $7.50.  After PNB attorneys 
  alleged that the post cards could involve extortion, the phone company 
  canceled Profile Service Corp.'s 976 number Monday, the first time such 
  action had been taken in the Seattle area, said PNB spokesman Bruce Amundson.

  But Jan Sakamoto, Profile's president, said the company did nothing wrong and
  would appeal the phone company's action to the Washington State Utilities and
  Transportation Commission.  "I don't think it's blackmail or fraud," Sakamoto
  said.  Instead, he said, his company was "catching the brunt of people's ire 
  at not being able to control information about themselves."
  
  Commission spokesman Raymond Day said PNB apparently was within its rights in
  canceling the number.  The commission allows PNB to cut off service "without 
  prior notice, for unlawful use of service or use of service for unlawful 
  purposes," Day said.

  Seattle news media, the state attorney general's office, the Utilities and 
  Transportation Commission, the Postal Service and PNB have received numerous
  complaints about the cards, which were mailed to 20,000 Seattle residents.  
  The card read: "Profile Service Corp. knows some personal things about you  
  that other people might like to know.  Our company's computer files contain 
  names, telephone numbers, complete addresses, credit reports and other 
  important pieces of information about you.  We have purchased this 
  information from a variety of public and private sources."  The card then 
  advised consumers to call its 976 number to have the number deleted from its
  computer files.  The $7.50 charge for the call would be billed to caller's 
  phone numbers, with most of the charge being remitted by PNB to Profile.  
  People who called the number will have the charge deleted from their phone 
  bills, Amundson said.

I think it's interesting that the company is not offering to delete information
because it is incorrect, but simply because people might not want it there, as 
long as they are willing to pay.  It would not surprise me if Profile Service 
Corp. didn't really have any data at all, but was simply out to milk money from
people who are anxious about "not being able to control information about 
themselves."

It's refreshing that Pacific Northwest Bell chose to put a stop to this scam.
I suppose they could have stayed out of it, saying it was Profile's business.

No mention is made of what "use" Profile Service Corp. makes of the data it
keeps.  If their raison d'etre is simply to get rich on people's $7.50 
paranoia calls, they can preserve income, lower expenses and raise profits by 
not maintaining an expensive computer database at all.  It would be interesting
to know how big Profile Service Corp. is: if it's just Jan Sakamoto in his 
garage, and if he's got other income, he can't lose: the only expense is the 
postcard mailing, so once that is recovered, each phone call is pure profit.

From Datalink (UK) March 23 1987:

LAW THREATENS FIRMS WITH COURT OVER FAULTS

A new Bill may leave computer companies wide open to claims for personal
injury says Angus McCrone:


  Software and hardware suppliers are being advised to take careful notice of a
  new law which means they could be sued for damages if their products are
  involved in a user's personal injury.
  
  The law is a product liability bill which is now on its way through 
  parliament and should be on the statued books by May next year.
  
  The bill gives individuals the right to sue companies if they can claim that
  they have suffered personal injury as a result of defective products - 
  whether computer products or any other sort.
  
  This is likely to apply not only where an individual suffers injury from 
  using a computer system, but also where a computer error is alleged to have 
  caused an accident, such as a plane crash.  Computer suppliers could even be 
  sued if their systems have designed a large object, such as a bridge, which 
  has fallen down and caused injury.
  
  This marks a radical change from the past, when products suppliers were only
  likely to be sued for damages if it could be proved that they were guilty of
  clear negligence.
  
  The proposed legislation has prompted groups like software's Computing 
  Services Association (CSA) and hardware's Business Equipment Trade 
  Association (Beta) to warn of serious consequences for their members.
  
  Alan Smith, director of administration at Beta - which represents most of the
  big hardware manufacturers including IBM, ICL, Honeywell and Hewlett Packard 
  - said that his organisation is 'very worried' about the new legislation.
  
  "It completely reverses 500 years of legal precedents,' Smith said. 'At the
  moment a claimant has to prove negligence by a supplier and that this
  negligence was the cause of injury.
  
  'In the future, as a result of this legislation, all suppliers will be 
  treated as guilty unless they can prove that their products did not cause 
  the injury.'
  
  In other words, Smith reckons the difference between a system or program 
  going wrong, and being misused, could be blurred.  'If someone misuses a 
  computer in the machine tool industry or in a hospital, who is to say that 
  the system did not malfunction and cause the injury?'
  
  He predicts that the product liability legislation would hit hardware vendors
  in two other respects - it will become much more difficult and expensive for
  them to insure products for liability, and they could be hit by a spate of
  'spurious claims' for damages.
  
  Both factors will present suppliers with increased costs.  Smith said; 'The
  next five to 10 years could be a nasty experience for a lot of companies.'
  
  But while hardware vendors look certain to be hit by the proposed product
  liability law, it is still not clear whether software will be included in the
  legislation or not.
  
  Ranald Robertson, legal services manager at CAP and an expert on software and
  the law, commented that the Government has not made clear whether software 
  will be treated as a 'product' and so will be covered by the new legislation.
  
  Robertson said; 'Until a test case is brought to court, we are unlikely to 
  have a definitive statement as to whether software is included in the
  legislation.  'But any software producer which ignores this legislation and 
  its possible implications does so at its own peril, because there could be 
  situations where a defect is attributable to faulty software and a potential
  liability could exist', Robertson added.
  
  Doug Eyeions, director general of the CSA, described one example; 'If 
  software is used to make a bridge or a nuclear reactor, and it turns out to 
  have bugs, then this legislation could lead to an enormous liability for the
  software supplier.'
  
  The CSA is arguing that software, by its very nature, cannot be guaranteed to
  be 100% bug free and cannot be tested in all possible circumstances - 
  therefore it would be unfair to classify software as a 'product' for
  the purposes of the new law.
  
  Another argument which the software industry is putting forward to the
  Government is the so-called 'development risk defence'.
  
  This argues that a supplier should escape product liability if it is judged
  that with the benefit of current scientific knowledge, it could not have
  foreseen a particular defect.
  
  But these sorts of arguments may fall on deaf ears.  One parliamentary
  amendment which had the support of Beta has already been defeated.
  
  The Government is also under pressure from the EEC which has issued a 
  directive requiring all its member states to have suitable product liability 
  laws in place by May 1988.
  
  Because the proposed law applies to all products the implications for the
  software and hardware industries have taken some time to sink in.
  
  But groups like the CSA and Beta are now lobbying very hard to influence what
  Eyeions describes as 'one of the major issues facing the industry'.

Elsewhere in the paper, a brief summary article states:

  According to Praxis chairman Martyn Thomas, who is involved with the Alvey
  formal methods team, this could mean software houses will have to prove they
  used state-of-the-art formal methods in the design stage.
  
  Rather than companies sorting themselves out in time for the new law, he 
  thinks "what's more likely to happen is that there'll be a court decision 
  that a company wouldn't have been liable if it had used formal methods.

In an editorial on page A.14 of the San Francisco Examiner and Chronicle on 
26 April 1987 were some comments on air passenger complaints having doubled 
in March 1987 compared with March 1986.  ``But the airlines weren't the only 
ones falling short in service.  The Department of Transportation ...  usually 
issues its complaint report monthly, but the one for March was the first since 
December.  The delay was blamed on computer malfunction.  Could it be that the
Transportation Department has the same computer system as the airlines?''
[Hey, I'm just quoting.  No responses please on whether the last sentence 
was facetious or whether the editorial writer is stupid.  PGN]

The SF Chronicle on the following day had an article noting that air
traffic controller errors at Chicago's O'Hare Airport increased 65% from
1985 to 1986, and nearly led to major disasters on several occasions.
[From a newly released congressional report.]

The SF Chronicle on 28 April quoted National Transportation Safety Board
Chairman Jim Burnett, that a forced reduction in the number of flights is
a necessary short term step to offset the recent rise in air traffic
controller errors and near-collisions.  FAA chief Donald Engen defended
the system as safe and said that Burnett does not understand it.  ``I
don't believe we should adopt a policy of restricting air commerce in this
country", he said.

You better believe that there is a problem shipping things via airfreight.

First,  let me give you a glimpse into semiconductors, especially the
(old) EPROM technology.  (If you know this stuff,  and disagree with
my explanation,  quit quibbling: you know what I mean).  The way that
an EPROM stores information is by "trapping" a bunch of charges in
an "insulated" region;  you can do the same thing by statically charging
up some material,  and not letting the charge drain off.  This trapped
charge can be used to modify the characteristics of a transistor:
if the charge is not there,  the transistor will turn on (off?) when asked to;
otherwise it looks like a dead duck,  and will not turn on or off.  Let the
"good" transistors represent a 1,  the bad (trapped charge) a 0.
VOILA!  Programmable Memory... just find a way to get the charge there.
Well,  that can be done by placing a fairly high voltage across the
transistor,  which causes a strong electric field,  which will BLAST
those little charges into place.  Hopefully. Sometimes you have to do
this several times,  i.e.- you have a programming cycle.

Well,  all  this depends on the charges staying there.  Do you know what
happens when a charged particle rips through a solid?  It leaves a little
chain of ionized atoms in its path;  luckily this only lasts a short time.
Zap!  there is a conducting path, and away some of those little devils race,
hither and yon.  And you lost some charge.  Do this often enough,  and
PRESTO.  No more stored information.

Now at 20 Km up there (60,000 feet: 12 miles),  you would be amazed at the
numbers of highly energetic particles.  Of course they will get "absorbed"
by the atmosphere,  but that is a Loooong ways down.  One of the reasons why
military equipment is "Radiation Hardened".

By the way, it isn't just High Energy Particles.  One of the
interesting things is that UltraViolet light puts out enough OOMPH
(highly technical physics term) to cause the charges to start leaking,
and is how you can erase a EPROM.  Well, ordinary light will also
effect semiconductors, in a similar manner.  In fact, enough light,
and a "nonconducting" transistor will start conducting.  Luckily all
those transistors are hidden away inside little opaque packages,
except for (are you ready?)  EPROMS!  which need a clear window so
they can be erased.

So here we are, with a new system, on public display.  The program was
in EPROM, and was on a board.  "Lets open the cabinet, and show people
a running system!"  This led to the main board, with it's EPROM, being
exposed to the public gaze.  And to their cameras.  Flash Cameras.
With BIG Pulse Zenon Bulbs.  10 Microsecond flash, 4 times light of
sun blah blah.  Flash! Flash!

...Parity Error!  EPROM Parity Fault!  Reset and Restart....

From the comments I heard,  this just about drove a couple of people nuts.

By the way, if you want to see if this works, try getting one of those
"singing cards" with the IC on it.  Some of them have been potted in
CLEAR jel, and you can actually see the chip.  Get the thing singing
away, and then shine a light on it.  A strobe light works best, and
you can actually hear the effect.

I once saw a Cessna light plane with a prop which had severely curled-back
blades. We asked the F.B.O. (employee of the rental company which owned it)
what had happened. We were told that the plane was equipped with
(overly-sensistive!) automatic landing gear retraction. It had hit a bump
while taxiing, and bounced; the mechanism decided that the plane had taken
off, and raised the gear. Didn't do the engine much good.

As a pilot and aircraft mechanic I can tell you this is not a realistic
simulation.  All aircraft with retractable gear have a safety switch
(often called a "squat switch") that senses when any weight is on the
landing gear and interrupts power to the retraction mechanism in that
condition.  Barring electrical/mechanical failure the gear will not
retract while sitting on the ground.

A common but unsafe practice is to flip the gear control to "up" while
taxiing and allow the gear to automatically retract as the plane lifts off.

I heard this on the radio coming in:  

   Cadillac is recalling 57,000 84-86 cars for what they termed
   'problems with the headlight computer that would cause your 
   lights to go out unexpectedly'

Now, wouldn't THAT be fun.  What I want to know is whether it is hardware
or software.

[For reference, the GM car computer is the 68HC11, a custom CMOS chip based
on the 6809 with lots of bit operations added in.  They use two per car,
one for the engine, and one for the body operations.  Both are programmed
exclusively in assembler.]
                                               chuq

     [Presumably the two computers are totally independent and provide no
     redundancy -- with no possibility for alternate hosting or comparison.
     Does it matter whether WHAT is in hardware or software?  If the computer
     has to go back to Detroit for repairs, it doesn't matter.  If your garage 
     mechanic can download a new program it might, but then we get back to 
     an earlier RISKS discussion about whether you will trust your mechanic to
     mess with your software...  PGN]

Excerpt from Federal Computer Week, Volume I, No. 6 (May 4, 1987):
 
             Ecom Resurrected (by M. J. Richter)

  The U.S. Postal Service's Electronic Computer-Originated Mail (Ecom)
  system, a short-lived and very unprofitable operation in the early
  1980s, has risen from the ashes and will go into operation in the
  private sector this September. TCOM System Inc. ...  plans to offer
  federal and commercial customers overnight to two-day mail delivery
  service via a data network.  Laser printers will produce hard copies
  of messages sent over the network ...  and the U.S. Postal Service
  will deliver the messages along with first class mail.  ...

  GTE Data Services of Tampa, Fla., just signed a five-year, $50-million
  contract to serve as TCOM's central processing and network management
  organization.  Customers will send their computer mail over telephone
  lines to one of the GTE Data Services' nine processing centers.

  At the data centers, the electronic mail messages will be sorted by
  ZIP code, furnished with ZIP+4 codes and then transmitted to one of 25
  TCOM regional operating centers.  There, the documents will be printed
  on high-speed laser printers, inserted by machine into envelopes and
  sent to the U.S. Postal Service for first class mail delivery.  A
  full-page letter will cost 65 cents, and each additional page will
  cost five cents. ...  TCOM trucks will transport the hard copies ...
  to regional post office hubs for delivery along with regular
  first-class mail. ...

  The TCOM "enhanced mail-distribution" operation, slated to start up on
  Sept.  1, is an exact private replica of the Postal Service Ecom
  system that opened up in January 1982. ... At the time Ecom operations
  began, the Postal Service said more than 80 business organizations had
  signed up for the service, and that four telecommunications carriers
  had contracted to provide the electronic transmission portion of Ecom.

  About two years later, protests by Congress and the Postal Service
  board of governors over Ecom's rising tide of red ink cause the Postal
  Service to discontinue the operation.  ...

I'm wondering how secure this mail will be.  While most computer "tech-ies"
are aware that electronic mail isn't necessarily private, many non-technical
people don't consider or aren't aware of the susceptibility of electronic 
communications (especially electronic mail) to interception.  Customers may 
well be mailing private or sensitive information (financial, personal, 
whatever), assuming it is as confidential as a traditional sealed-and-stamped 
letter.  Should one of the stuffing machines or laser printers jam, presumably 
some human must un-jam it.  What's to prevent him/her from casually reading 
the letter which was being processed?  After all, if an open letter just falls 
into *your* lap, don't you usually read at least part of it?  (Only to figure 
out what it is so you can return it, of course... :-) )
                                                            Brian M. Clapper

   [By the way, there were still more messages on spoofing mailers that are
   not included here.  I think you all get the idea that spoofing is amazingly 
   easy, and that most attempts to patch things up don't work.  PGN]

I had a local ACM/SIGGRAPH core (staff) meeting this evening.  We will
be having a special tour for our local members.  A special
demonstration was offered to us by Ron Reisman of Singer-Link at the
Man-Vehicle Systems Research Facility (MVSRF).  This facility was
featured during the "why planes crash" episode of Nova and we "flew"
in the two simulators shown on Nova.

The first, Advanced Cab, simulates a non-existent plane of 1995 with all the
latest bells and whistles which are not flight certified: advanced CRTs,
checklists (not paper), side sticks, etc.  This system does not have a
motion base and is about a $2M image generation facility, it was pointed
out that the side stick alone costs $125K.  The whole thing is multiples
of $10M.  Scene is a Link Night scene by a DIG (Digital Image Generator).
We "took off from SFO" and flew thru the Transamerica Building. We reset
the system, and I dropped the question on Ron.  Just to let you know, the
knobs of the system are human engineered, the flaps know look like
little flaps, the landing gear gear looks like a little landing gear
(I learned the story of this at JPL: to avoid similar looking knobs and
pulling the wrong thing).  So we pulled the landing gear while on the ground.
Plane bounded up and down basically taking off: (oh yes, the engines
were on, we have to specify the test conditions while pulling
wheels up) not the wrong thing, but not the right thing (obviously),
it's a non-existent plane so they never cared, they knew).

The second simulator was a Class 2 727 simulator.  This simulator
is probably the most advance simulator in Northern CA (so says Ron).
We had a 727 pilot with us on this one.  This simulator has a live
motion base and we could not fly with it (against FAA regs).  We have had
injuries (broken arms) by unauthorized "flights" with a high turbulence
setting: you have to be a real 727 pilot to use it.  This is the real
simulator used by Boeing trained pilots.  The people (Ron and I can't
remember the pilot's name [HER name BTW]) assured me that the 727 had
interlocks to prevent gear retraction while on the ground.  Every
eventuality of this type has "been taken care of."  You can agree or
disagree with this, but  I hope you can see why we should not do
this type of test in this machine.  They were aware of the F-16 simulator
problems.  Just testing.

Basically, the MVSRF people thought the wheels up thing was a bit strange:
probably an easily related over simple, but obvious example of problems.
They are more concern about what makes plane crash: designs are written
on paper with ink, checklists are written on paper with blood (Ron).
They are worried about more subtle but complex problems.  I think
there is a bit of naive on both parts and would recommend suspending this
line of discussion.  If some one else gets a chance to try the the F-16
simulator at GD in the Mid-West, you might post, but the professionals
of this area think we are knit picking.

I worked on A4's in the Navy, and we had a problem with the wheels up
interlock circuitry, and people.  There was an interlock so that the
wheels could not be raised with weight on them, however, this
interlock also disabled the radar altimeter.  To test the altimeter,
this interlock had to be defeated.  The proper procedure was for one
person to manually actuate the interlock switch, which was on one of
the main landing gear, while the testing was going on.  Since this
would mean four people were required to test the unit, work-arounds
were sought after by those of us on the line.  One of these workarounds 
called for removing a fuse from a panel in the forward nose gear well
while the test was in progress.  Sometimes the fuse didn't get
replaced, and didn't get noticed during preflight.  This caused the
up-and-locked indicator system to not indicate.  This annoyed pilots.
It never had any serious consequences that I knew of, but....

From: Matt Jaffe &lt;jaffe%cf5.UCI.EDU@ROME.UCI.EDU&gt;

Many military aircraft have an override which permits the gear to be
raised even when there is weight on the main mounts.  There are
circumstances where safety requres one to raise the gear while on the
ground.  A typical example is when the aircraft has run off the runway
and is headed for uneven  or soft terrain.  Leaving the gear down may,
depending on the aircraft and terrain, result in the aircraft flipping
inverted on the ground.  For both the aircraft and any personnel on
board, that is generally worse than merely sliding along on the
fuselage.  (There was a fatal accident here - Los Angeles - in the
Sepulveda basin recently when a T-28 made an emergency landing on
terrain that looked decent but was not quite good enough.)

The relevant question for design engineers is, of course, under what
circumstances may system operators require overrides to defeat safety
mechanisms and how difficult can the override operation be made to be
(to prevent inadvertent activiation) before it becomes so difficult to
operate in times of stress that it presents more of a safety hazard
(because it consumes operator attention and effort under what are
obviously already stressful conditions) than if it were it not present
at all?

   [The April 30 issue of Computer News (the magazine that ran alone with
   the story for months before the rest of the media noticed) carried the
   most complete summary I have seen to date. Here it is, slightly
   abridged.  Brian]
  
DEFENCE DEATHS: THE FACTS BEHIND THE STORY

The mysterious deaths of two Marconi systems experts first reported in Computer
News have sparked off intense speculation. Tony Collins clears up the confusion
surrounding this baffling series of events:

Late last year, a Bristol coroner, Donald Hawkins, spoke of a possible 'James
Bond' connection between the deaths of two computer experts involved in key
underwater defence projects.

Since then the mysterious deaths of five other defence workers have come to
light.  In addition, another scientist has disappeared and a senior ICL
employee is critically ill after an unexplained fall.

Most incidents have occurred after the men have successfully completed
important projects or left one job for another.

Although there are police suspicions that many of them were depressed for
different reasons, Computer News could establish no obvious motive for suicide
in any of the cases.....

Four of the dead men were employees of the GEC group - three at Marconi and one
at Easams. Two others worked at separate times at the Royal Military College of
Science at Shrivenham.

A Computer News investigation has established that most of the men were
involved in computer simulation, arguably the key which opens the door to some
of Britain's most secret defence technology.....

Marconi is Britain's only torpedo supplier and was last year awarded the
Ministry of Defence's largest weapons order - (pounds) 400m  for advanced
anti-submarine Sting Ray torpedoes.  The Sting Ray's computer aided guidance
system is so advanced it is being used in the development of Marconi's
strategic defence initiative (SDI) programmes.

The Royal Military College at Shrivenham is also involved in a number of
Britain's leading edge defence projects.  The college develops new testing
devices for the Ministry of Defence and is engaged as a sub-contractor to
defence companies on research and development.....

All the men involved were ambitious and demonstrated a special ability in their
particular field.  Marconi employee Vimal Dajibhai, 24, found dead beneath the
Clifton Suspension Bridge last August, was about to leave Marconi for a higher
paid job.

Ashad Sharif, another London programmer found dead in Bristol, was about to
take over the running of a department at Marconi's Stanmore headquarters.

David Sands, who died in March as his car loaded with two cans of petrol
exploded into flames as it crashed into a disused cafe, had just returned from
a family holiday in Venice to celebrate the ending of a three year command and
control systems project for Marconi's sister company Easams.

Marconi Space Systems employee Victor Moore (46) had just finished work on
infra-red satellites at Portsmouth when he was found dead from a drug overdose.
His death is said to have instigated an MI5 investigation, the results of
which will remain secret.

There is also a separate investigation into Marconi based at Portsmouth by the
Ministry of Defence Serious Crime Squad.

Early this year, two lecturers on top secret projects died in separate
'accidents' of carbon monoxide poisoning.  Both had recently returned from
America and had conducted research at the Royal Military College in Shrivenham.

The first, Peter Peapell, a lecturer and underwater acoustics expert, was found
dead under his car and the garage door was closed.  Although an inquest
returned a verdict of accidental death, police are unsure how the accident
happened.....

Despite reports that Peapell had no connections with electronics or computers
he had in fact written a book on basic computers.  He also had a paper
published on underwater acoustic emissions.

The second, Dr. John Brittan, a former computer science officer at the Royal
Military College was also inexplicably found dead in his car this year. He too
was involved in computer simulation.

A few weeks ago, Stuart Goody (23) a post graduate at the Royal Military
College at Shrivenham was killed in Cyprus while on holiday.  He died instantly
when his hired car collided head on with a lorry.  The lorry driver was said to
be unhurt.  At least one senior employee at the college considered that the
death could be significant.

Avtar Singh-Gida, a researcher working on an important Ministry of Defence
underwater project, disappeared just three weeks away from its successful
completion.....

About two weeks ago, Robert Greenhalgh, a contracts manager at ICL's defence
division at Winnersh near Reading, suffered multiple injuries after falling
from a railway bridge on his way to work.....

The firm admitted he had been positively vetted and may have had access to
secret UK and Nato data.....

After every death, police have given unofficial press briefings which provide
journalists with plausible though unconfirmed explanations for the accidents or
apparent suicides.

The major problem for police has been the lack of obvious signs of depression
in any of the cases.....

Several MPs have demanded a government inquiry although there are no signs that
ministers will agree.

The answer to the mystery may never be known, at least in the short term.  As
one policeman said: "We'll probably know all the answers when the papers are
released in 30 years time."

The Information Age Commission Act is intended to ``create a forum for
discussions and targeted research on the present and future impact of
computer and communication systems on our nation and its citizens.''
This year's bill, S.786, is causing a lively controversy.  Sponsors
are Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ).  (Last
year's bill passed the Senate, but did not make it through the House.)
Apparently most industry trade associations (except ADAPSO) are lining
up against it.  Some think that if such a commission must exist, then
it should represent industry views only.  The view of your RISKS
moderator (unofficially, of course, especially since RISKS does not
pretend to speak offically for the ACM) is that such a commission
COULD be wonderful -- if it is not a case of the fox watching the
chicken coops, and if it does not become a bureaucratic tarpit.
Otherwise it could be a disaster.

There is much background on the issues in an article by Willie Schatz
in Datamation, 1 May 87, pp. 32,37,38,40, which quotes a CBEMA issue
paper saying ``there is no specific or even identifiable need,
purpose, or focus for this commission, that it would be a government
commission in search of a mission.  The paper also contends that the
commission could become a forum for "promoting sensational but
unfounded allegations about the societal effects of modern information
technology.  The commission would needlessly provide a highly visible
forum for those who retard the information age." ''

                   [Side note to Herb Lin: Herb, have you ever shown 
                   Senators Nunn and Lautenberg copies of OUR RISKS 
                   Forum???  Are we retarding (or retarded?)  PGN]

From the Washington Post, Sunday 10 May 87:
 
&gt; FIRM, EX-OFFICIAL AT LEGAL LOGGERHEADS

&gt; Lakeland, Fla. -- The former chief financial officer at an insurance company
&gt; is holding the firm's computer files hostage with a coded password known only
&gt; to himself, a lawsuit charges.

&gt; Golden Eagle Group Ltd. wants a judge to order George C. Coker, Jr. to reveal
&gt; the password he programmed a week ago into the company's computer, which
&gt; Golden Eagle says contains current accounting in excess of $400,000 and 
&gt; extensive background data.

&gt; Coker contends that certain computer files are his property and says he will
&gt; reveal the password only if allowed to keep an IBM personal computer, which
&gt; he said was given to him in exchange for working overtime, plus his last
&gt; paycheck, a letter of reference and a $100 fee.

That's the entire article, verbatim unless I've missed a typo.  It doesn't
say anything about the size of the company, whether there had been any
warning about disputes between Coker and the company, or any other data
we could use to figure out what measures should have been taken to answer
the risk which is now visible.  I suspect, however, that the RISK question
is in the same class as one I have never been able to answer for myself:
at what point is it appropriate to trust a single individual in a process,
as opposed to the cost of never letting one person do anything without
another qualified person present?  Should graveyard shifts with a single
operator be prohibited?  Should I double the number of system programmers
in my shop so that no programmer ever does anything alone?  There's no
question about the risk such situations cause; the question involves the
economic penalties of reducing the risk.

For that matter, the article doesn't say if the data is from a mainframe
or a micro.  How do you handle a no-solo policy on a personal computer?

And note that audit trails wouldn't help here; there's no question about
who did what to the system.  Offsite backups might help, but (a) Coker
might have been in a position to sabotage them, and (b) if the data
is more current than the backups, they're worthless.  Let's see a show
of hands of RISK-readers who can swear that all data in their systems
(mainframe AND micro, please) is currently backed up off-site...on second
thought, forget it.

A few days ago a computer seems to have been stolen from a laboratory I know
of.  It can't have been difficult to steal; it was a MicroVAX 2000, and if you
haven't seen one, they're 5.5" x 11.25" x 12.75", small enough to fit in an
athletic bag or a sample case.  I know; I've done it.

It's not known yet, of course, who took the machine, but it is known precisely
when it happened, because the machine was a member of a local area VAXcluster
whose boot member (home base, with the system disk, etc.) was elsewhere on the
Ethernet in another, better-secured laboratory; and when the MicroVAX 2000 was
turned off, its absence from the cluster was immediately registered by the boot
member.

Hmm.  Does RISKS cover risks TO computers?   Pete

         critical application, that is part of the system risk...  PGN]

The current issue of TIME has two articles of interest: the smaller is the 
battle of the "hard" versus "soft" scientists with Serge Lang in one corner and
Herbert Simon {indirectly} in another.  I tend to side with Lang in this case.

The cover story is about recent advances in superconductivity.  I am
surprised that RISKS has not jumped on this topical band-wagon.  I note
some interesting things in the omission (since we have had the argument
that the omission of computers we have regarded is a RISK).

1) computers were probably not used.

1a) If computers had been used could we not have had superconductivity sooner?
Could not people have been "saved" sooner if higher-temp superconductivity
was around sooner?
	{I doubt it and so does PGN.}

1b) Is this a sin of omission of computers?  {Probably not since there is more
to understanding this universe than what is simulated on computers.}

2) The use of the word "tinkering" was prominent.  I know Peter Denning does 
not regard tinkering as experimentation.  The theory around superconductivity 
is poorly understood.  Perhaps, physics should do less tinkering. 8-)

3) What are the risks to superconductivity?  Don't higher speed trains
means higher speed train crashes?  (Ah yes, but the benefits outweigh
the risks...)  The computer science people worry, but this does not stop
the physicists.  What about all that LN2 out there?  Will there be increased
cases of frostbite? 8-) (Assuming we don't make room-temperature.)

4) A social commentary about the rate of technological change was made
regarding the Super Collider (the SSC).  Should that project wait or should
it proceed?  Similarly, should computing people jump on the superconductor 
bandwagon?  Only ETA systems has LN2 cooled computer systems on the market.   
I think the reality is that we won't see this material in the computing arena 
for about 20 years because a) a lot of effort will have to be made to 
determine whether room temperature materials exists and b) that waiting will 
delay use of the current material (whether a) works or not): just like waiting
for a better computer.  Oh, on the 20 year time frame, the question is could 
existing computers shorten that time frame?

One more thought: I'm surprised there was no RISKy commentary on Fred
Brooks "Silver Bullet" article.

The item I sent in recently from Datalink (of March 23) about proposed new 
Product Liability legislation in the UK contained a brief quote fromn  Martyn 
Thomas (Chairman of Praxis, a UK software house) which gave an over-simplified
view of his, and his company's, attitude to the use of formal methods. I
therefore thought it only fair to pass on a slightly fuller quote from a letter
by Thomas which appeared in the May 4 issue:

  "There are many mistaken views of formal methods, born from fear and
  ignorance.  Formal methods are no panacea. Their use does not guarantee 
  error-free systems.  They are intended to make reviewing and testing easier,
  not to make such activities unnecessary ... if a software developer chooses 
  to write down an important requirement or design decision using an imprecise 
  language, when a precise one is readily available, then he has acted 
  unprofessionally. If someone suffers damage as a result of that 
  unprofessional act, it is right that they should be compensated.  Customers 
  whose life or business depends on their computer systems working correctly 
  will increasingly want the assurance that their software developers are 
  applying the best available methods. In many cases, this will include the
  rigorous use of formal methods."

I can readily accept such comments - what concerns me is whether it will
ever be possible to make reasoned judgements about the risks attendant on 
using a given complex program, and about how best to apportion resources 
amongst the various different techniques, such as verification, testing 
and the use of design redundancy, which might assist in achieving some 
given required level of reliability from the program.

I recommend the novel, THE WHISTLE BLOWER, by John Hale.  The plot
concerns a British computer specialist who dies in an unlikely
accident.  Much better written than the usual thriller - really
transcends the genre, as the critics like to say.

Sorry, I don't have the publisher, I returned the book to the public
library a few weeks ago, but it seems it was a U.S. reprint of a novel
originally published in the U.K.

In the last issue PGN asked if someone had shown previous issues of RISKS to 
a couple of senators drafting legislation.  This treads on the boundary of 
inappropriate and risky in itself use of this medium.  It is generally 
understood, I thought, that this kind of forum is private to its readers, 
although the larger the subscriber list the harder it is to maintain that 
fiction.  Although I don't contribute much here, had I known there was a 
likelihood that what I wrote might end up in the Congressional Record I'm 
not sure I would have contributed it -- how do others think, or can our 
moderator state what he thinks the policy is?
                                                       Ted

   [Interesting question.  We agreed way back in Volume 1 or 2 that
   material in RISKS was open for noncommercial redistribution, as long  
   as that did not violate any explicitly stated caveats or copyright
   limitations.  It is important to keep RISKS informal and unencumbered 
   by red tape.  Besides, IDEAS HAVE NO BOUNDARIES (except in closed minds).
   One of the main purposes of RISKS is to disseminate ideas and awareness.

   My question to Herb (who is on leave from MIT, deeply embroiled in the 
   legislative process) was sort of a bemused wonderment as to whether the
   proposed legislation had in any way been influenced by the existence of 
   the RISKS Forum, since some of the goals are quite similar...  PGN]

Peter, I am sorely troubled by the prospect of our Congress providing
'oversight' or whatever it is they do down there to our industry.  Even
in areas where they have a clear mission and even one might expect
some expertise, the attention span of the Congress is measured in
Microseconds between headlines.  You will recall that last year, the
Congress created and then jumped on the bandwagon of war on drugs.  To
my local knowledge, there has been no *action* in that war since.  [I
do recall the House passing a bill calling for some $400 Million to be
spent on that war, but was saved from any notion of accountability by
the Gramm-Rudman act or some such.] I really do worry about the
grandstanding that such a commission would engender, and the
sycophantic interaction between the congresspeople and an uniformed,
shoot-from-the-hip press.  Really a bad idea.
                                                  Cheers, Jim

     [I noted in my comments that there are many pitfalls in the proposed
     legislation.  But, an implication of what you say is very depressing:
     the difficulties of government are so great that meaningful oversight
     is almost impossible anyway.  The fox shouldn't watch the chickens;
     the chickens can't watch the chickens; even the computers can't
     be trusted to watch the chickens.  So what do we do -- throw out 
     the chickens with the egg water?  PGN]

Last year two radar-equipped planes that had been promised to Customs were
given to the Coast Guard instead as a result of late-night Senate actions 
on the federal budget.  Customs Commissioner William von Raab then promised
Coast Guard Commandant Paul A Yost Jr. that Customs would provide $8M in
reparations to help the CG's airborne drug interdiction problem.  But Senator
Dennis DeConcini (D-AZ) told von Raab not to transfer the money, and to wait
for the appropriations process instead.  The Coast Guard decided to act on its
own.  Somehow acquiring Customs' computer account numbers, they simply caused
$8M to be transferred from the Customs account to the CG account.  To make a
long story short, there were protests from Customs, and just as mysteriously
as the money disappeared, it reappeared (although in two increments).

      [I adapted this from the Washington Post National Weekly, 18 May 87,
      p.34, thanks to Michael Melliar-Smith.  Perhaps the HACKER was really
      a Coast Guard CUTTER (or was he a CONS CAR'd CDR (LISPing to starboard?)

At Project Athena for some time we've been trying to convince our
vendors that if they hope to sell personal workstations worth $2K or
more to students they are going to have to include in the physical
design a top-to-bottom hole that penetrates the major box covers and
the mother board, suitable for dropping a bicycle lock through, so
that the machine can be chained to a dorm-room or apartment radiator,
or a desk in an office.  The reaction so far has been uproarious
laughter (and several reports of newly-designed compact workstations
stolen from one of the vendors).

Some years ago, the Ariande column in New Scientist proposed a novel and,
as usual (?), unworkable (??) bomb 'detector'. You zap your 'bomb' with
radiation of a flavour selectively absorbed by Mercury (but not otherwise
strong enough to hurt.) The Mercury gets a little agitated by this and, if
it happens to be part of Fulminate of Mercury, an explosion occurs.
So, you just march your passengers and their luggage, one at a time, down
a bomb-proof tunnel and if they DON't go boom, let them on board. Even if

  "SNAFU ENDS HAPPILY AT UCF AS STUDENTS GET EVERY CLASS THEY WANTED"
  by Laura Ost, The Orlando Sentinal, Saturday, May 9, 1987, Page D-3

[Reproduced with permission]

     Thanks to a computer snafu, a nightmare for University of Central 
Florida students has turned into a dream.

     UCF's new computer system failed to cut off pre-registration for 
summer classes as they filled.  The happy result for students who often 
wait years to take required courses: They got everything they wanted.

     At first, the glitch meant that 56 courses overflowed, and 700 of 
8,000 spring students who pre-registered were in danger of being tossed 
out of classes they planned on.

     But after discovering the problem April 24, officials decided there 
was only one answer: Give them what they want.

     "From the student standpoint, it turned out splendiferous," UCF 
spokesman Dean McFall said Friday.

     The solution was to add more than 40 class sections in education, 
engineering, and arts and sciences, and to extend employment of part-
time and nine-month faculty members who want summer work.

     The worst case was a speech course required for students without 
community college degrees.  More than 300 signed up for three sections 
with a total capacity of 84.  So, eight sections were added.

     The expanded schedule is a big relief for students; some courses 
have had long waiting lists, meaning that students often had to delay 
required freshman courses until their senior year.  Solving the 
registration problems wiped out the backlog.

     "It showed us the full market for those courses," said Charlie 
Micarelli, vice president for undergraduate studies.  "For the first 
time we could see the number of courses needed.  It was kind of 
overwhelming... So there's nothing bad that doesn't bring out some 
good."

     This was UCF's first use of the new computer system and the 
software that operates it.  The software was developed by the Florida 
Board of Regents technical staff, which uses UCF as a testing ground for 
the state university system.

     The malfunctioning software was repaired in time for regular 
registration Wednesday, officials said.  Classes began Thursday.

     Provost Richard Astro said the expanded summer schedule won't cost 
extra because it eliminates the need for some classes next academic 
year.  He said the university usually has enough regular staff members 
to cover summer classes.

     "What you don't want to do is put an ad in the paper and say, 
'Anybody who can teach, come on in'," Astro said.  "Basically what we're 
saying [to regular staff] is 'Hey, do you want to work this summer?'"

A few days ago on our university UNIX system (4.3BSD), a friend of mine
received the message reprinted below. Very briefly, someone seems to
have cracked the passwords in the "passwd" file and sent a piece of
warning mail to all the users whose password he cracked.  Note that my
friend's password was a dictionary word, while mine (uncracked) was a
proper name beginning with a capital letter.

&gt; To: xxxxxx
&gt; Subject: A matter of security..
&gt; 
&gt; Your password:  zzzzzzz [correctly stated]
&gt; 
&gt; As an experiment, and something of an unofficial public service, I
&gt; have been experimenting with a password breaking program that was
&gt; recently released into the public domain. Since anyone can use this
&gt; program now, I thought I'd run it on violet's password file to see
&gt; which passwords could be broken. Yours was one of them. If you're
&gt; security conscious, or just don't like the idea of your password
&gt; being so easily broken, then I would advise that you change it to
&gt; a word not found in the english dictionary, or use a combination of
&gt; upper and lower case letters. Either of these methods will render
&gt; your password fairly invulnerable to attack..

Subject:  Software Reliability book

     Software Reliability: Measurement, Prediction, Application,
by J. Musa, A. Iannino and K. Okumoto (McGraw-Hill Book Co., NY, 1987),
is now available.  I cannot contain my enthusiasm for this well-organized,
thoughtful, thought-provoking, well-written, [accolades]* book.  A sample
from 7.4.3 Measuring Ultrahigh Reliability, Case Study 7.1 on Nuclear
Power computer-based monitoring system:
	...we are 95 percent certain that at least ... 3 more (failures)
	will occur at some time.  The ... failure intensity in 0.895/1000 yr
	(of computer operation) using the logarithmic Poisson model.
Yes, that's less than one software failure per millenium of operation.

The point is that these three AT&amp;T Bell researchers have an excellent
collection of methods for measuring and predicting software reliability,
and have made these techniques easily accessable in this supurb book.

                       Senators Nunn and Lautenberg copies of OUR RISKS

No.  I work on the House side, rather than the Senate.  I have
suggested various points of contact in the House to people on software
related issues, though.

In response to another question, In general, I would not have qualms
about showing a hard copy of RISKS to anyone, since it is a public
forum.  In fact, I would bet that Lautenberg probably has access to
RISKS himself if he wants it, since he owns a large DP company.

     Senate people -- particularly at the staff level -- might actually
     speak with one another now and then...  PGN]

Given that the RISKS digest is distributed to hundreds, or even thousands of 
people on a computer network that is funded, for the most part, with public 
funds, I think contributors should consider their messages to be public.  
Certainly, the messages sent on RISKS can be monitored secretly by government 
intelligence organizations; I would think that it would be less of a concern 
if those messages were monitored by Congress.

As for the prospect that RISKS submissions might appear in the Congressional 
Record, I would doubt it.  Quotes attributed to individuals must be documented,
and I would guess that the electronic medium does not provide sufficient proof 
of the authenticity of a message.  This is just a guess from personal 
experience; I sent a letter to Proxmire's office last year on computers and 
Star Wars, and I was asked a week later to send a SECOND letter giving them
permission to use my letter in congressional testimony.

I've always assumed that "someone up there" [in DC] was probably reading
everything we share on ALL the journals on ARPANET and its cousins [DDN,
EDU, COM, etc.].  I think that's a fair condition of use of a resource
that's funded by public taxes.

Indeed, I've often HOPED that Washington [and other] government leaders
in each branch, especially in several agencies of the Executive branch,
read some of these journals - and then thought about what they've read.

I think Ted Lee's concern is common enough; I know I've often rewritten
submissions, trying to "walk on eggs" to share a truth [as I see it] that
others [including perhaps my colleagues in DoD] may find unpleasant.
That's why so many of my notes end with a caveat: "The opinions herein
are mine alone, and may not be shared by any other person or organization, 
real or imaginary."

The other side of this concern is that often some frustration shows through in 
submissions to RISKS [and Arms-D, et al]; because the writers have tried to 
share some knowledge or wisdom, and have been ignored.  So, just when we think 
we're only "among friends" is the very time that "big brother" decides to 
pay attention.  Murphy predicted that.  I've often said that "The ears have 
walls, and the walls have ears."

In issue 4.83 of RISKS, JPAnderson@DOCKMASTER.ARPA wrote

&gt; ... an uniformed, shoot-from-the-hip press.
         ^^^^^^^^^

This got by the (usually good) editorial pen of the moderator.  I assume that 
the intended word was 'uninformed'.  I was long into the next sentence before 
I realized that I had a parsing problem.  While 'uniformed' is a word, I don't 
really know what a 'uniformed press' would be.  

The hint I used to correct my misunderstanding of this phrase was a
pronunciation clue.  If the author had intended to write "uniformed", he
probably would have written 'a uniformed ... press' rather than 'an
...'.  At least, that's how a Canadian (me) would say it.

Now how would you teach a spelling checker that?           Michael

    [Not Canadian, but California English? -- "(me) would say it",
    "him and her are going", etc.  I won't press the point -- or
    any uniforms, either -- because I know the press is not uniform.  PGN]

In response to Ted Lee and Jim Anderson, I think it is inevitable that the
government will sooner or later promulgate regulations for our industry; it
is the basic nature of governments to do so.  The more important questions 
are which branch(es) of government, what kind of regulations, etc.  
Personally, I'd rather see an open body such as Congress writing the rules, 
rather than some alphabet soup department (IRS, NSA, FBI) that would be much 
harder to fight.  Congress at least listens to all sorts of inputs, including
individuals, companies, PACs, and expert testimony. An agency generally writes
rules to suit its own ends, and has lots of ways to discourage inputs that 
serve other interests.

There are some potentially useful things government *could* do for us, such 
as making net hacking and unauthorized disclosure of personal files criminal 
offenses or making liability limitations reasonable and predictable.  We also 
need friends to help control the (mis)use of computers by government agencies, 
particularly in the area of law enforcement.  Left to their own, I'm certain 
that some enforcement types would love to create a big-brother situation by 
creating huge databases with no controls on their access.  The only body which 
can realistically offer protection against such abuses is a more powerful 
government agency, such as Congress.

If this forum can be used as a vehicle to enlighten our lawmakers, even to
the minimal extent of making them aware of that the issues exist, I am all in 
favor of sending each congressperson a gift subscription to every issue.  When 
topics like computer privacy and liability become the issue of the day (and 
they will, probably through some scandal or major screw-up), those of us 
outside of government will need all of the connections and communications 
channels we can find to make ourselves heard.

Regarding Mark Becker on summer course registration at U. of Central Florida:

When I was attending the same institution (it was then Florida Technological 
U)  about ten years ago, the first night of registration one quarter turned 
into a fiasco because it took *MINUTES* for the computer system to process 
each registration form.  As it turned out, their new registration software 
had been brought on line without any live testing whatever.

The killer was that the program had been developed using an ordinary job 
control card with relatively low priority.  Nobody thought to bump the 
priority level up when it came time to run live students (thousands of us) 
through the system, so the program was still running as a background task.  
To make matters worse, it turned out that the accounting department was 
running a massive batch job at that time of the evening, and they *HAD* 
thought to give their job the highest system priority they could get.

From: Jerome H. Saltzer &lt;Saltzer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU&gt;  

Unless I missed something, the SALT offset doesn't help against
the attack this guy was hit with.  It just slows things down, but not
enough to make it infeasible.  The attack consists of taking a copy
of the system's one-way password encrypting program, and a
dictionary, list of popular first names, list of names of rock
groups, or whatever, and encrypting every string in the list, using
the SALT of the first user.  Then you do it again for the second
user.  Etc.  Depending on the consciousness level of the
installation, you typically discover anywhere from 10% to 90% of the
passwords that way.  We run the program on our staff occasionally,
just to keep them on their toes.

These days, if you have a MicroVAX II available -- or a VAX 8600 -- and one 
of the better DES implementations, you can check out an astonishing number 
of BSD UNIX possibilities overnight. 
						Jerry

    [The problem is that the SALT for each user is implicitly available
    to the attacker, so that individualized attacks are still possible --
    although the system-wide dictionary attack is no longer available. 
    The conclusion is that this approach is not really worth its SALT.
    For those of you new to this one, dig up the paper "UNIX Password 
    Security: A Case History", by Bob Morris and Ken Thompson, CACM,
    November 1979, vol 22, no 11, pp. 594-597.  PGN]

Before this starts a flurry of speculation about whether or not the UNIX
password encryption is secure or not... I seriously doubt that this person
has actually *cracked* the algorithm.  If you examine the code, you will
see how truly difficult that would be, since much of the information you
need is discarded and not present in the encrypted result.

	&gt; As an experiment, and something of an unofficial public service, I
	&gt; have been experimenting with a password breaking program that was
	&gt; recently released into the public domain...

This sounds very much like a program I wrote a few years ago to check
for "stupid" passwords on our machines.  My program simply made some
educated guesses on passwords - first name forwards, backwards,
capitalized, not capitalized... last name the same way... login name
the same way.  In all a total of 12 guesses per account.  In one
night's processing time on our Gould PN9080, I got about 480/10,000
a real word.  [...]

At University of Toronto, where I used to work, we convinced our terminal 
vendor to supply us with special terminals for public terminal clusters.  
These terminals had bolts, built into the base, that were intended to bolt 
through the terminal table.  Once attached, the bolts could not be removed 
with standard tools.  Neither could the terminal be opened to remove the 
bolts that way.  It helped, although I gather there were still some terminals 
that walked away.  I think that, at least in some cases, the table went too.  
After all, it was a nice terminal table!

This incident (and many others) represents one excellent reason why some
systems are best left 'low-tech'.  Headlights can burn out, electrical
systems fail, batteries die, alternators short, switches malfunction,
and so forth.  Adding a computer into the chain only adds another item
which can possibly fail WITHOUT providing any greater reliability in the
process; in perfect working order it is STILL prone to previous faults
PLUS the possibility of hardware/software/RFI/etc. failures.

During my recent vacation in Washington, DC, I got a chance to look at
a couple of documents that I haven't seen discussed in RISKS:

  1) APS PHYSICS AND SOCIETY, vol. 16, no. 2, April 1987, pp. 8-9:
  "SDI Software: The Telephone Analogy. Part II: The Software Will
  Not Be Reliable," K. Dahlke, et al.

  This is a piece co-signed by 16 members of the Bell Labs staff.

    On December 3, 1985, Sol Buchsbaum, executive vice president of
    AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, testified before the Senate Subcommittee on
    Strategic and Theater Nuclear Forces. In his statement, Dr. Buchsbaum
    compared the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to the United States
    telephone network, in order to demonstrate the technical viability of
    SDI. We feel this comparison is irreparably flawed. ... Many of us
    design the very telecommunications systems Dr. Buchsbaum references.

  The same issue reprints Buchsbaum's testimony and has two articles on
  inexpensive countermeasures to space-based weapons systems.

  2) "Report to The American Physical Society of the Study Group on Science
  and Technology of DIRECTED ENERGY WEAPONS," April 1987, to be published
  in REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS. 400+ pp.

   The APS convened this Study Group to evaluate the status of the science
   and technology of directed energy weapons (DEW). ... This action by
   the APS was motivated by the divergence of views within the scientific
   community in the wake of President Reagan's speech on March 23, 1983
   in which he called on the U.S. scientific community to develop a system
   that ``... could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles
   before they reach our soil...''.

   The APS charged the Study Group to produce an unclassified report,
   which would provide the membership of the Society, other scientists
   and engineers, as well as a wider interested audience, with basic
   technological information about DEW.*

  The study group consisted of 17 blue-ribbon physicists chaired by
  N. Bloembergen of Harvard University. The review committee consisted
  of G. Pake, M. May, W. K. Panofsky, A. Schawlow, C. Townes, and H. York.
  Their principal finding is that

    Although substantial progress has been made in many technologies
    of DEW over the last two decades, the Study Group finds significant
    gaps in the scientific and engineering understanding of many issues
    associated with the development of these technologies. Successful
    resolution of these issues is critical for the extrapolation to
    performance levels that would be required in an effective ballistic
    missile defense system. At present, there is insufficient information
    to decide whether the required extrapolations can or cannot be
    achieved. Most crucial elements required for a DEW system need
    improvements of several orders of magnitude. Because the elements
    are inter-related, the improvements must be achieved in a mutually
    consistent manner. We estimate that even in the best of circumstances,
    a decade or more of intesive research would be required to provide
    the technical knowledge needed for an informed decision about the
    potential effectiveness and survivability of directed energy weapon
    systems. In addition, the important issues of overall system
    integration and effectiveness depend critically upon
    infomation, that, to our knowledge, does not yet exist.

  They go on to say that

    We estimate that all existing candidates for directed energy weapons
    require two or more orders of magnitude (powers of 10) improvments in
    power output and beam quality before they may be seriously considered
    for application in ballistic missile defense systems. In addition,
    many supporting technologies such as space power, beam control
    and delivery, sensing, tracking, and discrimination need similar
    improvements over current performance levels before DEWs could be
    considered for use against ballistic missiles.

  The part most relevant to RISKS is Appendix A: Issues in Systems
  Integration, which raises issues frequently mentioned on RISKS, e.g.

    Decentralization may increase the problems of command and control,
    while more centralized organization may entail increased vulnerability.

* A personal footnote: I think that ACM has failed in its obligations to
its members and to society by not chartering an analogous study of the
computing technology needed for ballistic missile defense. It's very
late to start one now, but perhaps this is a case of ``better late than
never?''

Source: "New Breed of Hustler: Selling Illicit Long-Distance Phone Calls",
by Robert D. McFadden, New York Times, 11 May 87.

A new multimillion-dollar scam is underway in this country.  Hustlers
at bus and rail terminals and other convenient places all over the
U.S. are selling unlimited-length long-distance telephone calls at a
discount.  The going rate at the New York's Port Authority Bus
Terminal is $2 for calls anywhere in the country, and maybe $4 for
international calls.  The entrepeneur places your call with a calling
code from telephone company computers and distributed like drugs
through various networks, human and/or electronic.  The ``stealing''
of codes is apparently quite widespread.

There were 190 arrests in New York last year.  $500 million is the
current estimate of illegal calls per year.  With AT&amp;T, MCI, Sprint,
and others all using just a sequence of digits for identification,
this can be expected to grow.  (Perhaps British Telecom's PhoneCard
is the right idea, if it can be made mostly fraud-proof.)

In 4.84 Wm Brown III seems to have inferred (and implied) that my
comment about the propriety (or expectations) of sharing RISKS with
Congress said something about my views on the proposed legislation.  Not
true:  I'm constantly torn between the view that Congress (as well as
the press) knows nothing about any quasi-technical issue and the view
that they are about the only institution we have to save us from
ourselves; in this case I haven't formed an opinion (not that it would
matter much to anyone.)

  &gt; There are some potentially useful things government *could* do for us, ...
  &gt; The only body which can realistically offer protection against such abuses 
  &gt; is a more powerful government agency, such as Congress.

No chain is stronger than its weakest link.  Because far too many senators
and congressmen lead lives that they wish to keep private, such as Gary Hart, 
powerful investigative agencies, such as the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, were 
able to control important congressional leaders.

   governmental leaders is vital to the proposed Commission, it is included

&gt;
&gt;Given that the RISKS digest is distributed to hundreds, or even thousands ...

People on the ARPAnet side may not realize how extensive that distribution
is. RISKS is gatewayed to a Usenet newsgroup (formerly mod.risks, now
comp.risks). Brian Reid's monthly newsgroup statistics estimate for
as of April 1987 there were 7,100 people who actually read RISKS on
the Usenet side alone.

As to whether RISKS is a public forum, the same statistics estimate
that 859,000 people have access to Usenet, and 180,000 of those
actually read netnews.  You can draw your own conclusions.

Your correspondence about the need for a physical lock on students
motherboards was recirculated on INFO-COBOL, presumably as part of the
uproarous laughter.  This is just to say how much I agree that some
such feature is necessary, and to add to your sadness that such
mundane matters as the circumstances of real life are not taken
seriously by designers.  Tell them to go look at how televisions are
often modified by visual-aids resource centres in colleges.  Pat Hayes

I am confused.  Why would Customs propose to provide $8M to the Coast
Guard when they had already "donated" their two planes?  Somehow the
actions of the Coast Guard would be more believable if Customs had
received the planes.

Is this an abstract risk?    Paul

   [Relations were bad after the planes were reassigned from Customs to CG.
   During a subsequent thaw in the bad relations that ensued, Customs 
   promised CG $8M to help the CG's airborne drug interdiction program.
   DeConcini said don't do it.  CG took the money out of Customs' narcotics
   traffickers operating account.  

   Sorry.  I should have been more explicitive-deleted.  PGN]

The Wall Street Journal (18 May 87) has a Page-One article about one Robert
Post, a 35 year old former ATM repairman who has beaten New York City ATM's
out of $86,000.  He'd spy over customer's shoulders to get their PIN, and if
they left the receipt he'd take it to get their account number.  Then he'd
go home and forge a card using a $1,800 machine he bought, and return to the
ATM and make withdrawals.

He was caught because his encoding of the account number and the PIN, while
good enough to work in the machine, was flawed.  Manufacturers Hanover
managed to program its network to detect the flawed cards and capture them.
After capturing two and verifying that they were fake, they reprogrammed the
machine to notify security when one was being used, and dispatched guards to
catch Mr. Post.

Mr. Post, who repaid $50,000 to Manufacturers Hanover, had expected to get
off with a hand slap.  So far that hasn't happened.  He contrasts himself
favorably with someone who mugs a customer and steals the card.  "I'm a
white collar criminal."  He was dismayed that bank officials didn't offer
him a consulting job.

Today's Wall Street Journal (5/18/87) has this front-page item:

US Guided Missile Frigate hit by Iraqi missile, probably Exocet, in Gulf.

[Hearsay report from CBS Newsradio says the Phalanx close-in defense gun,
which the Boston Globe reports the class carries, is (for safety reasons)
turned on only when in free-fire zones--i.e., the fully-automatic computer
controlled weapon is not considered safe enough to tell when the ship is
under surprise attack (probably a good idea), but isn't used to inform the
crew when it needs to be enabled..]

From the Boston Globe, May 16, 1987:

  Boulder, Colo. - Computer whiz Stephen Wozniak has donated $100,000
  for a University of Colorado scholarship aimed at developing
  excellence in computer hackers at his alma mater.  "The value of
  cracking security codes and understanding them is that it generates
  incredible knowledge," said Wozniak, one of the original hackers
  and co-founder of Apple Computer Inc.  Wozniak said he actually
  encourages the "mildly social deviants" to break access and security
  codes as a way to learn, The Denver Post reported.  The "Woz"
  scholarship program is two-fold; a tuition grant and a job working
  with the computer science department.

Martin Minow         

P.S.  One of the beauties of the English language is that you don't 
know whether Wozniak is encouraging (mildly (social deviants)) or 
((mildly social) deviants).

     [I was struck by "incredible knowledge."  Woz probably did not mean
     "knowledge of the incredible", but if the knowledge is incredible,
     there is the nice ambiguity between "so extraordinary as to seem 
     impossible" (particularly if true) and "unbelievable" (particularly
     if NOT true).  PGN]

Long Ago (Risks 4:66), Dave Taylor wrote
&gt;   Overcoming Information Overload with Technology (Why It Can't Work)
&gt; I'm especially interested in horror stories people could tell me about
&gt; relying on information filtering systems and finding that they actually
&gt; weeded out critical information...

This strikes me as not quite the right tack to be taking (although
I haven't read the full paper).   Certainly it's worthwhile to
gather "horror stories", for the purpose of improving information
filters, and making people aware of their limitations, but it
doesn't seem valid to conclude that "It Can't Work".

Everyone uses some information filter; this is pretty much tautological,
since there is much more information available in the world than anyone not
otherwise idle can possibly keep up with.  So we limit our intake with
techniques like

 - Choosing to ignore broad classes of information ("I don't have time to
   follow AI-list anymore" "Please drop me from...")
 - Never reading any article whose title doesn't immediately "grab the eye"
 - &gt;Haphazard&lt; filtering, caused by just reading whatever one happens to have 
   time to read.  This month I get around to reading RISKS, but don't have time
   for NL-KR.  Maybe next month if NL-KR shows up first, it'll be vice-versa.

Now all these filtering techniques (especially the last!) have in common a
relatively large risk of missing important stuff.  None of them is very
sophisticated, or very likely to work very well.  I would be *quite*
surprised if it turned out that computers (much less "technology") could not
make the process work better.  Certainly there will be horror stories about
the use of the technology, but (if we had a way to collect them), I suspect
there'd be even more about filtering *without* the technology...

This is the usual sort of meta-risk.  Certainly using computers to do X
won't work all the time, and we'll be exposed to risks; but doing X without
the computers is at least as risky!

The real attacks to be worried about are not password attacks.  As
administrator of the Unix security mailing list I see all the latest holes
(three easy steps to root, etc.).  Some of the holes are truly frightening.
Once a hacker has access to a system (as guest, whatever) he need not spend
much time trying to work out someone else's password -- might as well go
straight to root.

System administrators are also welcome to join the USML; to cut down the
number of invalid requests to join I ask that you send mail to me as root;
further validation is done after that.  (I apologize for the amount of red-tape
but the explicit nature of the information discussed demands some protection.)

              [Since it is so easy to dig the root, I wonder how many bogus
              requests you will get!  Like a pig rooting for troubles?  PGN]

Here at DU we have the terminals bolted to long conference tables -- rather
hard to walk out with.  Far better, though, is that each unit is engraved
and painted with large "DU"s on each component in highly visible locations.
Makes them very hard to fence.  (Sure, you can use the innards, but then again
you could engrave the boards...)

I haven't heard of any terminals or PC's walking out since this was done.

	I've been working part time on a case study of password usage
on MIT's undergraduate machines.  The fast password transform that is
currently available was developed by myself and improved with the help
of several people at other research centers.  It turns out that the
SALTing that prevents the use of DES chips can be implemented by five
instructions in each round of the DES F function.
	The case study should be available by the end of the summer,
but I would like to point out one risk that arises when a person
chooses a first name for a password.  This is an example of the
principle of guilt-by-statistical-coincidence.
	I tried a dictionary of 2000 first names against all 4100
accounts.  The program uncovered the passwords for seven percent of
the accounts.  This took 6 hours on a VAX/8600 and it was helped by
the fact that the 4100 accounts only use 1735 different SALT values.
	Moving into the domain of sociology, I examined whether people
chose names of the same or opposite sex.  I found that 80% of the
users chose passwords of the opposite sex.  An additional 7% chose a
variant of their own first names.  The remaining 13% had picked names 
of the same sex.
	The coincidence is that the student group, Gays At MIT, claims
that 10-15% of the undergraduates are homosexual.  The conclusion one
could draw is that anyone with a same-sex password is either narcissic
or gay.  Anyone who uses an opposite-sex password is heterosexual, and
if it is not the name of their current significant other they are having
an affair.  Send the police if they pick their mother's or father's name.  
Perhaps this could persuade people not to use names as passwords.
                                                                  --Bob

       [This message has some interesting background on risks of passwords,
       but the statistical conclusions are almost as accurate as this:
           About 25% of all people are males living in the East.
           About 25% of all people are females living in the West.  Therefore,
           most males living in the East are females living in the West. 
       But not quite.  

       At any rate, I hope the message is getting through that passwords
       can be relatively easy to break.  For a REALLY BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTION
       of a horrendous implementation flaw in a well-known system (which
       is not named), see an article by Bill Young and John McHugh (Coding
       for a Believable Specification to Implementation Mapping), on pp. 
       141-142 of the Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Security and
       Privacy, April 1987.  The bug has presumably been fixed everywhere
       by now, but it permitted an easily constructed overly long password 
       to fake out the encrypt-and-compare algorithm.  I have known about
       this one for years, and am delighted to finally see it in print.  
       PLEASE dig up this article.  It is well worth reading.  PGN]

DIGITAL REVIEW, 18 May 1987, p. 72 [although the page is unnumbered]

  ... databases inherently carry a high risk of error.  Information can
  be altered or partially deleted through inadvertent mistakes or deliberate
  manipulation.  Abstracts of data can be misinterpreted, especially when
  taken out of context.  Failuer to update a database periodicaly can result
  in the dissemination of incorrect information about a company or an
  individual.  And hardware and software malfunctions can compound all these
  problems.
  
  Here are a few examples of the havoc an erroneous computer search can cause:
  
  * A computer analysis of several thousand New York welfare recipients found
  that more than 20 percent were working.  On the surface, this seemed like a
  violation of state law.  But a second check disclosed that more than half of
  those individuals had been authorized to work while receiving welfare
  benefits.  Apparently their files had not been updated.
  
  * A Dallas executive traveling on business in New Orleans was stopped by
  police for a minor traffic infraction.  When the computer wrongly flagged him
  as an escaped convict, he was arrested and jailed.  It took a week to
  correct the error.
  
  * A New York electronics manufacturer, ready to close on a $2 million  
  contract, was taken aback when the banks refused to give him the needed
  loans.  It turned out that a financial check had mistakenly shown his
  company to be bankrupt.
  
The article discusses the Supreme Court ruling on Dun &amp; Bradstreet vs. 
Greenmoss Builders, in which D&amp;B had falsely reported that GB was broke.
The Supreme Court upheld the Vermont decision against D&amp;B.  The article
goes on to consider some other legal issues.

  This means that information vendors can no longer use the following 
  rationales to wriggle out of paying for their errors:

    Free speech umbrella.  Although data vendors have a First Amendment right
  to free speech, they also have an obligation to ensure that the information
  they research and disseminate is accurate.

    Public interest argument.  The courts have long acknowledged that everyone
  has a right to comment on matters of public concern.  But they also have 
  noted that information on the private finances of companies and
  individuals, unless they seek the limelight, is not of public interest.

    "Chilling effect" standard.  The need for a free exchange of ideas demands
  that we occasionally tolerate the foibles of the press, as long as there
  is no malice.  The media have argued that to do otherwise would have a 
  "chilling effect" on reporting.  The courts, however, have not extended
  this argument to data vendors.

    Public domain argument.  It is quite well known that government agencies
  engage in periodic fishing expeditions, matching data and peeking through
  giant data banks to ferret out criminal activity.  But private data
  vendors don't have the government's license to snoop.  In fact, they must
  comply with state and federal privacy laws when conducting such searches,
  and if they err, they are accountable.

This is from the Design International column of MACHINE DESIGN of 3/26.

An electric chair designed to help prevent car theft has been teamed with an
electronic alarm and tested by a leading Swedish insurance company, Skandia of
Stockholm. Built-in electric cables are activated after the alarm has sounded 
four times. The shock transmitted to the person in the driver's seat is about
9kV at an inductive current of 65uA. Although unpleasant, the shock is not
harmful even to people suffering from heart ailments, according to the company.

I've never seen anything like this appear in either Risks or comp.society,
so I'm sending this along to both.

An editorial in The (Portland) Oregonian:

OPENNESS RESISTS CHIPPING

Oregon is inching toward truly interactive local government.  The Gresham
City Council has voted to supply its members with computer terminals in
their homes, to enable them to do research in the city's system at any
time.

Providing unpaid elected officials with the tools to do their job better
is easily worth the $6,000 appropriated for this purpose.  But in a state
with a strong Open Meetings Law and Open Records Law, does technology now
require an Open Electronic Impulses Law?

The Gresham computer system, like many others, permits users to send
messages to other users.  Anyone with a modicum of conspiracy theory can
easily imagine a quorum of the City Council logged on to their computers
together, busily conducting city business beyond the prying eyes of those
without user codes.

Gresham officials realize the risks involved.  Even if city residents
cannot gain access to the system, the information in it still belongs to
them.  And since a private conference call among a council quorum is
illegal, a computer caucus would equally constitute an access violation.

"What goes in is something we're concerned about, and I will probably
advise them to be conservative," says City Attorney Tom Sponsler.  "For
council members to communicate, with a quorum, on how they feel about
policy is not appropriate, and I will so advise them."

Sponsler thinks there is a greater potential for violations of the Open
Records Law than the Open Meetings Law.  "Anything of any substance," he
advises, "should not exist only online."  Members should also remember, as
Lt. Col. Oliver North could remind them, that anything put into a system
can later be pulled out of the system.

City Manager Wally Douthwaite expects that before the system goes on line,
Gresham will need a written policy on its use.  The need for clarification
may not stop there.

"There may be a time when computer use will be so universal that we will
need to take another look at the law," says Oregon Attorney General Dave
Frohnmayer.  "The Open Meetings Law was not designed for this technology."

The rules, Frohnmayer and Sponsler agree, should be clear.  Providing
information by computer is fine; debating and negotiating electronically
slips into silicon secrecy.

If the legal principle is clear, the technology should be able to follow.
All that is needed by Gresham - and the cities that will doubtless follow
its example - is a package of Open Meeting Software.

And people who understand its importance.

***[end of editorial]

I spoke to the reporter who covered the story, and he said it was an
email system, not an interactive conferencing system.  He thought they'd
be using a VAX 220 (?), and didn't know which operating system.

If the defense weapons were not reliable enough to keep on all of the time,
that should tell us all a lot about the chances for Star Wars to succeed (as
if we didn't know already!)

      [There is a serious lesson about perpetual readiness when nothing ever 
      seems to be happening.  Too often there appears to be no urgent need to 
      worry  about some particular event, because it has never happened 
      before.  Someone on board was quoted as saying exactly that -- no one 
      had ever fired anything directly at them before, and therefore it seemed 
      quite reasonable to expect that this time was no different.  Crying
      "wolf" is bad, but not recognizing the wolf (in sheik's clothing?) is 
      even worse.)  Sorry if I repeat myself on this subject, but this is a

Following the recent discussion on password (in)security, here is a simple
way of choosing a fairly safe password which I believe is attributable to
Steve Bourne (ex Bell Labs). Find any handy document (there's usually
something near most VDUs) and point your finger randomly at the text. Select
the nearest word (or words if they are short) and substitute one or two of
the letters for some other character. E.g. a `0' for an `o'. This should
reduce the risk of your password being decrypted. You also have the benefit
that you can easily select a new password as often as you like.

Jonathan Bowen, Oxford University Computing Laboratory, England.

    [Because this is not a deterministic algorithm, it has some merit.  
    However, you must remember that passwords are still vulnerable to various
    attacks.  In some operating systems and in most local networks, it is 
    easy to capture a password in transit.  In that case, it does not much 
    matter how cute you are in generating passwords.  A second point is 
    that as soon as you let people generate their own passwords, someone 
    will want a nice simple easily guessable one, ignoring the problem that 
    his/her operating system does not do a very good job of preventing 
    someone masquerading as that user from climbing through other people's
    files, implanting Trojan horses, deleting files, etc.  It is very
    antisocial of anyone to have such a weak password, or to rely on
    passwords that can be easily captured.  Simplistic thinking is the real
    source of trouble.  Even the policy that everything should be wide
    open (no secrets) does not protect you against getting clobbered by
    file deletions and Trojan horses.

    So, let's avoid fine-tuning essentially weak approaches and remember 
    the big picture.  Then I will stop reiterating...  PGN]

  &gt; Here at DU we have the terminals bolted to ...  tables ... .
  &gt; Far better, though, is that each unit is engraved and painted
  &gt; with large "DU"s on each component in highly visible locations.
  &gt; Makes them very hard to fence.

Interesting ... we seem to be concerned with different risks.  I always
assumed that terminals were stolen from public terminal areas in
universities by individuals who wanted a home terminal.  It never occured to
me that someone would seriously consider 'fencing' such a thing.  PCs,
perhaps.  I guess the general population might know what to do with such
things.  But terminals?

Under my set of assumptions, a large logo would merely enhance the value of
the treasure.  In fact, at UofT, we lost a few terminals to start-of-year
initiation rights.  One terminal made it's way to another university in the
area as part of a scavenger hunt (I expect they got extra points for distance).

Does anyone have any statistics on where the real risks are here?

Nuclear Plant Emergency Plan: In Event of Quake, Smash Toilets
United Press International

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., May 14 -- Among the earthquake emergency plans at the
TVA's Sequoyah Nuclear Plant is one to break all the toilets with a
sledgehammer and cover the plumbing holes with duct tape to seal off nuclear
leaks.  According to The Chattanooga Times, TVA nuclear engineers decided in
1984 that an earthquake could cause water in toilets to spill or drain out,
destroying the "water seal" in the pipes.

At the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, being built near Spring City, Tenn.,
plumbing that would not rely on a water seal was installed. But at the
Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, where nuclear reactors were operating at the time,
the hammer-and-duct-tape plan was adopted.  Both reactors at Sequoyah have
been shut down for 21 months because of safety and other regulatory
violations at the Soddy-Daisy plant.  The hammer and tape are stored in a
locked wooden box outside the Sequoyah control room.

"Personally, I don't think the big hammer is a big issue," Sequoyah shift
engineer Jeffrey Lewis said. "That cabinet has been there for years and we
haven't used an inch of duct tape."  Clerk Sue Hartman works near the box
where the hammer is stored.  She said the key to the box is "kept under
surveillance at all times."  In fact, the key to the key to the cabinet
where the hammer box key is stored is "kept on my body," Hartman said.

The Phalanx is just a radar controlled machine gun which fires 3000
(20 mm? nearly one inch in diameter) depleted uranium slugs per minute
at anything which moves. Would you keep it on all the time? No one
(but you) said it wasn't reliable. 

What does appear to be wrong is that there was only one, to cover the
stern of the ship. The bow was not protected by a Phalanx system and
that is where the (two?) Exocet missiles hit. 

Then again, we should realize that frigates such as this one are intended
mostly for anti-submarine/mine work; although it did have surface to air
missiles which could have been used to take out the aircraft which fired the
Exocets, frigates are not really expected to provide their own air defense.
And this one was operating under the assumption that Iraq aircraft were
friendly, so it did not shoot down the aircraft when it could have.

     [Perhaps the object was to shoot down the missiles?  Was 
     that the Star Wars analogy to which Chuck was referring?  
     Also, there was a report that there might have been TWO
     planes.  (One missile landed undetonated amidship!)  PGN]

or a park or at a theatre?  Do they prevent telephone calls?  If not, why
should they prevent electronic mail conversations?

I think that most people would agree that UN*X is not a secure system, nor
is it intended to be.  However, a judicious choice of password can
discourage amateur or half-hearted attacks on your account. Several methods
have been proposed for choosing hard to break passwords; my favorite is
simply to use the first letter of each word of some phrase, e.g., 'The rain
in Spain falls mainly in the plain' becomes TriSfmitp.  This has the
advantages that it is not likely to appear in any dictionary, it is very
mnemonic and if the password is long enough and rich enough in case, it will
stand up to a sustained exhaustive search.

There is another risk that I haven't seen mentioned: the use of .rhosts
files (at least it's a risk in the BSD world, I've never been in the System
V world).  Around here, quite a few people have .rhosts entries for several
machines, often including at least one Sun.  Couple this with the fact that,
given physical access, anyone can become root on a Sun and you've got
widespread vulnerability without the need for any password attack.

A series of mysterious deaths in which industrial robots suddenly attacked
and killed humans is being investigated in Japan, news reports said
yesterday.  Ten people have been killed by robots in the last eight years.
In four cases, operating errors were blamed.  In the other accidents, the
robots suddenly started working for unexplained reasons, according to
reports.  Witnesses listed a number of cases in which the robot suddenly
stretched out its mechanical arms, killing its victim.  Experts plan to test
a theory that electromagnetic waves in factories have been responsible for
setting off the sensitive computer mechanisms in the robots.

SF Chronicle 22 May 87, from Deutsche Presse-Agentur.

         [We had previously documented the 1981 Kawasaki case, and noted
         reports of at least four more (and possibly as many as 19) 
         robot-related deaths.  If we have any readers in the far East who
         can tell us what is really happening, please ...  PGN]

The San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit had an unexplained power failure on
17 May 1987, unprecedented in their 15-year history.  17 switches (which act
like breakers and shut off power when a short circuit or overload occurs)
kicked open in the rush to get runners to the Bay-to-Breakers race (no pun
intended), with still no cause having been identified.  A train stalled in a
tunnel beneath 7th Street in Oakland, and 150 passengers had to walk for 20
minutes to get out.  Engineers were unable to restore power in the
computer-controlled system.  5 hours later the switches suddenly closed
again, just as mysteriously as they had opened.

I received a message questioning my apparent coyness in not divulging the
name of a system that had a reported serious flaw.  In general I always try
to opt for openness, except when I am explicitly not at liberty to divulge
something.  In the case of the master password bug, it was found long ago in
UNIX Version 6 by some colleagues who never disclosed it.  The published
version that just appeared, and to which I referred, chose not to associate
the name of the system with the story.  Here are the details.

[Following is my own adaptation of Young and McHugh's presentation, with

The design was more or less sound sound (apart from the intrinsic password

implementation was seriously flawed by the absence of bounds checking.

On page 9 of the SF Chron, 23 May 87, there is a small item on the Speaker
of the Iranian Parliament.  He claimed that the Iranians electronically
countermanded the missiles (an Exocet [which did not explode] and the other
still unidentified missile, possibly an AS-30 laser-guided missile) AWAY
FROM one of their tankers.  If that is true, would the Iraqis have realized
what happened? (Were any countermeasure devices included in the arms sales
to the Iranis?)

Reports persist (with an official denial) that computer systems on the Stark
had not been working, and that they were waiting for spare parts.
Investigation continues.

  &gt;What does appear to be wrong is that there was only one, to cover the
  &gt;stern of the ship. The bow was not protected by a Phalanx system and
  &gt;that is where the (two?) Exocet missiles hit. 

   The standard configuration on guided missile carriers (I regret to say
that I have not seen a frigate with the things yet), is to have one port,
one starboard, about 2/3 of the way from the stern.  This way, the bow
is well protected.  The Phalanx is a very short-range system, which is to
be used only if everything else fails and the long-range defenses are
penetrated.  The system was not designed to be rapidly armed.  It is expected
that the long-range defenses will be able to hold off fire until the
Phalanx is available.

  &gt;... frigates are not really expected to provide their own air defense.
  &gt;And this one was operating under the assumption that Iraq aircraft were
  &gt;friendly, so it did not shoot down the aircraft when it could have.

    If you shoot at friendly aircraft, they will cease to be friendly.
If you don't shoot them, you have to trust them.  And sometimes trust is
not always justified.  The risks involved here are not if you can trust
your own systems, but if you can trust your allies' systems.

&gt; If the defense weapons were not reliable enough to keep on all of the time...

There are actually a couple of issues here.  One is the question of wear and
tear on continuously-operating mechanical hardware (the Phalanx radar is
mechanically scanned, I believe).  More significantly, though, *any* such
defensive system has some small probability of shooting down a friendly
aircraft.  Note that this problem is *not* restricted to automated systems!
Experienced combat pilots tend to consider "friendly" gunners to be almost as
big a threat as "hostile" ones, with good reason.  "Own goal" hits are common 
in real fighting; there were several in the Falklands War, on both sides.

One reason for having different levels of alert is simply to minimize the
chances of shooting down the wrong thing at a time when there is little real
danger.  The problem is particularly touchy when operating in a known war zone
with the intent of remaining uninvolved.

The following appeared on page 48 of the May 18, 1987 issue of Insight
magazine.  It seems relevant to many issues discussed recently.

			Credit Report Access

Car loans, mortgages and credit card applications are approved based on
information found in an individual's credit history, but most consumers have
never seen their computerized credit profile.  Now consumers can get the
same easy access to their credit report that banks and other lenders have
had for years.

TRW Inc., one of the nation's largest credit reporting agencies with files
on some 140 million people, is launching Credentials, the first credit and
financial information service sold directly to consumers.  For an annual fee
of $35, a member gets unlimited access to the credit report supplied to
lenders, notification when any lender reads the file and a credit
application that is kept on file and can be electronically sent to lenders
with the member's consent.

More than 250,000 became members last year during a pilot program in
California.  The service is now expanding nationwide.

"Credentials offers consumers greater control over their credit profiles
by ensuring their accuracy." says Mel Wellerstein, a vice president at TRW.
"Furthermore, with full knowledge of their credit history, consumers are
less likely to be taken advantage of or be intimidated by lenders."

    From: parnas%QUCIS.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu
    Subject: Open meeting laws (RISKS 4.87)

    Do open meeting laws prevent public representatives from
    conversing in a bar or a park or at a theatre?  Do they
    prevent telephone calls?  If not, why should they prevent
    electronic mail conversations?         Dave

I'm the chair of the Cambridge Human Rights Commission, a local agency that
is covered by the Massachusetts open meeting law.  That law applies to
deliberate meetings of a quorum of members for the purpose of taking actions, 
or discussing actions that the board or commission might take.  Any such
meetings must be public and announced in advance, minutes must be taken, etc.

With such a law, a phone call or meeting in a bar is okay, so long as
there's not a quorum present, or if the meeting was by chance, or serves a
social function (rather than the discussion of business).

On the other hand, a computer conferencing system or e-mail, like a
conference telephone call or meeting in a bar, is not okay if used for
discussions and negotiations among the members of the commission or board,
at least not if a quorum of members participate.  So the legal advice given
by the Gresham City Attorney seems sound to me, assuming the Oregon law is
similar to ours.

Roughly speaking, it might be okay to use e-mail or computer conferencing
the way you'd use a postal (USPS) mailing list:  to send out information
unidirectionally.  But using it for two-way, back-and-forth interaction is
using it as a substitute for a meeting, and that's precisely what's
disallowed, because the public doesn't have access.  (Even if the computer
system were open to the public, you'd be on shaky ground, because most
people don't own modems or know how to use e-mail.  They'd have as much
"access" as if the meeting were held a thousand miles away.)

From a techno standpoint, that's too bad; computer conferencing has some
advantages over meetings (among them, potentially, the existence of a
written record).  But it's good public policy.  As it is, people have
difficulty understanding and participating in their government; apathy,
bureaucracy, bad public transportation, and the grinding difficulty of
9-to-5 existence are among the culprits.  Let's not add computers to the
list until we have systems that are truly accessible to lay people from all
walks of life.
                                -Jonathan Handel

PS:  I'm not an attorney, so my reasoning is certainly far from definitive.
Also, I don't have a copy of the Mass. law in front of me, so this is based
on my best recollections.  And of course, open meeting laws vary by state,
so the issues will vary by state as well.

                 [Bruce Baker wondered how I could have avoided making a pun
                 on Gresham's Law in <A HREF="/Risks/4.88.html">RISKS-4.88</A>.  I thought this issue was
                 more like Gresham Slaw, carrying Coles to New Facile.  In
                 this case, the bad votes drive out the good?  PGN]

did not read that memo should look read it. Be sure to note that
operators of electronic communication systems now have legal
responsibilities for the privacy of data. 


MEMORANDUM

To:         The MIT Community
From:       James D.Bruce, Vice President for Information Systems
Re:         The Electronic Communications Privacy Act

	The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 was enacted by
the United States Congress in October of last year to protect the
privacy of users of wire and electronic communications.

	Legal counsel has advised MIT that its computer network and the
files stored on its computers are covered by the law's provisions.
Specifically, individuals who access electronic files without
appropriate authorization could find themselves subject to criminal
penalties under this new law.

	At this time, we can only make broad generalizations about the
impact of the Act on MIT's computing environment.  Its actual scope
will develop as federal actions are brought against individuals who
are charged with inappropriate access to electronic mail and other
electronic files.

	It is clear, however, that under the Act, an individual who,
without authorization, accesses an electronic mail queue is liable and
may be subject to a fine of $5,000 and up to six months in prison, if
charged and convicted.  Penalties are higher if the objective is
malicious destruction or damage of information, or private gain.

	The law also bars unauthorized disclosure of information within an
electronic mail system by the provider of the service.  This bars MIT
(and other providers) from disclosing information from an individual's
electronic data files without authorization from the individual.

	MIT students and staff should be aware that it is against
Institute policy and federal law to access the private files of others
without authorization.  MIT employees should also note that they are
personally liable under the Act if they exceed their authorization to
access electronic files.

  From: Peter G. Neumann &lt;Neumann at CSL.SRI.COM&gt;
  ...  He claimed that the Iranians electronically countermanded the missiles
  (an Exocet [which did not explode] and the other still unidentified missile,
  possibly an AS-30 laser-guided missile) AWAY FROM one of their tankers.

Other messages have also referred to laser-guided missiles.  [They] require
a laser to designate the target, which the missile then homes in on, by
seeking the reflected laser light.  That means that there must be a laser
actively illuminating the target at all times while the missile is seeking.

If the airplane carrying the missile goes away or drops out of line of
sight, it can't illuminate the target.

  [This discussion at the moment is labelled SPECULATION with respect to the
  Stark investigation in progress.  But one question is, how easily can a 
  missile such as the laser-guided AS-30 be faked out?  What happens under 
  cloud cover?  Does the missile go inertial for a while if it loses the 
  target, in hopes of reacquiring the target?  Can it get confused by decoys,
  light chaff, fireworks, or whatever?  Is the Iranian countermeasure claim
  plausible?  Remember, there were two missiles (the exploded one suspected
  NOT to be an Exocet?), and if one was electronic and the other laser guided,
  the countermeasure theory seems less likely.  Although I presume analogous
  arguments hold for electronic countermeasures on electronically guided
  missiles, the mechanisms might be different...  In any case, the risks of
  hitting something other than the desired target seem to be nontrivial. PGN]

FURTHER RESPONSE FROM HERB:

The AS-30 is indeed a laser guided missile, but it too requires an
independent laser designator.  If no Iranian airplane or boat was in sight
of the ship, no target designation would take place.  You must have a line
of sight to the target.              [Rafsanjani reportedly said that there 
                                     had been an Iranian tanker in range.  PGN]

The AS-30 is described as having two guidance components -- inertial
reference for the initial phase, and laser homing for the terminal
phase.  If anything intervenes between the laser beam and the target,
most likely the missile will lock its home-on track, and be lost.

OTTAWA - Two federal public servants who used a government computer for
their own purposes have been ordered to pay the government $1,270 for misuse
of high technology.  The environment department billed Michel Grenier and
Gaston Boisvert, two Montreal-based computer systems workers, for tying up a
government computer for almost an hour in August 1986.  Grenier, with the
permission of his supervisor Boisvert, used the computer for 57 minutes to
develop a personal program.

Perhaps this is an old problem; it occurred to me a couple of days ago.
It seems that there is more and more litigation initiated by people who
feel that they have been wronged by someone else's malice, negligence, or
deep pockets (ahem).  Someone out there already sued Lotus, right?

What happens when an "expert system" is involved?  Who gets the blame?
The programmer, who designed the system, or the expert(s) who supposedly
provided the rules that direct the system?  Can you imagine the stream of
expert witnesses giving their debugging of the problem?  Of course, if the
debugger was faulty....

Another source of fault might be the non-maintenance of an expert system.
For example, a new edition of the Physician's Desk Reference is published
every year.  The new information should be added to the expert system, or
else it will get out of date (and lack information on new drugs and newly
discovered side-effects and interactions).  If the expert system was
designed in such a way that maintenance was difficult, then the designer
might share some blame, too.

Just thought I'd ask.  It sounds like a great opportunity for finger-pointing.

When I got the MIT notice from the SECURITY list, I did a little digging
in the law books (Purdue's library is a Federal Depository).

I pulled out a copy of the Act (Public Law 99-508, H.R. 4952) and a copy
of Title 18 of the United States Code, which it amends.  From this
(after a couple of hours of "strike words a through f, insert words g
through m" -- I'd hate to be a law clerk), I extracted most of the
"interesting" parts of the law.

These parts pertain to administrators and users of electronic
communications services (if your machine has electronic mail or bboards,
it fits into this category).  The parts I specifically went for were
what we can and cannot do, what the punishment is if we do it, and what
our means of recourse are if it's done to us.  I left out all the stuff
about government agents being able to requisition things and stuff,
and all the stuff pertaining to radio and satellite communications.

So anyway, I typed all this stuff in to give it to our staff so they'd be
aware of the new legislation.  Since there is probably interest in this, I
am making the document availble for anonymous ftp from the host
intrepid.ecn.purdue.edu.  Grab the file "pub/PrivacyAct.troff" if you have
troff (it looks better), or "pub/PrivacyAct.output" if you need a
pre-formatted copy.  Bear in mind I'm not a lawyer, and I just typed in the
parts of the law I deemed to be of interest to our staff.

[Background: sci.crypt is intended to discuss cryptography issues.
 Recently, it has been discussing automatic teller machines, the
 security of personal id numbers, and how cards are invalidated after
 successive incorrect input of the user's "secret code."  This article
 branches out a bit, and might be of interest to Risks readers.

The determination on invalidation is done at the host.  If the programmer wants
to invalidate the card on three attempts, well, then the programmer has to
put a flag on the data record for the card.  An example: Bank Of America (who
I used to work 4) simply sends a report to the branch where your account is
and the branch personel decide whether to flag your card, or just call you
and ask what the h**l is going on.

Trivia:  The Diabold and IBM ATMs (diabolds have CRTs with 4 unmarked buttons,
IBMs say IBM on them, if not they have the cash sort of flop out of a slot and
have an open/closed sign on them) are ...wait for it... 3270 devices!  They]
actually have PF keys and the whole nine yards built-in.

Usual chain of activity in an ATM:

1) The interaction with the user, screens, etc. is done by some sort of
controller, a Series/1-type (read: VERY STUPID) machine which controls 
a whole set of ATMs.  The controller normally resides at some central location
and communicates with the ATMs over leased lines.

2) When you do a transaction, the controller tries to queue up a set of
transactions from its other ATMs.  It will either succeed or timeout. In
either case, the transactions are communicated to a 37X5 and from there
to a mainframe which runs a batch job to do the transaction.

3) Most banks cannot update the account base in real-time, so the ATM
processor (the mainframe doing the batch run, not the ATM itself) works
from a database containing last nights data corrected with todays transactions.
The transaction you actually do is simply made a memo posting and is
entered into the actual accounts system as if it were a teller withdrawl/deposit
with a note saying it was from an ATM.

MORE TRIVIA: The PIN is not a timing issue (in most systems).  Its just that
the whole transaction is usually sent to the mainframe, and that is slow going.

EVEN MORE TRIVIA: Have you ever been cheated out of money by an ATM?  If you
were it was most likely an IBM.  Go to your branch and report it, and they
(after you fill out the usual form) will credit your account.  Save the ATM
receipt, as they normally ask for it.  The IBM machines steal like theives,
and normally (like in socks in dryers) the money has simply vanished.  Diabold
ATMs miscount once in a blue moon, AND if you do a transaction that asks for
more money than is the the ATM (they dont keep track in most cases), it will
give you what it has and debit your account for only that much.

STILL MORE TRIVIA: Dont deposit cash unless it is to a Diabold ATM.  Diabold
ATMs check the deposit envelope to see if there is anything in it.  IBMs dont.
The deposit box is opened by two branch officers, and they (normally) wont
swipe cash from a Diabold, since it would be hard to claim an empty envelope.
However, an IBM machine...

(someone should really write a book on this subject)

I have submitted the following to comp.dcom.telecom, but thought it may also be
of interest to RISKS as indicating how advances in communication technology 
pose a risk to society by facilitating the conduct of criminal activity.

  &gt; In a recent article dmt@ptsfa.UUCP (Dave Turner) writes:
  &gt; 
  &gt; The following is from an editorial by Wayne Green in the June, 1987 issue
  &gt; of 73 Amateur Radio magazine:
  &gt; 
  &gt; The recent legislation making cellular phone calls illegal to listen in on
  &gt; has provided a bonanza for both organized and disorganized crime. It's
  &gt; difficult not to laugh over the situation the cellular industry has gotten
  &gt; itself into in its blind pursuit of the fast buck.
  &gt;
  &gt; What's happened is a mass move into cellular by criminals. They buy a
  &gt; cellular system, have an unscrupulous dealer alter the electronic serial
  &gt; number (ESN) on the built-in programmable IC, which makes calls both
  &gt; untraceable and free--a great combo. They tool around town, making calls
  &gt; to Pakistan, Columbia, and their Caribbean drug warehouses at will.

	I have a few comments to make on this and some related topics which
may be of interest to Net readers.  My comments are based upon personal
knowledge and experience as one who has provided some forensic science
consulting services to certain law enforcement agencies for a number of years. 

	It's sort of interesting to note that it was even easier to implement
spoofing fraud in dial IMTS mobile telephone installations, but such fraud
has been virtually unheard of.  The reasons for this are: much fewer IMTS
channels and much fewer IMTS customers than cellular make such fraud extremely
conspicuous; most IMTS installations are combined with MTS installations and
have a high probability of telephone company (or RCC) operator monitoring.
	My personal opinion is that cellular fraud has been encouraged due to
"safety in numbers". :-)

  &gt; Cellular has turned out to be great for coordinating every kind of criminal
  &gt; activity. It's just what criminals have been needing for years-- a
  &gt; dependable, free, untraceable, and safe communications system. With a
  &gt; combination of pagers and cellular phones, crooks are making a shambles
  &gt; of the cellular system--all protected by Congress.
  &gt; 
  &gt; If you wanted to deal in drugs, how better to get orders from your
  &gt; customers than by giving them your cellular phone number? There's no way
  &gt; to tap a telephone that can be anywhere in a big city, operating through
  &gt; different cells as it moves around. And with an altered ESN it's all free!

	Progress in telecommunications has unquestionably been of benefit to
criminal activity.
	Probably the single greatest benefit has been the introduction of call
forwarding.  This service has been of such great benefit to the conduct of
unlawful gambling, narcotics and prostitution operations that for many years
I have jokingly referred to it as: "1A Criminal Facilitation Service"; AT&amp;T
and BOC people may appreciate the satire in this remark.
	As an example, an unlawful gambling operation could change location
every day or so, with the telephone number for bettors being the same.  This
situation also neatly defeats any court-authorized eavesdropping warrant since
there would never be conversations on the telephone pair that was the subject
of such a wiretap; a forwarded call never takes place on the physical line
whose number was dialed.  In earlier No. 1 and No 1A ESS installations there
was no rapid method to determine to what number a given line had its calls
forwarded; such determination could only be made by an experienced switchman
using the ESS maintenance tty.  This rather frustrated law enforcement
agencies in their investigation of unlawful gambling and narcotics activity.
Furthermore, I know of some instances where telephone company personnel flatly
denied to law enforcement investigators that they could determine the
forwarded telephone number; this was, of course, a false statement, but was
made in a  misguided effort to keep the telephone company "uninvolved".
	As an interesting aside, prior to the advent of ESS and call
forwarding, some larger unlawful gambling operations used an electronic device
called a "cheese box" that effected a rudimentary kind of call forwarding in a
manner similar to a loop-around test line.  Two telephone lines would be
ordered for say, an unoccupied office or apartment, and each line would
connect to the "cheese box".  The actual location of the gambling operation
would call the first line, and remain on the line and wait for calls; the
"customers" would call the second line, with the result that it would
auto-answer and be connected to the first line.
	Telephone company loop-around test lines were used for the conduct of
unlawful narcotics dealing during the 1970's, but this practice has generally
disappeared as telephone companies: (1) installed 60A control units or
equivalent devices that dropped loop-around connections upon the detection
of speech energy (legitimate use of loop-around test lines is for single
frequency transmission measurements only); and (2) went ESS and therefore had
"call trace" capability that would automatically determine the origin of
calls to loop-around and other test lines.
	After call forwarding, the next most useful communications adjunct to
criminal activity is the voice radio pager.  It is an unfortunate fact of life
that no self-respecting prostitute or "street dealer" of narcotics would be
caught without their voice pager.  Voice pagers represent an ideal, inexpensive
method of arranging clandestine meetings.  A typical voice pager scenario:
customer calls narcotics dealer's pager from a coin telephone, giving coin
telephone number; narcotics dealer finds coin telephone to call coin telephone
where customer is waiting to arrange for a meeting.  What could be simpler
and more untraceable?
	In my travels, I have known of only two instances where criminals used
any speech privacy devices (speech scramblers) to defeat eavesdropping (lawful
of otherwise); however, I suspect that a new generation of low-cost digital
speech privacy devices will result in more of these devices being used by
criminals.  The units that I have seen used were all based upon analog
"speech inversion" techniques; these devices are easy to defeat, whereas the
digital devices are virtually impossible to compromise by other than NSA.
	One of the most novel (at the time) applications of communications
technology by criminals that I have personally seen was the use of
telecopiers by a large unlawful gambling operation about 11 years ago.
While the law enforcement agencies involved had obtained eavesdropping
warrants to install wiretaps on some of the telephone lines involved, they
were totally baffled by the strange sounds heard during some intercepted
calls.  I was called in to solve the mystery, and some listening told me
that this was an FSK facsimile machine running in 6-minute mode.  So we
borrowed a telecopier to decode the tapes; this was not as easy as first
anticipated.  I finally had to modify the telecopier to start in receive
mode without receiving a ringing signal (which was not possible from an
after-the-fact tape recording).  We got some pretty damning evidence, much
to the consternation of the criminals (who suspected a wiretap, but felt
that the facsimile machine was "secure").  While telecopiers are rather
common today, such was not the case 11 years ago.  I suspect that as
telecopiers decrease in price, they too will be more commonly used by
criminals.  While Group I and Group II facsimile machines are fairly easy
to monitor, the more common Group III (sub-minute) machines are much more
complex since they are digital and require faking a handshake protocol by
any receiving machine used as a monitor.

&gt; If it weren't against the law to listen to cellular channels, I'd suggest we
&gt; hams help the law by listening for suspicious cellular calls and recording
&gt; them. Say, how'd you like to get the goods on some serious crooks and find
&gt; (a) the evidence is inadmissible because it was illegally attained and (b)
&gt; yourself on trial for making the recordings. So join me in a big laugh, okay?

	I know of law enforcement agencies that have in the past used scanners
to listen to paging service channels and IMTS mobile telephone channels, and
have obtained useful intelligence information.  None of the information so
derived was used in court per se, but it may have contributed to the "probable
cause" for looking in a certain _public_ place at a certain time.  When any
investigator was pressed in court for the "basis of probable cause", the
information was attributed to an "anonymous informant" - a VERY common source
of law enforcement information.  Under the circumstances, I see nothing wrong
with this - but I am certain that a number of people will disagree with me.
	For example, an experienced investigator can readily detect a drug
deal going on via certain types of pager messages.  Now, if a police cruiser
just happened to be going by the aforesaid location, and decided it was time
for a routine traffic check... :-)

as gambling, narcotics and prostitution should be directed to /dev/null]

CHIPS ARE DOWN OVER ELECTRONIC POLLUTION  (The Guardian, 26 May 1987)

Japan is engulfed in an "electronic smog" which has caused deaths and injuries,
and jammed an airport radar system, according to recent findings.

Electronic smog occurs when electromagnetic waves from equipment like personal
computers and electronic game machines "escape" and trigger other machines.  An
electromagnetic wave can also be caused by a mere spark.  An electric spark
from a crane operating in a valve plant set off a lathe-operating robot in
1982 killing an assembly-line worker.

A simple household device like a television aerial booster can have dire
consequences.  Osaka International Airport's radar screens were jammed by
electromagnetic waves from a nearby television aerial booster.  The fault
and its cause were discovered.  But the Ministry of post and
Telecommunications (MPT), which has set up a group to investigate the
problem, admits that an air crash could have occurred.

Forty-two people were injured last September when two cars on a
roller-coaster crashed.  The MPT suspects electromagnetic waves from an
unknown source were to blame.  It says that communications at a busy railway
switching point have been jammed by waves from television game machines.  Train
doors have inadvertently opened several times.  The MPT wants manufacturers to 
redesign their electronic goods so that the waves cannot escape.

  In Risks Digest 4.86, PGN comments on the over-long password, and the
article by Bill Young in IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, April 1987.
I agree that most of us do a bad job of mapping our specifications to our
implementations, and Bill does an excellect job of pointing out one way to
overcome this risk.
  However, I believe that the case Bill points out is but one case of a very
general problem that has been solved in a different manner, in a much less
risky way.  Specifically, the specification that was violated in the
implementation can be summarized as "A data area is overwritten by a method
that should have no access to that data area."  This over-writing problem is
quite general: it happens for arrays (such as when strings are implemented
as array of characters), for improperly based structures, and other places.
  The particular error cited by Bill Young could not have happened if the
implementation had been in a language such as PL/I or Ada, where
over-running the bounds of an array is a required run-time check (in the
cases where the compiler cannot determine at compile-time that the
assignment is not 100% safe) instead of in a language like C where all the
effort is on the programmer, and no help is given to her by the language.
Such checks are clearly not new technology, since Multics (written in PL/I)
has been doing such for over 20 years.  Nor is the technology new to
hardware, since the Burroughs B5500-series and MCP (written in Algol) has
also been checking for a similar period.
  One of the reasons for the reliability of Multics and MCP is that they do
NOT depend on perfect programmers, but use both the language run-time
(checking software descriptors) and hardware (segmentation, rings, ...)  to
check for common overwrite errors and other access violations.
  I would personally prefer to put my faith in a compiler generating
correct code and the run-time for the language checking descriptors properly 
than putting my faith in every coder of every array-reference in every
program, even where all such programs have been "proved" to be correct,
simply due to the sheer size and difficulty of such proofs, and the high
probabiliy of an error in the proof, or in the configuration-control
of different versions (one proved correct, a different one installed)
of the software, or some other error that makes the proof "non-valid".

  This leads to my question:
    What RISK do we bring on to ourselves (both personally and
professionally) when we ALLOW inapproprate technologies to be used
(or in many cases, forced by others) that thereforce create unreliable,
non-robust software, when both the hardware and software technology
to prevent many of the problems have existed long enough that every
reasonable person working in software should be aware of them.
[I know that many people today only study the things of the current
generation, done simply and incorrectly for simple systems,
and don't understand much else, but that's another question.]

    While watching the Indianapolis 500 on TV this Sunday, I saw them do a
feature on one of the car crews that were using a celluar phone to talk to
the driver on the track.  You see, most crews use some sort of CB or
shortwave set to talk between the pit and the driver and the TV announcers
are always talking about what they overheard on the radios.  This one car
had a celluar phone and the crew would phone the driver to discuss things.
This seemed really strange to me until I realized that the use of the phone
meant that no one could legally listen in on their conversations.
    Everyday someone discovers a new way to use that law.

RISKS Readers who have a professional or personal interest in information
security on a practical level might be interested to learn that I have just
received my copy of the April 1987 Information Security Products and Services 
Catalogue, prepared by the National Security Agency.  There are no protective 
markings on the document, and (since they're VERY CLEAR when things *aren't* 
public-domain) I presume it is available on request by writing to

    Director, National Security Agency, 9800 Savage Road, 
    Fort George G. Meade MD 20755-6000

Anyway, it's in interesting compendium of companies who provide
communications and information systems security devices and services.
According to some accompanying document(s), "...this catalogue will be
distributed quarterly to [organizations] who received [certain lists]
previously...  Plans are under way to request that they be provided through
the Government Printing Office on a subscription basis."

The document is in 5 parts and lists companies and equipments thus:

	(1)  Endorsed Cryptographic Products List
	(2)  NSA Endorsed Data Encryption Standard (DES) Products List
	(3)  Protected Services List
	(4)  Evaluated Products List
	(5)  Preferred Products List

Also included is a brief, but informative, description of categories of
information which requires security, information about purchase and restric-
tions on the purchase of these devices and services.

Happy hunting!   Kurt F. Sauer, Director of Operations, Decision Studies Group,

The current issue of Forbes also reports on this new so-called service.
Forbes points out that TRW is required by law to provide a copy of one's
credit record for free any time credit is denied because of a credit report,
and for a nominal reproduction fee at any other time.  They express
incredulity that people seem willing to pay $35 for what they could already
get for free.  In addition, TRW encourages the Credentials customers to add
extra information voluntarily to their credit records under the dubious
theory that this will help them to get credit in the future.  People seem to
think that because their info is in TRW's computer it will be more credible.*

An article by Molly Moore of the Washington Post appeared in the SF
Chronicle, 26 May 1987, pp. 13 and 14.  It adds lots more details on the
Stark and its equipment.  The computers were programmed to give a LOUD alarm
that the missiles had been launched, even when NOT in the mode to fire the
Phalanx automatically.  Perhaps the radar scans only in the direction that
the Phalanx was pointing?  (We have already noted reports that the computers
were not even working at the time, although there is also a denial by the
Captain.)  On the other hand, the fact that the use of computers in this
context for automatic firing of the Phalanx is deemed unsafe is of great
interest to RISKS.  Reliance on continual preparedness in the defensive use
of unreliable systems with unprepared personnel seems quite risky.

Regarding the recent USS Stark incident, much has been written about the
Phalanx anti-missile system mounted on the ship.   Generally, Pentagon
spokespeople--parrotted by the news media and net posters--have stated some
variation of the following:

"If only {choose one or more of the following}:

	A) the Phalanx had been switched to "automatic"
	B) the ship's stern, where the Phalanx is mounted, had been pointing
           toward the incoming missile(s)
	C) the crew had been alert/warned in time to properly use the Phalanx
	D) the Phalanx had been operating properly (crew allegations of
           assorted Phalanx malfunctions/down time/maintenance problems)

then the Phalanx would have easily blown the incoming missile(s) away and we
would all live happily ever after."

This universal faith in the Phalanx is a dangerous belief that I take exception
to.  Contrary to the way the Navy and the media talks, Phalanx is a very new
weapon that has NEVER been used in combat conditions.  

History tells us that military hardware testing conditions and combat "real
world" conditions probably don't even lie in the same universes.  US military
hardware testing, driven by profit motives and military career advancement, is
particularly atrocious.  Everything I've ever discovered about this situation
leads me to believe that to get a good idea of how a weapon will really
perform, the best strategy is to utterly IGNORE test results.

The things that the "military-industrial complex" (MIC) (why is that a taboo
term these days?--Eisenhower coined it) will do to test a weapon are truly
bizarre.  Drones (moving at the breakneck speed of 60 mph, without evasive
action) have been painted with gloss red enamel to absorb more laser energy,
to "prove" that lasers can shoot down planes.  Gigantic aluminum foil
bull's-eyes have been arranged on the ground so that the Pershing II's radar
could find its target.  Over 160 mobility tests of the M1 tank resulting in
the tank's breakdown were thrown out as "invalid", while the single test in
which the tank didn't break down was presented as the final result.  Every
single test of the GLCM cruise missile has been altered to cover up grossly
unacceptable navigational errors.

Most of the Phalanx testing data I'm aware of shows excellent results,
usually on the order of 80% of incoming targets hit.  But as I've stated
before, that may mean nothing at all.  One problem in the Phalanx testing
the MIC doesn't like to talk about is that even if the incoming missile is
hit, the hit takes place so close to the ship that the ship is still blasted
by the missile's wreckage.  The Phalanx's MAXIMUM range is only about 1.5
miles, and most anti-ship missiles cover that distance in just a few
seconds.  This problem becomes worrisome when you consider that of the four
Exocets that hit British ships off the Falklands, THREE were duds, including
the one that hit the HMS Sheffield.  But the devastation caused by a dud
missile was still severe enough to wreck or sink the ships hit.  Even
without an exploding warhead, an anti-ship missile is a large, heavy object
travelling at high speed carrying fuel tanks at least partially filled with
various formulas of highly volatile rocket fuel.  The force of the missile
mass times its velocity is transferred as heat to the ship, resulting in the
possibility of a devastating fire--the greatest danger to modern warships.
Even if an incoming missile is exploded by the Phalanx, most of the
missile's mass will still strike the ship.  The mass will, of course, be
dispersed by the explosion--the amount depending on how close to the ship
the missile was when the missile exploded--and the velocity will be reduced
as well.  Hopefully this will be enough to save the ship, but even so a ship
peppered by high speed flaming debris may be out of action for some time.

Also, remember that the Exocet is a fairly old design as anti-ship missiles go.
Most of the newer designs are faster, have better guidance, and might not be
duds.  The new Soviet SS-N-22 supposedly almost hides behind wavetops while
travelling at better than double the Exocet's speed.

The Phalanx's gun--a 20mm gatling--is an excellent, proven weapon that has
performed extremely well in real world plane-to-plane combat.  But
plane-to-plane combat is a different environment than ship-to-missile
combat.  I've never heard of a pilot shooting down a missile coming at his
plane with a 20mm gatling, or with any other weapon for that matter.  Years
ago, the US Army had a weapon called the "Chapparal", which was a 20mm
gatling mounted on an armored personnel carrier.  Admittedly, there weren't
many opportunities to try it out against enemy air, but it died a quiet
death.  I know some Army commanders complained about its short range and
high ammunition consumption.

This Phalanx faith also makes me worry about the AEGIS cruiser idea.  The
AEGIS is crammed with all kinds of anti-air and anti-missile stuff,
including multiple Phalanx systems, and nearly everybody thinks of it as
being able to instantly produce an inpenetrable shield.  But I can't help
thinking about an interview with the Second Fleet commander a couple of
years ago.  He said if a real war broke out, he'd send all his AEGIS
cruisers home.  He contented that its high-powered radar, tracking, ECM, and
weapons control electronics puts out such a blatant electromagnetic
signature that it would attract every Soviet plane, ship, and sub within
hundreds of miles.  Sort of like a bug light that attracts so many bugs that
despite its excess power, it can't kill the bugs fast enough and it clogs
and shorts out.

So let's not get carried away by the Phalanx.  It wasn't supposed to be a
perfect missile defense system, but the MIC has to justify all that expense.
It's probably useful as a last-ditch emergency measure, but thinking of it
as a missile umbrella leads to a "crutch mentality" that neglects more
useful missile defenses like air cover, anti-AIRCRAFT weapons, electronic
countermeasures/chaff, and evasive action.

American commentators have the curious notion that, when English-speaking
soldiers die, it must be explained as a result of human errors, but when
their foreign speaking counterparts go the ultimate way of soldiers, it is
considered a victory.  Compare the newsmedia coverage of the Sheffield and
Stark incidents with the Libya and Grenada ones.

It looks to me, that the only risk involved is one of messing with guys
packing Exocets, and ramifications depend on what language you speak.

The technical discussion in this newsgroup has barely mentioned that
Exocets are smart missiles with an unusually high rate of 'success', as
seen from the launching end.  Which translates to an equally high
rate of 'failure' as seen from the targets.

So a technical discussion on the failure of the ships' defenses must
logically be followed by a discussion on why the second missile arrived
without exploding.  Rather atypical for Exocets.  Usually they do.
Computer failure?

Seems to me that the laser guided technology is about the same as the wire
guided technology of the Arab-Israeli War.  Wire guided TOW missles could
be easily defeated by spraying the general direction of origin.  Many
Israeli tanks ended the war with lots of wires draped over them.

The only 'smart' way that weapons can work is by adding intelligence, but
that can even cause problems (Berserker SF series by Saberhagen, etc.)

It was mail to me that generated that erroneous mailer barf message that
told you it was going to keep trying for 178 million-odd more days...

Sorry about that... Our net-host 750 has a flaky clock, even though it keeps
getting parts replaced by maintenance, and in that instance it crashed
briefly and came up with a system time thirteen days in the future.  Since,
at the same time, our main user machine had been down and mail to it was
sitting in the queue on the 750, the mail process on the 750 thought it was
two weeks since they had been queued and so merrily generated a great spew
of garbage mailer messages. I still don't know what is causing them to have
that enormous number of days displayed. We get all sorts of strange numbers
showing up in that field...

Anyway, when I noticed this, we cut off outgoing mail and I did a mass
delete of all message traffic with a "Waiting mail" subject line.
Unfortunately, it appears some slipped out before we caught them. Sigh...

If you see any again, please ignore them. (Though I'm sure you don't need
any more junk mail like that cluttering up your inbox.)

Apple computer sells a thing called a "security kit" that permanently
attaches a steel shackle to a Macintosh and Keyboard. With a steel
cable passing through both shackles, and padlocked to a water pipe, it
makes the Macintosh hard to steal. (Good for students.)

I don't know whether this feature was preserved in the new Macintosh
SE and Macintosh II, nor what it costs. 

The security kit does not protect the mouse, which can be easily
unscrewed and walked off with, but it should help cut down thefts of
the whole machine. 

Many third party vendors sell kits to lock computers down. Most work by
permanently fastening a baseplate to the desk under the machine with a tough
adhesive. Apple's version at least will not ruin a student's dorm's desk.

Charles Osgood reported the following story on CBS Radio this morning:

Hundreds of cat owners in Chicago received a bill for five dollars
accompanied by a letter explaining that they were required to register
their dachshund.  Apparently the Cook county health department had
provided rabies shots for pets and kept a computerized list of animals
receiving shots.  Someone got the bright idea of matching this list against
the list of dogs licensed in Chicago to find dogs that received shots but
were not licensed.  Cats are not required to have licenses.

Unfortunately, the county uses the code "DHC" to represent "domestic house
cat", while the city of Chicago uses "DHC" to represent "dachshund",
resulting in computer generated form letters to the owners of the "DHCs".
After the mess was discovered, a city official said "I guess if we'd thought
about it, we would have wondered why there were so many dachshunds in Chicago."
(not an exact quote, I couldn't take notes when I heard the story.)

	In RISKS 4.91 and some previous digests, some attention is drawn to
the problems of equipment malfunctioning due to EMI. I spent my early career
years designing electronic control equipment which was applied in very
(electrically) noisy environments, such as steel mills and forge shops.
The equipment was used to control the electrode gap spacing on various
types of melting and refining furnaces, such as electric arc furnaces 
operating at 400 volts and 30,000 amperes. The early designs contained mostly
analog circuits, which were supplemented by the then new digital technology.
In one of these environments, where RF was used to melt artificial ruby for
growing laser crystals, a Simpson VOM would read without the leads connected
and oscilloscope use was impossible. We now have a new generation of designers
without practical experience in analog circuits, noise filtering, and
shielding techniques, who don't think of voltages and currents, but only
of zeros and ones. While I agree with the FCCs EMR regulations, they attack
the problem only from one side. We must urge designers to submit the
equipment to operational tests under reasonably expected EMR fields, as
the cranes and even common static electricity can never be eliminated. And
those of us who use EPROMS shouldn't forget that light (even the flashlight
of an unsuspecting service man) and X-rays are EMR. We may soon find the 
government forcing certification at the emissions-receiving end. And the
liability laws are such that you could have a hard time defending the use
of a single PROM in a critical application if an erasure caused by cosmic
radiation caused an accident.

And some day, I know, just the right EMI will come along and cause everyone's
digital watch alarms to sound at once, thus deafening us all.

You don't need any special equipment to do this.  I once accidentally put an
extra null modem (a receive/transmit channel swapper) between the VAX and the
Macintosh I was using as a terminal.  This meant the Macintosh was listening to
a wire that wasn't being driven at the other end.  With a normal terminal, this
wouldn't have done anything interesting, but Macintoshes have unusually 
sensitive receivers, and there was enough crosstalk in ~150 ft of twisted pair 
cable for me to get a complete (error-free!) transcript of everything going 
through that cable.  This happened to include somebody's password...

(Just thought I'd give the security-conscious people out there one more

In the past few days some of the Cash Station (*) ATMs in the Chicago area
have changed the format of the receipts they dish out.  The new style no
longer has the account number of the account used in the transaction.

The above was a statement, now I have a question.
Has anyone heard of the 'new' phone features 'Call blocking' and 'Call
tracing'?  Supposedly call blocking will not let your phone ring if call is
placed from a certain number ( number to be designated by you, from the
phone which you are at ) and call tracing traces a phone call after one
presses a certain key sequence ( on your phone ).  I've heard that these are
available in California and another area.  Is there truth in this?

The Public Facilities people at the University of Michigan Computing Center
use the Macintosh Security kit mentioned in Risks 4.91 to protect Macs
installed in public areas.  They modified it to protect the mouse too, and
now they find that people steal the tracking ball out of the bottom of the
mouse.  Someone jokingly suggested epoxying it into the mouse, but so far
they haven't resorted to that.

Perhaps I missed it, but I haven't seen anyone mention the kits for under
$40, sold by 3rd parties, that permanently attach to two or three parts of
your computer and attach to one another by a tough steel cable that can be
passed through a radiator (here in the East), wrapped through a hole in
immovable furniture, or attached to something immobile.

We bought my son's at ComputerLand, but they're available all over by now.

This morning's Boston Globe included an article on the Phalanx and Aegis
defense systems.  The analysis was that the Stark was out of luck, because
the Phalanx couldn't possibly have shot down the Exocet.  It was possible
that an Aegis system could have shot down the missile, but the article said
there had been only two even-close-to-meaningful tests and they weren't all
that impressive.  In the first, the Navy classified as "sea-skimming" any
missile that came in at an altitude of 100 feet or less above the waves.
This let them shoot down a missile at 100 feet, which is pretty irrelevant
when it comes to an Exocet at 10 feet.  The other test involved shooting down
an Exocet (at 10 feet above the waves) but with the Aegis system mounted on a
barge so that its radar was at approximately sea-level. The problem that both
tests successfully avoided was having to look down at the radar reflections 
off the wave tops.  The conclusion of the article was that in all likelihood 
the Aegis couldn't have distinguished an Exocet from the "sea clutter".

In RISKS 4.91 I read:
    ... the use of computers in this context for 
    automatic firing of the Phalanx is deemed unsafe ....

As I understand the situation, the problem in question is not
peculiar to computer technology: if you carry a handgun, you
do not keep it always ready to fire, except in the case you are
in a very dangerous situation, and then you accept much higher
risks of hurting somebody by accident. There is no such thing as
a safe weapon: one has always to decide which compromise between
security against enemies and safety from your own weapon is best
at the moment. The difference between Phalanx and revolvers is
not qualitative ("using Phalanx is unsafe").
Just for accuracy (and, I am not sure the previous poster had made
the mistake I thought I saw, but I thought saying this may be useful
anyway). Apart from this, discussing how good radars and computers
may be for telling friend from foe is certainly interesting.

I was on vacation when the Stark incident happened, and am just catching up.
Upon reading some accounts, I think inappropriate attention is being focused
on the Stark's defensive systems.  What concerns me more was the role of the
AWACS aircraft and the look-down radar it carries.  (I note American crews.)
It appears from accounts I have read that it was the maneuver of the plane
that gave away the launching of the missiles, not any radar returns from
the entire minute in missile flight.  I don't know the range, but it seems
the sea state was ideal for detecting low flying cruise missiles of this
type (easier than terrain), and should have given a full minute warning.
The failure of the USAF AWACS to report sooner might show flaws in the
integration of the C^3I of the region making "layered defense" a joke.  I
don't know the AWACS radar system (like frequency, range from target (The
F-1), etc.), and I hope that this aspect of the investigation is not lost to
Adm. Rogers.  I no longer work with radar.

The stuff on the net focusing on the lack of a "front" Phalanx
is probably a little misdirected.  These missiles come in from the side
(since the cross-section of a ship is larger and armored ships have less
side armor) and the system on the Stark is probably adequate for such
side protection.  If the Phalanx were in the front, and the missile
had hit more aft, there probably would have been outcry for protection
in the stern.  The readiness state was still the important thing in the end.

In the end, the title of the old WWII British movie sums up the role of
this type of ship: They Were Expendable.

Mike Trout writes:

&gt; But the devastation caused by a dud
&gt; missile was still severe enough to wreck or sink the ships hit.  Even
&gt; without an exploding warhead, an anti-ship missile is a large, heavy object
&gt; travelling at high speed carrying fuel tanks at least partially filled with
&gt; various formulas of highly volatile rocket fuel.  The force of the missile
&gt; mass times its velocity is transferred as heat to the ship, resulting in the
&gt; possibility of a devastating fire--the greatest danger to modern warships.

In fact, of course, the amount of energy transferred to the ship is
proportional to the missile's mass times the SQUARE of its speed.  Knowing
only how big an Exocet is and how much a V-2 weighed, I'll guess the weight
of the Exocet at 1/3 that of a car.  According to Newsweek, it moves at 500
mph.  So imagine being hit by a car going at 50 mph.  The missile would
deliver over 30 times that much energy from impact alone!

Unsafe does not imply unreliable. A loaded gun is unsafe to carry
around, but that does not mean it is unreliable in the sense of "will
it fire when I pull the trigger". The Phalanx shoots at anything that
it sees.  You wouldn't normally arm it unless you were in combat.

&gt;From: "Jon A. Tankersley" &lt;apctrc!zjat02@seismo.CSS.GOV&gt;
&gt;Seems to me that the laser guided technology is about the same as the wire
&gt;guided technology of the Arab-Israeli War.  Wire guided TOW missles could
&gt;be easily defeated by spraying the general direction of origin.  Many
&gt;Israeli tanks ended the war with lots of wires draped over them.

That works if the laser designator is operated by the launch crew.  One of
the advantages of laser guidance is that the designator can be operated by a
separate crew in a location which the target has trouble figuring out. The
launch crew can run as soon as the missile is launched.

The FOG-M is also a major advance in this type of technology.

Jon Tankersley compares wire-guided munitions to laser designated.  No, they
are a new-generation weapon.  The laser designator need not be located at
launch point and in fact it is preferable they be at different points.  His
suggestion of smart weapons is more scary for me, don't.

Just noted: Hammer's comment about Exocets not exploding.  Actually,
duds happen all the time.  There were several duds in the South Atlantic.
Actually probably makes disarming them easier.

A discussion in RISKS 235 relating to the STARK incident and the "MIC" test
procedures stated "Drones...have been painted with gloss red enamel to
absorb more laser energy." The implication was that this is an unfair
advantage.  Unless these are heat seekers, I would think that the advantage
would be obtained by painting them to REFLECT more laser energy.

From: willis@rand-unix.ARPA

As a member of the computer fraternity who who has been in the privacy area
for a long time (e.g., chaired the HEW Committee whose report led to the
Federal Privacy Act, member of the Privacy Protection Study Commission), I'd
like to offer $0.25 more on the subject of TRW's Credentials.  To me, this
is marketing of the obvious and of information that is largely useless for
most people.  I didn't see Forbes on the issue but it seems that it
expresses the same view.

In the course of various privacy activities, I've had occasion to talk in
depth with TRW Credit Data and see my own record -- one time for free and
another time for (I think) $7.50.  For anyone that is seriously thinking of
subscribing to Credentials, I'd urge that you invest the nominal amount
first and see how little is really in your record.  All of the good things
that you've done creditwise (e.g., regular mortgage payments for 30 years)
will not be there; if you've been too bad (e.g., declared bankruptcy) it will
be there.  Even then, bankruptcy records have a legal life of 7 years, at 
which point TRW is obligated to expunge the record.  Beyond that your record
will be mostly a listing of your credit card accounts together with a comment 
about outstanding balance or being current.  As I recall when I last looked,
my TRW credit file had about 6 entries in it although I held many more
plastic cards than that and had much other credit activity.  Your SSN may be
there, although TRW is not authorized under any law to solicit its collection.

So, take a test flight with your record before plunging into a $35 annual fee.

The things (as I recall the blurb) that Credentials offers is a regular copy
of your record and notification of whenever the record is consulted.  I believe
TRW does not offer to tell you when the record is updated on existing lines of 
credit.  Unless one is extraordinarily active in creating new credit accounts 
or in hunting new jobs, your record will not be consulted very often and so
you won't hear much.  Meanwhile for less than $10 a throw, you can get your
record once or twice a year directly -- if you're interested enough to want
to know that often.  If you want to know something about how your credit record
plays a role in activities that you may not suspect (e.g., investigations of
various kinds), one can get some insight for a year's subscription.

It isn't TRW that represents the really big risk to most people.  It's the
small local credit bureau tucked away on some side street, that is frequently 
manual or at least not extensively automated, and that often engages in
information collecting activities that can be a little less than ethical.  For
example, there is the instance of an individual being hired to poke through
a bank's trash in the dumpster; he was picking out "pieces of yellow paper"
which turned out to be unneeded copies of delinquency notices on various
individual bank accounts.  The local credit bureau was learning about
delinquencies before the account holders even knew it.  In this instance, it
was poor information security in the bank that created the risk to individuals.

But the Credentials offer does raise an interesting philosopical point for
the citizen.  In my own consideration of the privacy issue as it may
emerge in the future, I've about decided that each of us will largely have
to take of himself.  There will be some law and some protections, but the
risks of living and operating in a highly automated information society
will have to be offset by our own individual protective efforts.  We're
already being told that the patient will have to play a bigger role in
managing his personal medical care; so it's going to be more of the
same in privacy and perhaps elsewhere.

Give such a premise, the next question is: does one want to run open loop
or closed loop?  Does one want to monitor the flow of his automated data
as it swirls around?  Or just hopefully have things arranged so he knows
when negative or harmful events happen?  There are some people who want to
be proactive and will want to run closed loop; and for them, services like
Credentials can be helpful.  I suspect most people will opt for open loop,
simply because of the burden of watching all the reporting; BUT at the
same time, we will all expect mechanisms to trigger negative events to our
attention.  Thus, the present Fair Credit Reporting Act requirements of
providing a copy of the credit report which reputedly is behind a negative
credit action is both appropriate and useful.

But, the initiative still is with the individual; there is nothing
automatic about the law's protection against risk.  As I recall the law,
the organization that makes a negative credit decision is required to tell
the individual where it got credit reports that entered into the decision.
The individual must then contact such places and request the credit
reports.  I'm not sure that Forbes is correct about providing free copies;
I suspect that the only legal obligation is to make the credit record
available for perusal at a specified place of business and during
specified business hours.  But then the FCRA was ammended I think, and
free copies may indeed be a legal obligation.  I think that the
individual must bear the cost of any reproductions.

On the other hand, I can understanding TRW choosing to send a copy as a
business convenience.  Among other things, it will avoid having people turn
up [at] the front door of an installation whose physical location TRW
properly wants to keep secret as an aspect of good system security.

I have been a member of this for over a year and am pretty satisfied with it.

Advantages:

1.  The biggest is that you get notified automatically if ANYONE accesses
    your credit history.  This alone is worth the $35/year to me 
    (it may not be to you).

2.  Free copy of your credit report whenever you want.  It is true
    you can get a free copy whenever you are turned down for credit
    (sometimes a big hassle though).  However, the NOMINAL charge
    for a copy otherwise is $8.00.  This can add up if you get more
    than one a year.

3.  "Standard" forms for disputing and correcting information (a little
    easier than writing letters).  Also, since you are a paying 
    customer, you get a little better service.

4.  Credit card registration and protection service 
    (generally costs about $12/year elsewhere).

Disadvantages:

1.  If YOU WANT (not required), you can tell them income and asset
    information which they keep on file along with your credit history.
    Then, theoretically, you can apply for a loan or other credit just
    by giving your TRW Credentials number and not having to fill
    out long applications every time.  In practice, I have not
    found anyone who will do this  (yet) (except for some car dealer whose
    ad was sent as a part of the TRW Credentials package!).

2.  $35 / year 

All in all, it's worth it if you want to know when someone accesses your 
credit history (which they are NEVER supposed to do unless you authorize
it) or if you want to get more than one or two credit reports a year.

Around 7:30 p.m. on 28 May, a white single-engine Cessna with West German
markings buzzed Lenin's mausoleum and landed near the Kremlin wall on the
750-yard-long Red Square in central Moscow.  The pilot was a West German
teenager named Matthias Rust.  The plane had flown 550 miles from Helsinki
to Moscow across ``one of the most closely guarded borders in the world''.
Ironically it was a Soviet holiday honoring the nation's border guards, who
were evidently less than alert.

Subject: Soviet Air Defense Penetration

Seeing that the Soviets also have a lookdown radar capability and this man
flew for hours in Soviet airspace, this makes me wonder more about the
limitations of such systems (also in the Stark incident).  I have not seen a
topographic map of the area he flew in, nor have ideas about traffic
patterns in the SU, but I think there are computers and software in this
(still probably not a computer problem but a C^2I problem which the Stark
incident has resolved into), and it's too bad we don't have Soviet
correspondents to flame about this.
                                          --eugene miya

   [Apparently the plane was observed at various points along the way, 
   but was flying so SLOWLY that air reconnaissance was difficult!
   I omitted this item from <A HREF="/Risks/4.92.html">RISKS-4.92</A> because it seemed only marginally 
   relevant at the time.  The computer part of the Soviet air defense system
   seems not to have been a problem.  However, I become more convinced
   with each passing RISKS Forum that it is human failings that underly 
   our most interesting RISKS cases -- requirement errors, design flaws, 
   implementation bugs, operational glitches, system misuse, or just plain
   human screw-ups, whether or not a system is heavily automated.  From now
   on I will no longer work so hard to justify inclusion of human misuses 
   of technology (or human misuses of what should have been done by technology 
   but was not).  In this case several heads have rolled -- the Soviet
   defense minister retired, the air defense commander was fired, and other 
   jobs are considered in jeopardy. 

   It is interesting to contrast this case with the KAL 007 -- there are
   similarities and significant differences.  There are also some parallels
   with the Stark episode.  ``Who would ever think that a plane approaching
   Moscow was not properly authorized?!''  PGN]

I've watched the discussion in RISKS about the Exocet, the performance of
the PHALANX system, and missile defense, and in a number of cases have
wished that less of what I knew was classified, so I could correct mistakes
that have been put into comments. There are, however, some details that I
can talk about freely.

The Phalanx system installed aboard ships has a theoretical arc of fire of
270 degrees, subject to cutouts from ship structure. The placement of the
system aboard the FFG-7 class results in the system retaining most of its
theoretical arc of fire. Unfortunately, the design of the  FFG-7 precludes
installing a second Phalanx - there's no place to put it. However, the lack
of a forward firing arc is not serious in most cases, as I will show below.

As the author of the only interactive chaff-launcher training simulator in
use by the Navy at this time (at least, according to the information I get
from the Fleet Combat Training Center here, where the program is in use), I
think I am qualified to comment on the use of chaff as a missile defense.

The effective use of chaff in missile defense depends on several factors -
the speed and direction of the relative wind, the specific design of the
ship's superstructure, and above all, detecting the missile as soon as
possible. 

The two basic tactics for decoying a missile with chaff are to 1) give the
missile a 'better' target than the ship to track and 2) use the chaff to
pull the missile's aim away from the ship after the missile has locked on
to the ship. To do this, the chaff must present a larger radar cross
section (RCS) than the ship.

All ships have a variable RCS, depending on the angle the ship makes with the
missile's course. The smallest RCS occurs with the bow or stern about 15-20 
degrees off the line of the missile's course. If the ship is beam-on to the 
missile, in most cases, all the chaff the ship can fire isn't going to help.

The relative wind is important because, first, the idea is to get the
missile to follow the chaff away from the ship, and since the chaff moves
at the speed of the relative wind, its movement is dependent on the wind,
and second, the chaff launchers don't throw the chaff rounds that far away
from the ship - a good relative wind is necessary to give the chaff enough
separation to allow it to appear as a separate target for the missile to
pick to track instead of the ship.

Finally, the missile must be detected as soon as possible. The chaff rounds
aren't immediately effective. It takes time for the round to reach its
'bloom' point, and another second or two for the chaff cloud to bloom. If
the missile is close enough, there won't be enough time for the chaff cloud
to form at all, or the chaff cloud won't have enough separation to be
useful. From the information gathered from the chaff simulation I wrote,
you generally need between 30 and 60 seconds of warning to be able to
deploy chaff effectively. 

The big advantage in the use of chaff, however, is that it's simple and
quick to use, if you get the warning. A four-position rotary switch, an ARM
button, and six firing buttons for the six rounds in a launcher box
comprise the entire console, which is part of the SLQ-32 console.  The
SLQ-32, the ELINT and ECM equipment, should have been manned while the
Stark was in the Gulf. It is the responsibility of the ECM operator to
detect the lock-on of the firing aircraft, and to use chaff and other
soft-kill measures against an incoming missile. From the information I've
seen on the Stark incident, whoever was at the SLQ-32 console has to have
been asleep at the switch, and is probably going to get raked over the
coals, along with the CO and the OOD.

     I noted with interest the articles in this morning's paper, which 
     imply that there were no technological failures, only human failures...
     Does that sound familiar?  PGN]

[Subsequent messages from Sean Malloy]

  The paper here this morning says that the CO, the XO, the TAO, and the WCO
  can all be held culpable. I'm not sure, because I don't know how the
  watchbill is set up aboard an FFG-7, but I think that the Tactical Action
  Officer and Weapons Control Officer may be the same person under normal
  circumstances - there may not be more than one officer on duty in CIC, and
  the designation of TAO is dependent on who is on duty - all of the command
  officers should have been through TAO school.

  It all goes to show that having fity million dollars worth of technological
  support doesn't do you any good if you don't use it [properly].

 &gt; Years ago, the US Army had a weapon called the "Chapparal", which 
 &gt; was a 20mm gatling mounted on an armored personnel carrier....

You may be confusing the Chapparal with something else.  The Chapparal had
4 Sidewinder missiles mounted on an armored personnel carrier.  My dad worked
on it when it was being designed and tested.  There was talk at one time of
putting some kind of guns on it for self-defense.

I was at a local computer dealer recently.  I'm friends with some of the
people who work there, so I was in back in the repair shop.  Someone had
brought in an Apple LaserWriter to be fixed.  They had purchased it about
six months before, and at that time purchased a security device consisting
of a plate with some (allegedly) permanent adhesive, attached to a thick
steel cable.  Unfortunately, when they installed the device, they placed it
in such a position that the steel cable extended over an access door in the
bottom of the LaserWriter, making it impossible to repair the machine.  But,
as anyone good repairperson knows, if something's in the way, you take it
off.  In about ten seconds, with only a normal slotted screw driver, the
"permanent" security device had been removed, leaving only a few scratches
on the bottom of the LaserWriter!

The moral is two-fold:  first, be careful when installing any security device,
so it can be removed, or isn't in the way for normal use or repair, and
second, no security device is perfect, and some are less perfect than others.

I'd like this information too, but I don't think people should have to pay
$35 a year for this service.  I think that TRW and other credit bureaus
ought to be required to send you a notice, for free, whenever your credit
record is queried or modified.

At present, we treat databases containing personal information as though
they were (almost) equivalent to any other corporate asset belonging to the
company that compiles the data base.  Existing regulations on data privacy
are a moderately weak compromise between commercial interests and privacy
rights.  I think the balance needs to shift.

A sophisticated computer crime occurred in Australia recently and is being
investigated by Kevin Fitzgerald and Stuart Gill in Melbourne for the victim
company.  Sketchy details, more later.  A disgruntled employee modified PC
circuit boards.  One called "Icepick" attacked ACF-2 on an IBM mainframe.  The
other called "Big Red" was used in a virus attack.

The proliferation of PCs and other computers throughout U.S. businesses has
led to larger losses to fraud, according to a recent study.  Computer crime
is on the rise, says a 54-page report by the Cleveland accounting firm Ernst
&amp; Whinney, in part because there are more computers in the United States
from which to steal.  The increasing use of computers in business has raised
the sophistication of users and, at the same time, fed the expanding pool
of potential computer criminals, the study notes.  

The FBI estimates the average loss from computer theft at $600,000, or about
25 times the average loss from "conventional" crime, the report says.  Of
the 240 companies surveyed, more than half said they have been a victim of
computer fraud, which the report estimates costs U.S. businesses from $3
billion to $5 billion a year.

     I noted with interest the articles in this morning's paper, which 
     imply that there were no technological failures, only human failures...

It seems like man/machine interface issues are greatly ignored in computer 
science and software engineering.  A current court case has the company that 
wrote the software for a device that killed two people arguing that the fault 
was the operator's.  In this instance, the software and documentation provided 
the operator with a command that was dangerous to use without any warning 
about how and when to use it safely (in fact, it probably should not have
been provided at all).  Was the operator at fault for acting in a
natural, human way or was the designer of the equipment at fault for
designing a technological device in a way that could easily lead the human
to make a mistake?  Can the design of a technological device be judged 
"correct" without considering the environment in which it will be operated?

We design programming languages so that they are less error-prone and
discourage the use of some languages because they are harder to use.  
Should we not also be responsible for doing this for the other types
of software we create?  We know that humans can make mistakes and, from 
psychologists, understand a great deal about their "failure modes."  If 
we can consider hardware failure modes in our designs, why not consider 
human failure modes?  Many of the large firms do employ human factors
experts, but not enough is done and people seem much too willing
to blame the human instead of the technology that failed to consider 
the human in its design.  I am starting to be leery when I read that 
the technology did not fail, the operator did.

&gt;   The particular error cited by Bill Young could not have happened if the
&gt; implementation had been in a language such as PL/I or Ada, where
&gt; over-running the bounds of an array is a required run-time check...

I'm not an Ada aficionado, but my recollection is that every PL/I compiler
I've ever seen has a turn-checks-off option, and usually it's the default.
The reason is clear:  such checks are expensive, particularly with a naive
compiler that can't eliminate many of them at compile time, and the overrun
condition is rare.

&gt; Such checks are clearly not new technology, since Multics (written in PL/I)
&gt; has been doing such for over 20 years.  Nor is the technology new to
&gt; hardware, since the Burroughs B5500-series and MCP (written in Algol) has
&gt; also been checking for a similar period.

The distinguishing feature here is that both Multics and MCP are running on
special hardware.  The reason that these are relatively unpopular systems,
while Unix and C are everywhere, is that the latter will run efficiently on
almost anything.  As we all know, many people will trade off safety for
performance any day.  As is less widely appreciated, this is not necessarily
a foolish thing to do -- it depends on the application.  One negative aspect
of having hardware and languages that enforce checking is that you have no
control over the tradeoffs.

My personal conjecture, not yet verified by experiment, is that with a
cooperative language and a reasonable amount of intelligence in the
compiler -- more than most current compilers have, mind you -- something
like 90% of the run-time checks could be eliminated at compile time, and
about 90% of the remainder could be eliminated by reprogramming that would
make the program clearer to the compiler (and incidentally to humans) while
leaving efficiency unaffected.  The remaining 1% might require a way to tell
the compiler "believe me, it's right", but otherwise the need for a run-time
check could be made a fatal compile-time error.  Result:  safety with no
efficiency penalty.  Trouble is, verifying this conjecture would require
building such a smart compiler, a sizable project.  Maybe next year...

The folks at our main facility just installed a new telephone switch, and made
two changes which are not user-transparent.  The two changes involve the method
used to reach our remote switch, and the method used to dial an international
call.  If you haven't guessed yet, the old international prefix corresponds to
the new method of ringing my extension from the main facility.  This would be
amusing if it weren't for all the auto-dial facsimile machines trying to phone
home to Japan with the old dialing codes.  They're not much fun to talk to, and
they don't seem to report the fact that the calls aren't getting through.

The moral of this story: Get your Fax straight, before you make changes.

I saw a piece on the Cable News Network (U.S.  cable television station)
last night concerning compulsive gamblers.  During the roughly 5 minute
story, a theory was presented which held that certain types of people may be
more likely to become compulsive gamblers than others.  I was doing
paperwork as I watched, and so was distracted, but I thought they said
something to the effect that those people are especially susceptible to the
(physiological?  psychological?) disease of gambling in much the same way as
alcoholics appear to react (physiologically?) to alcohol abnormally.
   I was surprised by the comparison, since alcoholics are reacting to a
drug (the alcohol), while gamblers are reacting to a behavior.  Is it fair
to call the gambling a disease, or "simply" a noxious habit?
   Anyhow, my train of thought led to computer use.  Certainly there are
individuals whose attraction to computers is greater than average, and
possibly greater than is healthy.  I regretfully admit a period as an
undergraduate when I would play computer games as a response to a slow
social life, which led to a vicious cycle -- my computer use took time that
I could have been using to work on my social life.  I broke the pattern, but
am left with concerns: Need we worry about compulsive computer users?  Need
there be a Hackers Anonymous?  Should compulsive computer use be considered
a disease, or a worthwhile funneling of energy?  If a disease, the vast
number of computers being introduced into the schools and the workplace
without our fully understanding the problem seems to present a potentially
large RISK to susceptible individuals.
   I'd love feedback on these thoughts,  as well as knowledgeable responses.
It would probably be wise if flames  and responses correcting my knowledge of
alcoholism, etc., be directed to me and I'll summarize to RISKS.

Regarding Eugene's message to RISKS about info-age Bill of Rights:  See if you 
have this book in your friendly neighborhood tech library:  "FREEDOM'S EDGE: 
The Computer Threat To Society" by Milton Wessel (Addison Wesley, 1974).  It
seems to have the Bill of Rights that you seek in its appendix.  I have neither
the legal right nor the time to type it in.

My earlier posting concerning problems in the Phalanx missle defense system
contained some errors.  I'm not sure how much, if any, of the article is
usuable, but I'm a fanatic about accuracy so I'll point out my mistakes.

In one paragraph, I mentioned a U.S. Army vehicle-based gatling gun called the
"Chapparal."  That is incorrect.  The Chapparal consisted of a number of
Sidewinder heat-seeking missles mounted on a vehicle, and did not include a
gatling.  The Chapparal did indeed die a quiet death, probably due to the short
range of the missles.  There have been, and still are, various types of ground
weapons consisting of gatlings mounted on vehicles.  They don't seem to be
meeting with enthusiastic popularity.  My statement about ground-based gatlings
having problems with short range and voracious ammunition consumption is
generally accurate.

Actually, since that whole paragraph I wrote about ground-based gatlings has
marginal relevance to the Phalanx, I suppose it could be deleted.

Sorry about that.  Thanks for your attention.  Michael Trout

COMPASS '87 will be held in Washington DC the week of 29 June - 3 July 1987
at Georgetown University.  COMPASS stands for COMPuter ASSurance and is
concerned with software safety and process security.

"Our safety, health, and welfare are increasingly dependent on the safe and
correct use of computers.  Despite advances in software engineering and
system design, it is common to find major bugs and untrustworthy performance
in critical computer-controlled systems.  Existing approaches to computer
assurance need to be refined technically and economically, and brand new
approaches need to be explored."

The keynote speaker is Harlan Mills, IBM Fellow.  Dr. Mills will speak 
about his quiet revolution at IBM, his "cleanroom" approach to software 
development.  Dr. Mills is trying to convince the DoD and NASA not to 
acquire debugged software, rather to buy only software that didn't have 
any bugs in the first place!  And he is receiving a receptive audience.

The keynote address and formal papers will be given on 30 June and 1 July.
The other days include special-interest group meetings and a tutorial (2
July) by Nancy Leveson on software safety.  COMPASS is sponsored by the IEEE
Washington DC Section, NASA, Computer Sciences Corp., and George Mason
University.  The Proceedings contain some sure-to-be classic papers: Mills
on how to acquire software, Neumann on the N best (or worst) computer risks
and the implications, several surveys of trustworthy systems and tools, and
lessons learned from the NASA Shuttle disaster and other real-world systems.
There are panel sessions on software safety, on the role of high-level
programming languages, and on legal implications.  In addition, there is a
banquet talk by Henry Petroski ("To Engineer is Human: The Role of Failure
in Successful Design"), and a luncheon talk by John Shore.

For further information on the program or registration, please contact Al
Friend in Washington DC either over the network at friend@nrl-csr.arpa or by
telephone at 202/692-7235.  Many people are staying the weekend after to
enjoy the Fourth of July in the Nation's Capital.

Stan Rifkin, Publications Chairman

      [I hope that in early July RISKS will have some relevant comments on
      Harlan's talks and other COMPASS topics.  (Last year's COMPASS program
      featured a rousing talk by David Parnas as Keynote Speaker.)  PGN]

From: Jerome H. Saltzer &lt;Saltzer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU&gt;

Henry Spencer mentions on the subject of run-time checks,

 &gt; The distinguishing feature here is that both Multics and MCP 
 &gt; are running on special hardware... 
 &gt; ... many people will trade off safety for performance any day...

That comment was widely accepted as the dominating concern in the 1970's,
when people were actively debating whether or not to carry forward the
hardware features that were required to support Multics and MCP.  At the
time, hardware features were still quite expensive.  But with 1980's
technology available, those concerns somehow look diminished.

With moderately clever implementation, hardware run-time checks can usually
be done in parallel with the main stream of computation, so they don't
directly impede performance that much.  At most they have the indirect
effect of using up silicon that might have been invested in performance
enhancements.  They also use up chip design time, but one would expect that
cost to be repaid many times in applications development time savings.

It seems to me that there remain two real barriers to introduction of
hardware run-time checks:

  1.  Developing a conviction that they are a good idea.  Those of us
  who have developed programs on Multics or MCP are easily convinced,
  but those of us who haven't are in a majority.

  2.  It is hard to sell a new architecture.  Life is more rewarding
  for people who do improved, compatible implementations of old ones.

      [Jerry has put his finger on one of the stumbling blocks in
      trying to attain systems with critical requirements for security, 
      reliability, safety, etc.  There are obvious incentives to use
      available hardware, software, programming languages, network
      facilities, etc., even if atrociously malsuited to the application.

A very thorough bounds test could be performed millions of times in the time
that it has taken you to read this sentence. The test has done nothing to 
further the purposes of the program, but it has given you that much more cause 
to believe that the program is working properly.  If something IS wrong, you 
know that you will know about it before it completely wrecks your program.

Dependability, serviceability, future expansion, and the need for defensive
posturing are basic engineering concerns -- whether you're building a
footbridge or a computer program. They do nothing for the bridge, but they do
help to guarantee that something infinitely more expensive than the bridge, 
namely a human being or his payroll record, won't fall into the waters below.  
If you can't be sure of that, then the cost of failure has completely eaten
up any cost that you "saved" by not anticipating the possibility.

The computer is the least expensive part of the whole scenario. You can always
buy a bigger one. If you "waste" a few milliseconds being very sure that you
don't have a problem, then it's time well spent.  If and when a problem does
crop up, then the defensive code kills two birds with one stone: alerting
you to the fact that you have a problem, and giving you a clear(er) picture
of exactly when, what, where, and why the problem has occurred.

These are some of the ideas that went into the design of the newer
languages.  It doesn't take much effort to become proficient in any one of
them and it behooves us very much to take advantage of them when we can.
Bounds tests, "inefficiencies," and all.  It's just plain good sense.

&gt; &gt; The particular error ... could not have happened in a
&gt; &gt; language such as PL/I ... where over-running the bounds of an
&gt; &gt; array is a required run-time check...

I winced when I read this, because 'required' is such an ambiguous word (on
whom is the requirement placed), but assumed that people would know enough
PL/I to understand.  Then came Henry's comment ...

&gt; ... my recollection is that every PL/I compiler I've ever seen
&gt; has a turn-checks-off option, and usually it's the default.

I have experience with only 3 PL/I compilers.  Subscript checking defaults
to on for two of them (PL/C from Cornell and PL/I Checkout from IBM), and to
off for one (PL/I Optimizer from IBM).

&gt; The reason is clear:  such checks are expensive, particularly
&gt; with a naive compiler that can't eliminate many of them at
&gt; compile time, and the overrun condition is rare.

We may disagree about what 'expensive' means, but I have examined the output
from the PL/I Optimizer with full subscript checking turned on and estimated
the cost of run-time subscript checking to be less than a few percent of the
total.  I ran a production subsystem with checking on for a few weeks, and
this yielded a number in concert with my estimates.  In the end, I turned
subscript checking off, but if the output of the system had mattered in any
real sense, I would have considered it false economy.

Regarding Steve Thompson's article about gambling addicts (<A HREF="/Risks/4.94.html">RISKS-4.94</A>), the
drug involved is ... adrenalin! This may also be true for computer junkies.
There is indeed cause for worry about the dangers of addiction to a
"response-pattern generator" that seems to be so emotionally neutral (giving
no feedback whatsoever about the user's habits or characteristics), and as
intellectually absorbing as the computer's user interface.  (Although the
shell isn't the most exciting person to spend time with, it never calls you
a jerk either.)

An emotionally vulnerable person can indeed be sucked in, and can tend to
lose sight of the fact that dealing with people isn't as straightforward as
dealing with computers.  One cannot usually "correct a relationship
malfunction" with an "abort/restart sequence" and "different inputs."
Because the addict may feel incompetent to deal with people anyway, spending
increasing amounts of time on the machine tends to compound his feeling of
isolation.  This can lead to a vicious circle in which he returns to the
relatively "safe" (if emotionally stultifying) environment of the computer,
after increasingly disappointing experiences with people that he is less and
less able to cope with.

As interfaces get better, this risk gets worse.

Summary: Two cents worth of bank stupidity

The ultimate case of bank stupidity came when we bought our house eleven
years ago.  At that time, they offered us the option of an automatic payment
plan, where we gave them the authorization to write a check on our checking
account (at a different bank, we're not stupid) for the monthly mortgage
payment.  As a side bonus, they were willing to do it twice a month for
half-payments, which was convenient as I was getting payed twice monthly at
the time (not to mention the postage savings).

About a week after we signed all the papers, I got a call from the nice lady
at the bank saying that could not put us on the automatic payment plan.  The
reason?  Our monthly payment amount was odd, and the two half-payments had
to be equal.  A few minutes on the phone and the nice lady checking with her
supervisor determined that we were allowed to make a greater payment with
the extra money going toward the loan principal, so we increased the monthly
payment amount by $0.01 to make the two half-payments equal.  And so we
thought we had it licked.

Act III:  Bank statement arrived at end of month.  Two automatic
payment checks to mortgage had cleared, each for $0.01!!!

&gt;
&gt;   &gt; Years ago, the US Army had a weapon called the "Chapparal", which 
&gt;   &gt; was a 20mm gatling mounted on an armored personnel carrier....
&gt;
&gt;You may be confusing the Chapparal with something else...

The weapon they are trying to identify was called the VULCAN.  It was a sister 
to the CHAPPARAL and was used to shoot down low-altitude aircraft.  I served in
Europe with 2/60th ADA C/V which was one of the first CHAPPARAL/VULCAN units to
be deployed over there.  They were the last thing the enemy had to get past 
before hitting something important like an airbase or equipment depot.  That's 
assuming they made it past the NIKE and HAWK batteries.  I believe from what I 
have seen in the news photos that the PHALANX is merely a sea-going VULCAN.

"Lost Squirrel Causes Troublesome Power Surge"
Providence Journal, Thursday, October 30, 1986

   An electrical power surge caused computers to go on the blink in
Providence brokerage houses, banks, and office buildings yesterday.  A
Narragansett Electric Co. spokesman said a squirrel caused a short-circuit
in a transformer.  Charles Moran, the spokesman, said the squirrel got into
a transformer at the Narragansett Electric's Dyer Street substation at
11:10am.  Moran said a backup transformer took over automatically and
prevented a power failure in downtown Providence.  But "there was a slight
power surge," he said.

   Computers in the money-market divisions of the Fleet and Old Stone Banks
were down for half an hour after the power surge, but banking services were
not disrupted, spokesmen said.  Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., a brokerage firm,
had trouble getting quotes on stock prices, according to Sharon Tallman, who
said some of the firm's Quotron machines went down.  At Superior Court, the
computer was down for two hours, but it didn't affect court scheduling, a
spokeman said.  

"The mainframe on our IBM computer was down for over an hour," said Robert
Perreira of the Providence Journal Co.'s computer services unit.  Perreira
said 14 systems went down and "three of them did not come up immediately."
A Journal Co. electrician said the power surge caused "our lightning control
panel to behave like a runaway monster."  It caused a computer to activate a
program designed to save energy on weekends by shutting off the lights in part
of the building. "The computer thinks it's Sunday," the electrician said.

    [A similar squirrelcide happened at SRI a while back.  The side-effects
     were quite prolonged and unanticipated.  On occasional Saturdays for 
     several months all of SRI was powerless while repairs were repeatedly
     attempted but not quite completely accomplished.  PGN]

From: churd@labs-b.bbn.com

A few months ago, Sixty Minutes ran an episode about the fact that the FAA had
rejected Honeywell's collision avoidance system in favor of its own (untested,
uncompleted) system.  I think the episode aired shortly after the Air Mexico
collision in California.  One of the people Sixty Minutes interviewed had been
an FAA official (executive?) until he became too vocal about the fact that the
FAA was ignoring a workable system.  It was his opinion that *many* collisions
and near-misses would never have happened if the Honeywell system had been
adopted when it was first introduced.

The Honeywell system resides in the aircraft and projects an envelope ahead of
the plane that can be detected by another Honeywell system.  The system 
communicates with the pilot by issuing a warning when an intersection with
another plane's envelope is detected and gives a direction in which to turn
to avoid collision.

The FAA system is tied into the ground-control system and seems to rely on 
tracking aircraft from radar on the ground.  I was not too clear on this.

The advantage of the Honeywell system is that it is small, cheap, and does
not require the pilot to rely on any outside assistance.  The drawback is
that *all* planes need to be equipped with the system.  But, since it is
small and cheap that would not be a great problem.

I can't remember all the pros and cons of the FAA system, but the cons had a
clear majority.  The system is much more complicated, involves ground-control
personnel notifying pilots about impending collisions, and is expensive.

After graduating about ten years ago, I entered the Air Force as a
Satellite Systems Engineer.  I was assigned to a unit operating a
particular NORAD satellite system...no names, no mission statements,
please.  A buddy DID almost start World War III one night, though.

My job was real-time and non-real-time analysis of mission data
from the spacecraft; the end result of my analysis was to advice the NORAD
Senior Director of the validity of the data.  A lot of factors had to be
incorporated in my analysis...in "N" seconds, I had to take into account
which spacecraft had reported, its health and status, DEFCON level, and
"numerous other mission critical elements."  Nudge, nudge...

Anyway, the job was highly dependent upon the experience of the analyst,
as well as his intuition...we had to have a FEEL for what was right.

Three years after I joined the squadron, the unit was reassigned from the
Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM) to the Strategic Air Command (SAC).  Now,
SAC is the largest producer of automatic humans in the free world.  In a
word, SAC is checklist crazy...every task is broken down to the largest
number of subtasks.

SAC treats its checklists as a way to eliminate the human element.  Training
two people to work as a team is unecessary...all they have to be able to do
is call off the proper steps from the checklist.  SAC uses simulators to
allow its people to practice every step, and to handle every contingency.
For instance, a missile launch officer has gone through the launch procedure in
the simulator dozens of times before he is placed in an actual control
room.  The opening sequence in WAR GAMES is an example of what SAC is trying
to avoid:  The crew must automatically perform its tasks, spending no time
thinking about what the consequences are.  The crew must not bring their
emotions into play, nor even any additional knowledge they must have.
Every action must be governed by a checklist step.

You can see what our problem was...how to you place "intuition" and "gut feel"
onto a checklist?  Our job could not be performed by an automaton; we had to
call on experience and a deep understanding of system operation in order to
provide our assessment.  We argued, to no avail.  We had to have a checklist.
So we thought and thought, and broke the analysis task into as many
subelements as we could.  The last subelement was OPERATOR INTUITION.

Did SAC complain?  Nahhhhh...they never read the thing.  Occasionally
they'd show up for Operational Readiness Inspections.  During the
simulation, their checklist called for them to verify that we had our EVENT
ASSESSMENT checklist open.  Their checklist didn't call for them to
actually read our checklists...

  [Dave Benson said that we should assume that an overloaded system will
  fail to handle any load at all.  I said an overloaded system could
  fail by handling no load, by handling its ceiling load and no more, or
  by handling its ceiling load and some decreasing part of additional
  traffic, and that we had no grounds for making that decision until a
  design, designers, and implementors existed.  Dave Benson said history
  tells us no system works without extensive realistic testing.]

If that summary sounds as if I thought Dave's remarks didn't address
what I said, that's correct.  I know of systems (not military systems,
with which I have have no experience) which demonstrate each of
those overload behaviors; I'm sure he does, too.  Overload behavior
is something that certainly can be stated explicitly as part of the
design and it's generally a pretty easy thing to simulate, compared
with the problem of simulating all possible inputs.  Note that I
am talking ONLY about response to overload, which is where the
discussion started.

I have plenty of doubts about many parts of the SDI program and I don't for
a minute expect that they will come up with a design or an implementation
that I will be willing to trust.  But Dave's original statement that "We
should assume that a system capable of handling N targets/sec will, when
presented with 2N targets, fail to handle any at all." is without basis and
his further statements referring to 30 years of software development history
offer nothing to support it.  Systems fail in many ways and there is no
reason to assume a particular failure mode without looking at the design and
implementation.  Worst-case assumptions are often useful, but in this case
they are unenlightening; we all know that in the worst case nothing works,
all the missiles fall through, and c'est ca.  I'm a lot more interested in
the probability of that worst case than in the fact that that IS the worst
case.  Dave did not say anything to convince me that an arbitrary system's
most likely response to overload is total failure; in my own experience
(admittedly only 20 years) more systems respond to overload with degraded or
limited performance than with total failure.

The latest issue of DATAMATION has an excellent article on computerized vote
counting.  I recommend it to all.  It addresses problems with punch card
voting, but doesn't address the problems with computerized voting booths.
The three biggest problems with computerized voting booths are secrecy of
internal operation, lack of recount capability, and inability for the voters
to ensure that the computer votes as instructed.  Some of the people whose
names are in the article were at BU in August for the Symposium on Security
and Reliability of Computers in the Electoral Process.  These people are
doing great work, especially considering the fact that they are generally
financing it on their own.

I am presently compiling some poll watching guidelines for computerized
elections.  I can send a copy to anyone who will be a poll watcher on Tuesday.

  [Whereas the following three incidents are not directly computer related,
  they are clearly RISKS related, providing further examples of the unexpected
  technical failures.  On examining my list of collected cases, I am astounded
  to discover how many of the cases were due to causes that (a) had never
  occurred before and (b) no one had even anticipated might occur.  PGN]

This morning's San Jose Mercury News contains three interesting
articles, almost one-after-another.  Their headlines, and a summary of
their contents:

* "Official says many U.S. atom bombs are faulty"

   More than one of every three nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal
doesn't work properly, [Sylvester Foley, asst. sec. of energy for
defense programs] said yesterday [during a breakfast meeting with
reporters].

   "Hypothetically, it could be catastrophic if you ever wanted to use
it and you pushed the button and nothing happened", said Foley.

                  { no comment... dcp }

 * "Jaws V: Sharks make light lunch of trans-Atlantic fiber-optic cables"

   Sharks seem to have taken a fancy for the new 1"-thick underwater
cables being strung across the Atlantic;  they've bitten through the
cable at least four times (cost-to-repair $250,000 per bite).  Similar
bitings have been reported in the Pacific.  Older-style copper-wire
cables apparently weren't attractive to sharks, and weren't bitten.

   [The NYTimes article suggests that the sharks seem to be attracted to the
   low electrical currents in the copper wires providing power for the
   fiberoptic repeaters.  The new cables are still shielded, but much thinner
   than previously.  PGN]

* "Lightning hits NASA launch pad inadvertently setting off 3 rockets"

   A lightning strike on a pad at NASA's launch facility at Wallops
Island, VA. ignited three small rockets and sent two of them hurtling
along their planned trajectories;  they were more than two miles out
before the NASA officials could prepare to track them.  The third
rocket wasn't in firing position, and splashed down in the ocean 300
feet from the pad.  It appears that a lightning bolt may have induced
a current pulse in the firing leads, triggering the igniters.

   One of the rockets was scheduled to have been launched shortly
thereafter to study night-time thunderstorms and their effect on the
atmosphere.

    [The weather-satellite ground station was also affected, despite
    surge suppressors and grounding wires that were supposed to protect
    it.  Weather data from GOES-West could not be received for 9 hours,
    and GOES-East was blacked out for 5.5 hours.  NYTimes, same day.  PGN]

	From the NY Times, June 9, 1987, page A22:  "Coding Error at O'Hare
Brings Two Jets Much Too Close Together".  Comments/elipsis in [brackets]
are my summations or deletions from the original.

  	"Two American Airlines jets were guided past each other at a
  fraction of the minimum legal distance of separation between them because
  of an error by an air traffic assistant, the National Transportation Safety
  Board said yesterday.  [This happened late last month.]
  
  	"But Mr. Engen [chief of the F.A.A.] said he did not believe that
  the incident justified any permanent reduction of, or special restraints
  on, Chicago area traffic.  He said the F.A.A. had determined that existing
  procedures, "when properly applied, do maintain a safe level of operation
  in the Chicago area."  [...]
  
  	"According to officials of the safety board and the F.A.A., here is
  what happened:
  
  	"An air traffic assistant in the tower at Chicago's O'Hare
  Internation Airport assigned the wrong code to the crew of a United
  Airlines plane that was about to take off.  The code was the one for an
  American Airlines plane that took off three minutes later.
  
  	"Result: Confusion
  
  	"The result was that the full-fledged controller whose job it was
  to radio subsequent air traffic instructions to the two planes saw the
  United plane on his radar scope with the American plane's identification,
  altitude and other data.  The computer feeding this data to the radar scope
  rejected duplicate data for the American plane, rightly concluding that two
  planes could not have the same code.  The American plan showed up only as a
  bright radar blip, without any identification alongside.
  
  	"Now, the controller wanted the United plane, with the American
  plane's data next to it, to climb to a new altitude.  When he radioed
  instructions to "American 637" to climb, the United crew ignored them, and
  the instruction were carried out by the real American 637.  [This caused
  American 637 to pass another American plane at 1/4 mile horizonal and 500
  feet vertical separation -- the rules call for 3 miles and 1000 feet.]
  
  	"[The quick fix is to add more supervisory staff to the O'Hare
  tower.]
  
  
	The biggest question in my mind is why does the system just drop
one plane if it sees two with the same id?  Shouldn't bells ring and lights
flash when an obvious operator-error situation like this pops up?  Also,
why isn't the plane id part of the info sent by the on-board transponder?
Aren't these id's simply the flight numbers assigned by the airlines?  Why
should it require any manual intervention to assign an id to a blip?

Also in the NYTimes on the same day as the bombs, the sharks, and the
enlightning rockets was a front-page item on a proposed expansion of the
NCIC database that would permit Federal, state, and local law-enforcement
agencies to exchange information on people who are suspected of a crime but
have not been charged.  A government advisory panel also recommended that
the NCIC should have access to other databases such as those of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, Social Security, and State
Department passport office.  Attempts to legislate controls were also noted
in the Times article, although concerns for protection of privacy seemed
not to be commensurate with inadequacies in the technology and practice of
protecting systems and networks from internal and external misuse.  PGN

The following appeared in the Richmond Times-Dispatch June 8, 1987
Section B page 1.  The article pertains to the state of Virginia's
attempt to automate distribution of child support payments.


                 STATE PAYMENTS FOR SOFTWARE SYSTEM HALTED

	State officials have halted payments on a problem-plagued computer
software system used in distributing child support checks and say the
manufacturer will get no more money until the system works.

	The state secretary of human resources, Eva S. Teig, said Saturday that
the state has paid Unisys Inc. only $75,000 of the $395,000 total "because
we are not satisfied with the product.  Until we are satisfied, we will not
continue payments on the program."

	Ms. Teig's announcement came as she prepared to submit a confidential
report on the child-support automation problems to Gov. Gerald L. Baliles.
The report "is a look at what has happened and a recommendation on where I
think we should be going," she said.

	The software system has been blamed for massive snarls in the
distribution of child support checks.

	If state officials are unable to work out the problems, Ms. Teig said,
"we'll look at other alternatives.  We're committed to making it work."

	Del. Howard E. Copeland, D-Norfolk, last month asked Attorney General
Mary Sue Terry to investigate the state Department of Social Services'
purchase of the software and determine whether it has been acquired through
legal procedures.

	Bert Rohrer, a spokesman for the attorney general, refused to comment
on whether an inquiry is being conducted.

	The purchase of the software was part of the department's attempt to
take over collection of child support payments, a job that had been done by
the courts.  The centralization brought widespread complaints about lost
checks, delayed payments and improper seizure of tax refunds.

	Social Services Commissioner William L. Lukhard approved the purchase
of the software system from Unisys, formerly Sperry Corp., in May 1985.
Critics say the software never worked properly, causing further delays in
the already slow distribution of checks.

	A federal audit last month said operating the new computer system would
cost Virginia up to $7 million per year, more than three times the amount
originally anticipated.

	Representatives of Unisys and state computer experts are analyzing the
system to determine if it can be corrected and "some progress has been
made," Ms. Teig said.

	The state is prepared to take further action if the software cannot be
salvaged, Ms. Teig said.  She would not elaborate.

Several state legislators have suggested that Lukhard be replaced as social
services commissioner.

	"As I've said before, I think the best thing for the whole department
is someone who would come in with a new broom and sweep clean," said Del.
Frank D. Hargrove, R-Hanover.  "The buck stops at the boss's desk."

	Others defended the agency chief.  "I would be disappointed and upset
if he was driven out of office," said Sen. Joseph V. Gartlan Jr., D-Fairfax.
"I regard him as one of the best administrators in state government."

First some background:  The Westpac Bank installed a new software system
for its ATM's which did not do proper checking.  Thus it allowed people
to withdraw more than the daily maximum allowed ($200).  It even allowed
the withdrawl of more than was held in the account.  The ATM's were
supposed to allow customers of the Commonwealth Bank to access their
accounts, but this access was denied by the new software.

From "The Canberra Times", Tuesday, June 16, 1987.

BANK LOSES HEAVILY IN AUTO-TELLER 'HICCUP'
------------------------------------------

Westpac's recent automatic-teller-machine "hiccup" cost the bank more than a
red face.  According to Westpac's electronic banking manager, Mr Bill Paget,
the bank would lose several hundred thousand dollars of overdrawn cash.

Westpac's troubles began on Saturday, May 30, when programmers installed the
IMS version 2.2 of IBM's software.  The following Thursday, after a week
long crisis, Westpac decided to close all its automatic tellers throughout
Australia, suspecting widespread fraud.  Because of the costs of recovering
debts, Mr Paget said the bank would probably not take legal action to get
its money back from people who were unable to repay it.

The Federal Treasury ordered an immediate inquiry on the situation as it
developed.  "We were concerned for the cardholder where there was a
technical malfunction and the cardholder lost money," a Treasury official
said.  However he warned that the Treasury might get involved again if
legitimate customers had rights abused during that period.

It seems the "hiccup" was more extensive than first reported.  "Computing
Australia" was told by Mr John Kosh, assistant manager of electronic banking
for the Commonwealth Bank, that the Westpac system was malfuctioning for the
whole of the week before Westpac closed the machines.

Because of this, he said, Commonwealth cardholders had been unable to use
Westpac automatic tellers.  At first, the Commonwealth believed it to be a
communications problem.  "We didn't know what was happening," he said.

The SWIFT network for the international transfer of funds was also hit, with
Westpac unable to send funds overseas while the host computer was down.  Mr
Paget said this caused "some inconvenience" to corporate customers.

Westpac has blamed insufficient software testing for the disaster and
maintains it will reinstall the offending software later.  Mr Paget admitted
that "somehow or other the testing didn't cover the problem".

"The new software is back with the technicians:  we're saying we don't like
what happened, and we don't want this to happen again," he said.  "There's
no doubt it will go back in at some stage, but they've got to find out why
it didn't work and try to work out how to fix it.  From where I sit, we'll
be looking at test upon test upon test." 

He said Westpac would not seek compensation from IBM.  "When you are in a
long term relationship with a supplier, this is going to happen," Mr Paget
said.  "Our people were involved with the software all the way along.  We
have to be big boys and live with it."

Although stories about bank ATM's swallowing customer's money are common
enough, you don't see too many stories about the opposite situation
happening.  Here is a story from the "Sydney Morning Herald" (Sydney,
Australia) dated Friday 5th June:

  The day Westpac's computer gave away money

  Westpac Banking Corporation is believed to have lost millions of dollars
  in international transactions, and will be forced to recover an undisclosed
  amount from customers who withdrew unauthorised cash from automatic teller
  machines, following a serious fault in the bank's computer system.

  A major failure in a new software system introduced last weekend forced
  the closure of all the bank's 650 automatic teller machines (ATMs) across
  Australia yesterday.  The fault also affected other ATMs with which the
  Westpac computer is linked.

  After the fault developed earlier in the week, customers suddenly found
  themselves able to make multiple withdrawals of amounts beyond the usual
  daily limit of $200, even if the account held no money.  They were also able
  to withdraw from cheque accounts they did not have.

The article went on to describe how "normally impoverished inner-city types
(were) suddenly treating themselves to cocktails in expensive restaurants
and buying new clothes at the QVB (a trendy boutique)", and that the SWIFT
system (Society of Worldwide International Financial Transactions) was
inaccessible.  However, the bank denies losing millions of dollars this way.

Apparently, parts of the new software could not cope with carrying three or
four times the number of transactions they had been tested for, and the ATMs
were forced to work in isolation, unable to communicate with the host
processor.  This raises a few important points:

1) Why was the real-life situation so much worse than what had
   been expected?  Don't banks test software until it fails?

2) Why were the ATMs permitted to work on their own, happily
   dispensing cash from empty accounts?

And more importantly ...

3) Assuming these ATMs have an internal audit trail, how much reliance can
   be place on them, in order to recover the money from customers who
   (knowingly) defrauded them?  I can see the court case now:

   "But, m'lud, Westpac has ALREADY ADMITTED that its software was
   at fault.  How can we trust these little bits of paper inside
   their machine, claiming that my client had defrauded them?"

ATMs *DO* have an internal audit trail, don't they?

[...] Since then they have been running large ads in the newspapers with a
funny drawing of an ATM with 'HIC' coming from its dispenser slot.

Westpac tried the new version of IMS2 against their test data transactions
but not against a load approximating anything like the actual loads. (One of
my students, who works with another of the Big Four banks, says that his bank
always tests against live load levels before they bring in changes: perhaps
reasonable validation does take place sometimes)

The UK Consumers' Association magazine Which? has the following cautionary
tale about use of credit cards [precis].
	
   "Sally Allen booked into a hotel near Paris for the night. As well as
taking her passport overnight, the hotel asked for her Access card. They
took an imprint on a payment voucher, even though she had no intention of
paying by Access, explaining that it was a safeguard against non-payment of
her bill."

   "When she returned home and tried to use her Access card she was refused
credit, even though she had next to nothing charged on her card. She
contacted Access and demanded an explanation. Apparently the hotel in France
had *reserved credit* on her account for the cost of her stay, and been
given an authorisation number from the Access computer in the UK. The amount
reserved had been deducted from her credit limit. The only way her credit
could be restored was for the hotel to contact them, and to cancel the
transaction. She wrote to the hotel immediately, but it took six weeks for
the credit to be restored."

   Which? reports that Access and Visa both think the hotel was operating
outside the agreed conditions of use, but that because they have no direct
contract with the French hotel, all they can do is lobby their respective
international organisations (Mastercard and Visa International) for a ban.

Anybody else come across this problem of uncancelled "transactions"?

It seems very wrong that someone can screw up your credit without
you ever signing or agreeing anything, and that the matter can't be
put right because of the national boundaries involved.

     I've been told that seven terrorists (belonging to Action Directe?)
were recently caught in France after the police took possession of an
electronic wrist-watch/calculator in which one of the terrorists had stored
a set of telephone numbers. Can anybody confirm this, and provide details? I
don't recall discussion in RISKS of any such incident, and its a nice Gallic
equivalent to the Irangate archived messages incident, if it's true.

Last night I had the pleasure(?) of trying out United Air Lines new
O'Hare terminal.  The terminal is extremely modern, complete with
computerized departure signs for each gate (in a red color that can't
be read when the sun backlights it!)  In the closet behind each gate
check-in counter there is an IBM PC (I think) with a menu driven
program used to set the information on the departure sign.
Unfortunately, any gate computer can control any gate sign, and the
result is that a simple operator error can cause lots of trouble.
In particular, last night, while I watched, the Pittsburgh flight
indicated behind the counter turned magically into one for Columbus.

I should also point out that the low tech solution of a sign board to
be slipped into a slot took only about 30 seconds per flight
changeover.  I watched the attendent take almost 5 minutes to
changeover under the new and improved high-tech solution.  (To be fair,
the terminal has only been operating since Monday.)

Aside: if you are unfortunate enough to have to connect from United
gates E-F to United gates B, plan on missing your flight unless you've
added an extra 15-20 minutes for the hike.  The terminal won't be fully
operational until 1989, though much UAL operations will switch there in
August of this year.

  "The computer error has been corrected and new address labels are being

On 18 May 87 a demonstrator flight of the McDonnell Douglas UHB twin-jet
(with one GE prototype unducted fan engine) was cut short when a cockpit
light indicated a potential problem with the UDF engine.  The warning was
triggered by a pressure sensor when the aircraft climbed above 12,000 feet.
Subsequent testing showed there was a software error in the annunciation logic.

A short tutorial on aircraft transponders...

In RISKS 5:2 Roy Smith asks:

&gt;&gt; ...why isn't the plane part of the info sent by the on-board transponder?
&gt;&gt; Aren't these id's simply the flight numbers assigned by the airlines?  Why
&gt;&gt; should it require any manual intervention to assign an id to a blip?

The transponder presently in use by all aircraft in the US has been around
for many years.  It has the ability to:
 
- Receive an unaddressed query pulse from a ground radar site and respond
  with a pulse of its own. 

- Include with its response the transponder code set by the pilot.  (This
  is the code which was incorrectly assigned at O'Hare.)  The code is 
  a 4-digit octal number, and has no relationship to the aircraft registration
  number or the (airline-assigned) flight number.
 
- Report if a special button (marked IDENTIFICATION) has been pressed within 
  the past few seconds.  This can be used by a controller to positively
  identify an aircraft, since its receipt causes the radar display to change
  the shape of the blip which represents the return.
 
- Report the pressure altitude of the aircraft, referenced to a barometer 
  setting of 29.92" Hg.  This ability is not required in low-altitude
  flights and is an extra-cost feature.
 
Work is being completed by the FAA on a replacement for the present transponder
design.  The new transponders (called "Mode S") will include a permanently-
assigned identification, unique to the aircraft, which will be transmitted
along with the other data when the transponder decodes a query.  Until the
Mode S gear comes into use, however, we are still limited to a transponder
code address space of 4096 discrete codes to identify an aircraft.
 
The effective address space is smaller, since several blocks of 100(8) are
reserved for special purpose.  Code 1200 is the general VFR (visual, not
under radar control) code; 75xx, 76xx, and 77xx are emergency codes,
and so forth.
 
A feature of most radar display systems is the ability to use the transponder
codes to DE-select a return so that a controller's display does not show the 
transponder data for aircraft not under his/her jurisdiction.  Such aircraft
might be separated horizontally (in another controller's sector) or vertically
(as in an overflight above an airport).  In places like Southern California,
this can be used to suppress the clutter caused by VFR (code 1200) aircraft
which would otherwise obscure the returns of controlled aircraft.  It has
been reported (and denied) that the controller involved in the Cerritos crash
had suppressed the VFR returns such as that of the intruding Piper.
 
Yes, it would be nice if the system could set off alarms when the data
became ambiguous.  But at what point should it delay the alarm against
the possibility of a transient failure (e.g., the second aircraft might
have been changing the code setting and been on AA637's code just as the
radar beam swept past)?  A real problem in aviation system engineering is
the incredible number of alarms which some pilots consider to be a safety
risk in themselves since they can go off in combinations which distract
the aircrew.

There's an O*L*D joke about the pilot who was hauled up before a board
after landing his airplane with the landing gear still up.  His defence
was that the gear-up warning horn was so loud that he was distracted
from performing the "gear down and locked" item in his pre-landing checklist.

Before takeoff on an IFR (instrument flight rules) flight, an aircraft's
pilot is given a "squawk", a four octal digit code to enter into his
transponder.  This is also entered into the ATC system's computer so the
code returned by the transponder when interrogated by radar is automatically
translated into the airline and flight number displayed on the controller's
radar scope.

As there are 4096 possible codes and probably lots more aircraft flying IFR
than that, pilots sometimes have to change squawks in mid-flight when
going from one region to another.  And, as airlines have duplicate flight
numbers that range from one to four decimal digits, they can't use those
for their squawks.   [...]

VFR aircraft receiving terminal radar service also use this facility,
although they are only using it at the beginning and end of the flight.
Also, codes 75XX are reserved for hijacked aircraft, 76XX for those with
communication failures, and 77XX for those declaring emergencies, so
that the total number of squawks available is actually less than 4096.

I got an ad from Raytheon today for a Mil-Spec version of the VAX (built
under license from DEC).  It is described as an "extreme performance machine
which survives tactical levels of nuclear weapons effects (NWE)."

On a related note, the June 15, 1987 issue of the trade paper ELECTRONIC 
ENGINEERING TIMES has an article called "Reveille for Military ASICs" (by
Terry Costlow, pps. 1 and 16).  It notes "Radiation hardening has been
viewed largely as an aerospace application, but it is now being included in
smaller weapons that are being produced in higher volumes than one-of-a-kind
spacecraft. 'We're seeing more nuclear weapons being designed for tactical 
battlefield conditions.  In the past, rad-hard was just used in weapons like
intercontinental missiles.  We feel this may be a nice emerging niche', says
(semiconductor vendor) NCR's (director of marketing Patrick) Riley."

Nothing to do with computers, but a very important point for system
designers. I was reading a book the other day in which the author
mentions the pang of fear that struck him on a plane one day, when
he noticed that the screws holding the ashtray to the seat did not
match. He instantly thought "Is this how they fix the engines too??".

Moral: Attention to the cosmetic details can play a great part in re-assuring
users (no matter how falsely!).

A few of you have received a UUCP message through "cbosgd" that intended to
demonstrate that systems are not really very secure and that it is easy to
bypass moderation on supposedly moderated news groups.  (The message in
question was written as a response to someone who thought that this might be
difficult!) The existence of that message should not surprise any readers of
RISKS, who by now have no trouble grasping the fact that there is no such
thing as complete security.  However, the message was sent not through
RISKS@CSL but through one of our innumerable redistribution points (and thus
was received by only a very small fraction of all RISKS readers).  The
possibility of doing that should not be a surprise, particularly in that
most local redistribution centers have been explicitly set up to be
automatic forwarders rather than requiring manual intervention.

A long time ago Dave Parnas objected to having his position papers on Star
Wars serialized in Soft-Eng@MIT-XX and circulated via netmail, partly
because there are no guarantees that the received message was actually
authentic.  (Crypto checksums could be used, although they create a new set
of vulnerabilities.)  Sooner or later someone will indeed post a bogus
message to the entire RISKS group, with fake authorship and bypassing my
moderation; I will then have to point out that I stated in RISKS-5.4 (and
earlier, as well) that it can of course be done.  (I have tried to use
TOPS-20 as sensibly as possible to make such immoderation nontrivial, but I
cannot seal off that possibility altogether.)  Besides, I would like to
believe that the RISKS community consists mostly of socially conscious and
thoughtful individuals, interested in learning and growing in awareness.

Careful RISKS readers must by now realize that I am probably the last person
in the world who would say that something is really secure -- I know that
NOTHING is, including the interposition (or imposition?) of RISKS moderation.  
I simply must rely on your sensitivity not to mount attacks.  We will soon
have to switch to a UNIX system on a Sun workstation as the RISKS source,
and at that point I would otherwise have to abandon all hope of moderation.

Telephone tidbits

[The Passive Aspect:]
 
No answer

University telephone users should be advised that when a University
telephone has been programmed for call forward busy/no answer, the caller
will hear three rings before the unanswered phone switches to its forwarded
number.  If that number is busy, however, the caller will not get a busy
signal but will continue to hear the ringing signal.  This is a problem with
the software for the system, according to the office of telecommunications,
for which there is no apparent solution.

[The Aggressive Aspect:]

Nothing in common

The full-feature electronic telephones called D-Terms now in use on the
University system are not compatible with Northwestern Bell or any other
telephone system.  Serious mishap, including explosion and fire, can occur
if these telephones are connected to the wrong system.

  A system at NORTHWESTERN.ARPA, [10.4.0.94], started advertising itself as a

Last week the local utility company was training the Customer Support Reps
(CSR) on the new procedures for emergency outages, such as during a storm.
There were several people from different areas in the company, all at the
main site.  One of the screens on the computer terminal used for handling
the emergency problems calls for the name of a printer to print the report.
One of the people involved could only remember the name of the printer in
the main operations for the company.  Needless to say, there were several
hurried phones calls after a utility company crew and police arrived at the
"scene of the downed power lines" to find no problem existing.  Fortunately,
the name of the CSR is on report, so they were able to track down the person
that way, and find out the false alarm.  A little while later the operations
room called back and asked if they had sent out a gas crew an hour before.

Remailed-to-RISKS by: ckk+@andrew.cmu.edu (Chris Koenigsberg)

We experienced serious file system losses on many of the VAX UNIX systems
this weekend beginning early in the morning on Saturday 6/20.  At that time,
a new system file which controls the disk purge operation was distributed
and failed on all of the VAX systems which received it.  On all but three
machines this operation was aborted after removing a substantial number of
its system files but before any private files were affected. These machines
were returned to service upon restoration of their system files during the
weekend.  The following machines:

    SPEECH2.CS.CMU.EDU	SAM.CS.CMU.EDU		 ME.RI.CMU.EDU

each also lost a large part of one of their private file partitions.  These
file partitions are in the process of being restored from tape backups and
the machines should be back in at least limited service by 1400 Monday, 6/22.

Normally, the particular disk purge operation in question would have
recursively removed all files in /usr/preserve that were more than a week
old.  However, on Saturday morning the mode of failure resulted in the
attempted recursive removal beginning at / of all files which were more than
a week old on each affected system.

Machines with (to our knowledge) only system files removed were:

    PH1.SPEECH.CS.CMU.EDU FAS.RI.CMU.EDU	GNOME.CS.CMU.EDU
    G.CS.CMU.EDU	  THEORY.CS.CMU.EDU	UNH.CS.CMU.EDU
    ROVER.RI.CMU.EDU	  ISL1.RI.CMU.EDU	IUS1.CS.CMU.EDU
    IUS2.CS.CMU.EDU	  SPEECH1.CS.CMU.EDU	CIVE.RI.CMU.EDU

Finally, a number of the VAX workstations were also affected.  Problems
have been corrected and all system files restored on:

    LAB.AGORA		EDJ.ARCHONS	EMC.CS	  	EP.FAC
    MRT.MACH		PIE5.MACH	A.NL	  	AMADEUS.PRODIGY
    DRAKON.RESDOC	F.SPEECH	G.SPEECH	Y.SPEECH
    SPEECH3		NDIFF.VLSI	D.SPEECH

Some workstations where a problem is suspected were inaccessible and have
not yet been checked and/or corrected.  We will attempt to track down and if
necessary correct problems with these systems on Monday.  You may also
contact the Operator at x2607 to report a problem if your machine appears to
be in this category,

So far as we know, no private files on any workstation examined so far were
removed and over all only VAX mainframe and workstation systems were
affected.  At this point, while we know what went wrong and where, we still
do not completely know why.

We do apologize for any inconvenience this failure has caused.

&gt;From: Peter G. Neumann &lt;Neumann@csl.sri.com&gt;
&gt;A few of you have received a UUCP message through "cbosgd" that intended to
&gt;demonstrate that systems are not really very secure and that it is easy to 
&gt;bypass moderation on supposedly moderated news groups...  However, the message
&gt;was sent not through RISKS@CSL but through one of our innumerable 
&gt;redistribution points (and thus was received by only a very small fraction of 
&gt;all RISKS readers).

Wrong.

The parochialism of our Arpanet brethren never ceases to amaze me.  The vast
majority of RISKS readers are on Usenet.  Usenet is far larger than the
Internet, Bitnet, etc, and almost every Usenet site that receives RISKS (alias
comp.risks).  UUCP is just a transport mechanism (Usenet != UUCP-net); many
ARPA Internet sites now receive their mailing lists Usenet-style using the
nntp system.  The forged article in question travelled to every Usenet site
(including those Internet sites that use nntp).  Usenet does not use mail,
but rather a flooding mechanism; every site sends it to all their downstream
links until everyone has the article.  If many people didn't see it, that's
because several people issued "cancel" messages to make it disappear.
(These messages were forged also).  -- - Joe Buck jbuck@epimass.EPI.COM

	      Old arpa mailers: jbuck%epimass.EPI.COM@seismo.css.gov

    [Thanks for the comments.  I maintain a large list of direct addresses to 
    redistribution centers (and a few individuals) on ARPANET, MILNET, CSNET, 
    BITNET, etcNET -- with many indirections -- and those readers simply did
    not get the message in question.  They did not miss anything.
    
    By the way, "forged" is not quite right.  On the basis of the dialogue,
    I conclude that the message was REALLY-FROM "apc".  It was just a public
    misuse of a useful but totally unsound facility -- subject to loss of
    privacy at each forwarding, loss of data integrity on any message, and 
    complete denial of service if a message is cancelled along the way.  (Use 
    of the RISKS banner and standard DIGEST format would have constituted
    forgery.  It is interesting to contrast this with Piet Beertema's 
    "Chernenko@MOSKVAX" -- Software Engineering Notes, vol 9, no 4, July
    1984.)  PGN]

  ... In its alter-ego, RISKS appears on the wild-and-wooly Usenet as the
  newsgroup comp.risks.  Netnews has lots of advantages over mailing lists but
  security isn't one of them.

  ... suffice it to say that ["apc" 's abuse of RISKS] was stupid and childish,
  and the tail-end of some totally absurd argument that has been going on for
  weeks all around the net.  Roy Smith, {allegra,cmcl2,philabs}!phri!roy ]
     [Note: There are advantages of unmoderated newsgroups and advantages
     of moderated newsgroups.  I try to maintain a relatively open policy
     (subject to the masthead guidelines); at least the "official" version  
     of RISKS will remain moderated.  PGN]

Boston (AP) - "A computer problem that blanked the radar screens of air
traffic controllers from New England to the Great Lakes for six minutes
delayed flights at Logan International Airport, but posed no hazard, an
official said.  When the outage occurred Saturday afternoon, planes
immediately were ordered to fly more slowly and at greater distances from
each other, according to Mike Ciccarelli, a spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration.  He said some flights were rerouted and planes
scheduled to fly into New England were ordered to remain on the ground.
'There were delays of incoming flights, naturally, because if they wanted
to leave Newark, for example, they couldn't,' Ciccarelli said.  He said
Logan has a separate monitoring system which kept the controllers in radar
contract(sic) with flying aircraft."

   [The SF Chron reported this on 21 Jun 87.  After quoting Ciccarelli that
   there was no hazard for air travelers, it went on to say, ``... although a 
   controller who asked not to be identified described the situation as
   "very dangerous".''  Increasingly the air traffic control operations are
   coming under scrutiny.  Oprah Winfrey had a fine show the other day.  PGN]

The following article was in comp.misc on Usenet.  It was posted as a

a separate topic and an interesting hazard. [Forwarded to Risks by Mark Brader]

  In the late '70's, I worked at the Library of Congress.  We had
  IBM and Amdahl mainframes with STC tape drives as our main data base
  machines.  Given the role of the world's largest library, our computer
  room received considerable attention.
  
  The British Broadcasting Corporation was given access to much of 
  the Library, to film a documentary.  We found that some major system
  crashes began to happen when they were in the computer room.  We 
  thought it might be their video equipment, floods, etc., but could
  not find the cause.
  
  The symptom was clear:  periodically, ALL of our tape drives would
  simultaneously stop, rewind, and unload, no matter what they were
  doing.  The operating system could not deal with such simultaneous
  events, and would crash.
  
  It turned out to be an intermittent event:  most BBC work was film
  or video, but they occasionally took still photographs.  When their
  electronic flash pointed at the front of the tape drives, the short
  burst of light was reflected into the photoelectric end-of-tape
  sensors of each tape drive, causing EVERYTHING to simultaneously
  sense (erroneously) end-of-tape.

Keywords: Electronic steering, fly-by-wire
Organization: Eikonix Corp., Bedford, MA

Several months ago I posted an article to comp.risks (RISKS 4.46) about the
electronic steering in the Pontiac Pursuit project car.  All four wheels on
the car can be steered, and the force required to turn the wheels comes from
DC powered motors that are computer controlled.  There is no direct physical
connection from the steering wheel to any of the wheels.  This article
triggered a small debate in RISKS over the use of electronics in automobiles.

The June 22, 1987 issue of AUTOWEEK contains a follow up story on the Pursuit.
They took a test drive of the car, fortunately at a closed race track rather
than on the highway.  During the test drive, the car ran out of gas.  When
the engine stopped, so did the 24-volt alternators which supply power to
the steering system. The steering failed, and the car ran off the track!  
Apparently there was no battery backup for the 24-volt system.

NASA NEWS
NASA ESTABLISHES SAFETY REPORTING SYSTEM
	NASA has established a voluntary, confidential safety reporting
system for its 100,000 employees and contractor personnel to alert NASA
management of safety concerns.
	The new reporting system supplements existing safety reporting
procedures and, initially, will focus on safety concerns associated with
NASA's Space Transportation System, more familiarly known as the Space
Shuttle program. The new system is being established as a result of the
Shuttle Challenger accident.
	The NASA Safety Reporting System (NSRS) will encourage employees
to supplement existing safety reporting procedures by completing and 
submitting an NSRS confidential report form to Battelle Memorial Institute's
Columbus Division, Columbus, Ohio. Battelle Institute is under contract
to NASA to develop and administer the NSRS for NASA Headquarters'
Safety Division. 
	Use of the NSRS report form will provide anonymity to the maximum
extent possible within the law for individuals disclosing their safety
concerns. The form will contain a section at the top for individuals to
include their names, addresses and telephone numbers.
	Upon receipt of the report form, the Battelle NSRS team will
remove this top section unless team members determine that additional
data would be useful. If so, the team will contact the sender for the
needed information and then remove, stamp and return the top section
to the sender as proof that the sender has successfully filed a NSRS
report. No record will be maintained of reporting individual's identities.
	Battelle NSRS and NASA specialists then will determine whether
the reported concern is of a critical nature requiring immediate action.
	The Battelle NSRS team will summarize all reported concerns, 
store the deidentified data in a computerized data management system
and forward summaries to the NASA Headquarters Safety Division for
further analyses in cooperation with a technical advisory group.
	The Safety Division and technical advisory group also will
determine what corrective action should be taken and track the 
resolution of these recommendations.

A comment on anonymous reporting systems: the AEC (then ERDA, then NRC
and the DOE) have had such a reporting system for years.  Every nuclear
facility in the country has a special phone with a direct line to
Washington DC, but it is rarely used and is poorly maintained.  Many
"employee suggestion" programs have not worked for various fears.
Some have supposedily worked in Japan.  I have noted no such systems
on computers since E-mail always has had return addresses.  What can
we do to get people to use such systems?

Recently Rice University was the victim of a little Internet EGP madness.  I
will try to give a coherent summary, though we still don't know how it came
about.

Sometime in the evening of June 23, Libra.Rice.EDU, Rice's ARPANET gateway,
started receiving packets destined for "css-ether" (Center for Seismic
Studies Ethernet, including the machine "seismo.css.gov") and "univ-ariz"
(University of Arizona Ethernet).  Libra.Rice.EDU (10.4.0.62, 128.42.1.64)
is an LSI-11 running Dave Mills's "Fuzzball" software.  Because of the
address space limitations of the PDP-11 architecture, Libra occasionally
runs out of room in its routing table.  We suspected that such an event
might have confused Libra's EGP to the point where it sent out bogus routing
updates.

A quick check showed that Libra still knew the correct routes to css-ether
and univ-ariz.  Still, we were worried because the tables were in fact full,
so we took the gateway down for about an hour around Midnight and restarted
it with expanded tables.  We then did our best to determine that we were not
advertising ourselves as a gateway to either network.

After midnight, we continued to receive packets destined for seismo, with
sustained traffic about 4 times higher than normal.  We called BBN the
following morning (June 24), and learned that bbnnet2-arpanet-gw, one of the
three "public" EGP-speaking core gateways, continued to list us as the
gateway, with metric 2, for css-ether and univ-ariz.  The other two core
gateways had the correct routes, and BBN confirmed that Libra was
advertising only legitimate routes. The erroneous traffic fell off markedly
when bbnnet2-arpanet-gw was rebooted that afternoon, but occasional
misdirected packets persisted until late this morning (June 25).

The same evening that Libra's gateway tables filled up, BBN had loaded "new
test software" into that gateway machine, so there is no clear smoking gun
here.

This story has a "happy ending", because our Fuzzball stayed up the
whole time and dutifully forwarded packets and sent ICMP squawks to the
offending machines.

Now, the bad part.  At least 78 hosts were fooled (that is, 78 hosts
were fooled in some given hour, because the log file wrapped around
about once per hour), including machines from nets 8, 10, 18, 26,
128.{8,32,41,45,59,83,84,95,102,103,104,105,115,121}, 192.1.2,
192.5.{25,58} and 192.12.{31,33,119,206,221}.  We don't know the cause
of this problem, but it does seem like a bit of a security hole.  We
could easily have wiretapped all the traffic for seismo.css.gov, or
even substituted our own more "interesting" packets.  Thus we were
particularly amused to find traffic from Milnet hosts (11 of them)
passing through us.

Interesting. During the time you report loyal fuzzball linkabit-gw was
having exactly the same problem, mounds and mounds of traffic sloshing
in and getting dutifully redirected. However, another fuzzball dcn-gw
was having no such prolem. All squawk the same EGP code as yours and
linkabit-gw at least has the same table-space problem as yours.

There is a clue in the clock-synchronization system that you may have
noticed. I began seeing frequent clock resets, with measured roundtrip
times one hop away as the ARPANET flies reaching twenty seconds or
more (!?). When I checked the INOC for core gateway routes, I found
the directly-connected macomnet client of linkabit-gw as reachable
via purdue-gw! Something was badly wrong in the core system.

Prompted by a note from Joe Weening at SU, I found a wee bug in the fuzzball
EGP code that would, under bizarre conditions I hastily add, result in a
nonsense address in a redirect message sent by the fuzz. The bog is now
fixed in linkabit-gw and dcn-gw. I can't see how the bog would affect the
slosh you an I saw over the last few days anyway, but it might under unlikely
conditions result in a j-random host, having mistakenly been redirected to
your gateway, not being redirected back to the proper gateway.

I forgot to add that table overflow will not affect what you send the
core, only what you can reach. If the table does overflow, the net(s)
lost will appear unreachable. I'm working on that. Also, I saw evidence
that the core tables were being corrupted with martians (net 112?!)
that reached back to touch us in the swamps. I also saw broadcasts
(sic) coming from a 128.205 hosts landing at linkabit-gw, truly a
martian who lost his compass.

  Subject: ATTENTION ALL MICRO USERS!!! FCC INFORMATION TAX AHEAD!!
  Date: 12 Jun 87 15:13:37 GMT
  
  	A terrible piece of news I just read about in the New York Times
  this morning.  The FCC just voted 4-0 to impose a $4.50 - $5.50 an HOUR
  tax on people who are using the phone system to transmit information
  across state lines.  This INCLUDES anyone hooking up to a network,
  not just people dialing out of state!!  I suppose people dialing
  into a system with access to Arpanet or even USENET might be charged
  this tax; the information services (Compuserve, etc.) are slated
  to be charged this tax as of January 1.  This is an outrageous tax
  which would squelch the burgeoning telecommunications industry,
  and is totally unjustified.  I would urge people to write letters
  to their Congressman to protest this unfair and exorbitant "information
  tax" which is based on superstition and lack of understanding of
  the telecommunications industry.

... is a piece of software that actually makes a computer blow up just
like in the movies.  This is long overdue.  "Lay" people are extremely
disappointed when a program or system grinds/wheezes to a halt with some wimpy
message like "B037X: USER ERROR IN GAPX TABLE" or "CATASTROPHIC SYSTEM FAILURE:
BUFFER OVERFLOW INDICATOR OVERFLOW" or "Bus error - core dumped".  They want
to see explosions!  Paper spewing out from wherever paper spews out from!
And gicky fluid oozing out of the machinery as the entire machine room
collapses onto itself because someone either forgot to put a %*&amp;#*$#&amp;@ in
column 92 or asked the computer an impossible question like "What's the
meaning of life?", "Why?", "CAN you get there from here?", "Calculate pi to
the last digit" [THAT'S NOT A QUESTION!], or "Where's the bathroom?"  That's
a worthy goal for computer technologists everywhere.  Forget artificial
intelligence!  Forget relational databases!  Forget distributed network
architecture proposal interface protocols!  Forget documentation!  Forget
associative memory!  Let's make computers explode in our lifetime!!!

A small step was taken toward this end back in the early sixties, in IBM's
System/360 model 30 CE school.  Seems one of the better students had time
enough to pore over the schematics and discover which cores (remember core
memory?) were located just beneath the overtemp sensor.  He wrote a small
program that did nothing but abuse those particular cores by writing ones
and zeroes alternately to them, until they heated up, and the temperature
sensor shut down the machine.

First, of course, the program printed out "Programmed Power Down" on the
console.  Caused a lot of bewilderment among the students and instructors.
Especially since the big feature being touted about the S/360 was that it
was so oriented to multiprogramming that it didn't even have a HALT
instruction.

[Then there was a string of articles (actually, this may have been a sep-

 pointing out that a number of modern computers have a software-handled

 stuck.  These articles were then nicely topped by this one:  --msb]

Some years ago I worked on a battery-powered instrument (it would run 24 to
48 hours on batteries) in which the project manager insisted that the OFF
switch should be an interrupt to the CPU, which would then power itself
down.

You guessed it.. the uP derailed and the only ways to get it back were:
1. Open the instrument up and yank the battery leads, or
2. Pull it off the charger and wait a day or two.

Fortunately (:-) it never made it to market.

Um.... many computers built for military applications contain a "trap door"
that can be reached by an assembly sequence that will direct the transformer
or power supply *input* onto the motherboard.  Manufacturers of this type of
computer include HP and Litton.  This "feature" is supposed to be used to
destroy your computer as the installation is being overrun by the enemy.
Since most of these suckers use large DC generators as input to the
transformers/power supplies, you can imagine the fireworks that occur when
this stuff reaches all those cute little ICs. ;-)

It was supposed to leave the attackers with molten sludge.

The following story was related to me by employees of
I.P. Sharp Associates (IPS).  They, with Scientific Time 
Sharing Corp. (STSC) wrote APL for IBM back in the early days.

It seems that there started to be competitors to IPS/STSC's APL system.
These companies would usually use IBMs APL (written by IPS/STSC)
on their large IBM mainframes.  Sometimes they would add extra
bulletproofing so that APL would not bomb, get better performance, etc.

Now, IPS/STSC really knew APL (and the IBM implementation) very well.
In fact, an employee living in Palo Alto would debug/enhance the
production on-line APL system from his home!

There were people across North America and in Europe (at that time) using
this single mainframe (360/158 I think).  The computer was in Toronto Canada.

Anyway, a competitor named Manhattan APL (I think) called up IPS and said
they were about to come online and if IPS wanted to, they could test
the system.  Manhattan said they had filled in all the holes and the system
was unbreakable.

Manhattan APL came online for their customers about 2 months late.
It seems that some of their disk drives had thrashed themselves to death.

I inadvertently wrote a BASIC program on an HP2000 at George Mason University
that blew up the disk drive.  It was an 8 player real time space war game.
The problem was that all interprocess communication had to take place via
disk.  I used the documented LOCK function for serialization.  It seems that
this function loaded a special OS overlay whenever invoked and reloaded 
the file I/O overlay directly afterward.  With 8 programs doing this
as fast as possible, the disk would die.

The problem was solved by using an undocumented feature of the scheduler.
A process was always assigned 1 sec of CPU following completion of a wait
for terminal I/O.  This allowed serialization with careful coding while
not using the LOCK overlay.

BTW, an IBM PC program can blow up the monitor and video cards by programming
nasty parameters into the video controller chip.

The CompuColor 2 personal computer of about the 1978-80 era could be made
to fry itself from BASIC. A simple FOR loop outputting 1-255 into a certain
I/O address (it's Z-80 based) caused the screen to blank in an entertaining
fashion, followed by the smell of smoke. You had to pull the plug at the
wall to get it to stop. I was totally amazed. Just think of the possibilities.
I don't know exactly what was going on, but I suspect that they had too much
trust in software and used the CPU to control such things as the power supply
so they could save $5 worth of chips.

When I was in high school, we had several SWTPC 6800 machines, of
slightly post-Altair vintage.  They had 32k of RAM (a lot at the time),
5-1/4" single density drives that held around 90k, a CP/M-like operating
system, and you had to boot them by calling the disk boot rom from the
monitor.

Anyway, I saw demonstrated (not with the school's permission, as you can
probably guess) a program called "DEATH" which did a number of destructive
things including stepping the drives out of range and apparently using this
opcode you mention.  I remember the main board going in for service after
that and coming back with lots of new chips.  I never knew how a program
could do this until now...

(Don't take everything I said as absolute truth... my memory is a bit
fuzzy... I do distinctly remember the computer being fried by that program,
though.  And no, I was not the one who did that... I was only a spectator)

On another note, some of the earlier Commodore PET's had a register in
their video controller that set the number of scan lines (or something like
that).  On some of them, you could tweak this register to get a better looking
screen display.  On others, doing so would toast the video circuitry.  While
this is not strictly in the "exploding computer" category, in the PETs the
monitor WAS in the same case, so it has the same effect on the poor guy who
watches it happen :-)

A few years back, PC magazine and PC World published claims that it was 
possible to program the video controller chip in the CGA
(Computer Graphice Adapter) video adapter board
so that an ordinary color monitor's flyback transformer would overheat
and catch fire. Has anybody done this? Is it included in anyone's copy
detection? Anyone's error handler?

It should be real simple to do. That chip gives you pretty good control
over the video waveform, so you ought to be able to play with the timing
of the horizontal sync pulse, (which, as I remember, was the way the trick
was done.) has anybody extened these techniques to the more sophisticated
EGA (Extended Graphics), and PGA (Professional Graphics).

In the 1880's the Canadian Pacific Railway wanted a line between Montreal
and Toronto but could neither afford to build one nor to buy out an existing
railway.  So what they did was to take a perpetual lease on an existing
railway, the Ontario and Quebec.  Later they did buy up O&amp;Q stock until
they held 80% of it.

Along with the O&amp;Q came land in Toronto and Montreal that is now of great
value.  Over the years the CPR sold off this land.  Finally someone noticed
that they didn't really own it, bought up some O&amp;Q shares, and brought suit
against the CPR.  The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.
Just before the court decision the O&amp;Q shares were valued at $15,000 (Can.)
each.  A ruling for the O&amp;Q would likely raise that by a factor of 10 or more
-- and a ruling for the CPR would drop it by a factor of 10 or more!

The court ruled for the CPR, and the stock dropped $14,100 per share in
one day (and more the next day).  But there was no entry in the stock
market columns for this remarkable change (the stock was listed as not
traded).  According to the Toronto Star, "a Toronto Stock Exchange computer
interpreted the sharp drop reported by stockbrokers as an error".

From the June 30 Edition of the San Diego Union:

                  PacBell's Service is Disrupted: 
       Computer glitch snarls multitude of 619 area calls

     A computer program glitch disrupted telephone service in San Diego and
Imperial Counties for several hours yesterday, potentially affecting all 1.1
million Pacific Bell customers in the two-county area.  The breakdown came
on the busiest workday of the year's busiest telephone season.  A major
malfunction in the computerized switching equipment at the company's main
station in Hillcrest prevented many long-distance calls from going through
the 619 area code, Pacific Bell spokesmen said.  Affected were both local
and long-distance toll calls.

     Pacific bell noticed calls backing up on its monitor at around 9:30 AM.
By late afternoon, technicians had traced the problem to a mysterious
foul-up in the programs -- the only part of the enormous computer, installed
in 1984 and working since without a hitch, that has been updated frequently,
a company spokesman said.  The system was shut down at 10:56 AM for 152
seconds -- a record.  Then the computer had to be reloaded, trunk line by
trunk line, while the search continued for the problem.  By 6 PM, most of
the system was back in service.

(The story goes on to describe the local impact, especially on the
long-distance companies who weren't at fault.)

  &gt;From: Eugene Miya N. &lt;eugene@ames-pioneer.arpa&gt;                [RISKS-5.5]
  &gt;NASA has established a voluntary, confidential safety reporting system ...

For many years, NASA has operated the Aviation Safety Reporting System
(ASRS) for the FAA.  It has been quite successful, producing important
information about flight safety.

The ASRS has two key features to encourage participation: immunity and
confidentiality.  When someone reports an incident to the ASRS, he/she
gains immunity from FAA disciplinary action for inadvertent errors
associated with it (deliberate actions are not protected).  NASA ensures
confidentiality by separating the identifying information from the report
during initial processing.  The reporter receives a numbered receipt which
can be used to prove that he/she reported the incident to ASRS.  Without
the receipt, the reporter cannot be identified.

The ASRS works because it offers an inducement for reporting (immunity),
and provides reliable confidentiality.  It probably helps that the program
is operated by a trusted, independent agency.

The notion that the proposed access charges for enhanced service providers
represents some kind of "information tax" seems to be remarkably popular.
Of course, it's total nonsense.  The FCC is merely suggesting that Tymnet,
Telenet, etc. no longer be exempt from the access charges that all other
services (e.g., long distance voice) must pay for connection to the local
telephone network.

The original exemption was to protect a "fledgling industry."  Whether the
industry can now compete on an equal basis with AT&amp;T and MCI remains to be
seen.

The computer-related risk here seems to be in how easy it is to forget that
our networks are being heavily subsidized by both private and public money.

RISKS-5.5 reprinted part of a newspaper story:

  Boston (AP) - "A computer problem that blanked the radar screens of air
  traffic controllers from New England to the Great Lakes for six minutes
  delayed flights at Logan International Airport, but posed no hazard, an
  official said....

This is at best vague and pointlessly inflammatory; at worst it's nonsense.

The key question is: was more than one installation affected?  What exactly
does "from New England to the Great Lakes" mean?  If they mean more than one
site, how could that have happened?  Are ATC computers networked together in
such a way that a crash can propagate? (I doubt it; as I understand it they're
too old to know about things like networks).  If not networks, then perhaps it
was a common mode power failure.  At sites several hundred miles apart?  I
doubt it.  If more than one site, then why were only the Logan flights
delayed?  How exactly could more than one site be affected at the same time
and for the same duration?  And in what conceivable sense was it "a computer
problem"?  A common mode software bug?  One that bit all the places at the
same instant?

It's considerably more likely that what they really meant was something like
"One computer failed today for six minutes at Logan airport."  Presumably the
longer-range radar at Logan tracks some flights as far as Lake Ontario (about
500 mi).  It's also possible that there are ATC centers in Montreal, Toronto,
Buffalo, Detroit, New York, Cleveland, Columbus, etc. etc., (all within the
same 500 mi. range) that were capable of tracking those flights, in addition
to the backup system mentioned in the story.  It's also interesting that
there's still sufficient flexibility in the ATC system that simply slowing
things down handled the problem.

The problem is that "One air traffic control system halted for six minutes
today at Logan airport" and "it didn't matter at all," just isn't much of a
story.  Not nearly anxiety producing enough; not nearly technophobic.

Imagine the same story written with a slightly different viewpoint: "The
reliability of our rather old ATC system was demonstrated today when the
system at Logan airport failed completely for six minutes.  Even though flites
as far as 500 miles away were affected, the problem was easily handled by the
existing procedures for slowing down some flights and keeping others on the
ground, made possible by the routine use of backup communication systems
designed for this purpose."

There are as I understand it abundant problems in getting ATC done right,
ranging from reliable sw and hw to reliable organizations of people and
alignment of responsibilities.  It's best we attend to the real problems and
try to discourage nonsense like this.  Tell your local newspaper they really
do have to get the facts correct.

The airmiss was allegedly due to the display equipment not showing details
of an aircraft because it had a duplicate SSR transponder code...

But aircraft without an assigned code all have the same code (1234 in
UK, 1200(?) in US); similarly emergency traffic all uses a small
number of not-guaranteed-unique codes; so this can't be the entire
explanation... (one hopes!)

The following letter is from the  syndicated column by advice-giver Ann
Landers,  which I saw in the 1 July 1987 (Providence,  RI)  *Journal*.
Though it addresses  real RISKs concerns,  I include it  more for its
giggle value.

               PHONE COMPANY GIVES SOMETHING FOR NOTHING

Dear Ann,

I think I can top the person who wrote complaining about the idiocy of the
phone company.  Talk about garbage in, garbage out!

When AT&amp;T split with Bell, we had three phones in our house.  The equipment
belonged to Ma Bell and the service belonged to AT&amp;T.  After we returned all
the phone equipment to Ma Bell, we received a bill for $0.00.  A few weeks
later, we received a check for $5 and a note thanking us.  Several months
later, we received another computerized bill for $0.00.  We called again,
got nowhere, so we sent another check for $0.00.  A few weeks later we
received another $5 refund with the same thank you.

This went on every three months for two years.  Now we are down to once a
year and have given up trying to straighten this out.  We just cash the $5
and forget about it.

Here's something to chew on.

%T DOD Gives Software Developers More Leeway In Writing Code
%J Electronics
%V 60
%N 12
%P 99
%D June 11, 1987
%O Military/Aerospace Newsletter (department)
%K SDS 2167/A Top-Down Methodology Waiver
%X Military contractors no longer will be forced to use top-down methodology --
in which design and coding of computer programs use a hierarchical structure --
when developing software for the Department of Defense.  The Pentagon has
revised its two-year-old Defense System Software Development Standard,
designated 2167, and will issue the new version, 2167/A, on June 30.  The
document spells out what the DOD expects from software contractors and gives
them more leeway in writing code than the original standard.  Although the
DOD revised 2167 in response to industry dissatisfaction with the standard,
some software suppliers are calling for further changes, such as provisions
for rapid prototyping.  Howard L. Yudkin, president of the Software
Productivity Consortium, a Reston, Va., group respresenting 14 aerospace
companies, is pushing for an industry position on where and how to use and
not use 2167.  The DOD, he says, should "recognize Standard 2167 as good for
the engineering development phase for which it was intended, but not for
advanced development."  The Pentagon's Computer Software Management Subgroup,
the joint-services committee responsible for 2167 revisions and compliance,
believes that 2167 coverage of rapid prototyping is premature, according to
Air Force Capt. Rick Schmidt, committee chairman.
%X That is the entirety of the announcement.  Having not seen the revised
standard (and not being a follower of the original, for that matter), I can't
ascertain whether this is a dangerous situation or not.  But it reminds me
that the reputation of the Go To is being restored in the letters sections
of Communications of the ACM, also.

I don't know how much this subject has been hashed/re-hashed in RISKS,
but a paragraph from an article in _Mustang Monthly_ caught my eye.  The
gist of the article is on boosting the horsepower of the new Mustangs.

&gt;  From: "Free Horsepower for HOs!" (Mustang Monthly, July 1987)
&gt;
&gt;      To get a more immediate horsepower boost from the elimination
&gt;      of the intake silence, disconnect the negative post on the 
&gt;      battery for at least 45 seconds to erase the computer's memory.
&gt;      That way, when you crank the engine again, the computer will
&gt;      immediately begin monitoring the fuel mixture to compensate for
&gt;      the extra air flowing into the fuel injection.  Be sure to 
&gt;      disconnect the negative post;  if you disconnect the positive
&gt;      post, the reconnection could cause a power surge that could 
&gt;      possibly damage the computer.

The Mustang freaks here where I work (including myself) were interested in
these tips, but as computer people, we were more intrigued by the last bit
about damaging the computer and erasing the memory.  A couple of questions:

   1) If disconnecting the negative post will erase the computer's memory,
      what happens when your battery dies?  Or _you_ yourself take the 
      battery off for some reason?  Does that also erase it, or does taking
      the positive post off within 45 seconds somehow keep you from losing 
      the memory?

   2) From that, what exactly do you lose when the memory is erased?

   3) Is this mentioned by Ford manuals or any shop manuals (i.e. Chilton's)?
      I know dealers don't mention this - my family just bought a Sable, and
      I would presume that the computers are basically the same, and our 
      salesman never mentioned it.

   4) What does this do with emissions control?  Some counties in Maryland
      have regular testing - would you still pass with the fuel being mixed
      differently?

Whatever information anyone could provide would be greatly
appreciated.  Thanks.                                           Shaun

On the 4th of July in Santa Fe, New Mexico, a prisoner kidnapped one guard,
shot another, commandeered the control center, and released six other
prisoners.  All 7 went through an emergency roof door, pole-vaulted over a
barbed-wire prison fence, and disappeared.  The guard tower was being
staffed only during daylight hours ``because of financial restrictions'' (SF
Chronicle, 6 Jul 1987).  A PBS item noted that the prison computer control
system was down at the time, and otherwise would have prevented the escape!

     I read recently of some problems that Intel had with the 32-bit
multiply instruction on their 80386 processors.  I am surprised that this
sort of problem does not occur more often: an obscure hardware bug which
sometimes gives incorrect answers.  All the emphasis is on software bugs.
The assumption is that hardware will work or fail catastrophically, or that
error correcting circuits will detect problems.  Is this always so?
     How often do microprocessors fail in minor ways?  People have written
about proving correctness of code: it is not possible to prove the
correctness of hardware.  For example, a complete test of a 32 bit
multiplier would require 2**64, or 1.8E19 operations.  (A year has only
3E13 microseconds.)  Even without complete tests, writing diagnostic
programs was extremely difficult when various margin and worst case
conditions had to be considered.  For example, memory diagnostic programs
moved themselves around in memory; they would write bit patterns of 1's,
0's, alternating 10's and 01's, actual addresses into locations, and so on.
     Hardware problems can also be bizarre.  My favorite was during an
experiment at sea.  We were recording data, and occasionally the magnetic
tape unit would hang.  Putting cards on extender boards to check signals
showed us that sometimes the tape was erroneously showing up busy, and
sometimes the computer couldn't even find the tape.  Some hours later, we
found a small (1-2 mm) piece of loose wire in the back plane.  As the ship
rolled, the wire would sometimes short out the busy line, and sometimes
short out a line which changed the physical address of the drive.  We had
another problem (this on land) where the card side of a backplane had been
painted; tiny paint chips fell off and short/open circuited various cards.
We only found it when someone took out all the cards and noticed the paint.
Can't happen again?  I read recently that a radar in a US fighter plane was
having intermittent problems.  The problem was tin whiskers which grew
inside an IC, were shaken loose by vibrations and sometimes caused internal
shorts.  Everything repeats, only different.

The last time I moved, I have noticed that certains organizations were
becoming slower in accepting change of address notices. I have been
receiving mail to my old address even after some mail (all computer printed)
had already been sent to my new address. Some organizations had to be
notified several times in writing, by phone and in person.

The latter revealed a possible explanation to this phenomenon:  Many
departments acquired PC's lately and kept their own personal 'phone books';
in effect they have created a distributed database, without the discipline
and procedures needed to manage it.  Changes to the organization's central
DB did not propagate well, if at all, to these small personal DB's.

It seems that nowadays when dealing with a big organization, one has to
notify them of any change in writing, so that the central DB would be
updated; then by phone or in person, directly to the department one is
dealing with, so that the change would *really* be done.  So far this has not
been a risk, only a nuisance. Horror stories, anyone?

Perhaps it isn't correct to call it a tax - though it has never been
made clear just who is to get the money.  But it is hardly "nonsense"
to criticize it.  The same bandwidth that supports one voice link
supports fifty 1200-baud data links.  In practice, far more, because of
packet switching - i.e., 1200-baud data is not usually sent continuously.

Charge $5 an hour for a 1200 baud link?  Only if at least $250 an hour
is charged for voice lines!

If this bill passes, it will no longer be profitable to sublet small
slices of T1 lines.  There will be no reason not use use a full 56kb
voice band line even for 300 baud data.

The only ones who will benefit from this radical decrease of efficiency
are those who will profit from installing unneeded new bandwidth, to be
used in this inefficient manner.  I say, if they can't compete in the
free market, tough.  Don't let them trash our freedom to communicate.

If this passes, it will keep me off the net, since my networking cost
would go from $25 a month to over $2000 a month.  I don't believe
that anyone is subsidizing this.  As far as the local phone company is
concerned, it's just another local call, and it is absurd to suggest
it costs them any more than any other local call.  As long as competing
local phone companies are not allowed, it is outrageous to allow the
one local phone company to take one's data hostage, demanding thousands
of dollars for what costs them pennies, for no better reason than that
they can get away with it.

I would also question how the FCC can make laws.  That is the perogative
of Congress, and I see nothing in the Constitution allowing them to
delegate their power to unelected bureaucrats.

There is a computer game about "Geopolitics in the nuclear age" called
BALANCE OF POWER.  It is sold at least for Commodore Amiga.  I bought one and
now master the beginners level -- being able to beat Soviet Union.  (We Finns 
have tried that twice before...)  I do not have time and interest to do that
on the expert level, as I find many other things more interesting to do.

What does interest me is how people in the USA percieve the world view of
this game.  Do you think it is reasonable?  There may be some risk in
designing games simulating international affairs, if they are seemingly
realistic.  Some childish people may take them as the truth.

&gt; For many years, NASA has operated the Aviation Safety Reporting System

&gt;...
&gt; The ASRS works because it offers an inducement for reporting (immunity),

I think that the past tense should be used here.  I'm just going from memory,
but I recall that in the late '70s the immunity provisions were dropped and
ASRS quickly faded into oblivion.  If it is still in operation, few pilots
(including me) are aware of it.

The following appeared in the Wednesday (24-Jun) New York Times, in the
Metropolitan Diary, a weekly column of "human interest" stories sent in
by readers:

	A small sign was taped to a building on West 120th Street near
	Amsterdam Avenue, and Ellen Shaw of Scotch Plains, N.J., noticed
	it as she passed by.  It was a discreet advertiesement for a
	nearby stand run by three young entrepreneurs - two boys and a
	girl - who were selling iced tea, cola and cookies.

	Ms. Shaw ordered tea and offered the youngsters a suggestion:
	"You may want to make a bigger sign," she said.  "That one is
	really not to noticeable."

	"I know," said one of the boys, gesturing toward one of his
	partners, "but that's as big as his computer makes them."

	He paused, thought for a moment, and slapped his forehead.  "Hey,
	I've got it!" he exclaimed.  "Maybe we could DRAW a bigger sign!"	

	The tea, incidentally, was herbal.

         ``Big Red'' seems to be a Trojan horse, not a virus, but then
         the article contains a few other technical curiosities as well.  PGN]

&gt;   From: DParker@Stripe.SRI.Com &lt;Donn Parker&gt;
&gt;   Subject: Australian Computer Crime                   [From <A HREF="/Risks/4.94.html">RISKS-4.94</A>]
&gt; 
&gt;   A sophisticated computer crime occurred in Australia recently...  A 
&gt;   disgruntled employee modified PC circuit boards.  One called "Icepick" 
&gt;   attacked ACF-2 on an IBM mainframe.  The other called "Big Red" was 
&gt;   used in a virus attack.

From "The Australian", Tues, 14th April 1987, page 41.

LOCAL CRIME TEAM CRACKS THE RIDDLE OF BIG RED
=============================================

The lethal computer virus known as Big Red has been tracked down and beaten
by a team of Australian computer crime investigators, solving a riddle that
has eluded foreign experts.  The so-called virus has been held responsible
for a string of computer disasters in several countries since it was first
detected in a NASA system in the United States in 1985.  It is generated by
an advanced technology device planted in computer systems.  At least 50 Big
Red devices have been found in the US, England and Australia in banking and
information-handling systems, but have never been cracked before.

Mr Stuart Gill, head of the Australian team that cracked the virus,
described Big Red as a "solid state data diddling device capable of breaking
encryption devices and corrupting data".  Mr Gill said his team had found
Big Red in the computer system of a "medium-sized Australian company that
handles very sensitive information".  He said the device was being used to
capture and store encrypted word-processing data in the contracts division
of the NSW-based company.

It was imbedded in the thick resin that had frustrated previous attempts to
examine the inner workings of the system.  "It is the first time anywhere in
the world that somebody has been able to find one in an operating
environment and find out how it works," Mr Gill said.

The investigation exposed the actual workings of the system, including
its circuitry, how it is connected with computer systems, the interface
with security control systems and the device's power source.

It confirmed that Big Red, frequently regarded as a part of industry
mythology, operates as a parasitic operating system within a host
environment.  "A lot of rumours and a lot of folklore have built up around
Big Red," Mr Gill said.  "The device is not as sophisticated and
comprehensive as it has been rumoured to be."  

There is now no doubt that Big Red has the power to transfer encrypted data
from legitimate files into "invisible" files, which can be accessed by users
without disturbing the host's access control and encryption systems.

Mr Gill also demonstrated another suspect device, designed to function as a
stand-alone system and probably used to operate an illegal gambling machine
disguised as a computer game.

Both devices were found by an investigation team led by Mr Gill, one of
Australia's leading experts on the unauthorised use of computer systems.
His five-member investigation team took 19 hours to uncover, analyse,
anaesthetise and remove Big Red from a host computer system where it had
been planted inside a terminal.  The team, part of the Melbourne-based
Comreco Computer Security, was called in by the company involved after
management, using an audit trail, had discovered that the host system was
being used after hours.  

Half pages of encrypted wordprocessing data were "just disappearing off the
face of the Earth".  The disappearence of the pages resulted from a
malfunction in the Big Red device, which normally "echoes" the appropriated
data back into its legitimate file, leaving no sign of unauthorised
activity.  "As far as I can tell, part of the circuit was burnt out.  It was
there for about three months," Mr Gill said.

A circuit test procedure revealed a trace of circuit activity that was not
part of the normal system's operation and the team "found the activity of
Big Red as it detected that the normal system was being shut down".  "I
thought to myself, now that I have you, the question is where the hell are
you?  The system had 50 terminals," Mr Gill said.

Big Red was found in an unused terminal, where Mr Gill suspects it was
planted by someone using "the old `I'm here to service the PCs' lurk".  "My
advice to anybody is that if you have a workstation that is going to be
unused for any given length of time, pull it out," he said.

The device was identified using several criteria, including the small red
LED, which gave the system its name.  It lights up when the system is
operational.  "Its location in the communications port of the terminal, the
resin casing and the red circuit board were all pointers to Big Red.

"We found it after twelve hours and it took another 7 hours to actually
determine what it was doing," Mr Gill said.  "I wasn't sure whether to
remove Big Red from the system or bring the computer here (to Comreco's
office) and surgically remove it.  "Sparks flew when we pulled it out but
that was all."

[The article goes on to say that this shows that Australian companies are
capable of coping with high tech security, and that if American companies
are thinking of setting up shop here, they will meet stiff competition.]

I can't find information that is a more technical description of Big Red,
or whether they caught the person who installed the device.

The federal panel report blamed the air traffic control system itself for
the Aeromexico crash, although it also blamed the entry of the smaller plane
into the restricted airspace.  It criticized ``limitations'' of the control
system's policy of relying on pilots scanning the skies for other aircraft
instead of advising planes under their control about other planes that are
flying under visual flight rules.  Board members also noted an apparent
weakness in the radar signal, which may have made the small plane less
noticeable.  The safety board tried not to blame either the controller or
the pilots, but said that the controller should have seen the Piper -- it
was on his radar screen, although the controller has maintained it was not.
(AP item in SF Chron 8 July 1987)

Last night's evening news noted that Delta Airlines has had three
altercations recently -- the pilot who accidentally turned off engines and
nearly crash landed in the ocean, a pilot who landed at the wrong airport in

You may recall that BART had an unexplained power failure on 17 May 1987,
unprecedented in its 15-year history.  17 switches opened for five hours,
and then mysteriously closed again.  On 7 July 1987 BART announced that the
cause had been ascertained -- a short circuit resulted from the use of a
battery charger in combination with a faulty switch.  (SF Chronicle, 8 July
1987).

The following is excerpted from the Peninsula Times-Tribune, Sunday,
July 5, 1987.  The byline is by Jack Brenan [sp?], Tribune Media Services
(reproduced without permission).

  FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.  -- When Jim Wyatt received his monthly telephone bill
  last Tuesday morning, he got the surprise of his life -- a $14,720.96
  surprise.  The bill was 2-inches thick, 210 pages long, detailing 4,931
  long-distance calls made on his U.S.  Sprint account.  Total number of
  minutes logged: 72,849.  That's 50.6 days of non-stop talking in 30 days. ...
  
  John Frusciante, who prosecutes computer related crime for the Broward State
  Attorney's Office said Wyatt appeared to be the victim of one of the larger
  long-distance fraid cases in recent memory.  ...  U.S. Sprint spokesman
  Steve Dykes said officials had not started investigating the bill yet, but
  that Wyatt probably was victimized by a hacker who used a computer to obtain
  his secret access code and pass it around.  ...  "This is something we take
  very seriously.  We have been beefing up our security department," Dykes
  said.  "It's about a half-billion-dollar -- that's with a B -- problem a
  year for the industry."  ...  "Most of the time, a computer is utilized to
  attempt to locate valid access codes using an automatic dialer.  In essence,
  you put it on automatic pilot and let it do its thing," Frusciante said.
  
  Wyatt ...  said he made his only concern clear on the telephone [to 
  U.S. Sprint] before he hung up. "I'm not going to pay the bill," he said.
 
The article is amusing, but it raises an interesting concern.  The
response of the U.S.  Sprint people is to "beef up security." If their
system was penetrated as they believe, the problem is probably better
solved by improving the lock rather than looking for the thief.

The activity profile of an auto-dialer that is trying to find legal
access codes is VERY different from that of a legitimate customer.  It
should be easy to have the computer foil such attempts (by holding the
circuit open for 30 seconds and disconnecting after N attempts), to
confuse such attempts (by always returning a FAILED code after the Nth
attempt) or even to help apprehend the perpetrator (by flagging the
line for a trace, or even tracing it automatically if this is legal). 

Even if the penetration in this case was not so trivial, the article seems
to indicate that the people at U.S. Sprint believe such a penetration is
possible.  Perhaps there should be legal recourse for customers who are
inconvenienced by such inadequate security.

I am more familiar with the internals of the GM system, but the GM and Ford
engine control computers have enough in common that this should be true for
both:

&gt;   1) If disconnecting the negative post will erase the computer's memory,
&gt;      what happens when your battery dies?  Or _you_ yourself take the 
&gt;      battery off for some reason?  Does that also erase it, or does taking
&gt;      the positive post off within 45 seconds somehow keep you from losing 
&gt;      the memory?

  If you lose battery power, the computer's volatile memory is erased.  It
doesn't matter whether the battery dies, explodes, is disconnected, or the
computer falls off the firewall.  Disconnecting the ground (negative) post
has been the preferred way to remove power on cars since long before the
computer era; I believe this is simply because the negative post is less
cluttered.

&gt;   2) From that, what exactly do you lose when the memory is erased?

  The GM computer keeps a "crib sheet" of mixture data (indexed according
to operating conditions) so that it can get close to the correct mixture
without waiting for the oxygen sensor feedback, a memory of fault
conditions, and some state information to help it decide whether the
engine is likely to require warm-start or cold-start techniques (for
instance).  All this is lost when the computer loses power.  If you have
disconnected power, the computer will have to rebuild its crib sheet, and
GM suggests that you drive for a few miles at varying speeds and throttle
openings to give it the data it needs (the engine has to be warm, too, since
the computer needs the feedback from the oxygen sensor).

  This crib sheet is basically a set of corrections to the standard data for
your engine and car; the engine computer will work adequately without it,
but performance and driveability improves as the crib sheet data gets better.

  Incidentally, on cars with electronic dash displays, the odometer is an
electronic display of the value on a mechanical counter buried in the
dash somewhere (even on cars like the GM C-bodies which have electronic
speedometer/odometer systems, where the mechanical counter is driven by
an electronic circuit).  The GM C-bodies are "Chrysler resistant" (so to
speak), since the same signal feeds the engine control computer and the
odometer circuit; disconnecting the odometer (unless you get fairly
fancy) also disconnects the engine computer, and this causes things not to
work very well (the engine computer really likes to know how fast the
car is moving, and gets upset if you're sitting at wide-open throttle
and zero mph for hours at a time).

&gt;   3) Is this mentioned by Ford manuals or any shop manuals (i.e. Chilton's)?
&gt;      I know dealers don't mention this - my family just bought a Sable, and
&gt;      I would presume that the computers are basically the same, and our 
&gt;      salesman never mentioned it.

  The GM shop manuals explain this quite clearly.  It is possible to read
most of this information out (GM cars have a little connector under the
dash which includes a serial line to the computer), and some of it is
quite valuable for service purposes (for instance, the crib sheet will show
if the engine is running unusually lean or rich, which may indicate a leak
in the intake system).

  The GM computer is quite paranoid about its sensor data, too, and a large
chunk of the ECM code is just checking the sensor values to see if they
make sense; if the ECM decides something's strange, it records a fault
code and lights the "Service Engine Soon" indicator on the dash.  The
fault codes can be read out through the connector, and the service manuals
have flow charts for tracking down the problems indicated by the codes.

  I'd be surprised if the average car salesman knew much about the engine
control computer; even if he or she did, I doubt the average car buyer would
be interested.  I'm not surprised the salesman never mentioned it.

&gt;   4) What does this do with emissions control?  Some counties in Maryland
&gt;      have regular testing - would you still pass with the fuel being mixed
&gt;      differently?

  The volatile memory (the stuff you lose when you disconnect power) is (at
most) a set of minor corrections to the standard settings for your combination
of engine, transmission, and options.  Once the engine is warm, and you've
driven a few miles and given the computer a chance to rebuild its tables,
you will be (more or less) back to the state you were in before the power
failure.  The standard settings are all in non-volatile memory (PROMs in
most cases) which won't be affected by power loss.

Friends of mine were recently stung by an unanticipated problem in the
interaction of the hardware and software.  They were using a random
number function which was not truly random.  One way to more closely
approximate true randomness was to get a new seed from the system
clock for each call to the generator.

When the software was being debugged, this worked fine.  However, when
the debugging was turned off, the random numbers suddenly started
repeating (in a predictable and non-random way).

It turned out that when the software ran at full speed (without the
debugging code to slow it down) it sampled the clock too quickly.
Thus, the seed number was not changed and the random-number generator
would produce the same number.

This bug was quite difficult to catch because it depended on the speed
of series of calls to the clock-reading function.  This speed was not
only slightly different from execution to execution, it depended on
the system load.  And, of course, it changed as soon as you started to
monitor it.

From Digital Review April 6, 1987 p.75
 
           "Victims Sought in Wall Street Fraud"
 
     "The [S.E.C.], the U.S. Secret Service, and the Arizona attourney
general's office are all investigating a reported $28.8 million computer
fraud (and a bizarre cover-up) alleged [!] to have taken place at a New York
City brokerage house on June 20, 1986."

     To paraphrase a bit, there is a problem during the triple witching day
(hour?) when the volume of transactions skyrockets. This firm's solution to
the resulting computer overload was to "speed up the operation of it's IBM
computer system by turning off the applications-level software that recorded
information for the audit trail for each transaction."  A clever clerk set
up 22 bank accounts under fictitious names for himself and selflessly
volunteered for overtime that evening to help clear up the backlog.  He then
sold a bunch of customer's holdings and credited the money to his phony
accounts, transferred the money to a numbered Swiss account, and left for
'vacation'....
     The really scary part about this is that no-one knows for sure what
securities he sold, who they belonged to, or how much money he ended up
with! They also don't know where he is, but that's hardly surprising. :+)
They wouldn't have even known that it happened except that another clerk was
working on the same data and saw something change that wasn't supposed to.
The firm is calling it a computer error and "hopes that customer complaints
would allow it to identify and reimburse the victims."

It would be worth examining the [reporting systems] that do work, and
they're not all in Japan:  both the US and the UK have confidential
aviation-safety reporting systems which get serious use.  One factor which
may be significant is that these systems are *not* run by the people
involved in managing aviation safety! They funnel through third parties (in
the US it's NASA, in the UK it's the aviation-medicine people I think) who
are far enough removed from the ongoing policy wars that they can
convincingly claim to be honest go-betweens.  Pious proclamations of good
intentions often are not enough to convince would-be reporters that their
names won't get back to management.

&gt;From: Heikki Pesonen &lt;LK-HPE%FINOU.BITNET@wiscvm.wisc.edu&gt;
&gt;Subject:      RISKS in "Balance of Power"
&gt;There is a computer game about "Geopolitics in the nuclear age" called
&gt;BALANCE OF POWER.  It is sold at least for Commodore Amiga.  I bought one and
&gt;now master the beginners level -- being able to beat Soviet Union. ...

"Beat the SU?"  Chris Crawford, the author of the game, gave a talk about
its development to the Palo Alto CPSR chapter before the game was marketed.
His stated goal (which I might might have changed) was to have the world
survive 20 years avoiding TN war.  If you have beat the SU, I suggest
sending a nice little letter to Chris telling him how.  The fact that you
are Finnish will be even more of a kick.  Chris thinks, "It's only a game."
He was approached by several University Poli Sci Dept. as a teaching tool.

The RISK of simulations is quite real.  There exist several "games" which I
hear about in the "shadows."  They are played by non-computer "hard-ball"
people [I was informed (at LLNL) that George Schultz was one].  I can guess
it runs on an Apple II because of portability requirements.  No flashy
graphics.  I doubt if these models are validated in anyway.  Chris's game
was given serious scrutiny, [the graphics were seen as a major advance, as
well as the use of mice], but it apparently lacks some statistics.  Note: I
have not given you the name of the group which showed me this.  There are
other groups at the Livermore Lab (where I am allowed to visit) which do
things like tactical and strategic nuclear war simulations.  (I have played
the most visible tactical simulation named JANUS [objective: train middle
level officers use and abuse of nuclear weapons]: Blue team (me) was overrun
by Red team.)  There are also other National Labs, and at least 24 companies
each employing close to a thousand people each who simulate matters of
policy [perhaps RAND being the best known].

The US and the SU both have a propensity with technological toys.  Their
attraction is very powerful as adult games (lacking video).  As long
as the older politicians breed a healthy skepticism in the younger
politicians, we are probably okay.

&gt; There may be some risk in
&gt; designing games simulating international affairs, if they are seemingly
&gt; realistic.  Some childish people may take them as the truth.

About 10 years ago, here in the suburbs of Washington, DC, a video game was
introduced which simulated cars chasing pedestrians.  The game was shortly
removed, because people felt that the game was teaching kids that pedestrians
were fair game for motorists.

On the other hand, world conflict simulations may be useful:  I recall a game
used in some psychology experiments.  The game concerned trucks and limited
roadways.  The experimenters noted that the players found that cooperation
between players (sharing the roadways) gained more for each player than
hostile actions.

Note that 45 years ago, the Japanese war-gamed their intended attack on Midway
Island.  In their simulation, they lost.  They proceeded with the attack,
anyway.  They lost the real battle, too.

   I have a friend, Mike* (not his real name), who owns a 1983 Firebird.
He does a great deal of work on cars in his spare time, but his education
and job are in computer science.  The work that he generally does is in
microcomputers and microcontrollers.  Mike was interested in improving the
performance of his Firebird, and happened to have a friend John* (not his
real name, either) who worked for GM and had access to the design and 
coding for the car computers.  John was willing to provide this information
to Mike as a personal favor, and did so.

   There is a PROM in the car computer that contains the basic parameters
of the engine's operation, such as fuel mixture, ignition advance, temperature
compensations, etc.  If I remember correctly, the PROM is a type which is
pin compatible with an industry standard EPROM (i.e., the EPROM can be
programmed and inserted directly into the PROM position by changing only
one or two power supply pins).  The information in the PROM is not necessarily
set for the highest engine performance, but rather to meet federal emissions
control and fuel economy regulations.  Therefore, changes in the parameters
in the PROM could substantially improve the engine performance, to the
detriment of compliance with federal regulations.

   Mike proceeded to replace the PROM with an EPROM of his own programming.
This resulted in a considerable improvement in the performance of his
Firebird.  After making this modification and adding exhaust headers to the 
car, it had a top speed in excess of 150mph. (After reaching 150mph on an
interstate highway, Mike decided he really didn't want to know what the
top speed was.)  I don't recall what the top speed was before these 
modifications, but it was a good deal closer to 100mph than 150mph.

One risk of computers that I haven't seen addressed in this forum is the
risk of having your cpu fall on you.  This comes from a man who several

The information concering the kidnapping, shooting, and release of the 6
other inmates is correct, however the rest of the information is misleading.

The guard tower was being staffed only during daylight due to financial
restrictions at the time of the escape.  Now it is being staffed 24 hours a
day.  Although the guard tower was unmanned at the time, it was not in the
field of view where the prisoners scaled the fence.  That area of the fence
was being monitored by motion detector sensors which were attached to a
computer system.  Due to several false alarms, it was decided to disable
that portion of the monitoring area until the problems were solved.  Also,
the fence was NOT topped with the normal razor that surrounds the rest of
the fences.  The escape area was still under construction.  The 18 foot high
chain-link fence was also not covered with a fine mesh fence which made
climbing the chain-link fence trivial.  Normally, the fine mesh makes it
near impossible to get a good hand or foot hold on the fence.  It has also
been mentioned that there are some design flaws in the computer surveillance
system as well as the fence enclosure.

The combination of weaknesses is what made the escape possible.  At present,
only one inmate has been recaptured the other six are still at large, and are
suspected of traveling south towards Mexico.  Recent sitings have confirmed
this suspicion.

I know (personally) of one case where one of my ex-students decided that he
needed free long distance.  He would use his Apple-II (it was some time ago)
to dial up the local number and try some number as an access code.  He
called the school's computer, so he knew that if he got a carrier then he
had gotten through.

To make a short story even shorter, he used sequential probing to choose the
access codes.  The long distance company's computer (it wasn't Sprint, he'd
gotten away using their's for a long time) picked up on the sequential probing.
The next thing he knew there were police wandering around his house late at 
night.  A week later he was arrested and his computer taken away (what a
terrible punishment!).

The funny thing was Pac-Bell was after him to give them his "source" and find
out where he had gotten the sophisticated algorithm, etc.  It seems they
thought he was a big time phone cracker.

	I was reading the Wall Street Journal last week, and noticed a
full page ad for the new US Sprint "FON Card."  The ad included a
picture of a sample card.  I tried making a US Sprint call using that
card number, and it worked.  Further investigation revealed that ANY
fourteen digit number would allow calls to be completed.

	In this case, the problem was fixed by the next afternoon.  But
Sprint is not always so prompt.  I once called them to request deactivation
of a code, telling them that the security of the code had been compromised.
They told me that it would take at least a week to deactivate the code.

	US Sprint and the other companies claim to lose a lot of money
from theft, but they are evaluating those losses based upon the retail
value of the unauthorized calls.

	It is only reasonable to use retail value for calls that
people would have paid for otherwise.  Most people I know who (would)
use unauthorized long distance codes would use them only for calls
which they would not have made otherwise.  The real cost of the
unauthorized codes, then, is simply the long distance company's
marginal cost, which is negligible.

	The fact that the Florida gentleman received such a large bill without
warning is quite suprising.  Recently, my sprint access code made its way
to a similar hacker's BBoard.  Within days, US Sprint called me, told me what
had happened and that they were actively tracking (tracing?) the sources of
the phone calls.  Seems that they computer systems automagically picked up on
calls being made very closely spaced in time from many different cities and
that they did not fit out 'usage pattern'.  When my bill came out (all 30 pages
worth) there was a nice letter saying to 'just pick out the calls you KNOW are
yours' which was easy since my calls all originated in Salt Lake City. 

	They specifically wanted the access code left live until they could
try to track down the callers who were using it.  They just called the other
day and informed me of the new number and that of the several thousand dollars,
they had recovered a great deal of it....All in all, they did a good job of
keeping the customer happy and well informed, and impressed me with the 
capabilities of their software to extract features that indicate abuse.

     Disconnecting the negative (ground) terminal first is a safety precaution
for the mechanic to avoid inadvertantly shorting the battery to ground.  After
the negative terminal is disconnected the positive terminal may be brought into

&gt; Subject: BALANCE OF POWER
&gt; Note that 45 years ago, the Japanese war-gamed their intended attack...

There were several Japanese simulations of the attack on Midway. The
first simulation took into account the Japanese forces, the American
forces, relative skill levels, and the like. The simulation was
played, and the result of the simulation was that the Japanese lost.

This was unacceptable to the admirals, since they knew that they had a
superiority in force strength, better intelligence, and the advantage
of surprise, so they ordered the rules of the game to be redesigned.
After a couple of iterations, playing the simulation produced a Japanese
victory in line with what the admirals expected from their plans.

The attack was carried out according to the final simulation,
whereupon the accuracy of the initial simulation was proved, with the
Japanese losing most of their carrier force and being unable to
conduct a landing on Midway.

In Risks 5.8 Don Chiasson notes the problem of hardware bugs, and makes the
statement "it is not possible to prove the correctness of hardware". This is
only partially true. A group at the University of Calgary has recently
proven the correctness of a chip design and is continuing research in the
area. (Anyone interested in the references can send me mail, although I add
that I am not associated with this group). As for the testing of chips once
the design has been verified, Mr. Chiasson is on target, as the majority of
testing schemes attempt to minimize the number of defective chips released,
rather than ensure that all are fault-free.

In response to Don Chiasson's 6 July 87 comment "it is not possible to
prove the correctness of hardware".  Clearly exhaustive testing is not a
practical means to accomplish this.  But see:

  Hunt, Warren A. Jr., "FM8501: A Verified Microprocessor", Tech.
  Report 47, Institute for Computing Science, University of Texas, Austin
  78712, February 1986.

This is Warren's dissertation and describes the formal specification and
definition of a microprocessor (similar in size and complexity to a
PDP-11) and provides a proof that the formal definition satisfies the
specifications.  Essentially a set of mathematical operation are defined
that describe the specification of the machine and these operations are
shown to be equivalent to a graph of hardware gates.  The mathematical
operations are characterized by commonly used functions, such as
addition, subtraction, and shifting.  The implementation (gate graph) is
characterized by Boolean functions applied to components of bit-vectors.
The machine was specified and defined in the Boyer-Moore Logic and the
proof was done using the Boyer-Moore Theorem Prover. 

A brief, but more readily available description can be found in Bevier,
Hunt, and Young, "Toward Verified Execution Environments", in Proceedings
1987 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, April 1987.

This work is currently being continued at Computational Logic Inc.

"A computer technician sent to check out a problem at Oldsmobile reports
this disaster; a 70-megabyte hard disk in the company's computer system
failed, completely wiping out the computer-aided design of a 1990 Olds car.
Since hard disks are routinely backed up by separate magnetic-tape systems,
however there wasn't much reason to panic at first.  But there soon was;
examination of the backup tapes revealed that they were blank.  Our insider

My new Dodge Caravan has an elaborate microprocessor-controlled radio, and
a large array of interior courtesy lights all linked to all the doors and
hatches.  If you leave any opening even slightly adjar overnight, your
battery goes dead, and the radio's computer goes into a catatonic state
which is NOT cured by jump-starting or recharging the battery.  After
battery power is restored the cassette tape will play, but the radio won't
tune or respond to anything, manual or pushbutton.  To restore it, you have
to pull momentarily one of the two fuses supplying the radio's power.  This
isn't mentioned anywhere in any of the car or radio manuals; I've had to
figure it out three times thus far.

I don't know about any pending cases, but readers interested in this subject
should check the article by Christopher J. Gill, High Technology Law Journal, 
Vol 1, #2, P483-520, Fall 1986 entitled "Medical Expert Systems:  Grappling
with Issues of Liability."  An important legal issue is whether the use of a
medical expert system constitutes a product or a service.  If an expert
system is a product, strict liability applies whereas if it a service then a
negligence standard applies.  Perhaps some lawyer reading Risks or AILIST
could read this article and summarize it for us.  It is not easy going.

&gt; The assumption is that hardware will work or fail catastrophically, or that
&gt; error correcting circuits will detect problems.  Is this always so?
   In the work I have done I have never made the assumption that hardware will 
either work or fail catastrophically. There can be a fault in hardware that 
will only appear when exercised. The 80386 fault only appears when certain 
numbers are multiplied together, otherwise the chip functions properly. 
   By error correcting circuits I assume you are including error detecting
circuits. Error detecting methods include parity and checksums. Error
correcting methods involve the use of error correcting codes (ECC) such 
as SEC-DED (single error correcting, double error detecting). It is possible 
for error detecting methods to not detect an error. With parity if an even
number of bits change value there will be no error detected. With ECC it
is possible for an error to be corrected wrongly or not detected at all. 
A paper authored by C. Chen and M. Hsiao titled "Error-Correcting Codes for
semiconductor Memory Applications: A State of the Art Review" in the March
1984 issue of IBM J. Res. Develop. magazine will explain the gory details.
It should be noted that proper implementation of ECC and prompt removal of 
faulty parts will minimize this risk.
   An error detection method to check arithmetic operations is to encode the
operands in an arithmetic code. Arithmetic codes are preserved by arithmetic
operations but not by boolean operations. To check a boolean operation usually
involves doing the computation on two separate units and then comparing the
result. A computer that did this was the STAR (self test and repair) computer
designed at JPL for use on board planetary probes.

&gt;      How often do microprocessors fail in minor ways?  People have written
&gt; about proving correctness of code: it is not possible to prove the
&gt; correctness of hardware.  For example, a complete test of a 32 bit
&gt; multiplier would require 2**64, or 1.8E19 operations.  
   There seems to be two issues here, design verification and testing to see
if hardware is fault free. Design verification is the process of verifying
that the hardware meets the specification it was designed for. I am not 
knowledgeable in this field. Testing to see if hardware is fault free I do know
about. I have written test vectors to completely test a 74F181 which is
a 4 bit ALU. It was 100% tested in around 30-40 vectors. By knowing
the gate level diagram and the possible faults it was not necessary to run
every combination of inputs through the chip. What was done was to setup the
input vector so that a particular fault if it was present would change the
output of the chip. It was written assuming that you were able to control
the inputs and observe the outputs, something typically found on a chip or 
board tester. Tests that do not or cannot use a tester are more complicated
but follow the same method of having a fault affect the output in a way that
can be observed. 

&gt;  Even without complete tests, writing diagnostic
&gt; programs was extremely difficult when various margin and worst case
&gt; conditions had to be considered. 
   If a diagnostic is to be effective it is going to have to take into
consideration most fault cases. The tests I have worked with and written make
the assumption of a single fault occurring. This simplifies the possibilities
with a good probability of detecting multiple faults when they occur.
Testing is simplified by the use of circuits to aid in testing the hardware.
As hardware becomes more complex, testing needs to be considered when the 
hardware is being designed or else the test designer will have a difficult
time writing tests and the tests will not be as effective as they could be.

&gt;Friends of mine were recently stung by an unanticipated problem in the
&gt;interaction of the hardware and software.  They were using a random
&gt;number function which was not truly random...

The modification described here to a pseudo random number generator 
(pseudo-RNG) is a really bad idea.  RNG's are developed to have some 
basic statistical properties, such as little or no autocorrelation, 
a uniform distribution similar to an idealized sequence of uniform 
random numbers, unpredictable without a fair bit of work, non-repeating 
over very long sequences.  Often these sequences are called pseudo-random.  
Whether it is possible to develop "real" random numbers is a philosophical 
problem.

Pseudo-RNG's have several advantages over a hypothetical sequence 
of "real" random numbers.  For example, you can restart the generator
to find the sequence of inputs to your program that caused the program 
to bomb.  You don't need to store the entire sequence of numbers because
the code to generate them is quite compact.  A competent developer of a
pseudo-RNG has already tested the sequences that come from the generator 
to make sure it indeed does pass statistical tests such as listed in 
Knuth's Art of Computer Programming chapter 3.  When you modify the 
generator by changing the seed at each call, you have created a new 
pseudo-RNG and you don't have a clue as to the statistical properties 
it now has.  Quite probably, you have reduced the number of possible 
sequences that the generator might produce - as happened to the people 
in Alan's story. 

If you feel a need to have a higher quality pseudo-RNG than what you 
have available, Statistical Computing, by Kennedy and Gentle has a 
good discussion of various pseudo-RNG's.

To: Risks Digest &lt;RISKS@csl.sri.com&gt;

Many thanks to all who commented on my contribution in RISKS DIGEST 5.8,
"RISKS in Balance of Power".  In this contribution I hope I can make it
clear, why I dislike the game, although my adult children found it funny
when they played it.  Also in the journal Byte, May 1987, Chris Crawford's
book about his game is reviewed and appreciated.  In a Finnish home computer
magazine "Balance of Power" received "****" (the maximum is 5 stars).

In the Instruction Manual the goal of playing is defined as "increase your geo-
political prestige and weaken the geopolitical prestige of the Soviet Union."

As a beginner you proceed to the goal by 
BLOWING INSURGENCY AND TERRORISM TO FLAMES.

When you master the beginner's level you can try the more difficult
"intermediate level".  On that a new channel of geopolitical interaction is
introduced:  THE SUBVERSION AND DESTABILIZATION OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENT.

You destabilize a government by sending in the CIA to encourage dissidents,
fund the opposition, incite riots and create other domestic political mayhem|

After you master these affairs (besides now and then sending money and
troops either to rebels or to governments) you become an expert.  The Expert
Level game introduces a new vehicle for governmental change, FINLANDIZATION.

Chris Crawford describes the term Finlandization by giving a short description
of the history and political situation of Finland.  The story is quite foolish
being on the level of the tourists jokes about the polar bears they have
met on the streets of Finnish cities.  For example, according to Crawford:

  "Finland is effectively under strong Soviet influence." and
  "Finland's relations with the USA are poor."

If things are so bad, how is it possible that our recent Prime Minister
and many other ministers are from the Right Party (Kokoomus).  How is it
possible for me to send this letter through a Finnish computer net with
many IBM and Digital computers, not allowed to export to countries connected
with Soviet Union?  How reliable are other so called facts in Crawford's game?

In "Balance of Power" you can Finlandize a country exerting diplomatic
pressure.  Pressure is an attempt TO INTIMIDATE A COUNTRY WITH WORDS AND
PROVOCATIVE ACTIONS, for example, holding naval maneuvers off the coast of
the victim.  (US Navy probably tried to Finlandize Libya when holding
maneuvers on the Gulf of Syrt.)

The errors and oversimplifications of Balance of Power are not its dangerous
features.  What irritates me is the worldview and the type of behavior the
game reinforces.  Thanks to the game certainly a lot of new Oliver Norths
are growing up in America. I am very glad to know, that Russians have only a
few Amigas and Macs, so that their youngsters are not playing this
geopolitical game.

The term "Geopolitics" is from German origin. "Geopolitik" was the strategic
methodology of Nazis. Hitler was a Master level player of a game very
similar to "Balance of Power".


I have written this letter in my Summer cottage not far from Russian
border using my old Commodore-64 sending it through telephone lines.

It is no surprise that Sprint access codes can be penetrated.
It would be no surprise to find out that AT&amp;T calling card numbers
(basically the same thing, but mishandled) can be penetrated.

In its early days, Sprint used 5-digit access codes and assigned
them in nearby groups.  This meant that knowing one or a few codes
made it possible with 15 minutes of manual trying to come up with
a bunch more.  Needless to say, they were hacked to pieces.

Their response to this was the "Travelcode", a 2-digit number tacked
on to the 5-digit number when you are calling a different Sprint CO
than your usual one.  They also presumably started doing more random
assignment of the numbers.  Even if you knew someone's access code,
you'd have to try 50 travelcodes with it before it's likely you would
hit on the right one, and by then they could have noticed you scanning
for it.

Look at AT&amp;T:  their charge codes contain the user's phone number,
which is publicly available information.  They only add 4 digits to it,
and in prior years, these digits were assigned by a trivial scheme,
which was typically discovered and published by the Yippies.

I suspect that the Telecom digest archives have a lot more information
on telephone billing security, if anyone is interested.

As with any public protestation about crime, the value is inflated.
Wholesale cocaine is always reported at inflated retail prices.  Similarly,
the phone companies lose beelyuns and beelyuns of dollars at this, though
they haven't shown that it requires them to increase their call handling
capacity.  What they claim to lose is the thousands of dollars that each
teenage phone hacker would have paid them making these calls legitimately.

In a recent article, someone from AT&amp;T said "these calls have got to stop".
I challenged him, and AT&amp;T, to stop them then.  Any time is fine by me.

   [This message duplicates some previous discussion, but also summarizes some
   useful points and is therefore worth including in RISKS.  The bottom line
   is usually $, and here as usual it seems cheaper to the producer and more
   acceptable to the user community to swallow the "losses".  Yes, in telephone
   calling it (marginally?) increases the load on the system, but in credit
   cards (VISA, etc.) fraud actually results in real losses -- but they are
   simply passed on to the customers through increased fees and service
   charges.  In both cases the burden is distributed to the users, who must
   watch for unauthorized charges and then negotiate to have them undone.  PGN]

Diane Downs, a convicted murderer of some notoriety (she shot her three
children, killing one, allegedly to rid herself of the responsibility for
them), escaped from the medium security Oregon women's prison last Saturday.
While in the recreation yard, she scaled two fences and walked away.  Budget
money is tight, so there was no guard assigned to watch inmates in the yard;
instead they depended on an alarm system in the outer fence.  The alarm did
go off, but little attention was paid to it because it goes off every day,
usually because of strong winds or birds.

    [This is the problem of the system that cried "wolf!".  When a system
    gives that many false alerts, it is time to change something to improve
    the false-positive discrimination.  It is amazing how often this
    problem occurs.  My neighbors next to the local high-school football
    field had a burglar alarm that went off whenever the home team scored a
    touchdown.  (An intelligent thief might notice such behavior rather
    quickly and find safety.  [2 points])  PGN]

The computerized reference numbers for thousands of NYPL books were mistakenly
erased when data was transferred from one computer to another.  The books
are still on the shelves, but have vanished from the reference system.  How
many are in this limbo state is unknown.  A patron was quoted as having been
told "by the head of research that the staff has made no attempt to retrieve
them because they are afraid they might lose more if they go into the system."

Last year in Dublin the beginnings of a major fraud were uncovered in an
department of our revenue service solely concerned with rebating a Value
Added Tax (VAT) paid by companies for materials they purchased.  The
approach adopted by the perpetrators was enviously simple due to the low
security pervading the data entry operations.  Basically, the clearance
system for rebates consisted of entering a company's name plus a clearance
code for payment of the rebate.  This information is fed to the central
revenue computer for issuing cheques and what not, where a number of
elementary verification procedures were invoked, e.g. was the company a
database entry, etc.  At this point one of the perpetrators (working with
this system) could easily authorise payment blamelessly.  Input from a
remote terminal was overseen at the host and payment authorised.  Remarkably
simple.  So what went wrong?  The implementors of the scheme didn't manage
the fictitious companies' accounts properly.  When one bank manager noticed
that only rebate cheques were coming into one account, he became suspicious.
His suspicions were confirmed when one member of the gang demanded the
withdrawal of practically the entire contents of the account.  The resultant
police investigation showed that the central flaw in the automatic rebating
system was human.  Usually before a company is granted an automatic rebate
it must be in good standing with the revenue.  It must prove, over a
considerable period of time, that it has in fact bought the materials
against which it is claiming the tax rebate.  But there was no security
which prevented someone administering the rebates from directly attaching a
clearance code to a company.  Unfortunately the system was tailor-made for
criminal violation.  Two more worrying aspects of the situation are that (a)
due to the vast number of transactions undertaken in a year, an audit (based
on sampling) would probably not have picked up any deficit; (b) if the gang
had been a little less naive they could have maintained the operation for a
comfortable period of time and then simply erased all record of their
transactions (ok, there is the problem of backup tapes).  This didn't get a
lot of reportage here, but most people with any computer experience were
surprised at the apparent naivete of the input/clearance system design.  It
was rumoured that a major review of security procedures was initiated in the
aftermath of the affair.
   [Note that the problem of backup can sometimes be circumvented by
   selectively blocking the writing of backup, or -- in some systems --
   tampering with the backup copies, although that requires a little more
   system experience.  PGN]

&gt; ...examination of the backup tapes revealed that they were blank.

For a long time now, one of our post-backup activities is to run a "table
of contents" program on selected backups.  The original reason was mundane:
users often request retrieval of files without knowing the exact complete
correct pathname and the exact date when the file vanished, so it's useful
to have on-line lists that we can check.  However, it also gives us a running
check on the quality of our backups, which has proved particularly useful
in coping with recent tape-drive problems.

Perhaps one subtle point should be made in reference to generating a set of
test vectors to 'completely' fault test a chip: I agree that it is possible
to derive a test vector set when the gate-level diagram is known. But, one
stumbling block that arises (and has its analog in software) is that
parasitic capacitances formed due the physical layout of the IC sometimes
cause the chips to have 'phantom' gates that do not appear on the schematic.
We have these stray coupling problems in software -- they aren't evident
from looking at our seemingly disconnected source listings, and we rarely
take the time to review the operating system code with ours.

I have had two interesting experiences with Sprint Access Penetration:

In December, 1986, I received a MailGram from Sprint stating that their 
computers had noticed a sudden, enormous increase in my travelcode usage.
Having tried unsuccessfully to contact me, that had suspended the code on
the assumption that it was being abused.  I subsequently received a bill
for about $800 in unauthorized charges.  The Sprint customer service 
people were very helpful about issuing me a new code and advising me on
how to straighten out my account.  Neither they nor I were able to 
successfully communicate with the billing people however.  It took 4 months
of threatening letters in both directions to clear the matter.  Apparently,
GTE Sprint and U.S. Telecom were in the process of merging their billing 
operations, and the abuse flag on my account got lost in the shuffle.

A client of mine had a neat "deal" on long distance telephone rates.  An
outfit had sold them "unlimited" long distance dialing on a flat per month
fee.  Each day the client would call this supplier and receive a new Sprint
access code to use.  It wasn't until many months later that an investigator
from Sprint came by asking questions.  As several close friends were officers
of this company, I was horrified.  Does anyone out there know enough of 
the relevant law to comment on this?  Could they be accused of receiving
stolen property?

Do we have any independent estimates of how large a problem theft of long
distance service is?  Are the other providers having as much trouble as
Sprint?  (I.e., is the problem generic, or does Sprint have a uniques
security hole?)  My experience would seem to indicate that they are at least
trying to detect patterns of unauthorized usage.

According to a posting on the FCC matter in the local legal bulletin
board, the FCC access charge affects only public data providers such
as CompuServe and Telenet.  It does not affect
  a) private users of modems
  b) private databases such as airline reservation systems.

The theory is that long distance providers have to pay something for
using the phone system.   In order to compensate the local Bell Operating
Company for all the calls coming in from long distance, they are given
a fee.  At the time this was instituted, the FCC decided to exempt such
organizations as Telenet as they were relatively new services.  Now
that their revenue is approaching seven billion dollars a year, it
was decided to a) make them pay their fair share, b) stop subsidizing
them or c) tax them depending upon your point of view.

This posting also makes a statement regarding the right of Congress
to delegate its law making powers.  According to Kenneth Culp Davis
who wrote the legal text book, Administrative Law, attacks on
delegation or subdelegation "serve as a disservice to the client."
Subdelegation is when Congress says that the Attorney General or
some other official can make regulations and he in turn delegates
it to someone such as the Immigration and Nationalization Service.

Administrative agencies have been around since the 1700's in the United
States, the first handling pension issues arising out of the Revolutionary
War.  Mr. Davis makes compelling arguments in favor of administrative
agencies, the exercise of discretion, the necessity for regulations and a
balance between the "rule of law" and the "rule of men" but this is not the
place to discuss that issue.  I would recommend this book to anyone
interested in administrative agencies.

   From "Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency," by Douglas Adams,
   New York: Simon and Schuster, 1987.

"Well," he said, "it's to do with the project which first made the software

own way it was sensational."

"What was it?"

"Well, it was a kind of back-to-front program.  It's funny how many of the

been several programs written that help you make decisions by properly
ordering and analysing all the relevant facts.... The drawback with these is
that the decision which all the properly ordered and analyzed facts point to
is not necessarily the one you want.

"... Gordon's great insight was to design a program which allowed you to
specify in advance what decision you wished it to reach, and only then to
give it all the facts.  The program's task, ...  was simply to construct a
plausible series of logical-sounding steps to connect the premises with the
conclusion." ....

"Heavens.  and did the program sell very well?"

"No, we never sold a single copy.... The entire project was bought up, lock,
stock, and barrel, by the Pentagon.  The deal put WayForward on a very sound
financial foundation.  Its moral foundation, on the other hand, is not
something I would want to trust my weight to.  I've recently been analyzing
a lot of the arguments put forward in favor of the Star Wars project, and if
you know what you're looking for, the pattern of the algorithms is very clear.

"So much so, in fact, that looking at Pentagon policies over the last couple
of years I think I can be fairly sure that the US Navy is using version 2.00
of the program, while the Air Force for some reason only has the beta-test
version of 1.5.  Odd, that."

	Last night I wandered into the TV room while my wife was watching
Siskell and Ebert reviewing a movie called "Robocop" (the title should
tell readers pretty exactly what the film's about). The first scene they
showed involved a bunch of developers demonstrating a police robot to
a group of prospective buyers - unfortunately the machine had a "glitch"
that caused it to machine-gun one of the demonstrators. This scene was
clearly intended to be comic, and in a grim sort of way it was. The
really disturbing thing was Ebert's (I think, I don't really know which
is which) later comment on this scene: "I think there's something
basically funny about a machine ... blindly following instructions in
the face of logic" (quoted as nearly as possible from memory).

	Now I would have said that it's been known for a long time that
computers as we're building them now "blindly follow instructions" without
the slightest regard for common sense or "logic", and that this is one
of the fundamental sources of risks to society in their indiscriminant
use. Ebert's comment got me wondering though, whether there are a lot
of people out there who really do think this "feature" of machines
is "basically funny", and if so how soon or effectively society as
a whole is going to start demanding responsible design and use of
computerized machinery.

	I suppose it's not necessarily impossible to see both the humor
and the serious side in a situation, and there's also the "you can't
fight it, might as well laugh at it" attitude - either or both of these
might (though I have no evidence) have influenced the movie makers'
treatment of buggy software. From the way it was delivered and the context
though, I really think Ebert meant what he said - inflexible programmed
behavior is a source of humor more than of serious problems for him. I
find that kind of a scary perspective.

Andrew Klossner:
&gt; The alarm did go off, but little attention was paid to it because it 
&gt; goes off every day, ...

Something I've always felt strongly about in regard to this is fire
alarms.  There are many buildings in which fire alarms are ignored as a
matter of course.  I believe that in such a case having the fire alarms
is worse than not having them, for two reasons.  One is if you are
trying to tell someone that there is a fire.  You will pull the fire
alarm and leave the building.  No one will listen.  The other is if you
are trying to observe whether or not there is a fire.  Someone tells
you that there is, but you tend to doubt them because their information
is probably from the fire alarm.  At least, this could cause a delay of
minutes which can be crucial in a large building in a fire.

In an apartment building I lived in recently, one night at about 4am the
fire alarm went off.  I blearily woke up, pulled on some clothes, and left
the building.  Standing outside, I saw only two other people that felt as I
did.  Everyone else was still inside.  (I had only been living there for two
months at this time.)
                                       Alan J Rosenthal

    [If any of you wonder, "What has this to do with computers and related 
    systems?", the answer by now should be obvious...  Alarms were ignored,
    bypassed, misinterpreted, or otherwise mishandled in many cases such as
    the Stark, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, Therac 25...  PGN]

AT&amp;T phone credit cards use a credit card number that consists (in most
cases) of your phone number followed by four (presumably somewhat random)
digits.  If the last four digits are random, the probability of guessing a
number (assuming you know that a particular phone number has a card
associated with it) is .01%, which seems relatively safe.

The problem was that if your number was on a centrex where the main number
ended in 000 all the users of that centrex had numbers that consisted of the
main number followed by 4 digits (a different four digit code for each user
to provide accountability), so if the centrex had 500 users with credit card
numbers, a random 4 digit number appended to the centrex number had
a 5% chance of working.  This made the expectation value of the number
of tries before finding a valid number 10!  

This has been corrected, so that now the card number is an individual 
number followed by the 4 random digits.

Yes, I saw that segment as well.  I think the scene derived its effect from the
"blame the computer" syndrome we have developed over the last couple of 
decades.  The effect is supposed to be based on 1) "we" have this new security 
device, 2) to test it, would you hold this gun?  [For those not seeing the 
scene, this biped robot security device can identify guns held at it.]  Stop.

Typical person (Everyman, who was the actor of this scene, there is a name
of this type of person in the Star Trek parlance) would say "No way."  This
is what you have test pilots and drivers for.  Machines have made us think
about them in less than positive ways.  It's perfectly safe.

Now, for the viewer (you the reader of RISKS), do you think you would point
a gun at an armed security device?  Now, do ya'?  Do ya' feel luck.. punk?

We (computer people) would think this device would be tested to this point.
I'm certain the programmer characters in the film would have thought so too,
otherwise, why would the RISKS group exist?

The problem with computer systems is that we think we should try to put
common sense into them.  I think this is wrong.  Humans take common sense
for granted.  It is a form of prejudice.  Common sense is not logic.  The
other extreme is "blind logic", which is portrayed as poor programming
(actually inconsiderate "exception handling").  Our problem is that we have
conflicting goals; the best written description was given by Nancy Leveson
in her Computing Survey article on Safety.  One purpose of science is to
challenge the assumption of common sense as part of education/learning.

Remember that just over a century ago, it was `common sense' that certain
members of the human population were inferior on the basis of race.
Quantum mechanics arose in a different domain to change other `common sense'
ideas.  In the end, it is all your point of view.  I do plan to see this film
(as bad as it might be). S&amp;E both gave thumbs up, but I don't trust them.

  &gt;"I think there's something basically funny about a machine ... 
  &gt; blindly following instructions in the face of logic" 

One of the scariest things I learned while teaching "Computer Appreciation"
(actually titled "Computers in Society") to non-technical types in the 70's
was how little college students knew about the "nature" of computers.  On
every final there was a question of the general type, "What are the
implications of a machine that only does EXACTLY as it is told".  The majority
of the answers were always about how bad it WOULD be if there WERE such
devices -- and remember, this was after they were told the question was
coming!   It almost makes you want to take up plumbing.

Right-on-target discussion (by Eugene Miya) of safety and risks in this
hypothetical situation, and the contrasts between what people intuitively
expect from "intelligent" machines and what they actually get.  (The term
"intelligent machine" is a lasting disservice done to our discipline by the
press of the 1940's and '50's.)  The point I want to make is that there
seems to be a large segment of society out there that doesn't think this is
a risk at all - it's just funny. That's the same society that somehow has to
make collective decisions about computer systems in nuclear power plants,
weapons, planes, and all the other things we've been discussing for
who-knows-how-long here.

There were two near-misses last weekend -- two Delta jets over Virginia both
bound for Dallas-Fort Worth, and a Delta jet and a single-engine Cessna
approaching Sacramento.  In both cases the FAA reported that the Delta jets
were "just following instructions" from the air traffic controllers.  In the
first case, the Atlanta ATC center in Atlanta was having computer problems
and the FAA placed the blame there -- on the system or on the controllers.
In the Sacramento case, it appears the private pilot was at fault.  (Delta
has been having an incredibly Murphian run of bad luck lately, with about
ten different incidents in the past two weeks.)  [Source:  SF Chronicle, 22
July 1987]

Incidentally, the July/August 1987 issue of the Common Cause Magazine has an
article by Jonathan King entitled "Blind Spots", "another reason to fear
flying: faulty air traffic equipment and not enough manpower to keep it
working."  It is a reasonably sensible analysis of past troubles.

I'm not sure what the original source of this phrase was, but the term
"artificial intelligence" was originated in the 1950's by John McCarthy,
generally regarded as one of the most important computer scientists (he
invented LISP, among other things).  The story goes that he created the term
in a grant application in order to kindle funders' interest in topics like 
symbolic logic with otherwise seemed rather esoteric and impractical.

I am getting tired of people blaming "the press" for "sensationalizing"
items that were in fact originally sensationalized by the technical
community itself.  In fact the most mind-boggling and incredible claims
about computing often originate from some scientists, and are if anything
underreported by the press.  For example some quite well-regarded computer
scientists are said to believe it will be feasible to load a runnable copy
of a human intelligence into a computer in the reasonably near future, so we
won't have to die anymore.  What has the NATIONAL ENQUIRER got that can beat
that?  A particular galling example to me is DARPA people complaining about
the "misconception" that Strategic Computing is promoting "killer robots"
when in fact their reports picture autonomous flying vehicles dropping bombs
on things.

I think there may be some overreaction here to the comments on a machine
blindly following instructions as a form of humor.  In fact, *people* doing
this kind of thing, especially taking things literally that were meant
figuratively, is a classic form of humor.  Gracie Allen was a master at this.

      [Yes, even for those who remember Gracie, let's go slow here on people
      blindly following instructions, unless there is a RISKS connection.  PGN]

I am very interested in nuclear power plant control. I was wondering if there
are any books/articles that people might recommend on the subject. It is my
opinion (and this ought to get some people going) that if they could actually
build one of the plants without construction corruption, we might be able
to have a nuclear industry. It is also my belief that some intelligent
(see: Robocop) control systems ought to be able to keep a plant running safely,
given mechanical backup.

From: Nancy Leveson &lt;nancy%murphy.UCI.EDU@ROME.UCI.EDU&gt;      [at PGN's request]
Resent-To: RISKS@csl.sri.com

Alex Bangs brings up two points with respect to nuclear power plant control:

  &gt;It is my opinion ... that if they could actually build one of the plants 
  &gt;without construction corruption, we might be able to have a nuclear industry

Although there have been construction foulups, I doubt that they can all
(or even most) be tied to corruption as opposed to simple mistakes.  The
reasons for the nuclear power industry problems go way beyond construction
difficulties and include economics, poor management, limitations in our
basic engineering capabilities, the impossibility of building any complex 
systems that need to guarantee an extremely low failure probability, etc.
For an excellent discussion of these problems with respect to the
nuclear power industry and other complex systems, I highly recommend
a book by Charles Perrow called:  "Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk
Technology" and published by Basic Books in 1984.

  &gt;It is also my belief that some intelligent (see: Robocop) control systems 
   ought to be able to keep a plant running safely, given mechanical backup.

Computers are currently used in nuclear power plant control, but I assume
Alex is suggesting that computers be given complete responsibility for safety.
I have not seen Robocop, but from the descriptions in Risks of the robot
following orders and killing someone inappropriately, I would hate to think
that this is the way we would want to build a nuclear power plant.  But
more seriously, it is important not to confuse Hollywood with reality.
AI software has not proven to be any more reliable than any other
software.  Programming is programming whether the application is supposedly
intelligent or not.  I will try to avoid controversy by refraining from
commenting on the capabilities of supposedly "intelligent" systems, but
it seems reasonable that if we were able to guarantee perfect software that
way, all software would immediately be written using AI techniques (or
more cynically, labelled as "intelligent") and we could all stop writing 
into and reading the Risks bulletin board.  

Considering everything, it does not appear to be reasonable or responsible
to depend on software to guarantee safety in any system where the consequences 
of failure are as extreme as in nuclear power plants.  Note that this does 
not mean that computers cannot be used in these systems -- they currently are.

It only means that we cannot expect computers to eliminate the danger of 
nuclear power plants or any other complex, potentially unsafe system.  The 
systems with computers are likely to be as dangerous as without them, and 
because of the well-known difficulty of building highly reliable software, 
they may be LESS safe with computers.  Whether we can in the future learn how
to use computers to control safety-critical systems with the same or less 
danger than without them is still unknown, but there are no simple answers.

    [If any of you wonder, "What has all this to do with computers and related 
    systems?", the answer by now should be obvious...  Alarms were ignored,
    bypassed, misinterpreted, or otherwise mishandled in many cases such as
    the Stark, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, Therac 25...  PGN]

Addendum, especially in the case of Chernobyl and Brian's Computers and Society
comment later in the same issue.  We, computer people, are frequently
accused of a binary mentality.  This is a good case where we have a minimum
of three states: true alarm, false alarm, and testing/practice.  The
last case is important because it allows consideration of further
contingencies, but it has the further danger of true alarm during
testing/practice as well as known false alarm.  The complexity can get worse,
so I won't go into it.  The question is how to provide for testing?

I hope that the situation will not get worse before it gets better.
Like "Robocop,"  I have to remain skeptical.  We (computists) are the
guardians for the general public at this time.

I can see the point that the FCC should be able to tax an industry that is no
longer completely weak, but there is still a problem. First, the people who
are probably going to get taxed are the users, not the company. Perhaps if they
drop their prices or lose users, their profits will drop. Otherwise, the
government will just be making more money while Telnet continues to make big
profits. The other problem I see is that this system really hurts the small-
time home user of these services. I really cannot afford to use CompuServe at
more than $6 per hour for fun. In a way, this tax is still risking damage to
the home compute culture.

July '87  IEEE Spectrum - Newslog

Norway will tighten export controls on technology.  The Defense Minister
announced this decision following disclosures that the state owned 
Kongsberg Vapenfabrik sold metalworking machines and related software to 
the Soviet Union.  The equipment was sold in partnership with Toshiba 
Machine Co. of Japan and enabled the Soviets to build quieter submarines 
using advanced propellor blades.

    [Some of you have seen Monday's full-page ad from Toshiba apologizing
    for this event, and promising never to do it again.  This case reminds
    us of some critical risks in technology outflux and some other critical 
    risks when there is not relatively equal distribution of technology...
    Evidently this is a case in which the President's offer to share (e.g.,
    the Star Wars technology!) is not applicable -- it seems to have had a 
    very profound effect.  (There is the old joke about certain computer
    systems and programming languages that should be given to our
    adversaries in order to set THEM back many years.  On the other hand,
    nuclear weapons capabilities are a case in which maintaining parity
    among the main parties does not help stave off developments in other
    nations.)  (End of ramble.)  PGN]

The mention of the Hacker's Handbook reminded me of this book.

	The Hacker's Handbook, by Hugo Cornwall.  1986 edition.  Published
	by E. Arthur Brown Company, 3404 Pawnee Drive, Alexandria, Minnesota,
	USA 56308; phone +1 612 762 8847.  ISBN 0-912579-06-4.

I found it last year and really liked it.  The book is written from a
European perspective (it was originally published in England).  It
starts from basics of computers, modems, and security, mentioning a lot
of things that RISKS readers already know very well.  But it includes
numerous examples of hacking European data services, e.g.  Prestel,
British Telephone, various X.25 networks, the British MI5 intelligence
service, as well as radio data hacking .  There was sufficient "new"
information to keep me avidly reading all the way through.  The
author's writing is chatty and informative, very easy to read.  I
recommend this book for the Risks Library.

Regular RISKS readers will remember the case of Stephen Gold and Robert
Schifreen who broke into the British Telecom Prestel network and were
successfully prosecuted under the UK Forgery and Counterfeiting Act of 1981
last year.  I believe they were responsible for breaking into Prince
Philip's [demonstration] mailbox on the system.  [See <A HREF="/Risks/2.44.html">RISKS-2.44</A>.]  Anyway,
this was a test case and it went to the Court of Appeal.  Last week the
judges decided to allow the appeal.  As a result it would seem that under
English Law

	The dishonest obtaining of access to a computer data bank
	by electronic means is not a criminal offence.

I am not a lawyer so I am not sure I can explain the legal arguments behind
this decision accurately! I am not even sure from the legalese whether they
got off on a technicality or not! However, it would appear that existing law
cannot be applied to computer hackers.

What follows is based on the account of the decision given in the Law Report
section of The Independent dated Wednesday 22nd July 1987 by Simon Cassell,
Barrister. (c) Copyright Newspaper Publishing PLC 1987

The legal reference is Regina v Gold and Schifreen, Court of Appeal
(Criminal Division), 17th July 1987.

Under the terms of the Act, Gold and Schifreen were charged with "making
a false instrument on, or in, which information was recorded or stored by
electronic means, with the intention of using it to induce the Prestel computer
to accept it as genuine, and by reason of so accepting it to do an act to
the prejudice of British Telecom plc".

At the root of the case was the question of what this false instrument was.
In the original ruling, the judge stated that "... the defendant here made
a series of electrical impulses which arrive at, affect and operate on what
is called a user segment". The two candidates for the false instrument
were therefore the electronic impulses and the user segment.

The defence argued that the electronic impulses could not be a device
since they simply carried information, being no more than a translation
of the customer identification number (CIN) and password. The court agreed.

The prosecution argued that the user segment was modified by the CIN and
password which it recorded momentarily in order to check they were genuine.
This was the false instrument manufactured by the appellants and the fact
that it had only existed for a brief moment of time was immaterial.

The court disagreed with this on three grounds.

(1) A forgery is a document containing messages of two kinds: a message
about the document itself (e.g. that it is a cheque), and a message in
the words of the document that it was to be accepted and acted upon (e.g.
that a banker was to pay a certain sum of money). The user segment did
not contain both these types of message at the moment when it was supposed
to be a forgery.

(2) The Act did not seek to deal with information that was held for a moment
while automatic checking took place and was then expunged.

(3) The prosecution had to prove that the appellants had intended someone to
accept the false instrument they had made as genuine. But the machine (i.e.
the user segment) which it was intended should be induced to accept the
false instrument seemed to be the very thing which was said to be the false
instrument (i.e. the user segment) which was inducing the belief.  If this
was a correct analysis, it reduced the prosecution case to an absurdity.

The judges concluded that the language of the Act was not intended to apply
to the situation which was shown to exist in this case, and "the procrustean
attempt" to force the facts to fit the Act "produced grave difficulties for
judge and jury which the court would not wish to see repeated." What the two
individuals had done amounted to a trick. If it was thought desirable to make
this a criminal offence, "it was a matter for the legislature rather than
the courts."

&lt;End of Legal summary&gt;

It is not clear to me as a non-lawyer whether a more carefully drafted charge
which specified the false instrument as being the micro computer and modem
which Gold and Schifreen presumably used to gain access would have succeeded.
However, it will be interesting to see in the light of this decision whether
some specific legislation is drafted to make hacking a criminal offence.
The whole area would seem to be a legal minefield at present!

On nuclear power plants, and making them work--unforeseen problems arise.
For example, at the South Texas Nuclear Project, one unexpected problem
was ... clams growing in the cooling water pipes.  You'd like to filter
them out, but their larvae are very very small.  You'd like to poison
them, but the water is kept in great big ponds that could percolate slowly
into the clay.  What to do?

As if that weren't enough to test your foresight, I believe that these clams
are exotics (i.e, illegal alien species).  In spite of the bad press that
technology has received over the years, purely natural problems can be (I

It is worth noting, too, that nuclear power is not only risky when
things "go wrong" (e.g. bungled construction, operator/control errors)
but also when things "go right".  A normally-operating fission reactor
produces large amounts of wastes that are dangerous for longer than
the lifetime of a typical plant, and smaller quantities of wastes that
will be dangerous for millenia.

We would all do well to remember that our solutions to current
problems should not create worse problems in the future.

In a recent issue of Science there was a long article by an American
scientist who had visited Chernobyl and talked to all the major people
involved in the response to the accident.  It makes interesting reading.  He
measured radiation in the area; nothing very serious any more, in the
sections he visited.  Several aspects of the cleanup were being delayed by
cold weather, e.g. replacement of contaminated tar on building roofs.  There
is an implicit comment that attitudes towards radiation have changed:
outside the immediate vicinity, the fallout from Chernobyl was similar in
magnitude to that of a very large atmospheric nuclear test -- an event that
was not uncommon in the 50s, albeit usually in more isolated areas.  In
general he was impressed by the speed and competence of the Soviet response
to the mess.  The medical handling of the situation, in particular, was so
rapid and skilled that it strongly suggests they've had practice at this.
He also notes that the other reactors at the plant were back in operation
within a year -- a considerable contrast to Three Mile Island #1, an
undamaged and perfectly functional reactor that sat idle for the better part
of a decade.

His overall assessment of the cause of the disaster agrees with the common
consensus:  a somewhat hazardous reactor design combined with truly major
ignorance and carelessness by the operators.  He notes that just making
more rules for the rank-and-file operators would not have solved the problem,
because it was one of the senior engineers who was responsible for most of
the violations of normal operating rules.  As an immediate precaution, the
operators are now told that the plant management is *not* authorized to
override the basic safety rules.  Much more attention is now being paid to
operations issues in general, and some modest modifications to the reactors
have also been made.  The real solution is to use a safer reactor design,
but the worker's paradise is no more willing to scrap a dozen power plants
overnight than the dirty capitalists would be.

In the July 22 issue of the SF Chronicle, page 20, Layne Ridley wrote
an article about flying fears.  (This is the same issue that reported
that two Delta incidents are being blamed on the ATC, not the pilots.)
Part of the response to "The pilot is drunk or incompetent." is:

   The captain of an airliner is held legally responsible for every
   aspect of the flight.  No matter if he or she was acting in good faith
   on instructions from the airline, an air-traffic controller or anybody
   else, if an plane under a captain's control is involved in any
   infraction or incident, the captain will be suspended, guilty until
   proven innocent.

What are the pilot's responsibilities and liabilities?  What about the
controller's?

  &gt;From Nancy Leveson &lt;nancy%murphy.UCI.EDU@ROME.UCI.EDU&gt;
  &gt;The reasons for the nuclear power industry problems go way beyond
  &gt;construction difficulties...

Oh yes, I realize that. I just hate it when people are dishonest when it
comes to such critical safety issues; it reads too much like a horror movie,
but it's for real. As for economics and engineering, I realize that those
are problems. Sorry for presenting such a simplified view without explanation.

  &gt;I have not seen Robocop, but from the descriptions in Risks of the robot
  &gt;following orders and killing someone inappropriately, I would hate to think
  &gt;that this is the way we would want to build a nuclear power plant...

Again, please allow me to clarify. I am talking about systems that would
only have the intelligence to help watrch for operator mistakes (like noting
that a valve has been open for longer than it normally should), and helping
to consolidate information in case of a major alert--summarizing the critical
information and making suggestions for courses of action. Basically, I envision
a system that is similar to the direction being taken in cockpit avionics.
With such a system, however, there is a risk that is the bane of all pilots--
boredom. For a wonderful set of information on aviation risks, see the
November 1986 issue of IEEE Spectrum. I don't suggest reading it on a plane :-)
 
I have no intention of ever letting a computer run a nuclear power plant, or
the US ICBM system (see WarGames). We are not at that stage, and I am not
sure that we ever want to be. Computers can be useful in presenting information
in a useful fashion. Making decisions is another matter altogether.

Alex Bangs, Harvard Robotics Lab, bangs@metatron.harvard.edu

  Just a quick addition. John Page, from our lab, suggested that the computer
  ought to call up the NRC on operator overrides and request that they come
  take a look, i.e. the computer plays the rat :-)  Alex

In a comment on the propsed FCC data transmission fee, Alex Bangs states
that in this case the "users, not the compay" will pay the tax.  I would
just like to comment that in *all* cases it is the users, or customers,
who pay the tax.  I.e., the company gets all its money from what it
charges the buyers, and must therefore pass along increases in taxes.

My comments reflect neither agreement with nor oppositon to the FCC
proposal.  I just wanted to clarify that one point.

This is a request for information: can any of the readers of this list
provide examples of problems caused by computer errors in the medical field? 
         [Presumably the requestor has been following the Therac-25...  PGN]
I would especially be interested in any relating to loss or damage of
electronically stored medical records and medical orders.  My institution is
in the process of purchasing a Patient Data Management System (PDMS) which is
supposed to eliminate the use of paper recordkeeping in an intensive care
unit.  It will hopefully provide a significant improvement in the speed,
detail and reliability of patient charting, but there is also clearly an
element of risk involved.  Some horror stories might help us open our eyes a
bit and avoid repeating anyone else's errors.

I response to your note in RISKS:

I recently stopped at a nearby supermarket to purchase milk.  I chose the
cheapest brand (not an easy task, since the labels on the shelves were very
poorly maintained and the packages are not marked at all).

When the clerk scanned the cartons the register rang up a price
considerably higher than what was on the shelf (though not enough
higher to be noticable in the middle of a large bill).  Since I
was only buying one item, I *did* notice the difference and objected.
The clerk went off to check with somebody, then gave me the lower price.

What was truly amazing was the reaction at the customer service counter
when I stopped to complain.  I was informed that, yes, the prices in
the store's computer do not necessarily match the prices marked on the
shelves, and the customer who isn't careful may get cheated.  I received
the impression that mine was a relatively common experience and that
the store did not consider it a problem.

I sent a very formal, very strongly-worded letter to the store manager,
but received no reply.

There must be something very different about the way Bell Canada
calling cards work, or else I missed the point somewhere.

&gt; &gt;AT&amp;T phone credit cards use a credit card number that consists
&gt; &gt;(in most cases) of your phone number followed by four
&gt; &gt;(presumably somewhat random) digits.

I suspect this is only true in some cases.  It's certainly not true for me.
The first 10 digits of my credit card number are some random telephone
number in some exchange I've never heard of.  It's certainly not my
telephone number.  I don't even have a Canadian telephone number, currently.
                [Actually this is true of several of the nonAT&amp;T carriers.] 

&gt; When I realized that, and that the only purpose of the card was
&gt; to remember the number, I memorized the last 4 digits and
&gt; destroyed the card.

But that's not the only use of the card.  My card, at least, has 2 numbers
(and a mag stripe that we'll come to later).  The second number is an
international calling card number, good (in theory) outside North America
(in practice, no one in Western Europe seems to honour it yet, but I keep
hoping).

&gt; The possibility that someone who knows my name will look over
&gt; my shoulder while I was using it was just too great.

I can't imagine what difference knowing your name makes.  They
never ask me what my name is.  In any case, 'they' can look at
your fingers pushing the keys on the telephone just as easily as
at the card.  Actually, the mag stripe is safer in this respect;
you never have to hold it still in anyone's line of vision.

&gt; Even now when the cards are magnetic there's not much point in
&gt; keeping them, as there are as many systems that accept regular
&gt; credit cards wherever the AT&amp;T machines are.

This doesn't seem to match my experience.
(a) I've been to many places where the credit card machines only
    take telephone cards.
(b) some credit cards cost more for the same phone call.  At the
    least, there is the service charge for the use of the card.
(c) the audit trail isn't as good.  When I have used VISA to make
    a phone call, I get back, on my VISA account, an undecodable
    string of digits.  When I use my calling card, I get a line
    item on the standard telephone bill in a standard,
    comprehensible format.

All in all, I'd say there is a lot of point in keeping the card
and using the mag stripe.

&gt;According to my opinion, the risk that computers blindly follow
&gt;instructions is not so high than the risk that people
&gt;blindly follow orders. So they have always done, but the risk
&gt;is greater nowadays, when we have the so called advanced technology
&gt;in our hands. ....

	True - people blindly following orders are probably worse
than computers doing it. The intent behind my original posting though
(which seems to have been widely missed) is that an even bigger
potential risk is that some large fraction of non-technical society
(a) doesn't realize that there ARE risks in the use of computer
technology (no surprise there really), and (b) when shown risks,
these people do not say "hey, that's a problem", they say "hey, that's
a good joke". At least in places (if any :-) where democratic government
works according to theory, those same people help make decisions about
some rather critical, risky uses of computers ("Shall we spend
X billion dollars on computerized anti-missile defenses?", "It must
be OK to build the new nuclear power plant, the computer simulations
say it's safe", etc.) Depending on how widely people really mistake
serious risks for funny glitches, we have a situation in which the
people deploying new technology (at least in a broad policy sense)
may neither know what they are doing, nor realize that there are
important things that they don't know. This, to my mind, is a much
more serious risk (or meta-risk) than the failure of particular languages
to check subscript limits or whatever.

	I guess what I hope to do was get some discussion/feedback
on this kind of meta-risk going (other instances? does it really exist or
am I just a pessimist? what can/should be done about it? etc.) Apologies
if earlier postings didn't make this clear.

   $23-MILLION COMPUTER SNAFU ADDS TO BofA'S TROUBLES

Bank of America quietly acknowledged a $23-million computer snafu that is
alienating key customers and will likely take months to fix.  The
one-sentence disclosure in the company's second-quarter financial report
said, "the corporation established a reserve for estimated costs, arising
from problems in Bank of America's conversion to a new trust accounting and
reporting system, which reduced net income by $23 million."

The problems arose when a new system, MasterNet, was brought on line in
March before being fully debugged to replace an aging system.  "They
committed two cardinal sins," a trust dept. official said.  "They took down
the old system before the new system was up and running.  And they were the
first big bank to install the system.  A key rule in computer software is:
Never go first."

As a result, sources say, the system has crashed for days at a time, the
bank is months behind in providing customers with their monthly statements
and there have been potentially costly delays in trading securities.
Sources called it a major embarrassment.  "Heads are going to roll."

The institutional trust services department administers more than $38
billion in pension fund and other assets for more than 800 corporations,
unions, and government agencies.

MasterNet was designed by Premier Systems Inc., a Wayne, Pa., software
services company.  "It is not our practice to discuss successes or
failures," said Arthur A. Kock Jr., vice president and chief financial
officer.  [I guess potential customers just like their name?! -- RH]

The system is designed around four Prime Computer models known as Leopards,
costing about $750,000 each.  "Prime has had at least five people here full
time trying to staighten things out," a bank official said.  "This is going
to be a really slick system, when it works," he added.

     [Chickenfeed?  BofA just declared a $1.14 Billion loss for the quarter
     on anticipated writeoffs for bad loans...  PGN]

Speaking of computer crime, etc., it is timely that I noted the
following article from Associated Press "buried" in our local paper:

                     Computer crime ring broken

Pittsburgh - Nine high school students in Pennsylvania have been arrested as
part of a countrywide computer crime ring that illegally bought millions of
dollars worth of goods and services, authorities say.
   Juveniles and adults from New York City to California were involved,
police said. The ring illegally obtained thousands of credit card numbers by

In the same week, two youngsters involved in the P.Floyd breakins at
Stanford an Berkeley were apprehended on the west coast.  Apparently the FBI
and Secret Service have been trying to crack down on crackers.  (See three
articles by John Markoff in the SF Examiner, 23 and 24 July for background.)

Disclaimer: RISKS does not condone unsavory cracking, and certainly does not
wish to glorify it.  The systems that were broken into were not considered
to be highly secure systems.  However, we have noted here that even systems
that are considered highly secure can be vulnerable to attack.  On the other
hand, we strongly urge emphasis on teaching that pervasively stresses social
values and ethics as an integral part of education and life experience, not
just on encouraging our youths to learn how to manipulate computers.  PGN]

  This is regarded in several sectors as an increasingly sensitive subject,
  and I am of the growing opinion that it not appropriate to discuss
  this subject in an open forum.   Readers should also note that several
  of the FORMER readers have included `experts' in this field.

Eugene, Because it is an increasingly sensitive subject is exactly the
reason it SHOULD be discussed.  This is an open society, North, Poindexter,
and the 'gipper' notwithstanding.  If you don't want to express your
opinions and share your knowledge about how to safely deal with the nuclear

    [This is of course a very old debate in RISKS.  In general, the awareness
    that there are serious problems is clearly a RISKS-related topic.  
    Considering the potentials for sabotage, misguided experiments, and so on
    there is a little justification for hiding the specific problems.  However,
    if the existence of such problems is hidden, the public can be grossly
    misled.  This debate thus echoes some of the Contragate hearings on what
    the public should know...  RISKS always tries to opt for openness, while
    recognizing the sensitivity of certain details.  PGN]

The morning paper reported that new a computerized tollbooth system made its
debut yesterday on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, at the King of Prussia/Valley
Forge interchange (the exit for Philadelphia). It resulted in huge snarled
traffic jams and delays.

Apparently they replaced the old toll cards, which you used to hand to the
attendant who then asked for your fare, with new ones that you insert
directly into a slot to be read by a computerized system which displays your
fare on an LED readout. The new cards are so small, though, that no one can
read them. So people didn't know what the fare was going to be until they saw
it on the readout, whereas people used to read their card ahead of time and
have their money ready.

In RISKS 5.15, Andy Freeman queried:
&gt; What are the pilot's responsibilities and liabilities?  What about the
&gt; controller's?

The Federal Aviation Regulations are the laws governing aviation in
the US.  Subchapter F of the FARs is entitled "Air Traffic and
General Operating Rules"; Part 91 of the FARs (part of Subchapter F)
is entitled "General Operating and Flight Rules."  FAR 91.3 states:

	91.3 Responsibility and authority of the pilot in command

	  (a) The pilot in command of an aircraft is directly
	responsible for, and is the final authority as to, the
	operation of that aircraft.

So, the PIC has total responsibility.  91.3 continues:

	  (b) In an emergency requiring immediate action, the pilot
	in command may deviate from any rule of this subpart [91-A:
	General] or of Subpart B [91-B: Flight Rules] to the extent
	required to meet that emergency.

Yes, there is accountability for emergency deviations, under 91.3(c).  (In
fact, it's interesting to note that a large number of pilots have delayed
declaring an emergency, or failed to declare an emergency altogether,
because of this potential accountability.  The FAA's official word -- and
practice, from history -- is to declare the emergency, make the necessary
deviations, and not to worry about "enforcement.")  Regardless, this gives
an idea of the authority of the PIC.  Note that these regulations apply
equally to all non-military flying in the US, air carrier, air taxi, and
general aviation alike.  As a (private) pilot, I take the accountability
portions of FAR 91.3 very, very seriously.

Andy Freeman's comment in <A HREF="/Risks/5.15.html">RISKS-5.15</A> and the ongoing discussion of ATC and
related affairs prompts me to offer some historical perspective on the
contemporary air traffic control system and anti-collision devices.  Its
history but it also has relevance to us as professionals in a computer world.

In World Wide II, an electronic radio-based technique called Identification
Friend or Foe (IFF) was invented by the British.  The problem at the time
was to tell whether a radar-detected aircraft belonged to our side or to the
other side.  Successive generations of the system were designed and by the
time it got to the one called Mark III, the various equipments in the system
were brought to this country where everything was re-engineered and put into
production for the Allied forces.  The Hazeltine Electronics Corp, then of
Little Neck, (Long Island) NY, was the focal point in the country for IFF
work under USN contracts.  Today we would call Hazeltine the systems
engineering and support contractor.

The transponder gave a very simple reply to each interrogation pulse: a
narrowly spaced pair indicating a normal response and a widely spaced pair
indicating an emergency situation -- no identification of individual
aircraft.  In fact, there's a famous incident concerning the capture of
several IFF equipments by the Germans from downed Allied aircraft; the
foes flew in looking like friends and clobbered (I think it was) Bari,
Italy almost into oblivion.

Toward the end of WW-II, the USN sponsored the design and development of a
successor system called Mark V.  Among other improvements, it transmitted
a 10-bit response which could be coded to identify individual aircraft and
operated at a higher frequency (L band) so the antennas could be smaller.

The war ended before Mark V got widely deployed and Hazeltine found itself
with all the great technology and ideas looking for a problem in the
civilian world.  Some internal studies were done and Hazeltine proposed a
national air traffic control system which layered the airspace into 1000'
increments (even altitudes going one way and odd altitudes, the other), put
altitude-reporting transponders on all aircraft, assigned a unique identifier 
to each aircraft, and used ground interrogators to challenge the transponders. 
The responses were to be displayed on PPI scopes which also would contain
correlated radar responses simply by synching the radar and interrogator
transmiters.  It was a very primitive digital system and naturally was to be
done in vacuum tubes -- which is all there was at the time!

Then (1945-47) only the ENIAC had been built; the UNIVACs and the
Princeton family of machines had yet to be developed.  The digital
computer had yet to really emerge so that the ground environment was not
proposed to be highly automated.

Now to the point of this history.  At the time, one of the important
arguments, if not principle, was the question of responsibility.  There
were discussions about whether the pilots would accept a traffic control
system that was ground based and would only give him directions.  In fact,
there were proposals to put the air picture together on the ground and
transmit it back to the cockpits for decision making aloft.

All of the basic ideas in today's ATC were conceived, proposed, and
implemented in the hardware-of-the-day some 40 years ago including the
frequency assignments.  The only conceptually new thing that has come
along has been the computer-based automation that supports the
controllers, although there has been of course a multitude of technology
and engineering advances and the evolution of efficient operating
procedures and overall system administration and some elaboration of
the original basics.  At the same time, the altitude-reporting transponder
is a relatively recent addition; it roughly parallels the introduction
of jet aircraft.

We all recall the slow progress of a ground-based ATC.  Quite aside from
the usual problems of introducing a new technology and persuading airline
companies to put more equipment on aircraft (that, at the time, were
generally weight, not volume, limited in carrying capacity), the pilots
argued for having ultimate responsibility and decisions.  For quite a
while, we ran a national airspace with ground-based rotating light
beacons, and various radio navaids.  We didn't have radars, much less a
transponder system.

Anti-collision proposals have followed the similar path; and for the
same reason, we still don't have them in place except experimentally.  One
of the long running arguments has been the self-same "place of
responsibility." The pilot, supported by his union and legal forces, has
argued that the ultimate decisions had to be in the cockpit because of the
legal responsibility mentioned by Andy Freeman.  The electronikers of
course argued that the job could be done much more effectively,
efficiently, comprehensively, and cheaply on the ground.

Honoring the established wisdom of learning from history, there is
something for our business.  Namely, in the solutions and conceptual
frameworks that we propose for this, that, or the other application, we'd
better be mindful of the legal environment in which the users of our
systems will be; we'd better be especially sensitive to the legal
obligations of the system users vs. where we put the automated support,
how we funnel its output to the legally obligated users, and what
legal responsibility it incurs.

It also relates to an aspect of compusec that has been little talked
about; in fact I never recall it coming up in the defense environment
although "2-man control" is a long established principle in stategic
weapons control.  It has come up only a little in the commercial compusec
world although it's an implicit principle in traditional conduct of
business in a paper world.  It's "role separation" or division of
responsibility.

Appropos of the insider threat and the overall integrity of system
operation, there is a growing awareness that separation of role is an
unaddressed but important latent issue in the compusec world.  One
shouldn't have the same individual both writing checks and signing them,
nor should the implementation of a system allow an otherwise authorized
user to have unauthorized access to both functions.

This principle also serves the reliability-of-performance issue.  For some
applications, notably ones involving high risk and/or public safety, one may
be wise to separate the automated functions of monitoring and reporting from
the (possibly automated or possibly manual) actual control of the process.
But even then, we better watch the legal assignment of responsibility vs.
the source of data on which to make decisions under that responsibility.

The following issue is a relatively one technically, I suspect, but may be
fairly common.  I am the co-author of a small book on nonverbal
communication (Benson &amp; Frandsen, NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION, Science Research
Associates).  For some time the book had a fairly large market as a
textbook.  Suddenly the sales fell off.  Then my own university bookstore
reported to me, when I tried to order it as a text, that it was out of
print.  I was pretty sure this wasn't so, and in a series of calls tracked
down the answering/ordering service from which all college bookstores order
the book.  It turns out that the book was listed on the computer database
under the name of the series of which it is a part (Modules in Speech
Communication) and that occupied the title field; an attempt to request the
title NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION returned a message that there was no such
title, which the operator naturally interpreted by telling the bookstore
there was no such title, so it must be out of print.  So bookstores told
this to professors, who ordered a different book.  This first happened
almost two years ago, and was followed by promises to correct it.  It
happened again last week.  It would seem that this is probably a fairly
common situation, and that it is one that is very unlikely to reveal itself,
since most people would not argue with the computer on such an issue.  I'd
be interested to hear whether such simple but mostly undetected errors (with
real consequences in this case for the availability of this book) are
common--and commonly corrected.

    Here in Atlanta, the Kroger stores advertise their "scan-rite" policy.
That is, if any item gets rung up via UPC with a different price than that

no sympathy, either.

Here in the Midwest we have a popular supermarket chain called

that if an incident similar to Mr. Scott's occurs, the customer
receives the disputed item for free.  Not a bad idea!

The RISK to the public of incorrect computer-controlled grocery-store
pricing may be the most common form of computerized fraud perpetrated
on the general populace. At least, I think it is the most likely to
happen to the ordinary individual.

The inconsistency between shelf-posted prices and what the stores'
computers have as the on-line price is still fairly common around
here (St. Louis); more likely at National stores, which is one of the
two chains I normally shop at. When scanning came in and individual-item
price-marking was dropped, there was much publicity about how the stores
would give you your money back if you were charged more than the shelf
price. These policies are still in effect, but are not publicized
any more. Also, I think the staff have gotten so used to the system
that they have become sloppy and careless. 

I often get several dollars' worth of free groceries by remembering
what the shelf price is and watching the display during checkout. You
just pay what the register shows, and then take the ticket and items to
the manager's cubicle and point out the discrepancy. The way the refunds
are implemented now is that, if you bought more than one each of an item
where the price was wrong, you get one free and a refund for the
difference on the others. If you bought one each of several items where
the prices were wrong, you get all the cost refunded (plus you get your
sales tax back, too, of course). One interesting aspect of this is that
the local stores have been doing "double coupons" for the past year or
two -- if you had redeemed a coupon on the item, they are paying you
twice the coupon value to take the thing! (Only once did the manager
check on coupons and give me back the coupon and cancel out its
redemption and adjust the refund accordingly.)

This is actually cheaper for the stores than trying to do it right in
the first place, I think. They are paying me by giving me free groceries
to do their job for them; since probably only a tiny fraction of the
great unwashed consuming public pays close enough attention to what they
are doing to catch these price discrepancies, it doesn't really cost
the stores that much -- undoubtedly cheaper than it would cost to pay their
staff high enough wages to expect them to be more accurate all the time!
Plus, of course, they get the extra income from overcharging the majority
of customers until they are caught. 

The stores also have an interesting method of correcting the discrepancy:
they never change the computer price -- they just change or remove the
shelf tag! (At least I have never seen any evidence that the computer-
stored price gets changed.) When you report the discrepancy to the
manager, they send a stockboy to pull off the shelf tag.

This sort of thing can be consistent and repeatable, too -- for example,
there is a local brand of taco chips I only buy when they are on sale
for 99 cents a bag istead of the usual $1.29, and EVERY time I buy these
I get a free bag! The store seems to never change the computer price when
they put up the "sale" sign on the chip display! (Usually I buy these on
Monday, the first day the new price would be in effect, but I have run
into this as late in the week as Wednesday evening. That means that three
days' worth of shoppers have not yet noticed the price difference, in a
huge busy store, or the computer price has not been updated despite reports.)

Anyway, if you are alert enough to pay attention, this is one RISK that
you can turn to your advantage.

[Note to risks readers: Michael Scott and I are colleagues in Rochester.
Topps and Wegmans are the largest of the local grocery chains, and the
main representatives of the hypermodern gigantic school.  Topps goes for
the blue-collar clientele; Wegmans is ritzier.]

Topps or Wegmans?  We always have this problem at Topps, and average
about 25 cents a trip or so in scanner errors.  We check the receipt
very thoroughly every time; I'll go back in the store and recheck shelves
to be sure.  They are always very nice about giving us our money.

At Wegmans, on the other hand, you get the item free, or a dollar back,
whichever is less.  One used to get the entire order free at Wegmans
for catching a scanner error; from the fact they stopped,  I gather that
other people than I noticed the following obvious strategy: buy one copy
(at least) of every item in the store; one item is sure to scan wrong,
so you will get the entire order free.  Out of some undoubtably foolish
sense of rightness, I never tried this; however, I did get several free
normal orders for noticing scanner errors.  The change in policy has
caused me to switch to Topps, which has generally lower prices.  I just
have to be more watchful.

Please to note that the number of scanner errors is substantially smaller
than the number of errors committed by clerks at manual cash registers;
furthermore, the scanner errors are much more easily checked, since
each line of the receipt shows the item scanned.  I have only caught
one error in interpreting the bar code.

Unfortunately the clarification is not entirely correct, although it is
fairly widely held misbelief.  While the application of a new tax to a
product or service will often result in an increase in cost to the end
user, it is very often NOT the case that this end user cost increase is
equal to the tax increase; in many cases the company absorbs some of
the cost.  A government decree will not necessarily affect the price
that a market will bear in as predictable a manner as is suggested by
this ``clarification.''

It is not true that development of computer security principles in the
"defense establishment" has ignored the principle of separation of
duties.  At class B2 of the Orange Book a system is required to support
separate operator and [security] administrator roles.  At B3 and above
it is quite explicit that a) to assume the security administrator role a
distinct auditable action must be taken, and b) that when performing in
that role a person is limited to ONLY doing those things "essential to
performing the security role effectively." Furthermore, there was quite
a long discussion at one of the recent national conferences (I forget
whether it was the last Oakland conference or the NBS/DoD before it)
about the topic of separation of duties as found in the financial
community and how it did or did not relate to the kinds of security
policies "traditionally" found in trusted systems.  One could in fact
argue that the fundamental principle of "need-to-know" versus
"clearance" is a kind of two-man rule:  the person who decides to let me
see a particular classified document, based on his judgement that I need
to see it, is not the same person who grants me the clearance that I
must have in the first place.

On the one hand, I am loathe to assign any sort of serious meaning to
Robocop. It was basically lots of very well done violence with a streak of
humor thrown in. The most thought provoking question I had after seeing it
was "Who in their right mind would trust anything that carried a big gun and
ran MS-DOS?" On the other hand, Ebert's quote clearly ignored the major plot
line of the movie. The guy who was championing ED-209 (The robot that gunned
down a board member during a demonstration) really didn't care if it killed
people. One of his quotes was something to the effect of "I had it all lined
up. Millitary contracts, spare parts for the next 25 years. The profits would
have been great. Who cares if it worked!" Of course the competition for the
ED-209 was a cyborg (half human) which had human judgement and therefore was
much safer... The other great social comment in the movie was the
not-so-overdone "trivialize death and suffering" newscasts.

As for computer risks, there was one lesson to be learned from Robocop. If
you are going to program back doors into an armed robot to protect yourself,
make sure you word your logic strongly enough so you don't get blown away in
the end :-)

In article &lt;8707252233.AA15919@csl.csl.sri.com&gt;:
&gt;The system is designed around four Prime Computer models known as Leopards,
&gt;costing about $750,000 each.  "Prime has had at least five people here full
&gt;time trying to staighten things out," a bank official said.  "This is going
&gt;to be a really slick system, when it works," he added.

A couple of corrections:  The "leopard" was Prime's development name for the
6350.  B of A did not have any in March, since the 6350 had not been announced
and B of A was not a hardware beta test site.  (USC was one of three beta sites
for the 6350, ours was installed in April if I remember correctly.)

(Chances are that B of A got 9955-II's and planned to upgrade.)

Attached, please find some references to applications of computers to
nuclear power plant monitoring and engineering.  A frequent theme is to try
and reduce cognitive overload in the event of a critical situation, i.e.,
present something other than 500 alarms ringing at once.

Works in the control engineering field address this issue in a more general
context: power plants, nuclear plants, chemical plants etc.  A couple of AI
based tools for fault tree analysis which is used in estimating risk
probabilities in the nuclear field among others have also been announced at
various conferences.

For those desiring to track this field, you should watch the American
Control Conference every year and the section for nuclear engineering and
control engineering in the IEEE Computer and Control Abstracts.  This is
very complete: our librarians complain that people keep requesting
references from there that are not in any library in the United States which
makes Interlibrary Loan a tad bit difficult.  It ranges from six months to a
year behind the date of publication unfortunately for the printed edition.

As far as the RISK of an accident, the average number of days of life loss
for nuclear accidents in the United States is on the order of two days per
person.  This uses probabilities estimated by antinuclear power plant
groups.  The number of days lost is a tenth to a hundredth of such risks as
automobile accidents, lighting and the like which we accept on a regular basis.

Hans Mark pointed out that the loss of life from Chernobyl due to delayed
cancers would be lost in the "noise."  That is no statistical test done on
deaths in the Soviet Union could discern that something happened.  If
nuclear power plants were removed and replaced with coal burning plants,
more people would die from the radiation released into the atmosphere by the
burning coal.  This ignores the death toll from coal mine accidents and air
pollution.  In short nuclear power plants are about as risk free as one can
get in this society and our energies are much better off being devoted to
automobile accidents, cigarrette smoking and alcohol addiction.

Two security notes:

First, on the discussion about scanner errors in grocery stores.  The chance
that these are actually scanning errors is so small as to be ignorable. The
UPC barcode they use is incredibly reliable, and includes two separate check
digits encoded in different ways.  What is very likely to go wrong is the
shelf labels. Usually, the system is that the computer database is updated,
and automatically prints revised shelf labels. There then is a considerable
lag while the labels are actually put on the shelves. Of course, sometimes
they forget to update the database, especially for sales.

Second, on actual computer security. We have 40 AT&amp;T PC7300s that are used
to teach an introductory computing course. We have had notable problems with
them (our current favorite causes students with output loops to end up losing 
the lab they're working on, source code and all), but were surprised when
the root passwords started to mutate. One of us asked the monitor in the
lab, who offered to break root for him so he could change it back. It seems
that with two mouse clicks, and two presses of the enter key, you can get a
root shell. There's a bug in the shutdown procedure, causing it to give you
all its warnings, push a root shell (complete with window system that says
"Office of root", just in case you don't know you're root), and then stop.
Most of the students don't know enough about UNIX to make any use of this
trick, but some of them seem to find changing the passwords around amusing.

A mainframe system that we have occasion to use retires passwords every 28
days and does not allow any of the four previous passwords to be re-used.
Since we use the system mainly for re-hosting (i.e., not "real" work or
personal files), the onerousness of this scheme has driven many of us to
using extremely easy-to-remember passwords on that system, such as the name
of the current month.  I find this quite ironic.

I thought people might be interested in a small article that appeared in
a sidebar of today's Chicago Tribune, Business Section, Monday, 27 July 1987.

                     "You'd better watch out

  A new software program lets anybody with access to an IBM or IBM-compatible
  personal computer become a hacker, at least on a small scale.  The program,
  from Mainland Machine, San Luis Obispo, Calif., is called PC-Prankster.

  It wasn't necessarily designed with the idea of making the world a better
  place in which to live.  An electronic jokester can sneak up and install PC
  Prankster on a friend or loved one's ``boot disk,'' (the disk used to fire up
  the computer's operating system when it is turned on), whereupon it resides
  in memory waiting for its chance to pounce.

  As soon as the PC user reaches a certain set number of keystrokes, the 
  prankster takes over.  The work in progress disappears, one of five ugly
  creatures fills the screen and blows a kiss, then vanishes, and the screen
  returns to where it was before the intrusion.  The prank repeats itself
  every 5 minutes or so.

  Among the characters are a cyclops that blinks and a flasher that flashes.
  The only way to get rid of PC-Prankster is to use the delete program 
  contained on the disk.  Or you could drop your PC out the window, timing
  it to land on the perpetrator.  PC Prankster costs $19.95 and also works
  on hard disk systems.

This really bothers me.  The article (and the program) imply that fooling 
with someone's work on a computer is acceptable and that hacking is just 
harmless playing.  The article also seems to imply that the program
is otherwise harmless "..and the screen returns to where it was before
the intrustion."  I find it unlikely that such a program will be perfectly
harmless in all cases.

I'm sure other people are more qualified to comment on other risks of such
a program, including the similarity of such a program to a trojan horse.

In RISKS 5.16, someone mentioned that a ring of teenaged credit card hackers
was recently broken. What they didn't mention is that the solving of the case
had nothing to do with the computer end of it at all. One of the kids bought
a skateboard with a hot card number, and his mother was so annoyed at his use
of the skateboard that she turned him in!

  &gt;Under the terms of the Act, Gold and Schifreen were charged with "making
  &gt;a false instrument on, or in, which information was recorded or stored by
  &gt;electronic means, with the intention of using it to induce the Prestel 
  &gt;computer to accept it as genuine, and by reason of so accepting it to do 
  &gt;an act to the prejudice of British Telecom plc".

This case is reminiscent of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in
R. v. McLaughlin (1980), 113 DLR(3d) 386-394.  In both cases the
authorities attempted to use a statute enacted for other purposes
to prosecute unauthorized computer use.

In the British case, as outlined above, the Act used was one
which makes forgery and counterfeiting illegal.  In the Canadian
case, which involved a University of Alberta student obtaining
unauthorized access to a university computer, the charge was that
of fraudulently using a "telecommunication facility", in violate
of s.287 of our Criminal Code.  (That provision is the one used
for people who use blue boxes to make long-distance calls.)

The Supreme Court's decision boiled down to this quote (at p. 394):

    Had Parliament intended to associate penal consequences the unauthorized
    operation of a computer, it no doubt would have done so in a section of 
    the Criminal Code or other penal statute in which the term which is now 
    so permanently embedded in our language is employed.

The result was that Parliament did indeed enact legislation making illegal
the unauthorized use of computers (in 1986).  It looks like the British
Parliament will have to do the same.  In the context of the quote above, the
decision of the English Court of Appeal is probably correct.  I'll be
interested in seeing whether the Court of Appeal referred to the (Canadian)
McLaughlin case.

     Tarrant County (Fort Worth) is about to start a 911 emergency telephone
service, the second in the state, prompting quite a few newspaper articles
about aspects of their service and that of Harris County (Houston), which
started in January 1986.
     The details I found most interesting were the problems that had to be
overcome in both systems.  (Quoted without permission from the Dallas Morning
News)

    For instance, Harris County found initially that people dialing a
    seven-digit number with 911 in it would sometimes reach the emergency
    operator by mistake.  Telephone company computers were so quick, they
    would pick up the 911 and transfer the call before waiting for a fourth
    digit.  [There are no other magic three-digit calls in this area:  for
    411, one dials 1411, and all other numbers are seven digits.  - pf]  ...

    In the beginning, 911 operators were deluged by calls from children
    trying out the system and from people who put the 911 number on the
    speed-dialing function on their telephones and hit the number by mistake.

    Misdirected calls also come in from cordless phones whose batteries are
    low -- a situation that seems to mistakenly trigger calls to 911 ...

    Another problem Tarrant County is working on is establishing street
    addresses for rural homes.  The [911] district is working with the U.S.
    Postal Service and telephone companies to assign street addresses to more
    than 9,000 locations in Tarrant County so that a recognizable address
    will appear on the screen -- not just a rural route and box number.

    [The director] was surprised when the effort met some resistance. ...
    "Some people have said, `I'm not going to use 911 so I don't need my
    address changed.'"

Tarrant County will start up their system on August 2, despite the failure
of equipment to automatically transfer the address information from the
emergency operator to the appropriate agency.  Dallas County (Dallas)
expects to start their own service next April; the goal is that the whole
state will have 911 by 1995.

This idea of "passing it on" is nonsense.  A Company, or any organization
selling a product or service, will charge as much as it can for its product
or service.  It does not matter how much the product costs them or how much
it is taxed or how much of the external costs are forcibly internalized by
regulations.  The question is simply "Does the amount received sufficiently
cover the cost of production to justify the organization continuing the
process?"  If the profit is too small or non-existent then the process is
halted.  If the profit is great, others will get into the act.

For the topic that came up in Risks, the question is "How will the companies
providing electronic communications services respond to the added costs of
FCC taxes?"  Some possible responses are (1) absorb them (not bloody
likely), (2) Add them to the price for the service (not a "passing on" but a
shift in customer base), (3) Absorb them for a while and add them slowly to
see how the customers react and (4) Get the FCC changed.

In my view, the key result of this will be to shift the customer base away
from private individuals to corporate individuals (corporations can more
easily add the extra costs to their products).  My question is then "Why is
the FCC using its taxing privileges to manipulate the electronic
communications market to force out the private individual?"  That leads us
away from the risks of computers to risks of another kind.

(If people want to argue this view of economics they should send mail to me
directly.  No need to clutter Risks with these more general questions.)

The risk-assessment numbers put forth to justify nuclear power's safety
remind me of Mark Twain's observation that there are three kinds of lies:
lies, damned lies, and statistics.  What real evidence or experience do we
have for these projections and statistics?  How can we meaningfully discuss
the "safe" containment of wastes that are dangerous for a time span
comparable to all of recorded history so far?  How much do we really know,
and how much of it is based on "plausible" guesses and conjectures?

The fact that nuclear power plants have been run in a generally safe way in
the past tells me very little about the future danger from them.  Predicting
the future like that is similar to the statistical fallacy that if a fair
coin has come up "heads" 500 times in a row, it is somehow "more likely" to
come up "heads" the next time that I flip it.  [Alternately, some people also
believe that it's "more likely" to come up "tails", since it's "about time".]

Car wrecks and cigarette smoking kill more people than nuclear plants, sure,
but the way that they kill people is very different.  Car accidents
generally don't affect a zone of several miles' diameter, forcing evacuation
and abandonment of homes.  Cars and cigarette smoke are perceptible, whereas
radiation isn't (I know that carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, but
you rarely get carbon monoxide from cars or cigarettes without smelly
components, too.).  Chernobyl has shown that when an accident occurs, it
doesn't matter that it's a rare event: it's an extremely unpleasant event.
Who cares if a meltdown happens "once in 100,000 years" if it happens
tomorrow?  It is perfectly rational to decide that a potential catastrophe
is undesirable, no matter how rare it is.

The Giant Eagle chain of supermarkets in western Pennsylvania has automated
checkout scanners at the bigger stores. But they also have a policy they call
Absolute Minimum Pricing, and as a part of this, they have a strict rule that
you can be ejected from the supermarket if you are caught writing down their
prices from the tags on the shelves (because they want to keep the jump on
the competition)! So I suppose very few people ever manage to catch scanner
price errors at Giant Eagles.

Re: Cash register prices not agreeing with shelf tags

Don't forget the Hi-Tech creed:

 What is fouled up by technology can be fixed by further technological patches.

In the case of computerized cash registers, help is on the way in the form
of radio-updated LCD shelf tags.  (This is according to an article in last
week's Sunday News and Observer.  I can dig it out, but it is unlikely to
contain any useful facts.)

Of course, this will bring two new risks:

  The price may go up while you're waiting in line.

  The tags may be affected by teenage vandals who have gotten
  bored with breaking into computers.

  [Recalling the students who spliced themselves into the comm line to the
  Rose Bowl scoreboard and took over the display, we can certainly look forward
  to someone changing the prices downward just before checking out.  PGN]

In The Economist, July 25, 1987, pp. 73-74, there is an interesting look at
the coming automation of commercial airports.  Deregulation has led to
explosive growth in demand, with consequences all of us who fly can talk at
length about.  The chart in the article shows the current ~10^12 revenue
passenger miles/year almost doubling by the year 2000.(~6% growth per year).

The article discusses the introduction of automation to cope with increasing
airport and aircraft size.  After a brief look at automated ground traffic
control, including arrival gate assignment,  it concentrates on evolving
mechanisms for baggage sorting and handling.  There is also a brief mention
of the problems associated with sharing ticket counter facilities by small
airlines when each uses a different, incompatable, reservation system. Large
emphasis is placed on a new International Civil Aviation Organisation rule
effective next year that will require carriers to match every piece of 
baggage loaded with a passenger verified to be on the aircraft.

In addition to a brief survey of the technologies involved, there is a lot 
of discussion of the potential problems:  Simple system breakdown, incom-
patible tag systems at different airports, accidental mischief (child with
toy magnet scrambling magnetically encoded tickets), and malicious mischief
(as simple as disgruntled employees entering false gate data, thereby running
aircraft around in circles).

My favorite "fun" prospect mentioned is baggage tags where the human and
machine readable destinations differ...  This one reminds of the old check
kiting scheme based on checks with mismatched bank name/numbers.

The article is very witty, and I just hope the people designing these systems
are experienced.  I think we can find examples of just about every kind of
risk ever mentioned in this forum lurking here.

Oh yeah, the solution to the incompatible reservation system problem is 
CUTE...Common Use Terminal Equipment.

In RISKS 5:15, Andy Freeman asked, in regard to commercial airline operations:

  &gt; What are the pilot's responsibilities and liabilities?  What about the
  &gt; controller's?

As one of many private pilots reading RISKS, I'll try to answer.  In so doing, 
I will attempt to simplify the system enough to a) be understood by non-pilots,
b) not insult too many pilots, and c) not reveal too much of my own ignorance.

The statement of the pilot's responsibilities is, like the U.S. constitution, 
very succinct and, also like the constitution, full of implications:

The pilot-in-command is responsible for all aspects of the flight.

Among other things, this means:

  1) The pilot can refuse Air Traffic Control (ATC) instructions.

  2) Whatever the co-pilot, navigator, flight attendants, airline
     executives, controllers, and everyone else have to say, it is the
     pilot who has the final word on whether a flight is go or no-go.

  3) No matter who's being paid to de-ice the wings, fill the gas tank,
     inflate the tires, clean the windshield, etc., it is the pilot's
     responsibility to determine that the aircraft is ready to fly.

What are ATC's responsibilities?  To put it very succinctly (probably too
succinctly):

  Advisory, sequencing, and separation.

This, of course, means a lot of different jobs.  These jobs are handled
by four different parts of the ATC system which usually involve
different personnel and, somehow, intermesh, communicate, and
coordinate.  These four pieces (not found at all airports) are:

   1) Ground control (take care of traffic on the ground up to the runways),

   2) Tower (control use of the runways, specifically through takeoff and
      landing clearances),

   3) Approach and departure control (control air traffic in the
      vicinity of the airport), and

   4) Enroute traffic control (control air traffic everywhere else).

Ground control and tower operations take place in a tower with a view,
approach/departure control takes place in a darkened room full of radar
scopes, and enroute traffic control takes place in a darkened room at a
regional center (for example, a center in Seattle watches over most of
the Pacific Northwest).

During the course of a typical flight under Instrument Flight Rules
(IFR), ATC tells the pilot when to taxi, when to take off, when to
ascend and descend (and to what altitudes), when to turn, and when to
land -- all based on a flight plan filed by the pilot.  The pilot's job
is to worry about which way the aircraft is pointed and what's going on
in its vicinity -- ATC's job is to allow lots of aircraft to use the
same airspace (clouds and all), airports, runways, and terminals.  That,
in a nutshell, is my attempt to answer Andy's question.

So what's gone wrong with the system?

There's been no shortage of finger-pointing.  Some blame general
aviation (little guys like myself), some blame the PATCO strike, some
blame drugs, some blame deregulation, some blame pilot training.

The answer, of course, isn't all that simple -- it involves economics,
politics, technology, the Reagan military buildup, personnel, unions, etc.
So far, nobody in any position of power has come up with any solution more
creative than to increase regulation of the already heavily-regulated airspace.

My own pessimistic prognosis is that the air traffic system has a lot worse
to get before it's going to get better.

Nathan Meyers   (hplabs!hp-pcd!nathanm)

    [We have noted Henry Petroski's evidence that we tend to learn little from
    our engineering successes, but that the real advances come from trying to
    understand our failures.  There is MUCH to be learned from the ATC
    situation, especially when confronted with the realization that many of
    the existing problems will continue to exist even when the long awaited
    new computer systems arrive.  PGN]

Sorry, but that's true only if you assume that the coin is balanced to have
equal probability of falling heads or tails.  A balanced coin would have a
probability of 2^-500 of 500 consecutive heads; while not impossible, a run
of that length would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the coin was
balanced in favor of heads.  I suggest that the nuclear power industry is 
still demonstrating a good track record and will probably continue to do so.
This doesn't say that there won't be a disaster, but if you want to dismiss
the operating history, you should explain why it represents a statistical
anomoly.  (Coverup, progressive deterioration, etc.)  After 500 consecutive
heads, it isn't unreasonable to expect a 501st head as well.

On the other hand, it is perfectly reasonable to consider whether the
potential damage from an accident outweighs the small probability of its
occurrance, or whether it is outweighed by the reduction in consumption
of non-renewable fuels.  Unfortunately, the analysis may be technical, but
the decision will be political.

In <A HREF="/Risks/5.14.html">RISKS-5.14</A>, Alex Bangs raises two concerns relating to nuclear power plant
safety (construction corruption, intelligent control systems) and requests
references on nuclear power plant control.

Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that a given plant may be constructed 
without "corruption"; I interpret that to mean that the plant is built exactly 
to specification.  Such a procedure does not guarantee that the specification 
itself is correct; nor does it guarantee that a properly constructed plant
built to a correct specification will continue to adhere to that specification 
after it is put into operation.  I do not mean to de-emphasize the problems
that result from shoddy construction practices, but merely to point out that
these are not the only problems; perhaps they are not even the major ones.

With regard to the use of intelligent control systems, a similar plethora of
problems exist.  Although [hopefully!] intelligent control systems known as
"human beings" are now used to operate plants, the multitude of sensor
inputs (some of which may be erroneous) and the large number of possible
failure modes pose problems that are exceedingly difficult to solve even
when copious time is available--which it sometimes isn't.

Consider also what repercussions have already occurred for the nuclear
industry as the result of [possible] human error during crisis situations;
now imagine the outcry if the public at large discovered that a nuclear
accident occurred in part because of a fault in an expert system---a
"computer error".

Two excellent references on the subject are:

      IEEE Spectrum Vol 16 #11 Nov 1979  and  Vol 21 #4  Apr 1984

Both issues cover TMI extensively, especially the first.  They are eminently
readable to anyone with a technical background; I believe the first issue won
a number of awards for its coverage.

Finally, a brief anecdote.  On March 28, 1979, I was in St. Louis for an
interview with Union Electric Co. for a possible position at their
then-under-construction nuclear facility at Callaway, Missouri.  The
interview went fine, but when I came out of their office in the afternoon and
turned on the car radio, I began to hear news bulletins about a place in
Pennsylvania called "Three Mile Island".   I figured it was a sign. :-)

&gt;  [Concerning SINGLE-FAULT-TOLERANT SYSTEMS, I noted recently that most
&gt;  of the nuclear power plants are designed to remain safe as long as only
&gt;  a single pipe ruptures.  Two pipes are too many.  Earthquakes could make
&gt;  things quite difficult.  PGN]

First, I'd like to point out that I am not an expert in nuclear energy or
nuclear power.  I am not entirely familiar with the workings of the insides
of nuclear power plants.  Even if I were, the fact that there is no
standardization among these plants makes quantitative statements difficult.

Judging from "The President's Commission on The Accident at Three Mile
Island", there are three methods of cooling the reactor:

1: Main feedwater pumps.
2: Auxiliary feedwater pumps.
3: High-pressure injection pumps.

Unfortunately among this foot-thick stack of reports I cannot find a blasted
diagram of the reactor cooling system.  I presume these systems operate on
separate lines.  But for all I know they could feed into a common line
(besides the reactor vessel itself).  Breaks in the upper half of the
cooling system are covered however.  Parts of the contingency plans indicate
that it is possible to pump water that comes out of a break back into the
reactor via sump pumps.  Therefore, from what I can gather, two
double-guillotine breaks that occur in the lower leg of the reactor cooling
system may be fatal, but two double-guillotine breaks, where one occurs in
the lower leg might not be fatal.  Note: from the definition of
double-guillotine breaks, isn't this four pipe breaks in 2 pipes?

Ref: double-guillotine break: a pipe break where a section of pipe is
completely removed from the line (needing 2 breaks) and the outgoing water
does not impede the flow of water coming out the other pipe.  I read this
somewhere in WASH-1400.

In reference to the above subject of Computer Crime, I have a book at home
that told of a case of a stolen program for estimating bids on the type of
work involved by two competing companies. The only reason the larger company
was convicted for the theft of the program from it's smaller competitor was
that they printed out a hard copy of the program. U.S. law at that time said
that what was contained in electronic memory, wasn't "real?" or something to
that effect. There certainly is a need for new or more comprehensive laws
due to new technology. I also understand banks are required to make hard
copies of their accounting programs determinations at appropriate places for
auditing purposes. Again what is in memory is not "real".

This is an old pet peeve/idea/complaint of mine that some recent postings
on passwords being broken have finally prompted me to set down on iron oxide:

Claim:  Any frequent computer user, including the most non-technical,
        can/should be able to remember a 10 to 15 character password
        consisting of a "random" sequence of digits.

To demonstrate this, consider the following 2 questions:
(A)     What's your office phone number?
(B)     What's your home phone number?
I suspect almost everyone can answer both questions correctly.  The
two together give 14 fairly patternless digits, or 8 if you don't
count exchanges.

Now compare the frequency with which you dial/speak/write your *own*
phone number with the frequency with which you type your password.
(This is why I only make my claim for any "frequent" user).  At least
around here, the number labels on office phones are often missing, so
the lack of visual feedback for passwords shouldn't be a problem.

Although Ted Lee's interpretation of "2-man control" does describe a form of
implicit separation of responsibility, I suspect that Dr. Ware was referring
to what has become rather common in NATO defense compusec procurements, the
explicit "2-man (or more) rule".  This a mechanism whereby two (or sometimes
more) mutually cooperating, authorized administrators are required to
perform some action that affects the state (particularly the security state)
of the system.

The cooperating, authorized administrators may also be required to belong to
separate operational groups, etc., depending upon how the system has been
screwed together.  All in all, it's not a bad idea and I'm still surprised
that the US compusec community has not yet picked up on it.

The following incident may seem familiar, but given the extreme dread and
terror that many people find in the IRS, it could be quite serious:

My father-in-law is retired (and has been for a few years), but ocasionally
works.  My mother-in-law is still working.  When she filled out their
tax returns this year, she filled in the amount of social security payments
received in the calendar year (as required), which was the maximum of
$10,400 (I think).  However, in transcribing the rough copy of the tax
return to the final copy, she made a mistake and copied the vertical
line between dollars and cents as a 1.  Thus she filled in 104001.

About a month later they received a letter from the IRS stating that
recomputation of their taxes showed that they owed another $4,500! Needless
to say, they were quite upset until they realized what had happened.  After
it was pointed out, the IRS eventually cleared things up.  It would seem
that the simplest sort of sanity check in the figures would have eliminated
such behavior.  The amount of social security benefits for a tax return with
two dependents can't be anywhere in the neighborhood of $104,001.  I wonder
if there any sanity checks at all in the code?

I spent a year working at Large Manufacturer of Space Craft. One of my
duties was system manager of a large Gould Supermini-computer system.
This was a dual processor ECL based system with 16 Megabytes of memory
and about 2 Gigabytes of disk, plus lots of I/O controllers.  One of the
last things I did before leaving was start the paper work to get the
system certified for classified operation.

Two years later..  I am talking to my former boss there and he says that
the computer had been very unreliable lately.  I am surprised as it was
*extremely* reliable during the time I was there and ask what happened.
It seems when the system went classified, they put locks on the doors --
which precluded normal security patrol checks.  They also put the only
audible temperature alarm in the room with the computer.  One Friday
night, the A/C went out.  Monday morning (according to the report I got)
the machine's cabinet was too hot to touch.  This is not hard to believe
as an 18 board ECL CPU puts out LOTS of heat, and this is a dual CPU
system.  Anyway ever since that incident, the machine has been flaky.

Gee, I wonder why? I'm amazed that it works at all.      -Burch Seymour-

This article is in regards to Leff's article in <A HREF="/Risks/5.17.html">RISKS-5.17</A>.
  &gt;If nuclear power plants were removed and replaced with coal burning plants,
  &gt;more people would die from the radiation released into the atmosphere by the
  &gt;burning coal.  This ignores the death toll from coal mine accidents and air
  &gt;pollution.  In short nuclear power plants are about as risk free as one can
  &gt;get in this society and our energies are much better off being devoted to
  &gt;automobile accidents, cigarrette smoking and alcohol addiction.

I've often heard these statistics and believe in their validity, as a
statistic.  However, what is not talked about is the potential death per
accident.  If a car crashes there is a reasonable chance somebody can survive
(seat belts, luck), but that probably someone will die.  In an airliner crash,
your chances of surviving are nearly nonexistent, with the body count surely
in the hundreds.  Although the chances of an accident in a nuclear plant are
small, the potential body count is astronomical.

After Chernobyl, I heard an engineer say the odds of a nuclear accident was
once in 10,000 years, but that the accumulated operating time of all reactors 
world wide was over 10,000 years! Does this mean we should expect a major
accident about once every 30 or 40 years?  Yes, nuclear plants are the safest 
overall, and offer better long term energy resources (look at France), but
the chances of surviving the accident and potential body count of an
accident must also be factored into the safety equation.  I don't think you
can say nuclear power is safer than say coal power when you compare the
number of coal related deaths (mining, processing, burning) versus the
potential death from a nuclear power station accident.  It does mean we must
be much more careful with this fire than we have with other fires we've
harnessed before, but we should not walk away from it.  That would be a
greater burden for future generations then we have the right to inflict.

    Amos Shapir is quite correct.  AT&amp;T credit card numbers consist of your
10 digit telephone number, followed by 4 random digits.  Indeed, this is the
basis for one of their "features" - the ability to "phone home".  One can
dial one's own phone number, and when prompted to key in the credit card
number (by an otherwise unidentified "bong"), simply type the last four
digits.  The call will be accepted and your wife/husband says "Hi!".

    This risk Amos mentions, involved in someone knowing your name, is
obviously that, given the AT&amp;T card numbers, all but the last four digits
can be derived by "letting your fingers do the walking".

    As to the Internation Number, at least in the AT&amp;T case it's just a two
character prefix to your phone number and a one digit suffix.  Hi tech, right?
                                                                      _
    Incidentally, US Sprint does it much better.  I just received my FONCARD
(pronounced with a long O, e.g.  PhoneCard) from them.  The card number is
14 digits, none of which relate to my phone number, account number, or even
area code.  In addition, the card is bright silver, highly reflective, and
the imprint is *not* in a contrasting color - it's the same silver.  I have
trouble reading it from 12 inches away, and I doubt it's possible to read
over someone's shoulder.

Jonathan Thornburg's comment ignores the point that people do not normally
expect to change their telephone frequently, and that when the number does
change, it takes quite a while to memorise it again.

&gt; (A)     What's your office phone number?
&gt; (B)     What's your home phone number?
&gt; I suspect almost everyone can answer both questions correctly.  The
&gt; two together give 14 fairly patternless digits, ...

But I have only one phone and one office, and neither number has
changed for years.  I have accounts on about ten computers, with a
different password on each.  Passwords sometimes change as often as
monthly.  However, the only ones I write down are those that I cannot
set myself.

It isn't difficult to think of passwords that is easy to remember but
hard to guess.  Run two words together, or use the initials of some
phrase, or misspell some word or name.  Of course you should never
have the same password on two machines.

Another password risk is terminal programs which offer to remember your
password for you.  These should come with strong warning messages.

A monkey slipped out of its cage aboard a China Airlines cargo plane [before
landing] at Kennedy Airport, forced the crew from the cockpit, and played
with the controls before it was nabbed.  ``He wasn't making any demands --
he wasn't trying to take the plane back home,'' said John Schneider, an
animal control officer from the Port Authority who netted the 15-pound
macaque monkey after a 90-minute game of hide-and-seek through the 747 jet.
(The monkey had crawled out of the cargo area and into the flight deck.)

Re the IRS ADP procedures.  Several years ago I participated with a
committee that reviewed the IRS long range planning for ADP upgrades.  So
the group got to know something about general procedures, although not
intimate software details.

In these comments, I'm only offering perspective.  I am neither defending
nor criticizing what the IRS or other record-keeping organizations do.

The IRS obviously runs an enormous financial operation.  The accounts
receivable is huge so that there is a high motivation to get tax payments
processed and into the bank.  Similarly the IRS is obligated under law to
pay interest on delayed rebates, so there is a corresponding motivation to
process tax returns rapidly.  Both motivations are really in the citizen's
best interest.

The first thing that happens to any personal tax return (at the regional
processing center -- Fresno for California and the western states) is data
entry directly from the submitted form and as written.  The data entry
clerks have no authority to change anything.  The system then runs out the
numbers according to the rules that go along with the tax forms and tax
law.  All the system does is check arithmetic, and probably verify the
presence of required parameters (e.g., SSNs).

If it finds any variance, the computer generates an appropriate letter
which is then mailed, sofar as I know without human review.  A lot of
people have been the subject of a completely automated action -- including
a computer generated letter -- from detection of a problem to mailing of a
letter.

At some point (I don't recall exactly when), all tax records are mag-taped
to West Virginia to the IRS national processing center where they get
additional checking, verification, examination, extraction of statistical
data, etc.  It's from this 2nd stage process that returns are selected for
audit, and that produces the statistical parameters which go into the
famous "computer evaluation" for audit selection.

The IRS motivation is to collect taxes accurately, according to law, and
in timely fashion.  While I don't know this from first hand evidence, I
can imagine that there is little management motivation to include
reasonableness checks on the taxpayer-submitted numbers and forms.  Among
other things, it could be a legal misstep to guess what the taxpayer
intended to write, as opposed to what was actually written; and one can
readily conceive circumstances under which the IRS -- or many other
recordkeeping organizations -- could get into hot water by second guessing
what a person intended to do on some form or in some transaction.

So, we're not likely to see many computer-based reasonableness checks in
record-keeping systems, especially finanical ones.  The error-correction
feedback loop will continue to be external and through the individual
concerned, as it has been for a long time with paper-based systems.  Such
a decision is partly legally based, partly because there is generally
little basis for guessing what was intended, and partly because the
operational costs will always act to minimize the amount of software that
must execute to process each transaction.

While any computer-wise person can imagine all sorts of checks to improve
the lot of individuals who have to deal with a records system, I'm afraid
that managers of record-keeping activities are just not going to be
motivated to implement subscriber-courteous safeguards.

PGN - your parenthetical comment about "There is no Sanity Clause" goes
for many record-keeping organizations, not just Federal institutions.

Subject:  IRS Income
To: Risks@csl.sri.com

I am under the impression that the IRS is not supposed to release
information they receive to other agencies.  Hence, if someone says that
there are receiving $104001 from SS, the IRS is apt to accept that,
believing, perhaps, that these people are fraudently obtaining multiple
checks to which they are not legally entitled, but report such income so as
not to be in violation of the law under income-tax evasion sections.  I am
reminded of the story of the pest exterminator who put "Hired killer" under
the occupation block.

Re telephone cards, SPRINT, et al.  Originally the GTE/SPRINT access code
for making calls was just 7-digits for local calls, plus 2 additional
ones when out of area.  After getting the SPRINT switch via the local
access number, the procedure was to dial the access code and then the
desired number.  The same thing was continued when it became US/SPRINT.

Penetrators of the SPRINT system have long been a problem, and all sorts of
ways have been suggested for acquiring the access code.  Among them was just
plain automated PC-based exhaustive trials searching for a good one.  At one
time, my SPRINT business account got over 300 unauthorized calls in one month,
ALL from Joliet, Illinois -- the location of a well-known prison.  Given
that I had always been extremely cautious about using the memorized number
at a public phone, I never did find out how it got so popular in Illinois.

Recently, as noted in RISKS, the access code has become 14-digits but
there has also been a procedural change.  After getting the SPRINT switch
through the local access number, now the desired number is dialed first;
after a couple of beeps from the switch, the access code is then dialed.
It's a slight nuisance sometimes if one is using a phone that has the
buttons in the handset; he better get the receiver back to his ear fast or
the acknowledging beep-beep from the switch can be unheard.

One wonders why the inversion of parameters; here is a possible explanation
based solely on my conjecture, not on any first hand knowledge.

Given that penetrators will continue to be a problem, one would like to have
some data to help track them down or to have system characteristics that
will deter them.  Clearly the 14-digit number makes guessing much more
tedious and possibly slow enough to turn away trouble makers.  In addition,
if someone is trying to guess numbers, perhaps already knowing part of a
legitimate one, the system now knows what number is being sought when the bad
access code is given.  As telephone companies have done for years, the called 
party can then be contacted and asked who might be trying to make a call.

But the technique is at the same time so easily spoofed by calling any
number, or some public number (like an office building), or always calling
a different number each time while guessing at access codes.  It's a minor
software extension to make the penetrator's PC generate a number to be
called in addition to generating a trial access code.  Of course the
generated called number might not be a valid one which could mean that a
guessed access code would erroneously be discarded, but one can imagine
ways around such a small problem.

Perhaps there is no security connotation to the new SPRINT procedure;
perhaps it really stems from some software convenience, or some billing
requirement.  Perhaps, also, the system designers bet on a security
safeguard that has little to offer.  Perhaps the state-of-art for (what is
really) computer security in the telephone business is not as well advanced
as it is in mainframe world.

Jon Jacky (&gt;&gt;):
&gt;&gt;... the term
&gt;&gt;"artificial intelligence" was originated in the 1950's by John McCarthy,
&gt;&gt;generally regarded as one of the most important computer scientists (he
&gt;&gt;invented LISP, among other things).  The story goes that he created the term
&gt;&gt;in a grant application in order to kindle funders' interest in topics like
&gt;&gt;symbolic logic with otherwise seemed rather esoteric and impractical.

That's not the way John McCarthy tells the story.  He indeed wanted to
create &lt;intelligent machines&gt;.

The term "machine intelligence" was in use for a while at the University
of Edinburgh, which at one time had both a department of Machine Intelligence
and a department of Artificial Inlligence.

The earliest popularization I can recall was entitled "Giant Brains, or
Machines That Think", written by One Of Us. (Edmund C. Berkeley, if I recall
correctly).

Unthoughtful scientists and engineers have often in the last 70 years been
carried away in explaining the delights of their subject to others.  This
is a risk in any enterprise and we needn't be surprised at its occurrence
in fields of computing.  Like any other risk, we indeed ought to avoid
overly extravagant claims.

New York Telephone's Poughkeepsie-area central offices experienced a
backfired attempt to upgrade the software for the (non-IBM) computers on 18
July 1987 in order to improve service for 50,000 customers in the area.  The
result was that for 21 hours only about one call in three got through for 8
exchanges, according to a NYT spokesman.  Between 12,000 and 14,000
customers were reportedly affected.  The problems were eventually solved,
but the spokesman said the actual cause was still not known.  [Source:
Poughkeepsie Journal, 19 July 1987]

The article was contributed via US Mail by Ronald S. Rosen of Poughkeepsie, 
who noted that despite the public explanation of only one in three calls
making it through, there were some customers (Ron among them) who could not
make ANY CALLS AT ALL.  (Statistics are fine unless it is YOU to whom they

&gt; Among other things, it could be a legal misstep to guess what the
&gt; taxpayer intended to write, as opposed to what was actually written ...

It seems to me that second-guessing isn't the real RISKS issue here, but
rather what should the program do if the reasonableness check returns the
answer "unreasonable!"?

For the IRS case, with some hundred million returns per year to process, the
simple answer of "kick it out for human review" could easily generate work
for several million human reviewers.  Where can you find that many reviewers
all of whom are motivated to get to the bottom of the problem?  One way to
find an interested reviewer is to send the problem to the person who filed
the return originally.  Thus the IRS strategy of generating a completely
automated kickout letter to the original filer is probably both more cost-
and procedurally-effective than any alternative one could think of.

Admittedly, it is a little unnerving to receive an automated response from
the IRS asking you to send them an extra $10,000,000.17 because the computer
didn't realize that was a typo on line 11, but once you get over the initial
shock, all you have to do (in principle) is follow the instructions for
filing an amended return and the problem goes away.  (Horror stories about
IRS agents following up with inappropriate actions don't alter the
appropriateness of this strategy; they instead illustrate a misfeature in a
different part of the system.)

The item in <A HREF="/Risks/5.21.html">RISKS-5.21</A> on the macacque-eyed 747 takeover was unfortunately
less than precise, possibly leaving the impression that the monkey
comandeered the plane in flight.  The monkey was at large in the cabin
toward the end of the flight.  After landing the pilot and copilot remained
in the cockpit until the animal control officer thought he had the monkey
cornered at the rear of the plane.  After the pilot and copilot left, the
monkey then entered the cockpit and was captured while sitting on the
instrument panel between the pilot and copilot seats.  [RISKS item: did the
monkey alter any of the control settings?  Presumably the next take-off
checkout would have spotted it...]

Once upon a time, we had computers carefully confined in their own

was safe for humankind.

Now, I look around me: a Commodore Pet, an Apple II+, an Amiga 1000,

ceiling on two sides are shelves of 5.25" disks, 3.5" disks, back

for the various systems, computer science textbooks, the collected

At our site, we have several computers.  For security reasons, we are
asked to have different passwords on each machine.  In addition, these
machines (may - I'm not sure) keep logs of incorrect userid/password
combinations that are entered.

Now, being a fallible human, I occasionally type the id/password for
machine A while trying to log on to machine B.

It would not occur to me (in advance) that the log of incorrect
combinations should be safeguarded, but imagine if that log fell into
malicious hands.  The attacker would have a list of excellent
possibilities to try out on other machines at the site!

And, to make matters worse, while he was randomly trying combinations
from the log, he would be duplicating a "normal" pattern of errors,
thus being less likely to raise an alarm.

A friend of mine tried to withdraw money from a Versateller (Bank of
America; she's a BofA customer).  After asking her to re-enter her PIN
several times, it told her to give up.  She knew the number was the right
one (she uses it several times each week) so the next day she went to see a
human employee of the bank.  This person tried to tell her that she had
probably forgotten or misentered her PIN, but had to back down when several
people behind her in line said that they had the same problem.

My first thought was that the problem was with the cards, not the PINs.
Although some automatic tellers (such as the one I normally use) imply that
the card is readable (by welcoming you by name before asking for your PIN),
apparently Versatellers do not.  Still, I would expect them to complain
about an unreadable card before asking for the PIN.

I doubt the problem was with a specific ATM; my friend was using the
one in Palo Alto, but she lives in San Francisco and presumably most of
the other affected customers did not use the Palo Alto machine.

I'm also assuming that the PIN is verified with the central system, not
locally by the ATM, since there was some delay before the ATM complained
about her PIN, during which time it let her specify the transaction she wanted.

Sounds like the BofA system had spontaneously forgotten (or garbled?) a bunch 
of PINs.  This leads to some interesting speculations: does their system
lose other information (balances, for example)?  Has it been compromised?
Is there a "disgruntled employee" at work?  Do banks often forget PINs?

         SDI Software is Feasible, AFCEA Report Concludes

In a 200-page report to be released in Mid-August, The Armed Forces
Communications and Electronics Association will conclude that
development of the needed hardware and software for the Strategic
Defense Initiative is difficult but attainable.

The study, begun in April 1986 for the Defense Department's Strategic 
Defense Initiative Organization, was carried out by a committee of 
civilian scientists from industry and research institutes.  Five panels 
were set up, to examine processors, software, networks, communications, 
and man/machine interfaces, all under the heading of battle management 
systems and command, control, communications and intelligence systems.

Although the report has yet to be released, its conclusions have been
aired in public by study participants.  Describing the hardware
requirements as "more firmly in hand than the software," the report says
that building the system's architecture around hardware will mitigate
software problems.

Stuart J. Yuill of RJO Enterprise Inc., Lantham, MD, chairman of the
networks panel, said he was impressed by the high quality of the study
teams.  He also noted that conclusions of the study reflected the
"nearly unanimous" view of the experts.

The task of developing the software needed for the SDI has been
described as impossible by some observers, who say that a perfect
defense shield is infeasible, partly because it is untestable.  The
AFCEA report instead suggests that developing effective software will be
possible, even though the requirements are complex.  Thus the system
software needs the most attention, it says.

  [This is not particularly computer relevant (and you may omit it if relevance
  is in with you today) -- except that the conclusion is worth noting.  But,
  please don't respond to the items that are less than relevant.  Yes, it's my
  fault -- I could have omitted Mark Day's precursor as well -- except that
  it had a useful comment on a STILL EARLIER message...  Iterated Mumble.  PGN]

&gt; Car wrecks and cigarette smoking kill more people than nuclear plants, sure,
&gt; but the way that they kill people is very different.  Car accidents
&gt; generally don't affect a zone of several miles' diameter, forcing evacuation
&gt; and abandonment of homes...   [Mark Day, <A HREF="/Risks/5.18.html">RISKS-5.18</A>]

There is also the question of voluntary vs involuntary risks.  However, the
comparisons here are basically apples-vs-oranges.  A much fairer comparison
is to other risks that are involuntary, affect a zone of several miles'
diameter, force evacuation and abandonment, etc.  There are such, and they
get far less attention than nuclear risks.  One is driven to conclude that
the perceived seriousness of risks has much more to do with the amount of
publicity than with the magnitude of the problem.

Some examples:

- There is apparently at least one place in the US where a dam failure would
	probably kill a quarter of a million people.  The probability of dam
	failure is known to be nonzero, and they are much less carefully
	guarded against terrorist attack than nuclear plants.  Do you know
	whether there is one upstream of you?

- The Bhopal disaster probably (I don't have numbers handy) killed more
	people than all nuclear accidents to date, Chernobyl included.  There
	was noise about it at the time, but it's largely forgotten now.  Do
	you know whether there is a plant handling such chemicals within,
	say, ten kilometers of you?  Do you care?

- The largest peacetime evacuation in history had nothing to do with nuclear
	reactors.  Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated from the
	center of Mississauga (which is essentially a suburb of Toronto) when
	tank cars loaded with chlorine derailed a few years ago.  How many
	rail lines are there within ten kilometers of you?  Do the railroads
	using them observe any restrictions on what cargos they carry on
	those lines?  How frequent are derailments on those lines?  (Usually
	the answers are "several", "no", and "much more common than you
	think".)

People who raise the issue of nuclear wastes should look into the arsenic
content of stack-scrubber sludge from coal-burning plants.  That stuff is
produced in far greater quantities than nuclear wastes, for comparable
power outputs, and arsenic has *no* halflife -- it is dangerous *forever*.
Here we have another comparable, arguably rather worse, risk that is largely
ignored in all the uproar about nuclear power.  Why?  Less publicity.

ABACUS: THE MAGAZINE FOR THE COMPUTER PROFESSIONAL
Vol. 4, no. 4, Summer 1987, pp. 7-25
"Computer (In)security: Infiltrating Open Systems"
Ian H. Witten (Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary)

ABSTRACT: Beware the worm, the virus, and the Trojan Horse.  Despite
advances in authentication and encryption methods, computer systems are
just as vulnerable as ever.

MINI-REVIEW: This article is chock-full of the sort of information that
RISKS contributions keep saying can't be overemphasized. It is written at a
level that can be understood by almost anyone who ever had to log into a
computer system, and possibly by a congressman or corporate vice-president.
Witten stresses that trust is transitive: If I trust you as a source
(especially for software), I have thereby placed trust in everyone you trusted.

SELECTED QUOTATIONS:

Shared computer systems today are astonishingly insecure. And users, on
the whole, are blithely unaware of the weaknesses of the systems in which
they place--or misplace--their trust. Taken literally, of course, to
"trust" a computer system as such is meaningless, for machines are neither
trustworthy nor untrustworthy; these are human qualities. In trusting a
system one is effectively trusting all those who create and alter it--in
other words, all who have access (whether licit or illicit). Security is a
fundamentally HUMAN issue. ...

It is comforting, but highly misleading, to imagine that technical means
of enforcing security have guaranteed that the systems we use are safe. ...

Many systems suffer a wide range of simple insecurities. These are,
in the main, exacerbated in open systems where information and programs
are shared among users--just the features that characterize pleasant and
productive working environments. ...

Throughout this article the word BUG is meant to bring to mind a concealed
snooping device as in espionage, or a microorganism-carrying disease as in
biology, not an inadvertent programming error. ...

Not only should you avoid executing their programs; take the utmost care
in ANY interaction with untrustworthy people--even in reading their
electronic mail. ...

The simplest kind of Trojan horse turns a common program like a text
editor into a security threat by implanting code in it that secretly reads
or alters files in an unauthorized way. An editor normally has access to
all the user's files (otherwise they couldn't be altered). In other words,
the program runs with the user's own privileges. A Trojan horse in it can
do anything the user could do, including reading, writing, or deleting
files. ...

One good way of getting bugged code installed in the system is to write a
popular utility command. ...

The thought of a compiler planting Trojan horses into the object code it
produces raises the specter of bugs being inserted into a large number of
programs, not just one. ...

The trick is to write a bug--a "virus"-- that spreads itself like an
infection from program to program. The most devastating infections are
those that do not affect their carriers--at least not immediately--but
allow them to continue to live normally and in ignorance of their disease,
innocently infecting others while going about their daily business. ...

The neat thing about this, from the point of view of whoever plants the
bug, is that the infection can pass from programs written by one user to
those written by another, gradually permeating the whole system. Once it
has gained a foothold it can clean up the incriminating evidence that
points to the originator, and continue to spread. Recall that whenever you
execute a program written by another, you place yourself in that person's
hands. For all you know, the program you use may harbor a Trojan horse,
designed to do something bad to you (like activating a cookie monster).
Let us suppose that, being aware of this, you are careful not to execute
programs belonging to other users unless they were written by your closest
and most trusted friends. Even though you hear of wonderful programs
created by those outside your trusted circle, programs that could be very
useful to you and save a great deal of time, you are strong-minded and
deny yourself their use. But maybe your friends are not so circumspect.
Perhaps Mary Friend has invoked a hacker's bugged program, and unknowingly
caught the disease. Some of her own programs are infected. Fortunately,
they may not be the ones you happen to use. But day by day, as your friend
works, the infection spreads throughout all her programs. And then you use
one of them. ...

If you use other people's programs, infection could reach you via a floppy
disk. ...

The smaller and more primitive the system, the safer it is. For absolute
security, don't use a computer at all--stick to paper and pencil! ...

The only effective defenses against infiltration are old-fashioned ones.
...

Finally, talented programmers reign supreme. The real power resides in
their hands. If they can create programs that everyone wants to use, if
their personal libraries of utilities are so comprehensive that others
put them on their search paths, if they are selected to maintain critical
software--to the extent that their talents are sought by others, they have
absolute and devastating power over the system and all it contains.
Cultivate a supportive, trusting atmosphere to ensure they are never
tempted to wield it.

From: Joe Morris (jcmorris@mitre.arpa) &lt;jcmorris@mitre.arpa&gt;
Organization: The MITRE Corp., Washington, D.C.

The District of Columbia, still smarting from its handling of the snow last
winter, has discovered what happens when it sends out an erroneous tax bill
to someone who can make life uncomfortable: it sent a bill for ten cents to
David Brinkley (yes, THAT David Brinkley) along with a sternly worded
warning that if he did not pay, he would be fined $2,137 in penalties and
interest.  Brinkley reported on this in a brief commentary on his nationally
televised ABC news program last Sunday.  There was a follow-up in this
morning's Washington Post, from which the following is lifted:

   The whole thing was a mistake, said D.C. Department of Finance and
   Revenue spokeswoman Brendolyn McCarty, a "mathematical audit error."
   Ordinarily, she said, [taxpayers] would not have been billed for 
   amounts of less than $2.  But someone forgot to tell the government 
   computer that.
   [...]
   Brinkley paid the 10 cents even though he maintained he owed the
   District government nothing.  District officials acknowledge that 
   his bill had been paid last year, but no one knows where the extra
   dime cropped up and  officials cannot account for why the letter
   threatened him with $2,137 in penalties and interest.

   "They will wind up blaming it on the computer," Brinkley said when
   told of the District government's response.  "I knew that.  But a
   computer only puts out whatever you put in it."

Perhaps the most astounding thing to come out of this is that we apparently
have at least one respected national news commentator who is aware that GIGO 
means "garbage in, garbage out", as opposed to most of the Fourth Estate, who 
believe that it means "garbage in, gospel out".  The story itself, of course, 
is unusual only in its victim's ability to strike back quickly.

  &gt; Describing the [SDI] hardware requirements as "more firmly in hand 
  &gt; than the software," the report says that building the system's
  &gt; architecture around hardware will mitigate software problems.

If this is an accurate summary of the report's conclusion, it's rather
odd.  The Eastport Study Group report to the Director of SDIO
(December 1985) came to the exact opposite conclusion.  Again, there
was the assertion that the task of building SDI was "difficult but
possible."  However, there was also a strong critique of the usual
procurement process of acquiring hardware first and treating software
as an afterthought.

    ... contractors treated the battle management computing resources
  and software as a part of the system that could be easily and 
  hastily added.  The contractors treated battle management as 
  something that is expected to represent less than five percent of
  the total cost of the system, and therefore could not significantly
  affect the system architecture.  They have developed their proposed
  systems around the sensors and weapons and have paid only "lip 
  service" to the structure of the software that must control and
  coordinate the entire system. (p. 9)

  The panel cautions, however, that the feasibility of the battle 
  management software and the ability to test, simulate, and modify 
  the system are very sensitive to the choice of system architecture.
  (p. 10)

It's plausible that the newspaper got it wrong and that the new report
also says that designing the system around the SOFTWARE would make the
software problem easier.  Otherwise, it seems like a very strange claim.

This article follows up on previous comp.risks items relating to the Muni
Metro and BART railway systems in San Francisco.

Today I was amused to read in The Times an article describing a ride that the
Queen took on the new London Docklands Light Railway.  This railway features
driverless trains.  The article describes an incident whereby overriding the
control computer to "speed the royal passage" resulted in a delay occasioned by
the doors not opening at the station because the train was improperly docked.

I was considerably less amused to read, as an aside in the same article, about
an incident in which one of these automatic trains "crashed the terminus
buffers and ended up dangling in midair".  As I recall, the train was on the
verge of leaving the end of some kind of bridge.

Although the Queen officially opened the LDLR yesterday passenger services
would be delayed for a few weeks since (according to London Transport) "test
running has not yet reached the high level of reliability needed".

I would like to express two personal opinions: firstly I am dismayed that
despite the long history of railway travel each new implementor of automation
still makes the same mistakes as the predecessors. Secondly I fail to see how
people who propose automatic control of nuclear power stations and ATC can
presume to do this when the conceptually far simpler problem of the control
of trains on a closed railway network has not yet been solved after years of
trying.

I came across this the other day:

		FAIRFAX'S 911 BACK ON TRACK
		Shutdown Attributed To `Bug in Software'

		Patricia Davis
		The Washington Post, August 1, 1987

  Fairfax County officials said yesterday that their new and occasionally
  dysfunctional 911 emergency communications center was operating properly,
  with calls being answered in less than a second.

  Mike Fischel, director of the Public Safety Communications Center, said that
  American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. workers had discovered and repaired a
  problem in the telephone system that a week earlier caused it to shut down
  for 30 minutes.

  Because of a ``bug in the software,'' Fischel said, employes where able to
  receive calls at the communications center July 24 but could not hear the
  caller.  Because of a backup system, however, there were no delays in
  providing emergency service, he said.

  Although there have been ``persistent problems'' with the telephone system,
  including telephone sets overheating and some background noise, the
  computer-aided dispatch system has performed well since it became the
  primary system July 23, Fischel said.

  The new system cost $12 million and is calld CAD, for Computer Aided
  Dispatch.  It is housed in the police department's Pine Ridge facility in
  central Fairfax and somewhat resembles Mission Control at the Johnson Space
  Center in Houston.  Red numbers flashed on a wall show how long calls go
  unanswered.
	[ .... ]
  The new system displays the phone number and the address, then verifies
  the information, assigns a priority to the call and relays the information
  to the appropriate dispatcher --- police, fire or ambulance.

  During the month-long transition to CAD, there were complaints of delays
  both in answering 911 calls and rerouting them to the proper dispatcher.
  Officials said those problems were because of the complexity of the system
  and the fact that employes were initially doing double duty by monitoring
  the old system to check the performance of the new one.
	[ .... ]
				* * *

Hence it would appear that the new system failed but service continued
due to the operators keeping both old and new systems on-line during a
breakin period.

It would be interesting to find out a few more specifics concerning the
nature of this ``bug.''  Does anyone out there have more clues to
contribute?  Also, once the glitch has been localized, it would then be
interesting to learn ``who's responsible'' should the faulty system have
resulted in some tragedy.

A query from Dave Mack wondered thoughtfully why on earth the monkey tale
made it into RISKS.  One reason is that I wanted to illustrate the point
that developers of technologically based systems must anticipate all sorts
of events that to the ordinary mortal would seem preposterous.  Having a
monkey loose in the cockpit is just one example of an event that few if any
people had ever thought of before.  I might have added something about
monkeys typing randomly and sooner or later typing Shakespeare.  The
probability that a monkey might do something eventful to the plane controls
is of course nonzero.  Macaques are particularly inquisitive and playful.

I used to think that bank card PINs were stored on the cards themselves, but
an experience I had some months ago convinced me that (at least in my case)
they aren't.

When I got my bank card from my bank in Little Rock, they didn't send me the
usual notification of my new PIN.  I assumed I could use the one I had
requested on the application form, but it didn't work.  I went in to my
branch and they called up the central office -- they had assigned me a
different PIN, but had never told me about it.  The teller read off my card
number to the person on the phone and they told her my number, which she
wrote on the back of a deposit slip and gave to me.

Things were fine for a couple of months until one day an ATM rejected my card
with an "incorrect PIN" message.  I went back to the bank, where they went
through the same procedure of calling the central branch.  I found out they
had changed my number back to the one I had originally requested!

I was very surprised at this -- I thought they had to give you a new card to
change your PIN, or at least re-encode the magnetic stripe.  Guess I was
wrong...

The folklore has always been that computers, especially in the form of robots,
would one day render blue collar workers obsolete.  BIX [Byte Information
Exchange] recently reported that automated assembly has not significantly
reduced labor and assembly costs (and, presumably, jobs).  Instead, inventory
costs have been cut because planners can more accurately predict how long it
will take to produce an item.  Items can be produced "just in time" instead of
maintained in inventory.  In addition, resources devoted to assembly are only
about 5 to 10 percent, but inventory tends to absorb 10 to 20 percent.  The
speculation now is that managers are more likely to be displaced than workers,
since it is the managers who tend to be responsible for inventory management
and accounting.

The BIX report [microbytes/items #1421] was based on the work of Randall
Davis, a professor at the MIT Alfred P. Sloan School of Management and the MIT
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.  Apparently Microbytes Daily interviewed
Davis.

&gt; People who raise the issue of nuclear wastes should look into the arsenic
&gt; content of stack-scrubber sludge from coal-burning plants.  That stuff is
&gt; produced in far greater quantities than nuclear wastes, for comparable
&gt; power outputs, and arsenic has *no* half-life -- it is dangerous *forever*.
&gt; Here we have another comparable, arguably rather worse, risk that is largely
&gt; ignored in all the uproar about nuclear power.  Why?  Less publicity.
&gt; Henry Spencer 

I'm getting really sick of people defending nuclear power plants by talking
about how dangerous coal power plants are.  These are not the only
alternatives, as we all should know by now.  

As has been well established in the energy debates of the last 15 years,
the best alternative to nuclear power is conservation.  Please excuse me if
I don't feel moved to dig the relevant factoids out of my library to back
up this statement, as it should be obviously true.  (You could, however,
start with Lovin's classic SOFT ENERGY PATHS).
                                                       -- TomA

   [OK, gang.  Adequate discussion of the risks of technology in general may
   be impossible within the scope and resources of RISKS.  Worse yet, there
   are deep belief systems involved, and some of the arguments are more 
   religious than rational.  I have had mail on both sides -- "Why do you keep
   running anti-nuclear power messages?", and "Why do you keep running
   pro-nuclear power messages?"  I am just trying to keep RISKS objective, 
   although very few people lack committed viewpoints in any argument -- the
   rational middle-ground viewpoints do not seem to be popular in our society.
   (Moderation in the defense of moderation is no virtue?)  One goal of
   RISKS is to encourage open discourse on topics relating to risks in
   computer-related technology.  One perfectly good strategy in a particular
   area may be to eschew the use of computers in a particular application,
   or to avoid the application altogether.  Such arguments may seem
   nontechnological, but they can be quite technologically based.  PGN]

I just got this out of the info-atari16 mail group.
It illustrates one of the more unusual risks I've seen :-)

  Date: 22 Jul 87 03:54:28 GMT
  From: mtune!akgua!rbk@RUTGERS.EDU  (R. Brad Kummer)
  Subject: ST keyboard parts needed
  To: info-atari16@score.stanford.edu

  Does anyone have a damaged ST keyboard that they could send me a piece of?
  I need one of the little rubber "nipples" that sits under each key.  If you
  remove all those tiny screws from the back of the keyboard, there is a
  little rubber cup with a small piece of carbon attached underneath each key.

  Why do I need it?  Don't ask...  My kids spilled a Coke on the keyboard, I
  took the keyboard apart to clean it (that part worked fine), but I dropped
  one of the little "nipples" on the floor and the [...] dog ate it!

  If you could help me out, I'd be eternally grateful.  (Would you consider
  trading it for a dog? :-)

  Thanks, R. Brad Kummer, AT&amp;T Bell Labs, Atlanta, GA {ihnp4, akgua}!akguc!rbk

Those not in the Unix community may not be aware of the excellent security
paper that was published in the Bell Labs Technical Journal a few years ago.
Some parts of it are Unix-specific, but much of it is fairly generic.  The
most interesting parts are discussions of how supposed enhancements in
security actually make things *worse*; the paper is clearly the result of
practical experience, not just theoretical navel-contemplation.  For example,
the problem of logs of incorrect login/password combinations being a source
of useful information is worse than it seems:  even just logs of login names
alone can be informative, because people do accidentally type passwords in
response to the login-name prompt now and then.  For another example, aging
schemes that try to enforce frequent password changes have bad side effects:
"...the most incredibly silly passwords tend to be found on systems equipped
with password aging...".

The paper is "UNIX Operating System Security", by F.T. Grampp and R.H. Morris,
AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories Technical Journal, Vol. 63, No. 8, Oct. 1984, pages
1649-1672.  Any good engineering library will probably have the B.L.T.J.
(formerly the Bell System T.J.), since it is/was one of the top technical
journals of the communications industry.  This particular issue, the second
special issue on Unix, can also be ordered from AT&amp;T, although I don't have
ordering details handy.

Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology {allegra,ihnp4,decvax,pyramid}!utzoo!henry

    [While you are in that issue, you might just keep on reading.  The paper
    following Grampp and Morris' is also worth looking at:  "File Security
    and the UNIX Crypt Command", J.A. Reeds and P.J. Weinberger, pages
    1673-83: "crypt" was not very secure.  PGN]

From Risks 5.23:  (Factory automation and risks to jobs -- James Coombs)
    The BIX report {on the effect of robots} was based on the work of Randall
    Davis, a professor at the MIT Alfred P. Sloan School of Management and the
    MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.  Apparently Microbytes Daily 
    interviewed Davis.

"Apparently" is the key word here.

First of all, the information about robots and their potential impact on human
employment is the work of Warren Seering (prof of mechanical engineering at
MIT and a member of the AI Lab).  An accessible (and quite entertaining)
reference is his article in "Technology Review", April 1985 (pp 58-67); the
impact and cost figures are on pp. 66-67.

All of which I would have been happy to tell BIX, had they asked.  They didn't.

One of the RISKs of giving talks in public is having magazines quote as if
from an interview (I don't recall an interview with BIX; I do use those
figures as one slide in a 3-day long course).  This curious procedure is
apparently routine; it has in any case happened to me previously.  The
practice is at best disingenuous, suggesting that they have conducted a
careful interview and summarized it, rather than picked a few entertaining
sentences out of several hours of lecture.

It also quite often results in misinformation, as in this case.  When you have
an hour to explain a subject you do it one way; when faced with a reporter who
is going to reduce everything to single sentence pithy quotes, you proceed
quite differently (and quite a bit more carefully).

  &gt; Stephen Colwill &lt;mcvax!praxis!steve@seismo.CSS.GOV&gt;:
  &gt; Secondly I fail to see how people who propose automatic control of
  &gt; nuclear power stations and ATC can presume to do this when the
  &gt; conceptually far simpler problem of the control of trains on a closed
  &gt; railway network has not yet been solved after years of trying.

I'm not sure I agree that controlling trains (actually operating them,
as opposed to telling a human engine driver where she is supposed to
go) is conceptually simpler than controlling a nuclear power station.
A nuclear plant has a lot of sensors and actuators, in well known
locations and required to be in well defined relationships to each other.

A train is a large object whose position is only approximately known at best,
whose speed is hard to change and is changed using systems whose performance 
is subject to wild fluctuations with age, maintenance, and track conditions,
and whose surroundings are totally unvisible to the controlling system.

I wouldn't argue that a power plant is easier to control or safer,
but I think I would rate them similarly far beyond the realm of things I
feel comfortable about yielding to fully automatic control.

Other fora ("forums" for those under forty) are perhaps suitable for
expressions of political position regarding the mix of electrical
generation methods, including conservation.  We must recognize that
substantial computer related RISK is attached to nuclear reactor
generated electrical power, and that little computer related RISK
is attached to other generation methods or to conservation.  I am
disappointed that so little commentary occurs in RISKS regarding
computers as realtime control devices of nuclear power plants.

My interest in seeing more such commentary should not be taken as a
political position regarding the appropriate mixture of electrical
generation methods.  We might indeed all learn something about
mishap and accident prevention methods by learning more about what
is done in the nuclear power industry.

It seems perfectly consistent for a professional in computer related
areas to on the one hand be interested in learning more about computer
RISKS in nuclear power plants and on the other hand to take any
position whatsoever regarding the desirability of such.

I remind RISKS readers of the issues of AAAS Science, and the articles on 
risks and risk perception therein, which I cited on RISKS a few months ago.

In conclusion, I hope we might continue to see in RISKS contributions
regarding computer risks in the nuclear power industry, without thereby
attributing to either our Dear Moderator or to the Contributor any particular 
stance on the desirability of nuclear generated electrical power.  I would 
prefer the politics to appear elsewhere.

My credit union uses a PIN system that is designed in such a way that no one
is supposed to be able to obtain the PIN once it has been sent to you.  The
PIN is generated "randomly" and pre-sealed envelopes are produced with the
PIN printed on the inside via carbon paper, and a serial number is printed
on the outside of the envelope.  When the PIN envelope is sent to a card
holder, the serial number of the envelope is entered into the computer and
the serial number is cross-referenced to the PIN which is then stored in
that card's record.  If you forget your PIN number, a new envelope with a
new PIN is sent to you, because no one can access the actual PIN, only the
computer knows what it is.

Of course, that is the theory, but I'm sure that someone somewhere can
get to them given enough time.

  [MILNET TAC access cards are generated the same way from a dedicated non-
  net-accessible system managed by the Network Information Center at SRI.  PGN]

In RISKS 5.22:  mogul@decwrl.DEC.COM (Jeffrey Mogul) says:
&gt; A friend of mine tried to withdraw money from a Versateller (Bank of
&gt; America; she's a BofA customer).  After asking her to re-enter her PIN
&gt; several times, it told her to give up...

This happened to me when I needed cash for the weekend (on a Saturday morning).
From talking to the "ATM expert" at the credit union, I found out that the ATM
asks you three times to re-enter your PIN, then determines that you should
not be allowed any further transactions for the rest of the day.  In my case
it had a blank line where my name normally is when it first says "hello".

The solution, according to the ATM expert is to immediately hit cancel when
the machine asks for your PIN a second time, clean the magnetic strip on the
card, and try again.  This method has worked since then.  I don't understand
why the ATM can't figure out that something is wrong when it reads the card.
Don't they use checksums?

Assuming an ATM will work properly when you need it leads to the
risk of being without any cash over a 3-day weekend.  Now I only
use them to avoid a long line inside during business hours.

Seattle Times, Wed. 8/5/87 (used without permission):

	We knew it would happen eventually.  Computers do this, computers do
that.  Now, we're told, computers *assume*.  M.G., a Bellevue consumer,
learned this when he tried to phone home from the Red Lion Inn at Portland's
Lloyd Center.  He phoned several times and no one answered, but he was
charged for making long-distance calls.  When he inquired about the charges,
he was told the hotel computer ``assumed'' he had made a connection and
talked with someone at the number he dialed.  When M.G. explained to a live
desk clerk at the hotel that no one had answered his phone calls, the
charges were removed from his bill.  M.G. suspects that many travelers pay
such phone charges without realizing they've paid to hear a brrr-ring, not
to speak with a real person.

	Is this practice sanctioned by the Washington state Utilities and
Transportation Commision?  M.G. asked.  Hotel and motel phone systems are
private telecommunications systems, and are specifically exempt from
regulation by state law, according to Susan E. Sumner, public-information
officer for the commision.  Sumner checked with Red Lion headquarters and
was told the hotel's computer equipment cannot determine whether a call that
has been placed actually has been answered.  ``Consequently, in the first 45
seconds after a call has been placed, the computer `assumes' the call has
been answered,'' Sumner said.

	The hotel's policy is to adjust the bills of guests who have been
charged for calls that were not completed.  Red Lion's management has
indicated that printed notices will be placed by phones in rooms so guests
will know how they are being charged for these calls.  It would be wise for
consumers to ask about this policy when checking into any hotel.  Some
hotels and motels charge an access fee even when consumers use their own
credit cards to make long-distance calls.

This excerpt (slightly edited) is from Dagbladet, Oslo, Norway,
Friday August 7. 1987:

COMPUTER ERROR OPENED ALTA (power station) FLOOD GATES.  While all
(Norwegian) electrical power supply directors were on visit at the very
controversial and newly opened Alta Power Station (in Finnmark, northern
Norway), the catastrophy happened. While trying to correct a computer error,
two of the flood gates of the Alta Dam accidentally opened.

A three-meter high flood wave ran down the narrow river canyon at a speed of
approx. 20 km/h.  A full police rescue alarm was called, local radios gave
warnings to campers etc., a helicopter was sent out to locate possible
victims of the flood.  The river rose about 1 meter during the twenty minutes
that went by before the the dam engineers were able to close the gates
manually. 2 million cubic meters (50 M cubic feet ?) of water was lost.

As far as the local police knows, no one was hurt, but 5-10 small
river boats were crushed.  The power station expects some claims 
for compensation.  [The Alta river is well known for its salmon]

The Alta Power Station has been operative since May this year.  "The paradox
is that this very autumn we were going to install a valve that will prohibit
the accidental opening of the flood gates", the dam administration says.

The Alta Dam and Power Station was much in the news a few years ago. It lies
in the Norwegian part of Lappland. Long and very violent demonstrations by
Lapps and others (including some very prominent Norwegians) nearly stopped
the contruction work.

     Regarding Burch Seymour's note in 5.20 about a CPU overheating: a
certain charitable recently purchased computer equipment to assist with
their operations. Bad planning contributed largely to the fact that it has
not been of any help to them. One of the concerns that they failed to
address was the physical placement of the machines with respect to heat.
 
     A "Baby 36", a PC, terminals and printers for both and a printer for
the new phone system were all put into an eight-by-ten-foot room. As the
contractor hired to perform the initial installation of software, and
training for the staff, I pointed out that this was less than desirable.
However, it was not until, in an attempt to make the room habitable, I
turned the thermostat off that I found out that it controlled not merely
that room, but the entire back half of the building.
 
     With the assistance of the materials manager (after failing to convince
the executive director to make changes in room assignments) I completely
blocked the heating duct into the computer room, and made a direct fan vent
to the outside. In spite of this, through one of the coldest winters we've
ever had in Vancouver the temperature *never* fell below seventy-two degrees
farenheit (most often it hovered in the eighties) and the clerical staff
froze their fingers off.
 
     (After three months of complaints of heatstroke and frostbite [one
typist took to wearing gloves all day!] the computer was moved ... to an
area with insufficient power supply!)

Instead of being critical of the bug and the 30 minutes of downtime

  &gt;... it would then be interesting to learn 'who's responsible' should
  &gt;the faulty system have resulted in some tragedy.

we should find it refreshing to see that someone has learned the lesson of
keeping the old system on line while the new one is tested *IN THE REAL
WORLD*.  So many times people disconnect the old system and depend entirely
on a new, incompletely tested system.

Mark Day's comments re the Eastport report bring to mind a related issue, which
has some relevance to Risks:  how management responds to reports of problems.  
I highly recommend "Illusions of Choice", by Robert F. Coulam, published (I
think) by Princeton U. Press, dated late 70s (I can dig out accurate info if
needed; my copy isn't handy).  The ostensible subject of the book is the
development and procurement of the infamous F-111 fighter- bomber, but it is
also a fascinating look at bureaucratic management and the mistakes it makes.

The title of the book comes from the persistent belief of the senior DoD
people that they could decide the project's fate at various milestones
during development, when in fact the project was merrily proceeding on its
pre-ordained path without waiting for permission to do so.  This was not
because the people in question lacked authority:  the F-111 had so much
trouble that the Secretary of Defense was personally involved.

The part of the book that specifically came to mind was Coulam's comments
on the F-111's engine problems:  DoD repeatedly took it for granted that
the engine problems would be solved, simply because the contract with the
engine manufacturer said so.  The engine problems *were* eventually pretty
much solved, but only at the cost of significant changes to air intakes and
so forth.  Those changes were incorporated only in later F-111's, because
the early ones were too far down the production line by then:  aircraft
production had happily continued, in sublime confidence that the engine
problems would go away!

This sounds a whole lot like the contractor attitudes that the Eastport
group criticized.  I would conjecture that the software development was
going to be done by someone other than the prime contractor for the
hardware.  Of course the software would work on the hardware as supplied;
the software contracts would insist on that!

Just as a point of fact, the COMPUSEC community has picked up on this.  Any
VAX/VMS system since V4.0 (I believe, V4.3 definitly) has the capability to
enforce 2 passwords on a given account.  This allows the system
administrator to set up privileged accounts (or semi-privileged accounts, or
just regular accounts) with 2 passwords, one user for each of these
passwords.  The capability to activate the account would require both users
to be present to login.  Once logged in, the user can do what he wishes
(exactly analogous to the safe deposit box situation in a bank).  Even the
system administrator's account can be set up this way.

Of course, one does not have to necessarily use two people, just one
person who knows both passwords would get you in also (I guess this is
appropriate for especially paranoid people).

Summary of "Optical Disks Raising Old Legal Issue", in Digital News, 3 Aug 1987

When microfilm came out, Congress passed the Uniform Paperwork Act which
covers "microfilm, microfiche, photocopies and some electronically
transmitted paperowrk, such as facsimiles."  There is a book out called the
"Legality of Optical Storage" which was prepared with the assistance of a law
firm.  No specific state or federal laws cover the technology as yet.  Robert 
S. Williams, president of Cohasset Associates in Chicago, a record management 
consulting form, says that the existing laws will suffice.  New Jersey has a
bill pending in the legislature to specifically cover optical storage.  It
is geared to the state government's needs rather than private industry.

The IRS has already introduced a trial program in which optical disk juke
box storage is used by personnel to answer questions from customers or in
preparation for audit.  However, the IRS still keeps the original forms
although both the IRS legal counsel and Department of Justice says that the
optically stored originals are as good as the originals in court.  The
National Archives has given IRS the permission to destroy the originals, but
the IRS is still storing the originals.

The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is holding its Second Annual Colloquium on Science, Arms Control, and National 
Security September 28-29 at the Hyatt Regency Crystal City, jut outside 
of Washington DC.  The reason Risks Forum readers should be interested 
is that this Colloquium represents one of the few occasions when policy-makers meet scientists to share concerns; both sides speak frankly.
For example, at last year's Colloquium, Kenneth Edelman, Director of the 
US Agency for Arms Control and Disarmament, said that nuclear weapons 
were safer now than at any other time in history. The Colloquium 
provided the opportunity to ask him what made him believe that. Last 
year Gen. Abrahamson, Director of SDIO, made clear that the first step 
in SDI was to protect military targets, not civilian populations. He 
also provided a list of technologies that needed to be developed in 
order for SDI to succeed. High among those was battle management 
software. He said that computing power alone can tip the strategic 
balance between the super-powers.

Speakers at this year's Colloquium will include Robert Dean, Special
Assistant to the President and Senior Director for International Programs
and Technology Affairs; Lewis Branscomb, Director of the Science,
Technology, and Public Policy Program at Harvard, and formerly the Chief
Scientist of IBM; Robert Cliff Duncan, Director of DARPA; John Deutch,
Provost of MIT; Paul Nitzer, Special Advisor to the President and Secretary
of State for Arms Control Matters; Jonathan Dean, Arms Control Advisor,
Union of Concerned Scientists; Amoretta Hoeber, Director for Planning and
Development, TRW; Lt. Gen. John Wall, Commander, US Army Strategic Defense
Command; Charles Zraket, President, Mitre; and Sidney Graybeal, VP of
Systems Planning Corp.  Registration is $160 (incl. meals) for the two days.
For further information, call AAAS at (202) 326-6490.

A recent item in RISKS called attention to Ian Witten's article in the
summer 1987 issue of ABACUS.  I found the article fascinating reading and
filled with insight.  It is crammed with detail on the weakness of systems
to password attacks, Trojan horse attacks, and virus attacks, and it even
elucidates the lacunae of Ken Thompson's Turing Lecture on invisible,
self-replicating compiler viruses.

I would like to invite a discussion in RISKS on the question of publishing
graphic detail on security weaknesses of systems.  As Editor-in-Chief of the
ACM Communications, I am sometimes faced with conflicting reviews on such
materials -- some reviewers will say it is inappropriate to publish such
lucid detail when there is no good defense against the attacks, some will
say that this type of information is capable of inspiring a lot of mischief
and making life unpleasant for numerous innocent people, while others will
say that these things need to be discussed so that people of good will will
know what they're up against.  It would be helpful to me and other editors
to have a better idea of where the community stands on this sort of thing.
Should we encourage publication of this kind of material?  Discourage it?
Publish general overviews of attacks and weaknesses but not give enough
detail to permit others to replicate the attacks?  Should there be an ACM
policy on this question?  If so, what might that policy be?

Many thanks to all.   Peter Denning

    [This topic has arisen regularly in RISKS.  The last time we took a
    crack at it we still seemed to believe that vulnerability lists were
    somewhat sensitive, but the pretense that nobody knew what they might
    contain was likely to get you into much greater trouble than if you
    assumed that the vulnerabilities were widely known and likely to be
    exploited.  If a system is fundamentally flawed, it should not be used
    in critical applications where those flaws could result in serious
    compromise.  Publishing the security weaknesses can only improve things
    in the long run -- although it may lead to some frantic moments in the
    short run.  The real problem is the tendency to put all of one's eggs in
    a single ostrich basket -- and then stick your head in the sand.  Passwords
    are a fine example.  If there is ONLY ONE PROTECTION WALL, then anyone who
    penetrates it has everything.  The obvious strategy is to use multiple
    controls -- with passwords (or perhaps better authenticators) as a first 
    line of defense, sound oerating systems and applications as a second, and 
    careful auditing in real-time or after-the-fact as the last resort...  PGN]

I want to point out a hazard in electronic mail systems that can easily
be overlooked until one gets caught by it.

The risks normally discussed include: the mail gets seen by unauthorized
readers; is lost; is sent but the archive copy is later lost; the ID or
contents are changed; or the recent and humorous example of "archive saved
after all" when it wasn't wanted, in Reagan's NSA using PROFS.

The additional hazard I want to point out is: the problem of yourself
inadvertently sending a note or a copy to the wrong person(s).

I have used various forms of e-mail at several universities over a 13 year
period, and perhaps the most embarrassing incidents in such use have been
when I mis-sent notes.

Typical sensitive contents are things relating to criticism, of employees or
peers or managers. Or possibly semi-secrets, usually related to early
discussions of hirings, firings, reorganizations, office moves, management
shifts. All of these matters can be written about to specific individuals,
where the mis-sending of the note can be very hurtful; in some cases if
mis-sent to specific persons, in other cases if mis-sent to almost anyone.

Here's a brief list of ways such mis-sending can occur:

1. similar names or nicknames or userid's.

2. absentmindedness, along with interruptions; returning from a telephone
interruption and sending a note to the proper recipients of the previous
topic or the next topic.

3. the manual or automatic inclusion of others on a cc list for something to
which you are replying.

4. mistakes or misunderstandings or similar names/nicknames/userids in
group or system nickname files.

5. Actual failure of an electronic mail system (I have found this rarer than
the above risks, though when I was developing some of my own tools once,
I had this type of failure; the form of it was to mail the current note
to the recipients of the last note I sent).

Electronic mail is riskier in this regard than manual mail, for several
reasons, including:

Brief, cryptic, and/or indirectly indexed names for addressees; unusually fast 
and simple actions to prepare and send the notes, which avoid the normal
delays with real mail (but those delays added extra chances for review by
oneself and others, or chances to intercept and cancel); plus the normal
risks of new or unfamiliar systems and the risks of computerized systems.

One defense is a broad defense against the dangers of many new systems:
use the new facility for the least critical matters in the early stages
of either the system's development or your learning of the system.

Doug Mosher, MVS/Tandem Systems Manager  (415)642-5823, 
Evans 257, Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA 94720

    [Ironically, one solution here is related to a solution to Peter
    Denning's query: assume that everything might as well be public
    anyway (since the privacy and integrity in most mail systems and the
    networks they use are minimal anyway) -- and don't use a computer system
    to say anything that you would not say publically.

    There are also some "features" of mail systems under which the current
    pointer does not get moved as you might think it would.  You can easily
    wind up answering the wrong message.  The solution there is always to
    review a message -- including its recipients' addresses -- before you 
    commit to sending it off.  PGN]

Well, in addition to the risks to the innocent public from the use and
misuse of computers, I now see that we computer users suffer because of
the ignorance of those who apparently do not use computers or, at least,
those who use them mindlessly.  US Sprint has just dumped two different
kinds of cards on me, neither of which works with my software.

I have Sprint's local basic service, but the quality is not good enough
for telecommunications.  Their "dial a local number and input a code"
connection has always been better than AT&amp;T or anything else that I have
had locally.  Now, however, they have numbers that are too long for
ProComm.  In addition, they have reversed the sequence, so that one now
inputs the telephone number before the travel code.  That means that
none of the popular communications software will work properly with
Sprint's new system.  Finally, to demonstrate their complete ignorance
of the needs of telecommunicators, they ask us to "listen for the
recording" before inputing the "14 digit FONCARD number."  It will
probably take the ProComm authors a little while to come out with a
speech recognition module!

This change is going to cost Sprint a lot of revenue in the next few
months.  It's also going to cost many of us a lot of aggravation.  The
software developers will have to rework their programs and negotiate
with Sprint (or we will find different carriers).  And, at least in the
meantime, there will probably be a lot of people hacking together
interim solutions.  How could Sprint be so naive?
                                                      --Jim

P.S.  If they are trying to solve problems with illegal access, they
are on the wrong track.  The thieves will revise their programs very
quickly; the legitimate customers will be the ones who are locked out.

Much has been said about the risks of trusting computers too much.  It can
also be a problem to trust them too little.  This was a problem at Three
Mile Island, where the human operators turned off a cooling system that the
automation had turned on.

Good user interfaces can help.  It should be clear to a human supervising
an automated system *why* it's doing whatever it's doing.  Observers on 
the presidential convention which investigated TMI said nasty things
about the design of the plant's control panel.

By the way, anyone interested in the political aspects of nuclear power should
check out Peter Beckman's book, "The Health Hazards of Not Going Nuclear".

I've had a problem with my PIN on an autoteller before.  In this case it
was clear that the problem lay in the PIN keypad.  Some keys wouldn't
register, others bounced.  After several attempts at typing very
carefully, the machine kept my card. 

Customer Service had noticed an unusual number of cards taken over the
weekend, but were dubious of my explanation until several people in the
customer service line behind me made the same complaint.  They had me
talk to the service people, because I was able to explain the problem in
technical terms ("keys", "bounce"). 

It's possible the BofA problem was also a simple mechanical failure, but
bank staff tend to treat the machines with reverence not accorded ordinary
household appliances.  They don't expect them to get stuck and break.

        [Several other ATM submissions are not included here.  This one is 
        borderline, illustrating again the deification of technology.  PGN]

From: Jerome H. Saltzer &lt;Saltzer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU&gt;

The desirability of public discussion of computer security flaws comes up
frequently in RISKS as well as in every mailing list and forum I've seen
that touches on security.  My opinion is very strongly in favor of openness
and public discussion of computer security problems, right down to the
details of how to break in to specific operating system releases.

The background for my strong opinion is that I've been working with computer
security, protection, and privacy since 1961.  In that time I've seen both
secrecy and openness used at different times, and it is clear (to me) that
whatever arguments seem to apply at the time, in practice openness works and
secrecy doesn't.  Whenever someone succeeds in arguing that a security problem
shouldn't be noised about, the result is usually several of the following:

     1.  Fixing of the specific problem drops in priority, sometimes
     to the point that it doesn't get fixed at all, leaving the
     system vulnerable to attack for an extended time.

     2.  Others with similar systems often don't learn about the
     problem, leaving their systems vulnerable.

     3.  Others with dissimilar systems almost never hear about the
     problem and therefore don't realize that they should look for
     analogous problems in their systems.

     4.  People developing new systems design the same problem into
     their new system.

In contrast, when rapid public discussion takes place following
discovery of a security problem, the original system gets fixed very
quickly (sometimes it is temporarily operated in a drastically
curtailed mode while waiting for the fix); other users of similar
systems start evaluating their vulnerability, the community
immediately starts to look for analogs of the problem, and as a
general rule the state of the art steps forward a notch and that
class of problem has a somewhat lower chance of reappearing in future
system designs.  (That is not to say that all system designers bother
to look around for lessons they might apply to their systems!)

My conclusion is:  the argument that one enhances security by not
talking about weaknesses is fallacious.  In practice, trying to hide
security problems reduces security, certainly in the long run,
usually in the medium run, and often even in the short run.

When the proprietor of a site or an operating system vendor makes a
potent case for not revealing a security weakness, my usual proposal
in response is that any veiling of a weakness should have a time
limit, after which it will be discussed publicly.  That approach
focuses the argument on the right question, namely what is a
reasonable time limit; it keeps the pressure up to fix the problem,
and it tends to move in the direction of getting the information out
to those people in the world who really need it.  Most important, it
recognizes that the information will eventually circulate among
system attackers, so it must be gotten to system designers, too.

To say more strongly what Grampp and Morris wrote in 1984: the bad
guys know this stuff already, or will discover it soon; the good guys
need all the help they can get.
					Jerry

   [As an example, we have the note from BJORNDKG in <A HREF="/Risks/5.24.html">RISKS-5.24</A> that
   "If you forget your PIN number, a new envelope with a new PIN is sent 
   to you, because no one can access the actual PIN, only the computer 
   knows what it is."  But anyone who reads RISKS should realize how untrue
   this conclusion is, even if the PIN is stored encrypted!  PGN]

&gt; Should we encourage publication of this kind of material?  Discourage it?
&gt; Publish general overviews of attacks and weaknesses but not give enough
&gt; detail to permit others to replicate the attacks? 

I am not convinced that you can publish overviews that do not provide
any thoughtful person with enough insight to fairly easily complete
the details of the attack.  I believe that it is the initial
identification of a flaw that is difficult, not the exploitation of it.

&gt;    [... If a system is fundamentally flawed, it should not be used
&gt;    in critical applications where those flaws could result in serious
&gt;    compromise...  PGN]

While this argument appears logical from the academic view, it has
some interesting ramifications in real life.  Since the introduction
of digital computers, the federal government has been one of the
biggest users.  Their usefulness has led to all sorts of sensitive
information being stored and manipulated in an amazing variety of
different machines.  I believe it is fair to state that these machines
were not designed with security as a major consideration.  I suspect
that removing all sensitive information from  critical applications
would cripple the government.  Also, there is no way to replace all
those systems with secure systems in the near future.  Even if we only
buy secure systems for new applications, it will be several decades
before the fundamentally flawed systems are gone.

&gt;    [...  Publishing the security weaknesses can only improve things
&gt;    in the long run -- although it may lead to some frantic moments in the
&gt;    short run...  PGN]

Unless those frantic moments include the USSR concluding from compromised
information that they are able to successfully attack the US.  In that case,
I claim that regardless of the outcome of the attack, publishing the
security weakness did not improve things in any sense.  -- Doug

Just a clarifying comment on Howard Israel's observation about VMX/VMS.
It may be that the tekkies have provided for the option of twin passwords
but government policy statements and administative directives have not
directed that such safeguard procedures be used.  Until system
implementers and system owners/operators are compelled to install
split-duty provisions, the best intentions of the technical designers will
only have provided a necessary, but not sufficient condition for improving
security.  We will have happenstance usage of double passwords depending
on the conscience of system managers and their perception of threat.

And in some sense, as Howard Israel points out, the safeguard as now
implemented isn't all that great since one person, knowing both, can type
them in sequentially -- which makes it no better than a single password
and certainly more trying to one's memory.  A stronger procedure would
require concurrent entry (within a prescribed time limit) and from
different, physically well-separated terminals.  Even that can be
circumvented as Richard Pryor once demonstrated in some movie.

The importance of such intricate safeguards of course depends markedly on
what the threat is believed to be, which implies that double passwords
will probably be used primarily in defense systems and occasionally in
commercial systems, e.g., perhaps where public safety or intense
industrial competition might be involved.

A recent news items noted the flooding of a NASA control room during a
simulated Space Shuttle flight.  A longer piece on NPR stated that pipes in
the ceiling of the control room had burst, and that the control room crew
had quickly put covers over their equipment.  NASA personnel considered it
"routine" to have equipment covers handy for just such an occasion.  While
it is easy to second-guess the installers, the NASA computer folks should be
complimented for having their covers ready.  This is a simple, non-technical
precaution.  I'm surprised that it has not already been discussed in Risks.

    [It has, but way back in RISKS-1 or -2.  By the way, there was a CDC 
    computer in a basement that got flooded by the automatic sprinklers,
    shortly after I arrived at SRI.  By the by-the-way, I heard a story
    today about a corporate building power failure that was accompanied by
    a fire; it turns out that the obligatory "EXIT" sign came on in the
    dark with a short in its circuitry, and the emergency light caught fire.
    (The bearer of this news wanted to keep his company's good name out of
    RISKS, so this is appears here anonymously.)  PGN]

[Can't cite my sources - I was lazy, hoping someone else would enter a
comment about this one, and I have forgotten the exact details, such as
which center, what date, etc.  - Mike]

Subject: Computer Error Opened Flood Gates of Alta Dam 

Dept. of amusing juxtapositions:  in 5.24 we have Dave Benson saying
"We must recognize that... little computer related RISK is attached to
other generation methods or to conservation...", while in 5.25 we have:

&gt; COMPUTER ERROR OPENED ALTA (power station) FLOOD GATES...
&gt; ...three-meter high flood wave... full police rescue alarm...
&gt; warnings to campers etc...

Persons interested in risks of power generation, in a broad sense, might also
wish to read Tom Clancy's "Red Storm Rising".  The first few chapters are a
graphic account of how centralized computer control of oil refineries permits 
one-man sabotage on a staggering scale.  (The rest of the book, which is also
quite good but less relevant, is about the Third World War that results when 
such a single act of sabotage severely disrupts Soviet oil production.  This
is a risk on a scale that dwarfs most of the RISKS discussions!)

I would also observe that one aspect of energy conservation is efficient,
often computerized, management of energy use in large buildings etc.
I don't recall hearing of any serious problems with such systems, but
surely there must have been some, especially early on?  Anybody know?

Installing the safety features a few months *after* the system becomes

if I am not mistaken, 'incompetence'. (In Russian it's Chernobyl, of course).

I just wanted to point out that the risk of sending messages to the wrong
recipients can apply to paper mail as well as electronic mail.  My father
claims to have once known a manager who forbade the use of paper clips in his
office.  It seems that he had once lost a job because a memo critical of
one of his superiors got snagged in the paper clip of another memo addressed
to the person he was criticizing!  :-)

   I am not convinced that you can publish overviews that do not provide
   any thoughtful person with enough insight to fairly easily complete
   the details of the attack.  I believe that it is the initial
   identification of a flaw that is difficult, not the exploitation of it.

That comment rings completely true.  I would argue the following implication: 
publication of any information about a problem should be accompanied with
full detail, so that the good guys have all the information they need to get
on top of it.  (Security lesson number one:  technology transfer to the good
guys is an order of magnitude harder than to the bad guys.)

Hardie continues to comment on a comment by our moderator. . .
    [... If a system is fundamentally flawed, it should not be used
    in critical applications where those flaws could result in serious
    compromise...  PGN]

   I suspect that removing all sensitive information from critical
   applications would cripple the government.  Also, there is no way to
   replace all those systems with secure systems in the near future.
   Even if we only buy secure systems for new applications, it will be
   several decades before the fundamentally flawed systems are gone.

I think that both of these positions are a little too polar, and thus are
dancing around the real-world problem.  There are situations when it may be
a reasonable risk to leave sensitive information in a flawed system, for
example when you are fairly sure that your opponent doesn't yet realize the
information is there and probably won't trip over it immediately, or when
you are fairly sure that the other side hasn't yet learned of the security
flaw.  But since knowledge of such things spreads, that kind of decision is
very time-sensitive--the risk increases every day.  So the decision must be
accompanied by a plan to shore things up, either by fixing the flaw, getting
the information moved to a safer place, or--a common solution--putting other
barriers around the flawed system.  Anyone who continues to run a flawed
system for years, much less decades, while trying to maintain secrecy about
its problems isn't taking a risk any more, he is inviting a disaster.
					Jerry

    [The placing of supposed barriers again is subject to the skepticism
    that Jerry has about the system itself...  The problem is recursively 
    unsolvable in any definitive sense, although the perceived risks are
    often only a shadow of the actual risks.  PGN]

a woman robbed of 8,750 pounds'.  Her Abbey National Building Society [do
you have building societies?  a sort-of bank with just deposit accounts and
mortgage accounts] cash card had been used to steal 250 pounds (the daily
limit) per day for 35 consecutive days from her account.  The RISKS interest
comes from the comment by Abbey National's head of security (i.e., not just a
spokesman):  "It is true that we tell counter staff at branches to make
enquiries if cheques are cashed on three consecutive days.  But to instruct
the computer to do this on ATMs would be far too time-consuming," he said.

	Elsewhere, Abbey National claims to process 5.7M transactions per
year; say 15K transactions per day average, perhaps 50K per day peak.  I'll
leave others to estimate the size of the computer needed to compare three or
four 50K-record files within a day, looking for repeated transactions on
individual accounts, and the amount of time needed to write the software.

	The moral is:  don't expect computers to perform all the routine,
boring tasks that they do so much better than people.

In <A HREF="/Risks/5.25.html">RISKS-5.25</A>, Henry Spencer asks about problems with the computerized
environmental/energy controls that are becoming popular in large office
buildings.  Several years ago (and with a former employer) I had the dubious
pleasure of seeing what happens when one of these systems is installed
without considering that the building tenants might not fit the 'standard'
mold.  The building, located on a university campus, housed four floors of
professors' offices, a lecture hall, and the computer center.  The new
environmental control system, which was run remotely from the Physical Plant
offices, was retrofitted to the building several years after it was
constructed, and was designed for use where the building was occupied during
the day and vacant at night.  Sure enough...the first night the $%^&amp;* thing
turned the air conditioning compressors off at about 19:00, causing all
sorts of panic in the computer room.  No damage resulted from this (except a
few gray hairs), but it highlights the sort of incompatibilities that can
result when too many assumptions are made about an environment.

From: lance@ubvax.UUCP (Lance Keigwin)
Organization: Ungermann-Bass Enterprises

Just after college I accepted a job with the Social Security Admin (SSA)
in a NYC district office.  I spent several years with SSA as a claims
representative, operations supervisor, and regional program specialist.
Fortunately I had the good sense to leave several years ago, when it
became very clear that federal service was not an alternative to anything.

In these jobs I dealt with all levels of the SS program.  Undoubtedly the
two biggest headaches for SSA (and the public claimants) were resolving
discrepancies in dates of birth and earnings records.  Screwups in
establishing age is another story, and far less controversial.  SSA's
record there is really pretty good, if the claims rep is not a dope.

But scrambled earnings records are almost impossible to fix.  This
usually happens when somehow an employer gets a hold of a wrong number,
usually from an employee (although the employer could pick it up from
almost anywhere...and they do!).  Of course there is cross-checking
against what SSA believes is the right name and number but all it takes
is some (#$%@$%) clerk to cross refer two numbers to the same person and
zap!  Suddenly you're record relects someone else's wages too.  Or worse:
your covered earnings are credited to some third party.  This happens all
the time because people forget their numbers, re-apply for a second one,
guess wrong, etc.  Safeguards exist but if you consider the scale here
(all those workers, all those employers, and the general interest of the
average gov't employee in doing the job right even if it means more work
and worsened processing statistics) there are bound to be major problems.

When does the error come to light to you, John Q. Public?  If at all,
almost always at retirement, some decades in the future; at a time when
many employer records are gone, if not the employer itself, and your
recollection is at best fuzzy.  Chances are probably 9 in 10 that you'll
never get credit for all the taxes you paid, if your record is messed up
obviously enough for a rep to notice it and to look into it.

My advice:

1) Never, NEVER give anyone a fake SSN.  It will haunt you later in life.
If SSA has to search for earnings under a different number (spotted on an
application for employment, a credit card report, school record, etc.) you
will suffer significant delays in getting your correct benefit at best.
More likely, you will never live to see the tax credit.

2) Always, ALWAYS request a statement of your earnings every three
years.  There are screwy statute of limitations regulations (3 years,
3 months and 15 days), about when an error can be corrected.  Also the
statement of earnings you get will only breakout the last several years
individually, and will total all prior years in one lump sum, so it it
good to do it periodically.

3) If you suspect an error, ask for a complete posting of each year
(a "certified earnings record").  If you're given a little card to
complete and told it will be mailed to you, don't buy it!  You can only
get a complete record by seeing a Service or Claims representative, who
must complete an SSA-450 for transmission to HQ in Baltimore.  Insist on
a photocopy of it when it arrives.  Be troublesome, if necessary.

4) If you do see an error, put your dispute in writing and if you must
mail it in, do so certified mail.  Establishing the date you first
suspected an error is important.  SSA has ways of "scouting" an employer's
records.  Ask to have it done.

5) Check your W-2 for the correct SSN.  Paystubs too, but especially
the W-2.  Report any error to your employer and IRS.

6) If you don't want to give your correct SSN to someone and feel you
must fake it, give them a number that starts with "9".  There is no
such thing as a real 900-series number so you are not risking screwing
up yours or someone else's account.  SSA will never accept it.

7) If you get an official decision that goes against you, protest if
you really believe you're being cheated.  There are several appellate
steps, and usually the official who decides is reasonably intelligent
and responsible.  Read the back of the notice about "reconsiderations",
"hearings", etc.  The reversal rate it very high.

As a matter of interest, two years after I started work for SSA I
requested a record of my earnings.  Sure enough, there was an error in
two quarters.  Want to guess who the employer was that messed up?
Yep, SSA.  It took them 3 years to fix it.  Good thing I had an "in". :-)

I also discovered that my retired father should have been getting benefits
for three of his student children (an SSA snafu).  I had us apply, and
asked for full retroactivity (over 8 years).  The claims examiner awarded
only 12 months of retroactivity.  I appealed.  We won.  Total family
benefits came to over $7000.  I used my $1500 to buy a washer and dryer.

The discussion of the NASA computer room which got flooded brings this to mind.

Here at Purdue, the University fire department (actually, I think it's the
Safety &amp; Security folks) doesn't like Halon systems.  Admittedly, there are 
risks to humans when using Halon systems, since Halon's function is to remove
the oxygen from the air.  (I have heard stories that some Halon manufacturer
placed people in a room full of Halon to prove it was "safe"--not sure I'd want
to try that one, although they apparently all survived with no ill effects.)

Anyway, we as computer folks like Halon.  Sprinklers tend to have rather
adverse effects on the hardware.  But, we can't install a Halon system in our
computer rooms.  We have to install a sprinkler system.  So.... we have Halon 
extinguishers and sprinklers.  We haven't had any leaks.  Yet.  Covers are a
neat idea; too bad we don't have any (a risk we probably shouldn't be taking).

The risk here is due to a lack of understanding on the part of people who
don't work with the hardware... they don't realize that their aversion to
Halon (which is easily countered by having the firefighters wear airmasks)
puts several million dollars worth of equipment, not to mention the probably
incalculable value of the data stored, at risk.

I would like to raise the issue in this forum of certification of software 
engineers. Certainly, someone who has built a model aircraft would not be 
considered (or consider themself) competent to design a commercial jet.  
Yet those who have written a few BASIC programs as a hobby often seem to 
have no such qualms about their education and abilities.  High school students 
tell me about their jobs building important software systems.  As a contrast,
engineers must usually satisfy minimal educational requirements, and 
engineering projects for critical systems often have a requirement for a 
professional engineer to be involved.  Although the ACARD report suggestions 
were regarded as extreme by many in the computer science field, they are not 
necessarily much more than is routinely expected in other related professions.

For example,  System Safety Engineering is a field that is about the same
age as computer science or perhaps even somewhat younger.  There are, however,
already certification programs.  And as an example of what can be done
for critical systems,  there is a MIL-STD-1574A (USAF): System Safety Program 
for Space and Missile Systems that mandates that Air Force space and
missile projects have a "Qualified System Safety Engineer" to manage the
system safety program and be "responsible for the effective implementation 
of the following tasks ... [too many to cite, but essentially the tasks 
necessary to implement a system safety program]" and who is "directly 
accountable to the program manager [i.e., the US Air Force program manager] 
for the conduct and effectiveness of all contracted safety effort for the 
entire program."

A Qualified System Safety Engineer is defined as someone who must meet the 
following requirements:
    "A technically competent individual who is educated at least to the
     bachelor of science level in engineering or related applied science
     and is registered as a professional engineer in one of the states
     or territories of the United States or has equivalent experience
     approved by the Purchasing Office.
        This individual shall have been assigned as a system safety
     engineer on a full-time basis for a minimum of four years in at
     least three of the six functional areas listed below:
             System Safety Management
             System Safety Analysis
             System Safety Design
             System Safety Research
             System Safety Operations
             Accident Investigation

I don't know of any similar requirements in government standards for managers
of software engineering programs on critical projects nor any similar 
assignment and acceptance of direct responsibility and accountability to 
the customer for the *effectiveness* of the software engineering effort.
Does anybody else?  Am I wrong in my observation that under-qualified people 
are sometimes doing critical jobs and making important decisions?  Do you 
agree that some type of certification is necessary?  If so,  there are 
still many open issues e.g.,  should there be minimum educational 
requirements and what kind, should there be minimum experience requirements, 
should there be examinations, should certification be in particular application 
areas (dp, scientific, safety-critical real-time, etc.) or perhaps in 
particular subareas (systems analysis, design and coding, QA, etc.), should 
there be continuing education requirements, should there be minimum 
requirements for those teaching software engineering and certification of
educational programs, ...

&gt; From: Jerome H. Saltzer &lt;Saltzer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU&gt;
&gt; So the decision must be accompanied by a plan to shore things up, either
&gt; by fixing the flaw, getting the information moved to a safer place, or--
&gt; a common solution--putting other barriers around the flawed system...

This is practical when you are dealing with a single system.  However, the
number of DEC VAXs (as an example) that handle sensitive information is too
large to identify.  There currently exists no way to even tell all the
administrators using any particular system that they have a problem.  While
additional barriers are probably not prohibitive for one system, when
multiplied by the number of systems in use throughout the government, I
expect that cost would be unbearable.

I just want to vote, very strongly, for disclosure of operating system
security flaws.  Non-publication of these flaws assumes that there is some
other system for distributing such information only to those of us in
industry responsible for design and implementation of reasonably secure
operating systems.  If there is such a system please let me in on it (after
a suitable security check, of course); if not, I'm confident our customers
would prefer the situation where 10 potential penetrators *and* I know
the information, to the situation where only 5 potential penetrators know it.

The question about open discussion of computer security flaws brings
up an interesting point that I have not seen mentioned, that is, that
the people who understand such flaws (often the people who try to find
them) are not as often as we might like the people who administer the
systems.  In many cases I have seen the systems managers are not 
prepared, either by interest, temperament, or background, to understand
the security problems and react properly to them.  (Not that this is
the case everywhere, but it is certainly the case in many situations.)

Such system managers are the types who tend to react to security holes
by trying to suppress any information about them - not by trying to
fix them.  They are also quite likely to respond inappropriately by 
imposing severe security measures in the wrong places - usually impeding
the real purpose of the machines, and rarely actually fixing the problems
(indeed, sometimes this "added security" makes the problem worse).  

The question of publicizing security holes is thus further complicated.  If
the problem is publicized, will it spur some people to take (often
inappropriate) measures that will inconvenience (or worse) the users of the
machine in a misguided attempt to patch the problem?

Without trying to continue the discussion on passwords, access codes, credit
card numbers, etc, I would like to relate a very interesting article about
eliminating the need for people to ever put their actual code in the open.
The article was about 'Zero Knowledge Proofs' and appeared in the Science 
Times section of the New York Times earlier this year.  

It appears that an Israeli scientist has developed an authorization system 
based on such proofs that allows a person to verify that they are the 
owner of an account, without having to give away the 'account number' or any
other information which allows them to be impersonated.  The basic idea is to
give the account owner a complex graph which is successfully colored so that
no two connected nodes use the same color.  It is easy to generate such a
graph, but given a complex graph, coloring it is not, in general, possible
to color it successfully.

A device checking authorization gets to see the graph, but the color of the
nodes is hidden.  The device picks two connected nodes at a time and is
shown that they are, indeed, colored differently.  After each pair has been
shown, the colors used in the graph are interchanged so that after many tries
the device can be quite sure that the graph is colored, but have no clue
as to a coloring scheme that works (which when combined with the graph,
represents the actual account number).

The article stated that such a scheme could be applied to passwords, and

    The folklore has always been that computers, especially in the form of    
    robots, would one day render blue collar workers obsolete...

It is true that automation has not rendered workers obsolete, or resulted in
huge cost savings.  As you note, the main impact of automation so far is
that it results in greater central *control* over the production process.
In fact, this was one of the principal motives for automation from the
start: management wanted greater control over labor.  (By "management" here
I mean high-level managers who are removed from day-to-day production.)

Even though the worst fears have not been realized yet, that is no reason to
be optimistic.  Although automation thus far has been rather awkwardly
implemented (requiring nearly as many workers as before), it has set the
stage (by routinizing work and thus deskilling workers) for a new phase in
automation that actually gets rid of the work force.  As David Noble said in
his (highly recommended) book Forces of Production, "Men behaving like
machines paved the way for machines without men."

    ...  The speculation now is that managers are more likely to be displaced
    than workers, since it is the managers who tend to be responsible for
    inventory management and accounting.

The "managers" to be replaced here are probably quite low-level supervisors.
But the idea that automation hurts management *in general* (while the
workers make out fine) would be a bit silly.  In the end, I believe that
automation will cause incredibly disruption and suffering unless there is
also a dramatic shortening of the work week.

Check out the Noble book -- Oxford University Press, 1984!

I have been confused from the beginning about what it is that the workers do
now.  I suppose that it could be little more than filling parts buckets for
machines or something like that, in which case their work would be even more
routine than before.  I had this hope, however, that they were servicing the
machines, in which case their work might be significantly more skilled and
interesting.  Can anyone give more details on this?

Also, I wonder what happens to the managers at various levels.  Does their
work become more interesting and rewarding, or less?  I'm sure that for
some, the "planners," work becomes less stressful.  What about the others?

&gt; "It is true that we tell counter staff at branches to make enquiries if

&gt; computer to do this on ATMs would be far too time-consuming," he said.

Well, while it's true that it shows great lack of insight not to do anything
about a known potential problem (especially when the withdrawals were at the
daily max, which should always be a flag for caution), it's less than clear
what they should do.  A human teller can ask for ID; most existing ATMs
can't.  If you just fail the transaction, you're going to make customers
unhappy (how often we object to restrictions intended to protect us).  It
would be a good idea for all ATMs to have cameras and for human intervention
to be triggered by any of a number of suspicious circumstances (I'd say max
withdrawals on two successive days was suspicious), but that's also going to
raise the cost of service...

the really small distributed machines) have wet covers.  This is because
most Centers were constructed before halon was put to wide use and so fire
protection is provided via "wet" protection.  The problem comes in upgrade.
Mission Control Centers are used practically all the time, making upgrades
tough.  I asked this question at a meeting today for RISKS.  It comes from
"very reliable sources."

    [Many messages on this subject... I have excerpted to reduce overlap.  PGN]

As I understand it, Halon's fire-killing ability comes from two
characteristics of the gas:

1) It excludes oxygen, when used in sufficiently large amounts.  This
   is one of the ways in which carbon dioxide kills flames (its cooling
   effect being the other), and thus any oxygen-exclusion risks from a
   Halon system would also probably exist in a CO2 system of similar
   gas-magnitude.

2) Halon interferes, chemically, with the combustion process.  I
   believe that it ties up the free (ionized) radicals in the flame,
   and blocks one or more of the partial-oxidation steps.  Because this
   is a chemical effect, and not a physical one such as oxygen
   exclusion, it can occur at relatively low concentrations of Halon in
   the atmosphere.

I saw a demo at NCC a couple of years ago, in which a Halon-system
manufacturer's sales-rep stood in a closed booth smoking a cigarette.
He then let loose a 1-second burst of Halon, and the cigarette went
out.  For the next several minutes, he stood in the booth, breathing
normally, and demonstrated that he was unable to relight his cigarette
(he stuck a Bic lighter outside the booth through an arm-sized hold,
flicked it alight, moved it gently back within the booth, and it went
out the moment it entered the Halon-charged atmosphere).

I've been told that the major risk to humans from being in an area that
has been Halonized isn't the Halon itself... instead, it's the risk of
inhaling the rather nasty partial-combustion products of the plastics,
other petrochemicals, and miscellaneous combustibles that were burning
when the Halon was released.  Because the combustion was interrupted,
these chemicals won't have been burned to completion (to water, carbon
dioxide, etc.);  they may include lots of carbon monoxide, hydrochloric
or other acids, and similar things that aren't conducive to long life
and respiratory health.

Please don't take this as gospel... and kids, don't try this at home.

Several years ago, at a previous employer, I designed fire control systems,
including many HALON systems. HALON does -not- extinguish the fire by
displacing the oxygen in the air. It interferes with the actual
combustion process. The amount of HALON required to disable combustion is
only around 3%-7%, which leaves plenty of oxygen for humans. (The following
is all from memory and may not be entirely accurate) There are some effects
to humans from prolonged ( &gt;1 hour ) exposure to HALON at this concentration.
I think that they are on the order of headaches, etc. and dissappear when 
exposure ceases. There were no long term effects known at that time.

The greatest danger in using HALON that I know of results from exposure
to the gas as it is discharged from the nozzles into the room. HALON systems
are designed to get the gas dispersed in the required concentration as
rapidly as possible. The high flow rate of the gas and the expansion at
the nozzle results in very low temperatures in the discharged gas.
I heard a story that a government agency required a full discharge test
of a HALON system in a computer room, and to shield some installed equipment,
someone held a sheet of plywood between one of the nozzles and the equipment.
He suffered severe frostbite on all eight fingers.

I used to be a volunteer fireman when Halon became popular, [...]

At one computer center I know, the fire extinguisher system consists of
CO2 jets below the artificial floor.  It has never gone off, but rumor has 
it that the jets will throw the floor tiles a small way, before flooding the
entire basement with CO2 in several minutes.  This DOES replace the oxygen,
and everyone who works there is told to RUN LIKE HELL if they hear the fire
alarms go off.

[...] Of course, Halon does have some risks.  Nothing's perfect.  The
immediate risk to people is that at very high temperatures, Halon is
chemically changed to phosgene, a strong poison that burns the lungs.  The
temperature in a small class-A fire in a computer room would not produce
hazardous amounts of phosgene, but a large conflagration might.

The reason why the fire department is not satisfied with just Halon is that
it is a one-shot system.  That's O.K. if a fire breaks out in the protected
area, the Halon system activates promptly, and the fire goes out.  But there
are some failure modes:

1.  If the room is not sealed, the Halon will be blown away.  If the initial
source of combustion is still present, the fire will reflash.  Normally,
Halon systems shut off ventilation and air conditioning before discharging
the Halon, but do you trust those relays to work?

2.  If the fire spreads to the area from outside, the Halon system will only
push it back once.  Once the Halon dissipates, the fire can move in again.

3.  Halon systems are complicated.  Contrast that with a sprinkler system:
Water in a pipe, Wood's metal keeping it there.  In a fire, the metal melts
and water sprays out.

So, the tradeoff in computer room fire protection is that Halon is very safe
to the equipment and to people in the event of an accidental discharge,
sprinklers are safe for the people but not the equipment in an accidental
discharge.  In a small fire under normal conditions, Halon is effective at
extinguishing the fire but doesn't hurt the equipment and has a low risk to
the people (probably lower than that of the carbon monoxide from the fire).
But in the case of a big fire, Halon by itself can not be counted on to
fully extinguish the fire.

When I was Tactical Data Systems Officer on a cruiser, I worried
about firefighting water, since the Navy uses sea water to fight
fires.  So don't complain about fresh water spraying into your
equipment, it will just wash troublesome dust off the circuits. :-)

[...]  We had a false alarm set off the halon in our machine room.  The
amount of warning the system gives before discharging the gas is impressive.
So is the effect on the computer room (lots of gas, lots of air motion, lots
of dust and displaced ceiling tiles).  Much preferable to water. (But also
much more expensive -- that false alarm was not cheap by any stretch of the
language.)

  &gt; A train is a large object whose position is only approximately known
  &gt; at best, whose speed is hard to change and is changed using systems
  &gt; whose performance is subject to wild fluctuations with age, maintenance
  &gt; and track conditions, and whose surroundings are totally invisible to
  &gt; the controlling system.

In the context of the automation of an existing network using old rolling
stock, I take your point.  My original posting focussed, however, on the
London Docklands Light Railway.  The LDLR was purpose-built from scratch, the
rolling stock is new and also purpose-built.  It seems to me that the designers
had ample opportunity to install precisely the kind of sensors you describe.
I cannot believe that these sensors are beyond modern technology.

Stories of trains jumping buffers give the lie to any hope that the
opportunity afforded by the design of a virgin system has been properly
taken.  It is this that I find so disappointing.

I submit that your submissions over the past weeks have driven me into
submission.  The quality of contributions and self-control exhibited by
contributors has dropped off radically.  Various complaints have been
received recently that I have suddenly become far too generous in including
too much irrelevant, unsound, incoherent, and otherwise marginal material.
Well, I currently have a HUGE backlog of messages for consideration -- 30 in
the last four days -- but all are mostly minor variants of previous
contributions, and many of them will not emerge.  (Perhaps the recent deluge
is merely a summertime phenomenon?)  Well, due to my own heavily overloaded
schedule, RISKS will slow down for the next two weeks, when I will be
limited to a few short shots at NETland.  But please keep on submitting the
GOOD stuff -- I'll get to it eventually.  And please excuse the slowdown.

By the way, I erred in including the MITRE notice in <A HREF="/Risks/5.28.html">RISKS-5.28</A>.  Please
don't expect me to do it again.

The responses to Denning/Saltzer/Hardie are running about three-to-one for
nonsecrecy about security flaws, with all sorts of caveats, hedges, special
cases, etc.  Logic tells you that you'd better know when -- and how -- YOU
are vulnerable.

The certification issue is not generating much enthusiasm either way.
(Perhaps certification is also needed for computer system users who have
authorization to do act dangerously or fraudulently.)  The legal aspects of
screwing up may be a driving force toward certification to protect system
developers (or procurers?) if a big liability suit gets won by the injured
parties.  (The Rogan case that follows is small potatoes.  By the way, Donn
Parker notes that the Equity Fund case, with direct losses of $200 million,
is actually estimated at $2 billion total losses if indirect costs such as
stockholder losses are included.)

The standards issue for system safety is warming up again, but is also not
likely go generate too much enthusiasm.  (If you care, see the concluding
item in this issue.  It also implies all sorts of risks.)

Excerpted from the Los Angeles Times, Aug. 13, 1987:

          COMPUTER SNAFU RULED A RIGHTS VIOLATION
    Wrong Man Repeatedly Detained on Murder, Robbery Charges
                   By Jack Jones

The Los Angeles Police Department violated the constitutional rights of
a Michigan man by continuing to list him in a nationwide crime
information computer system as wanted for murder and robbery, even after
it was clear the real suspect was using his name, U.S. District Judge
Robert Kelleher has concluded.

Terry Dean Rogan, 29, will now go to Los Angeles Federal Court to seek
monetary damages ....  Kelleher found that [the two] Los Angeles Police
Detectives... do not share liability with the city, even though on
several occasions they re-entered Rogan's name in the National Crime
Information Center system and failed to add new descriptive information
that would have established Rogan as the wrong man.

The city failed, Kelleher ruled, to properly train and supervise the
officers in the constitutional protection aspects of using the crime
center system and the necessity of adding more accurate information when
it becomes available.  The actual suspect, Alabama state prison escapee
Bernard McKandes,... began passing himself off as Rogan in 1981....

Rogan ... was first arrested in October, 1982.... He was held in jail
until a fingerprint check showed he was not the man being sought.
Nevertheless, ... Los Angeles detectives put his name back into the
computer, neglecting to add qualifying information, and he was arrested
four more times -- mostly after routine traffic stops.  On two
occasions, he was taken into custody at gunpoint, handcuffed and jailed.
It was not until early 1984 that Rogan's name was removed from the
computer system -- after a Saginaw News reporter told [one of the L.A.
detectives] that McKandes ... was back in prison in Alabama.
McKandes... subsequently was convicted of the California murder and
robbery charges.
                     [See ACM Software Engineering Notes 10 3

The June issue of the British magazine Modern Railways carried this item:

     'UNAUTHORISED TESTS' CAUSED DLR CRASH

     The Managing Director of Docklands Light Railway Limited, Cliff Bonnett,
     has said the accident which occurred at Island Gardens station on
     10 March (Modern Railways, May) was primarily caused by unauthorised
     tests, carried out before required modifications had been carried out
     at the southern terminus.  The train, which ended up overhanging from
     the elevated track after crashing through buffers, would have been
     'arrested' if the protection system 'in its full and modified form'
     had been installed.  The train was being driven manually.

Incidentally, on the same page of the magazine is this:

     DOT MATRIX PROBLEMS

     A marked improvement in the performance of the Northern Line's
     gremlin-infested dot-matrix train indicators is promised by the
     autumn, but modified software cannot be satisfactorily commissioned
     for a year, says London Underground, while a new central computer
     at the line's Coburg Street, Euston control centre is awaited.
     Meanwhile, some indicators have lost the minutes-to-train-arrival
     feature, displaying only the order of train arrival.

Two weeks ago I taught a 3-day continuing education class on software safety
at UCLA.  The makeup of the class says some interesting things about the
awareness of software safety issues in the U.S.  I was pleasantly surprised
to have 40 people enrolled (the average class size of software engineering
classes there is about 25).  Half the class was from outside California
which means their management was willing to invest money in sending people
across the country to take the class (implying some awareness and commitment
to the problem -- the class itself also was not cheap).  It was also
interesting to note that although the majority of people came from the
aerospace industry (including someone from Morton Thiokol), there were 3
medical device manufacturers (all said that their attendance was directly
related to the Therac 25 incident -- these accidents that you read about in
risks do have an effect, especially when lawsuits and media publicity are
involved); 2 commercial aircraft manufacturers and a manufacturer of
aircraft engines; the Air Force, Army, and Navy; a couple of firms that do
safety analysis on a contract basis; and one in entertainment (Walt Disney).

Many in the class identified themselves as safety engineers [see the
following message], but there were also software engineers and a fair number
of people who identified themselves as "software safety engineers" or
"software system safety engineers."  I was especially curious about the
software safety engineers and asked a few questions.  All but one had
previously been system safety engineers and had acquired this title within
the past few months.  One had been a software engineer previously and had
become a "software safety engineer" very recently.

   [This item may be boring to some of you, and important to others.  It is
   included for the record.  Comments To: nancy@ics.UCI.EDU, Cc:RISKS.  PGN]

A new change notice to a system safety standard (MIL-STD-882B: System Safety
Program Requirements) has just been released (July 1, 1987).  The surprise
is the amount of reference to software contained in it and the new tasks on
software safety included.  The following are some excerpts (there is lots
missing).  I am sending more information to Peter Neumann for inclusion in
the next issue of SEN.  I am curious about how most system safety engineers,
who are untrained in software engineering, will be able to accomplish these
tasks.  Since in most cases they will not, I would guess that many of these
requirements will be passed along to the software engineers to actually
perform.  The tasks could potentially also have other impacts on software
engineers working on safety-critical projects.  Those of you in the
aerospace industry should be aware of what is about to hit you and others
may find other government agencies following suit.

TASK 202 - PRELIMINARY HAZARD ANALYSIS
[includes] consideration of the potential contribution by software to 
subsystem/system mishaps, safety design criteria to control safety-critical 
software commands and responses and appropriate action to incorporate them in 
the software specifications, and software fail-safe design considerations.

TASK 203 - SUBSYSTEM HAZARD ANALYSIS
identify all components and equipments, including software, whose performance,
performance degradation, functional failure, or inadvertent functioning could 
result in a hazard or whose design does not satisfy safety requirements.

TASK 204 - SYSTEM HAZARD ANALYSIS
perform and document a system hazard analysis to identify hazards and assess 
the risk of the total system design, including software, and specifically of 
the subsystem interfaces.  

TASK 204  OPERATING AND SUPPORT HAZARD ANALYSIS
requirements to evaluate hazards resulting from the implementation of 
operations or tasks performed by persons ... Includes identification of
changes needed in software to eliminate hazards or reduce their associated
risks along with warnings, cautions, and special emergency procedures
including those necessitated by failure of a software-controlled operation
to produce expected and required safe result or indication.

TASK SECTION 300 - SOFTWARE SYSTEM SAFETY
[states that] Software System Safety is an integral part of the total System 
Safety Program.  The 300 series of tasks are recommended for programs which 
involve large or complicated software packages ...

TASK 301 - SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS HAZARD ANALYSIS
The contractor shall examine systems and software requirements and design in 
order to identify unsafe modes for resolution, such as out-of-sequence, wrong
event, inappropriate magnitude, inadvertent command, adverse environment,
deadlocking, failure-to-command modes, etc. ... Software Safety Requirement 
Tracking ...  Analyze Software Requirements Specifications:... assure that the
System Safety Requirements are correctly and completely specified, that they
have been properly translated into software requirements, and that the software
safety requirements will appropriately influence the software design...
The contractor shall develop safety-related recommendations, and design and 
testing requirements and shall incorporate them in the Software Top-Level
and Software Detailed Design Documents, and the Software Test Plan.

TASK 302 - TOP-LEVEL DESIGN HAZARD ANALYSIS
... analyze the Top-Level Design ... include definition and subsequent analysis
of Safety-Critical Computer Software Components (SCCSC), identify the degree
of risk involved, and the design and test plan to be implemented ... ensure
that all safety requirements are correctly and completely specified in the
Top-Level design. ... include analysis of input/output timing, multiple
event, out-of-sequence event, failure of event, wrong event, inappropriate
magnitude, adverse environmental, deadlocking, hardware sensitivities, etc.

TASK 303 - DETAILED DESIGN HAZARD ANALYSIS
...shall analyze the Software Detailed Design ... to verify the correct 
incorporation of safety requirements and to analyze the safety-critical CSCs
... includes relationships between safety-critical and other designated 
software at the CSCI, CSC, and lower unit levels (including subroutines,
data bases, data files, tables, and variables).  It also includes the
requirement to include safety-related information in the Software User's
Manuals.] ... the contractor shall identify safety-critical computer
software units to the code developers, and provide them with explicit
safety-related coding recommendations and safety requirements from the
top-level specifications and design documents.

TASK 304 - CODE-LEVEL SOFTWARE HAZARD ANALYSIS
The contractor shall analyze program code and system interfaces for events,
faults, and conditions which could cause or contribute to undesired events
affecting safety... Analyze (1) safety-critical CSCs for correctness and
completeness, and for input/output timing, multiple event, out-of-sequence 
event, failure of event, adverse environment, deadlocking, wrong event, 
inappropriate magnitude, hardware failure sensitivities, etc. ... (4) proper 
error default handling for ... inappropriate or unexpected data in the input 
data stream, (5) fail-safe and fail-soft modes, (6) input overload or 
out-of-bound conditions.

TASK 305  SOFTWARE SAFETY TESTING
The contractor shall test the software to ensure that all hazards have been
eliminated or controlled to an acceptable level of risk.  Implementation of
safety requirements (inhibits, traps, interlocks, assertions, etc.) shall be 
verified.  The contractor shall verify that the software functions safely both 
within its specified environment, and under abnormal conditions.  

TASK 306 - SOFTWARE/USER INTERFACE ANALYSIS ...

TASK 307 - SOFTWARE CHANGE HAZARD ANALYSIS
The contractor shall analyze all changes, modifications, and patches made to
the software for safety hazards, to include the following: All changes to
specifications, requirements, design, code, systems, equipment, and test
plans, descriptions, procedures, cases, or criteria shall be subjected to
software hazard analysis and testing, unless it can be shown to be
unnecessary due to the nature of the change... the contractor shall show
that the change or patch does not create a hazard, does not impact on a
hazard that has previously been resolved, does not make a currently existing
hazard more severe, and does not adversely affect any safety-critical
computer software component or related and interfacing code... The
contractor shall review the affected documentation, and ensure that it
correctly reflects all safety-related changes made.

In all the discussions that have taken place since Peter Denning's submission
about the paradox of reporting vulnerabilities in computer systems, I have 
been surprised that no one has mentioned DoD Instruction 5215.2, dated
September 2, 1986, "Computer Security Vulnerability Reporting Program (CSTVRP)"

The Instruction:

     1.  Establishes a Computer Security Technical Vulnerability Reporting 
Program under the direction of the National Security Agency, National 
Information Security Assessment Center (NISAC).

     2.  Establishes procedures for reporting all demonstrable and repeatable
technical vulnerabilities of Automated Information Systems (AIS).

     3.  Provides for the collection, consolidation, analysis, reporting or
notification of generic technical vulnerabilities and corrective measures in
support of the DoD Computer Security requirements in DoD Directive 5200.28,
"Security Requirements for Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Systems," 
December 18, 1972.

     4.  Establishes methodologies for dissemination of vulnerability
information.

Some pertinent excerpts are as follows:
...
     The program shall be focused on technical vulnerabilities in commercially
available hardware, firmware and software products acquired by DoD...
...
     The reporting portion of the program is also available on a voluntary
basis for the non-DoD AIS community.
...
     The NISAC shall maintain a central repository of computer vulnerability
information.
     Information on the technical vulnerabilities of AIS's shall be protected
from unauthorized disclosure while ensuring it is disseminated to individuals
responsible for the security of an AIS.
...
     The NISAC shall:
...
     Establish procedures to encourage the voluntary submission of technical
vulnerability information from non-DoD AIS users.
     Establish and maintain a data base of technical vulnerability information
having security commensurate with its sensitivity.
     Establish procedures for transmitting technical vulnerability information
to affected manufacturers for corrective action.
...
     Vulnerability summaries in narrative form should be addressed to:
       National Security Agency
       Ft. George G. Meade, MD 20755-6000
       Attn:  Chief, S2
     An inner envelope should be marked:
       Attn:  CSTVRP/S2093
...
     Any technical vulnerabilities in products appearing on the Evaluated
Products List will be referred to the responsible vendor for correction.
Appropriate warnings will be disseminated.
...
     Vendors may be provided the technical details of reported vulnerabilities
to make corrections, but shall not be provided information about the specific
site(s) concerned, methods of discovery, or other information which could lead
to increased site vulnerability without the express written approval of the
Head of the DoD Component or the DAA.

Comments:  It should be noted that this Instruction applies primarily to
systems that have been evaluated against and certified to be technically
compliant with the DoD Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (the Orange
Book) and, of course, is directed primarily to Defense related agencies.
Nonetheless, I assume that they wish to receive vulnerability information on
any commercially available product.  All vulnerability information received
under the instruction is classified at least CONFIDENTIAL so that affects the
way the information is transmitted to NSA, especially for any organizations
authorized to handle classified information.
     A copy of DoD Instruction 5215.2 can be obtained from:
       U.S. Naval Publications and Forms Center
       5801 Tabor Ave.  Attn: Code 301
       Philadelphia, PA 19120
                              Telex # 834295; Phone # (215) 697 3321

     [The CONFIDENTIAL aspect is of little help to most RISKS readers, and
     probably explains why nothing has appeared here before.  But there are
     unclassified evaluations, and the Evaluated Products List is worth noting.
     In particularly, it contains evaluations of Gould's UNIX-based system
     UTX/32S and VAX VMS 4.4, for example.  A very useful article for people
     interested in UNIX vulnerabilities and how Gould has sought to fix them 
     is Gary Grossman's "Gould Computer Systems Division Secure UNIX Program
     Status", 9th National Computer Security Conf., NBS, Gaithersburg MD,
     September 1986, Addendum pp 27-37.  I get a lot of requests for the
     kind of information found in that article, so I thought I might as
     well mention it here.  (The 10th National is coming up in Baltimore,
     21-24 September 1987.)  PGN]

The July 20 issue of AW&amp;ST had an editorial viewpoint from a former FAA
offical describing a situation where manufacturers of air traffic control
equipment are shying away from bidding on ATC contracts because of the large
and vague liability issues. This industry has formed a group to try to define
liability and provide indemnification. This example reflects the more general
situation where the liability risks of 'doing business' will prevent automation
in a growing number of 'critical application' industries. As the liability
issue comes to a head in other industries we will have a situation where the
non-use of computers, instruments, and software will increase the risks to
society.

We are and should be responsible for our actions and products as computer
professionals. But if liability is undefined and indemnification non-existent,
how many of us will be willing to work on 'critical' applications, when our
companies, jobs, etc. are 'on the line' owing to potential errors or
negligence of third parties, in addition to our own errors or omissions.

I have been reading with interest (no pun intended) the stories of ATM
problems.  I find that the data processing problems of the bank I deal
with, 1st National, are not confined to their ATM system (which has actually
been extremely reliable).  The day before I went on vacation, I transfered
some money between a couple of my accounts.  I did this the old fashioned
way.  I walked into the bank, sat down at one of the bank officer's desks
and filled out the paper work to transfer funds between accounts.  I then went
merrily on vacation.    When I returned, I found that the funds had been
withdrawn from one account and (according to my ATM card) had never appeared
in my other account.  I went in and talked to the bank manager.  They
produced a printout of my account and it showed the money was there.   Feeling
a bit foolish, I thanked them and went back out to the ATM machine.  The ATM
still showed the balance as being off.  I went back to the bank manager and
she looked more closely at the printout.  What happened is that when the
bank officer tried to post my transaction, the computer went down.  This
caused the transaction to be what they called "double flagged".  Withdrawls
are always instantaneous, but deposits and transfers take a day to clear.
When the transaction was double flagged, the money never got posted.  It
was still my money and it was in the account earning interest, but I couldn't
get to it.  That's why the ATM reflected a lower balance since ATM's
reflect the balance available, not the actual balance.

I asked the bank manager if I had to come in personally to the bank every
time their computer crashed to check my account.  She said no, double
flags usually expire in 48 hours.  For some UNKNOWN reason, they don't
always expire.  I asked what would have happened if I hadn't come in.
She said that the money would have stayed in my account earning interest,
but I would never have been able to access it.  I asked her why such
exceptions like mine (double flagged for &gt; 100 hours) weren't noted.
She said it doesn't occur often enough for them to check for the condition.

Personally, I always thought that's what was so nice about computers.  They
can check lot's of things very quickly and note extreme cases that a human
being might miss.  And what really got to me is that they (the bank manager
and apparently the programming department) DON'T KNOW why some double flags
are never removed.  That really worries me.  I think someone in their
programming department should be shot.
                                            Warily yours, Joe Herman

  [From Mark Weiser, weiser.pa@Xerox.COM] 
  The article by Nancy Leveson about certifying software engineers mixes
  apples and oranges a bit.  The first part talks about safety engineers,
  the latter part about software engineering managers.  I know of no
  certification for any managerial level person (other than MBA programs,
  if you call that certification).  There are such things as certified
  computer programmers, with specializations in areas like systems.  I
  think the the CCP program is a useful one, although it perhaps does not
  go far enough, being based only on a test.  Although I have a PhD in
  computer science, I took the CCP exam to see what it was like.  I
  passed, but I suspect many of my colleagues would not.
                                                            -mark

Response by Nancy:  I obviously was unclear in my message.  The Qualified
System Engineer requirement is only for the person who assumes the
responsibility for the system safety program (i.e., who acts as technical 
manager or technical lead), the other safety engineers are not required to
satisfy the same requirements, and this person is certified as to
technical ability, not management ability.  It is similar to the
certification as Professional Engineer -- very few engineers are so
designated, but safety-critical and important projects often include the
requirement for a Professional Engineer to be involved. The idea is to ensure
that at least SOMEBODY is responsible and accountable that things are done
right and there is somebody on the project with a chance of knowing HOW to
do things right.  I don't know anything about the CCP certification, but get 
the impression that it is a minimal qualification test rather than a 
process to identify the very best.

   [I have grave doubts about some of the certification ideas -- and about
   the notion of system safety people, especially if done in the absence of
   intelligent system designs!  PGN]

The front page of the Washington Post this morning described the current
hypotheses on the crash of the MD80, Northwest Flight 255, in Detroit on 17
August 1987.  The flight recorder indicates that the flaps were not set for
takeoff, although another Northwest pilot reported to the contrary.  As most
of you now know, the pilot and copilot apparently omitted the checklist
procedure for setting the flaps.  Today's addition to the emerging picture
is that, when the attempted takeoff began, the computerized warning system
failed to announce (by simulated voice) that they had neglected to set the
flaps.  It was supposed to.  However, a subsequent computerized warning did
indicate the final impending STALL, which indicates that the computer was at
least working, contraindicating speculation that the warning system might
have failed because of the circuit breaker being turned off.  This leaves
open the possibilities of sensor failure, faulty wiring, and computer
problems -- hardware failure, software misdesign, etc.  (A flap indicator
switch had failed on that plane in January and had been replaced, but this
was apparently discounted in importance because of redundancy.)  Another
possibility being considered is that the flap and slat controls could have
been properly set, but failed to deploy...

GUARD YOUR CARD

  Many BANK CUSTOMERS do not realize that their automatic-teller machine
(ATM) cards are not protected by the federal laws that cover credit cards 
like Visa and MasterCard (which have a $50 maximum liability if lost or 
stolen).  ATM liability is also $50, but *only* if the card is reported 
missing within two days.  After that, your liability rises to $500, and
after 60 days the amount you could get stuck for is *unlimited*.  So
guard your ATM card and personal identification number (PIN), or you could 
lose a small fortune.

                                 ---Molly Sinclair in *Family Circle*

No wonder banks, etc. want us to have ATM cards.

The following does not reflect my opinion on professional licensing, which I
believe mutually benefits both the licensee and the public, but reflects my
concern about the amount of influence a license may carry.

While I am generally neutral about professional licensing, I am concerned
about the practice of making a licensed individual "responsible" for safety,
security or quality, just as I am concerned about assigning such
"responsibility" to a specific department in any organization.  Too often
everyone in the company or project assumes that the "responsible" person or
group will catch all problems; that the rest of the process can be a little
sloppy, "..and besides there is a schedule to meet."

Of course the responsibles do not completely catch anything except the blame
for what went wrong (which they try to shift to Murphy).  Businessmen
operate by the modern equivalent of the "Code of Hamurabi," but it is
impractical to fire a whole engineering group or even a senior designer
(expensive to replace); so the quality assurance department is the target of
opportunity (low pay, low prestige).  I'll wager that the average senior
designer has twice the seniority of the average senior QA engineer.

The point that I am striving for is that assigning to SOMEBODY the
responsibility for safety, quality or security, whether by licensing, title
or regulation, is not only insufficient to solve the problem but may also be
detrimental in the long run because it promotes complacency in the rest of
the team.

In the quality assurance literature, anecdotes report that the most
successful quality programs involve every person in the company, while the
quality assurance department becomes more a scorekeeper that a line of error
defense.  The aphorism "quality is everybody's job" may be a cliche, but it
holds much truth.  I would say that quality, safety and security are
everybody's jobs.

Everybody working on critical systems must consider himself/herself
responsible for the quality, safety and security of the system; and until
that sort of attitude takes root neither licensed engineers nor automated
tools nor process standards will make the slightest dent in the risks we face.

Nancy Leveson (&gt;&gt;)

&gt;&gt;Am I wrong in my observation that under-qualified people
&gt;&gt;are sometimes doing critical jobs and making important decisions?

Your observation appears correct to me.

&gt;&gt;Do you agree that some type of certification is necessary?

I would rather say that certification is highly desirable.  Necessity is
a most difficult concept after one moves beyond the basics of air, water
and food.

&gt;&gt;If so,  there are still many open issues...

Yes, yes.  But the basic issue is to obtain or create some certification
agency.  My attempt to interest the Society of Professional Engineers met
with silence.  My attempt to kindle some interest in this matter on RISKS
about 15 months ago received no support, and at least one negative response.
I conclude that it will take at least one major accident with significant
loss of life, this accident attributable to software failure, before there
will be sufficient interest to establish a certification program.

&gt;   ... In the end, I believe that
&gt;   automation will cause incredibly disruption and suffering unless there is
&gt;   also a dramatic shortening of the work week.

Much depends on what else is going on in the economy at the same time.  By
far the biggest example of technological unemployment in history (to date)
is the mechanization of farming, which does not seem to have caused trouble
on such a scale.  This was relatively recent, too.  As late as 1918, farming
was so manpower-intensive that my grandfather missed combat service in WW1
because he (and thousands of others) got sent home on "harvest leave".  I
don't know what the numbers were like then, but over a longer time scale
the percentage of farmers in the population has gone from &gt;90% to &lt;10%.
Studying this enormous transition might tell us something about handling
he advent of automation.

In the early 1970's a (possibly apocryphal) story was doing the rounds.  It
concerned an installation of IBM's where the new physical plant had a
significant amount of its environmental controls in the hands of a computer.
Unfortunately, a serious bug emerged during testing, which manifested itself
by activating the fire-fighting system, which immediately powered down the
systems (electronic equivalent of hitting the crash stop), eliminating all
traces of the misbehaving software.  After two repetitions the story
reported that the project was abandoned.

I never troubled to track this one down, but it has stuck in the memory.  The
second story I can vouch for because I hired the senior system programmer
shortly thereafter and he gave me the details.  Unfortunately I am not at
liberty to reveal the installation concerned, which probably invalidates this
posting.  [Not necessarily.  We just have to take it for what it is.  PGN]

A huge dedicated computer environment was constructed by one of the largest
computer users in the UK.  The main floor was so large, and the halon fire
suppression on such a hair-trigger, that the operators had to practice gas-mask
drills when the alarm sounded.  By the same token, the exits were sufficiently
distant that reaching them in a smoke/gas filled atmosphere could be a serious
navigational problem.  To help out, illuminated arrows were set into the floor
panels, and a computer was supposed to light these to point the way to the
nearest exit.  Needless to say, this extremely costly system totally failed its
first test because the primary control software shut down all systems,
including the light control system, on detection of a fire/smoke problem.

I do not know how to cure this class of problem, which is akin to the
self-powered emergency light for power failure.  The reason for shutting down
control systems in a fire emergency is obvious, but the idea of umpteen
self-contained micro-processor-based emergency systems is equally horrifying.
Imagine the software update problem, should the installation to be sufficiently
advanced in its thinking to implement flexible response!  By way of comparison,
consider the Brown's Ferry near-disaster (We Almost Lost Detroit), where a fire
in the (one and only) cable duct under the control room floor rapidly severed
the control centre from everything over which the operators were supposed to
have control.  No matter that the fire started in an extremely bizarre fashion,
the issue is how do you protect vital communication links in physically
hazardous circumstances.

From: &lt;asci!brian@ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU&gt;

I write fiction on the side.  Watching the discussion on automated control
systems for such systems as air traffic control and power plants, I was
reminded of a short story I wrote a few years ago that used a possible world
economic collapse as a plot device (though the theme was dramatically
different).  I've always been suspicious of Wall Street (the buying and
selling of money for the sake of making money just strikes me as wrong, I
think of investing as buying and staying).  In my story I skirted the issue
of how the collapse could be brought about, but intimated that someone
wanted to do so by sabotaging a computer system somewhere.  Recently I've
been thinking such a collapse is now possible by the deliberate sabotage of
a computer system used by brokerage houses.

As I understand it, these systems watch the difference in say the price of
company A and a bond from company B.  When the price of the bond becomes
attractive for reasons I don't understand, the computer starts dumping hundreds
of thousands of shares in company A and buying in company B.  Another computer
sees the drop in company A and starts selling to cut its losses.  Another
computer and watches the drop, and starts buying in A when it thinks it is a
good value.  TIME had an issue about the electronic market and talked about a
program called Firedown that did something like this.
        [And RISKS has had considerable discussion in past volumes on 
        instabilities that can result from closed-loop computer models. PGN]

My question is what if somebody sabotaged such a system or group of systems,
and they started selling everything and bought into say gold.  Is there a
risk that an "electronic" panic could be started with all of these machines
selling and selling, generating an avalanche effect?  It seems from media
reports that the speed of the buying and selling transpires much too fast for
human intervention, and the programs are DESIGNED to work without human
intervention.  What prevents such an occurrence?  If sabotage is possible,
and an avalanche could be generated, what precautions could be made to stop
it (maybe a government computer monitoring the whole thing that steps in and
starts buying everything up to slow and eventually stop the avalanche, later
it starts an organized sell of everything it bought)?

With what appears to be agreement that fully automated control systems have
enormous dangers and that human intervention is demanded, what about these
Wall Street beasts?  I don't know, but as a writer I'm very curious what
others might know.

    event happening.  PGN]

&gt;
&gt; Elsewhere, Abbey National claims to process 5.7M transactions per year ...

&gt;	The moral is:  don't expect computers to perform all the routine,
&gt;boring tasks that they do so much better than people.
&gt;
&gt;				Andy Walker, Maths Dept, Nottm Univ, UK

No, the problem just has to be looked at differently.  To enforce the
250 pound per day limit, the computer has to have fields in its customer
records that indicate the date of the last withdrawal and how much has
been withdrawn on that date so far (or some such information).  To enforce
the "3 consecutive day" rule, merely add another two bit field that indicates
how many consecutive days the account has hit the max withdrawal limit.  Of
course, the easy way around this is to withdraw 249 pounds per day, so this
probably isn't what you want to be looking for, but the scheme can be adapted
to many different trigger conditions.

The moral here is:  Don't be blinded into believing that the obvious
solution is the only solution.

I wounder how much computing power is wasted in the world because poor
algorithms are implemented and give acceptable enough performance to just
get by?

	In the September SciAm, there is an ad from Honda announcing that
the new Prelude Si4WS has 4-wheel steering.  I seem to remember this type
of steering being discussed at some length on this list in the past, so I
won't go into the details other than to quote the following from the ad:

	"The rear wheels are linked directly to the front wheels by a
steering shaft, gears and rods.  There are no computers, wiring or
electronic black boxes.  The Honda system is mechanical and sure."

	Have the Honda engineers been reading RISKS, I wonder?  Perhaps our
discussions steered them away from electo-gadgetry?  Has car design turned
a corner because of us?

  From "The Independent" of August 24th:

  Transatlantic flights at risk from computer,  By David Black

  The computer which controls airliners flying between Europe and North
  America failed yesterday morning, causing delays of up to three hours on
  all transatlantic flights. 

  It is the ninth serious breakdown of the system, which has had, on average,
  minor failures every other day since it became operational earlier this year.

  It crashed just after 11.30am.  By mid-afternoon Heathrow airport began to
  run out of parking space for delayed aircraft, many with passengers on
  board.  Similar delays were experienced at Paris, Schipol (Amsterdam),
  Frankfurt, Zurich and other major European airports and complaints from
  airlines began flooding in last night.  The failure on the busiest day of
  the year is bound to embarrass the Civil Aviation Authority internationally.

  Although the computer was restored by tea time, controllers were unable to
  bring it back on line without stopping all transatlantic traffic.  Last
  night, the intention was to wait until traffic eased prior to the surge of
  eastbound traffic from North America before restoring the computer.

  The computer, known as the Flight Data Processing System (FDPS), is
  based at the National Air Traffic Service's Oceanic centre at Prestwick
  in Scotland.  Yesterday's failure is the second in which all information
  available to controllers was wiped from the system. 

  Controllers there monitor weather systems over the Atlantic and every day
  draw up a network of airways, known as the Organized Track Routing
  system, offering the quickest transit times.  So busy was demand
  yesterday, that instead of six parallel tracks, nine were planned. 

  The computer takes data from domestic air traffic control centres and works
  out the times at which aircraft will enter Oceanic airspace.  Safety for
  aircraft crossing the Atlantic depends entirely on separation, not by radar,
  but by releasing the planes into the track system at regular intervals.

  All movements are displayed on large screens which yesterday had to be
  isolated from the computer, with flight details entered manually. 
  Strict flow control limiting the number of airliners allowed to enter the
  tracks was then imposed to prevent collisions. 

  The new system is all electronic, and when the screens go blank, there are
  no printed cardboard progress strips to fall back on.  It is the subject of
  highly critical reports in the latest CHIRP (Confidential Human Factors
  Incident Reports) bulletin, which is published by the RAF's Institute for
  Aviation Medicine.  CHIRP allows pilots and controllers to report incidents
  in confidence, without jeopardising their or their colleagues' careers while
  alerting others in the aviation industry to possible safety problems.

  It is based on a similar scheme in the US, run by NASA.  However, last week, 
  in advance of publication of the latest CHIRP bulletin, the CAA said that
  because references which could identify staff were removed, the reports
  lacked sufficient detail to be investigated, and were undermining flight
  safety.

  One controller used that CHIRP bulletin to describe what happens during
  a system crash: "On one occasion when the system crashed all information 
  available electronically to staff was wiped out.  For two and a half hours 
  the staff had no idea what traffic was in their area."

  The oceanic controllers were reduced to telephoning adjacent air traffic
  control centres to find out which airliners had been handed over to the
  recently, and to examining old strips to get some kind of picture what
  airliners were flying, supposedly under their control. 

  Adjoining control centres, meanwhile, had to hold airliners on the
  boundary between their area and Oceanic's while the mess was resolved. 

  During one crash, a westbound and an eastbound airliner were accidently
  placed on a collision course 35,000 feet over the Atlantic.  The controller
  concerned wrote: "The potentially horrific situation was resolved by pure
  good luck when another controller noticed that the eastbound was missing
  from the display, and may have been deleted by mistake."

  A senior controller at the Oceanic centre said last night:
  "They wonder why we have so little confidence in our top management when
  they give us tools like this - aeroplanes have to have duplicated or even
  triplicated systems as back-up, but the same safety rules clearly do not
  apply to our equipment.  These continual failures are the basic ingredients
  of a mid-air disaster."

  Christopher Tugendhat, the chairman of the CAA, was unavailable for
  comment yesterday.

With regard to the crash of Northwest Flight  255, if the faulty fasteners
that are common throughout military and nuclear installations have also
been used in civilian aircraft, it is not entirely impossible that the
flaps deployed but broke off the moment stress was applied in takeoff.
These bolts do not meet design specifications, and are not ordinarily
detected by maintenance workers.
                                          --Mark Ethan Smith

    [Incidentally, Danny Cohen noted that my implicit assumption that the 
    flap warning system might have been working because the stall warning 
    system was working was unjustified -- the two systems are independent.
    "In the MD-80 there are 2 independent Stall Warning Systems, one of which
    shares a power supply with the Takeoff Configuration Warning System
    (TCWS) that is supposed to warn about incorrect flap setting on takeoff."
    But the common power supply does indeed imply that the circuit breaker
    did not fail.  Furthermore, it now appears that the flaps WERE 
    retracted (not deployed) on takeoff, in spite of the visual testimonies 
    of other pilots, and that would make it very hard to take off.  PGN]

The 4 Sept 87 papers note that the Delta L-1011 flight on 8 July 1987 that
was 60 miles off course actually came within 30 feet of colliding with the
Continental 747, and that four of the five safety measures that had been
previously recommended had been ignored, including plotting the expected
course on a map -- in fact, the appropriate chart was not even on board.
The cause of the near-miss is attributed to false data entry of the inertial
navigation heading.  Both the USA and Canada announced stepped-up use of
redundant checks in the navigational procedures...

The other day I was called in to repair an old terminal which was spewing
random characters across the screen.  I tracked the problem down to the
keyboard, specifically the i8741 microcontroller. (BTW, the i8741 is an 8
bit intel uController with 1k EPROM &amp; 64 bytes RAM) This uController and the
keyboard had manufacture dates of early 1977.  I was in school in 1977, and
the EPROM cells were touted as being able to store a charge for 10 years
(nearly infinite time for systems where time is measured in nanoseconds
:-)), so no one ever cared about 10 years in the future.  Guess what? It's
now 1987 and in comparing the EPROM code with another device, some entire
words had floated to back to FF, causing the failure.  I was thinking about
how many other computer keyboards/systems had older style EPROMs and how the
firmware was slowly decomposing.  Where might these controllers be?  ICBM
launch control systems?  ATM machines?  Pacemakers?  Now I have something
else to lay awake at night and worry about. :-)

I recently posted a request for info about a company offering a modem for
$122 (at least two other people posted similar queries).  I've since seen
the following bulletin, which I am passing along...

  Message #1951
    To ALL                                    08-11-87
  &gt;From STEVE LEON (SYSOP)                     Subject WARNING
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  There is an ad appearing in BYTE, INFO WORLD, Compuserve's ONLINE and
  perhaps other places (it may be scheduled for PC WORLD). It is a full
  page ad by an outfit in Beverly Hills California called Compuscan.
  Prices are absurdly low - in fact - they are below wholesale.
  To make a long story short - the whole thing is a scam. We have the
  postal authorities on it. INFO WORLD will have a front page story next
  week on it.
  In the meantime, don't fall for it. If you already have - RUN to the
  bank and stop payment on the check. (Get to the bank in person and get
  it from them in writing that you told them.) If you already sent money
  and your check was cashed - next time remember the old -but true fact -
  that if sounds too good to be true - chances are it is not true.
  Please pass it on through the BBS networks.

From The Miami Herald, August 14, 1987.  

It's 10 p.m. Do you know where your children are?  No?  Well, just
dial them up on your computer, via satellite link to the tiny implant
embedded just behind their left ears.

This is not science fiction.  Dr. Daniel Man, a Boca Raton plastic
surgeon, just won a patent on the basic technology.

He says the satellite link won't work until he perfects techniques
for making the human body act as an antenna.  Be he predicts its use
by parents, pet owners, overseas workers in potential hostage
situations, Alzheimers's patients and police tracking criminals or
parolees.

Does Dr. Man see any hint of Big Brother in all of this?

"Yes, but I don't want to go into it.  I'm more into the technical
aspects."


   [What will it take before inventors of technology consider
   implications of their work as part of their responsibilities?  MS]

SPANIARDS LEARN THE PRICE (ART) OF PHONE PIRACY (From the Independent)

Madrid -- The ears of officials at the Spanish telephone company Telefonica,
are burning at an article printed in a Dutch newspaper that ran instructions
on how anyone with a computer hooked up to their telephone can dial around
the world at Telefonica's expense.

  Such telephone piracy has plagued other countries, such as the United
States, Britain and Germany who were forced to end this electronic joy-riding.

  But according to the Dutch Newspaper, Volksrant, Spain, Portugal and
Italy all lack the means of tracking down pirates who ride the 'bridges'
-- those who ring anywhere in the world, and talk as long as they want,
courtesy of the intermediate or 'bridge' method. 

  The method is like an electronic shell game, whereby the pirate calls a
busy number in Spain through his local operator.  Then using that open line
to Spain, the pirate coaxes(!@??) the right series of sonic signals through
his computer to ring elsewhere at the telephone company's cost.

  A Telefonica spokesman said that the number of callers hitching free
rides on the Spanish system is 'infinitesimal'.  But he said most
European telephone companies had a gentleman's (?sexist) agreement to
split the costs incurred by the pirates.

      [... about affecting the values of shares by sabotaging computers]

Actually something like this was attempted here lately - someone called
a broker, posed as a customer and placed huge purchasing order for a
certain share; luckily the purchasing bank's computer flagged the order
as suspicious and it was never carried out. This time the fraud was done
by a human, and the computer caught it. I guess Wall Street computers
may be protected much better.

The evolution of the species -- from grease monkey to service technician
-- is behind schedule.  Our education, apprenticeship, and retraining
system is not keeping pace with the spread of electronics and new high-tech
components through cars, say service experts.  They point to a crisis ...

Improvements in quality and defect avoidance have spared most new car
owners the worst effects of a repair industry that's technically dated
and starved for able new recruits.  But watch out when today's cars and
those of tomorrow start wearing out.

Already some consumers are enduring multiple visits to dealerships to cure
such aggravations as stalling, quitting, rough idling, hesitation, and
odd noises, not to mention more serious problems. ...

Each year, literally millions of dollars worth of computer controls are
being removed from cars unnecessarily when mechanics can't trace the true
source of problems. ...

Today's average mechanic in Canada is in his [sic] mid-30's.  He completed
his training more than a decade ago, before computer controlled emission
and engine management systems, anti-lock brakes, or widespread use of
turbochargers.  Add to that the coming electronically controlled four-wheel
driving and four-wheel steering systems.

"There is nothing in the auto mechanic program that says you have to go back
to school for upgrading", says [Ford of Canada's William] Rowley.  "Most
fellows have been out of school so long, they don't know how to learn any
longer."

Rowley says there's also a problem with the compensation system for mechanics.
A fellow can often earn more doing routine service tasks, like brake repairs,
than he can earn puzzling over a mysterious electronic problem. ...

Rowley believes every new-car dealership should have one electronics
specialist by 1990 and half of new-car mechanics should have these skills
by 1995. ...

James Lanthier, ... [of] Ontario's Ministry of Labour, says 598 Ontario
mechanics are now spending weekends completing three trade updating courses.
None has yet finished more than the first course, which began in January,
on the fundamentals of computerized vehicle management systems.  And these
students are only a minority of the 15,000 mechanics in Ontario involved
directly in repairing cars. ...

Ford's Rowley complains ... that community [i.e. vocational] colleges
are still graduating apprentice mechanics who have not been exposed to
some of the latest technical features of cars.  He says most college
curriculums are three years out of date. ...

Only recently has the auto industry persuaded the federal government to
take a leadership role in trying to help provincial education authorities
set a course of action. ... If any provinces took immediate action ...
the first of a new crop of high-tech auto technicians would be collecting
their licenses some time in late 1993.  And even that may be too optimistic.

Toronto Star on August 29, 1987.

From: Nancy Leveson &lt;nancy%murphy.uci.edu@ROME.UCI.EDU&gt;

&gt;From Frank Houston (Risks 5.31):
&gt;The point that I am striving for is that assigning to SOMEBODY the
&gt;responsibility for safety, quality or security, ...

While it is obvious that safety or security or any other important software
quality must be the concern of everybody or it will not be achieved, that
does not mean that assigning responsibility is not necessary nor that
everybody (en masse) can perform the necessary activities to achieve it.
One of the main reasons for the growth of the system safety engineering
field is that the early missile systems were so unsafe.  The basic procedure
for achieving safety in these early systems was to assign responsibility for
safety to everybody.  Unfortunately, there are always conflicting goals in
any engineering design process.  These goals need to be prioritized and
decisions made with respect to these priorities and with knowledge about how
the decisions will affect the ultimate quality goals of the entire system
under construction.  The responsibility for setting goals and priorities
rests with management.  But to then assign responsibility to every engineer
and designer to make all decisions about conflicting goals means that each
person must understand all the implications of every decision they make on
every part of the larger system under construction.  This is unrealistic
because for any reasonably complex system, each person cannot possibly have
all the information necessary to make these decisions.

The individual engineer is responsible for implementing the safety 
requirements for the component or subsystem under his control.  But there 
needs to be a systems safety engineer who is responsible for deriving those 
individual subsystem safety requirements from the SYSTEM safety requirements, 
ensuring that the design personnel are aware of them (so that they can 
implement them), providing the interface point for questions that arise as the 
design progresses (requirements on any real project are not completely 
specified before design begins and never changed thereafter -- for one thing, 
the design process itself suggests additional requirements), etc.  My personal 
belief after studying complex and large projects is that there is a necessity 
for a software safety engineer to interface with the system safety engineer.  
The reason for the extra level of interface is the complexity of the software
subsystem and the practical problems of training a person to be an expert in 
all aspects of engineering and computer science.  The software safety engineer 
is responsible for performing the duties listed above for the system safety 
engineer but with respect to the software subsystem and for interfacing with 
the system safety engineering group which is dealing with the larger questions 
of the interfacing between the subsystems.  This does NOT imply that each 
person is not responsible for the quality of the subsystem on which they are 
working, only that they cannot possibly be responsible for understanding all 
aspects of the entire system and that decisions about such things as safety 
and security cannot be made individually and in a vacuum by hundreds of people 
without any central coordination or planning function.

So yes, safety must be designed into the system by each individual on the
project.  But somebody must provide them with the information necessary to
do that.  And that person (or group) has the responsibility for the
correctness of that information and for getting that information to the
people who need it in a form and at a level of detail that can be most 
effectively used by those people.

  Just a brief contribution to the debate on the Certification of Software
Engineers. In the UK Software Engineers may apply to be recognised as a
"Chartered Engineer", by the Engineering Council. This gives the software
engineer the same status/rights as a chartered civil or nuclear engineer.

  The applicants qualifications and experience are examined by an admitting
body to ensure that he meets the required standard. The British Computer
Society is in the process of nominating members to Chartered Engineer Status.
Membership of the BCS requires sufficient academic or relevent commercial
experience and the member has to adhere to a code of professional conduct.

  In the UK, therefore, there is a growing body of certified and experienced
Computer Professionals recognised by their peers, who are qualified to
undertake work to the standards required.

A Firm NO to certification. Richard Neitzel, Rockwell International, Golden, CO

In her recent article Nancy Leveson states:
  &gt;                 ...Am I wrong in my observation that under-qualified 
  &gt;people are sometimes doing critical jobs and making important decisions?  

	No, you are not wrong in your observation, as many under-qualified
people are working out there. However, I seriously doubt that any system of
proscribed training, education, experience, etc. will be either effective or
of use to much of the computer industry. I will base this on three
observations.

	First, there is the implicit assumption that engineers are
particularly intellegent and able persons. Having worked with engineers from
all sorts of backgrounds, and being one myself, I honestly feel that the
number of under-qualified, and in some cases, out right ignorant, engineers
is staggering. This applies equally to persons with years of "experience" as
to recent graduates. I have worked with "recognized experts" who obviously
knew little more about their subject then I.

	Secondly, and closely related to the first item, is the assumption
that by using tests, experience criteria, etc. we can determine whom are
qualified persons. As a former certified nondestructive testing Level II, I
can testify from personal experience that such programs have severe
problems. For those not familar, nondestructive testing is a highly
specialized field that invokes the inspection of items for defects using
such methods as ultrasonics, radiography, and eddy currents. Since one
missed defect could cause a disaster, such as an airline crash, the need for
qualified persons is obvious. Under the agency of the American Society for
Nondestructive Testing, a program of training, testing and certification has
been in use for over 20 years. Unfortunately, it has not proved adequate to
the task. First, given human nature, fraud has been a part of the system. By
requiring certification, the number of available people is cut sharply. This
means that the incentive for both employer and employee is great to falsify
certifications. Second, the program has proved to have only a small bearing
on the quality of the persons who are certified. Recent studies have shown
that only 60-70 percent of the persons certified are performing at an
adequate level and out of those most are only performing their jobs at the
70th percent level.

	Third, who will determine what the standards are to be? Is it truly
possible for a committee to determine what is suitable for a board spectrum
of industries? Drawing again on my NDT experiences, it has been discovered
that persons who are excellent in testing nuclear power plants have no luck
in aircraft inspection and vice versa. The blanket certification fails
because it must be too general, in order to cover the entire field. The
result has been that industries are requiring additional testing, etc. for
their own areas.  Once this starts to occur the attempt to quanitify
someones ability in an area outside of the one in which they are currently
working is impossible.  Do we really want to limit job mobility this way?

	For these reasons I am against attempting to overly regulate who may
call himself a "software engineer".  I should like to close with two parting 
thoughts:

	1&gt; Some of the most creative and effective programmers I have ever 
worked with had no formal CS training (one dropped out of college after 2 years
and the other is a philosophy major). Conversely, one of the worst was a bona
fide CS graduate with 2 years experience, whose code was simply a wooden copy
of the "proper" way to program.

	2&gt; Medical doctors, who frequently make life or death decisions, are
required to pass their board exams only once (the same is true of lawyers). 
Thereafter, they are judged only by the quality of their work. Isn't that 
exactly what we are doing now?

	The opinions expressed are mine alone and do not reflect any position
on this issue by Rockwell.

&gt;From:  &lt;benson%cs1.wsu.edu@RELAY.CS.NET&gt; (David B. Benson)
&gt; I conclude that it will take at least one major accident with significant
&gt; loss of life, this accident attributable to software failure, before there
&gt; will be sufficient interest to establish a certification program.

But this is the trouble with software certification, with Star Wars
testability, with software copyright protection, with Look-and-Feel
lawsuits, etc, etc:  the slipperiness of software.

For each of the cases presented in RISKS recently (ATMs and other bank
errors, air and rail traffic control, power station control), I can see a
long and drawn-out legal battle over accountability and responsibility.
Who, for example, would be held responsible for improperly programming the
flap controllers and monitors responsible for the recent Detroit air crash?
Assuming that one person or group were found responsible, would they be
personally liable, or the company?  Consider the Morton-Thiokol hearings: a
fairly clear case of a bad product, and a lot of finger-pointing.  Where did
the blame finally rest?

My point is: Yes, if there were such an accident which was clearly the
result of software failure, it *might* lead to a certification
program.  Unfortunately, I don't envision such an accident, or rather
such an assignment of guilt.

The Aug 14 1987 issue of "The Phoenix", an Irish investigative magazine,
tells of a tax swindle currently being investigated there. The taxation
authorities are the Revenue Commissioners (abbrev. Rev Comm) and the
Collector General (abbrev. Coll Gen). Checks paying tax bills and using the
abbreviations as payee were misappropriated by crooked tax officials, who
altered the payees to "Trevor Commerford" or "Collette Gerald". Accounts in
these bogus names were opened all over Dublin.  Flaws in the offices'
(manual) procedures allowed the crooked officials to effectively 'lose' the
defaulter's files in the bureaucratic system.  The defaulter is typically
happy never to hear from the tax office again, even though s/he may only
have paid a portion of the bill.
 
  "A crucial factor in the whole fiddle is the modern banking 
  practice of retaining checks and noting only the amount debited
  on customers' accounts. In days gone by, alterations to the 
  payee line would have been immediately obvious to the payer 
  when the check made its way back with the routine statement." 

While writing this, I've thought of two other stories related to Irish 
banks. One involved using dud checks to earn interest during a prolonged
bank officers' strike. The other concerned a microcode fix I applied to 
the Bank of Ireland system which stopped it dead overnight, with an 
apparent "loss" of several million pounds.

Does building a high quality, safe, reliable, and secure instance of 
a system cost more than building a low quality, unsafe, unreliable, and
insecure instance of the same system?  If not, then the safe one, being
of equal cost, will surely out sell the unsafe one and the folks who
build the safe one will prosper and those who build the unsafe one will
not.  Notwithstanding catchy phrases, generally speaking, quality, safety, 
reliability, and security are not free.  Who then absorbs their cost?

Frank Houston proposes that the builders themselves absorb the additional
cost when he suggests that "quality, safety and security are everybody's
jobs."  As the Japanese and Korean experiences have taught us, this works.
The Japanese auto worker does more work for a given amount of money than
an American worker.  Japanese cars cost the same as American cars, you
get more for your money with Japanese cars, and the builders of Japanese
cars prosper and the builders of American cars do not.

Will this approach work with software and computer systems?  Enterprise A
pays 10 engineers $50,000/year each and builds Product A.  Enterprise B 
pays 15 engineers $33,333/year each and builds Product B which costs the
same as Product A but is of higher quality, safer, more reliable, and more 
secure.  My expectation is that there will be a net flow of engineers from 
Enterprise B to Enterprise A.  Why?  

I don't know but I can think of a possibility.  The amount of the cost of 
quality, safety, reliability, and security that computer system engineers 
are willing to absorb is not perceived by them to be sufficient to make a 
difference in the system's customer's buying behavior.  Thus, Product A will 
sell just as well as Product B but A's engineers will do much better than 
B's engineers.  Thus, I don't think the Japanese approach will work with
computer systems.

The only alternative is that the system's customer absorbs the additional 
cost.  What are computer system buyers willing to pay for quality, safety,
reliabity, and security?  The marketplace evidence says to me that without
any downside risk for their absence, damn little. Thus, as long as we are 
willing to accept the excuse that the computer malfunctioned and no one is 
to blame then we can't be expected to be asked to build high quality, safe, 
reliable and secure systems.  

MORAL: If you want build good systems then you either have to be willing
to absorb more of the cost of doing so or be willing to accept liability 
for not doing so.  If you are willing to do neither, then you should expect
to only build low quality, unsafe, unreliable, and insecure systems ... and
that's just what we're doing.  "We have met the enemy and he is us." Pogo

Joe Herman's account was most interesting, especially in re the ATM not
reflecting the true balance.  I withdrew some bucks via an ATM on a Friday -
and a few days later, Tuesday - had occasion to withdraw some more. The
receipt after Tuesday's withdrawal showed a balance significantly higher
than the amount prior to Friday's transaction. I double checked and found no
EFT or normal deposits outstanding. I called the hot line and was told that
I probably had transacted during a "float adjustment" period and that the
amount indicated on Tuesday's receipt was not actually there. I was then
informed that if I had transacted a few minutes later the receipt probably
would have indicated the "real" amount.  A couple of other minor incidents
similar to this have convinced me that I must be going right down the rabbit
hole every time I enter a bank parking lot. I don't remember signing an
agreement that they could fiddle with my account for adjusting anything.

Criminals are set free, innocent people get arrested due to serious problems
with the central computer of the Dutch police.  The newly installed computer
at the CRI (Central Investigation Information dpt.) in The Hague, Holland,
is invested with bugs.  Police departments all over Holland have decided not
to use the CRI computer anymore, until the problems are solved.

Only one day after the computer was installed, problems started occurring,
giving inaccurate or plain incorrect information about people the police
wanted to check.  Innocent people appeared to be on a 'wanted list',
criminals were 'cleared'.  This resulted in injust arrests or people
sent away whereas they should have been arrested.  The chaos was enormous.

The CRI clearly made the blunt mistake to completely dispose of the
old system and switching to the new system at once.  No back-up system
was maintained.  And the supplier of the software ("It's not our fault,
we've delivered what was ordered") washed his hands in innocence, blaming
the police for incorrect usage of the system.

Will they never learn?

United Press International [4 Sep 87]
 
COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- A young man became so mesmerized by his computer 
that he was hospitalized with a "computer syndrome" that made him unable to 
distinguish between the real world and computer programs, a Denmark medical 
journal said.

The journal said the unidentified 18-year-old contracted the new form of
psychosis, called computer syndrome by three doctors at Copenhagen's Nordvang 
Hospital, after spending 12 to 16 hours a day in front of his computer.

The doctors said the young man began to think in programming language,
waking up in the middle of the night thinking, "Line 10, go to the bathroom;
Line 11 next."
 
The patient told the doctors he "discovered that man is only a machine. 
There is no difference between the computer and man."
 
In WEEKLY FOR PHYSICIANS, psychologist Bent Brok and psychiatrists Eva 
Jensen and Erik Simonsen said, "He merged with the computer and afforded it 
supernatural qualities."
 
In the end, he suffered from insomnia and anxiety and had to be 
hospitalized.  The article did not indicate his present condition.
 
The young man's preoccupation with computers is not unique, but his 
psychotic condition is unusual, Tuesday's report said, warning against 
"many young people's excessive preoccupation with computers."
 
The three doctors said that the computer is used by youths as a substitute 
for human contact because it always responds in a rational manner but that 
the stress on logic can lead to immaturity and emotional limitations.
 
The computer trade itself also seems to be aware of the problem.
 
"A large group of young people -- about 95 percent of them boys -- are 
computer freaks who live for nothing but the machine," said Lars Knudsen, 
32, manager of a Copenhagen computer firm, Professional Datainformation.

"The typical computer freak is between 14 and 16," said Knudsen, a former freak
himself.  "He gets up at 2 in the afternoon and sits in front of the screen 
until 4 in the morning.  He drinks 3 liters of Coke and has no girlfriend."

Two short notes:

   The "were the flaps extended" debate has made me remember just how
   unreliable human eyewitnesses are.  Many times we depend on human
   observation to back up sensor data.  Yet we forget about the people
   who "saw" the plane on fire before it hit the ground, and the pilot
   of the plane behind who "saw" that the flaps were extended.

   The comments by Rich Neitzel about certification have also reminded
   me of the risks of natural language.  At one point in his "NO to
   certification" message, Neitzel uses "proscribed training" where he
   means "prescribed training."  Of course, this totally reverses the
   meaning.  It is not hard to imagine such an error being written
   into the specification for a system, leading to behavior totally
   opposite that which was desired.

Roy Smith (System Administrator, Public Health Research Institute, NYC) remarks
(in RISKS DIGEST 5.32) about Honda's 4WS (4-wheel steering) having "no 
computers, wiring or electronic black boxes" and being "mechanical and sure".

He then asks "have the Honda engineers been reading RISKS?" and "Has car
design turned a corner because of us?".

These are most interesting questions, especially since Honda has the 4WS
in Japan since 1976.
							Danny Cohen

   [OK.  So an &lt;illogical&gt; conclusion would be that the Japanese invented 
   RISKS prior to 1976.  A more sensible conclusion might be that it pays
   to stick with a good design?  But I think there is a tendency to have
   to keep up with the Joneses in modernizing auto designs and other systems
   by using computers just to one-up the competition.  I'm delighted to hear 
   that Honda might have resisted that in the 4WS.  PGN]

&gt; He says the satellite link won't work until he perfects techniques for
&gt; making the human body act as an antenna.  Be he predicts its use by
&gt; parents, pet owners, overseas workers in potential hostage situations,
&gt; Alzheimers's patients and police tracking criminals or parolees.
&gt; 
&gt; Does Dr. Man see any hint of Big Brother in all of this?
&gt; 
&gt; "Yes, but I don't want to go into it.  I'm more into the technical
&gt; aspects."
&gt; 
&gt;    [What will it take before inventors of technology consider
&gt;    implications of their work as part of their responsibilities?  MS]

I admit I wasn't there and didn't hear the interview happen, but this sounds
to me like a cheap shot out-of-context quote.  I don't think there's much
question about the desirability of the uses he suggests; it's not
unreasonable to promote them despite the potential misuses the moderator and
the interviewer fear.  There are precious few things in the world that don't
have both good and bad uses.  It's important to be aware of the potential
abuses of the things we create, but it's also important to not be so afraid
of them that we sit around creating nothing.  Once it is possible to do a
thing, and it seems likely that what Dr. Man suggests is not far from
feasibility, it will be done.  It would be nice for the creator to be one of
the first to point out the dangers and to suggest the need for their
regulation, but it is unfair to expect someone whose reputation and
financial future are tied up in the development of a product to spend as
much time plugging its dangers as its virtues.  That's what the rest of us
are supposed to be doing.  One could reasonably say that Dr. Man had done
his duty by making his product visible far enough in advance that we can
work on controlling it before it is reality.

From "Logged On", by Vin McLellan - Digital Review, August 24, 1987, page 87

Anthony Prince Fairchild is doubtless a colorful rogue.  Five years ago, when
People magazine reported on a dispute between the Aspen sheriff and the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) about lax law enforcement in the Colorado
resort town, Fairchild stepped forth - not to deny the DEA's allegations that
he was running an Aspen "drug factory," but, rather, to defend eccentricity.
"It's not against the law to be bizarre," he told People, which featured a
photograph of him leaning back against a nude female mannequin he called
Christina.

Some may have found Fairchild's face familiar.  An engineer by education and
trade, Fairchild had also been a model:  His Salem-smoking visage has
adorned millions of magazines and billboards.  He's now 50 years old, but
police still call him a "pretty boy."  Last month at a pre-trial hearing in
San Jose, Calif., Fairchild curled up on a courthouse bench reading
Firestarter, while the curious strolled by to check him out.  After all,
Fairchild had just had his bail changed from $2.5 million to "no bail" out
of fear that he would post the money and disappear.  "He looks just like
Timothy Leary," said an onlooker, referring to the LSD guru the '60s.

If Fairchild isn't a legend like Leary, it may be because federal
authorities have never publicized the extent of their interest in him, even
though they've sought him several times over the years.  But after being
arrested last November with eight kilos of cocaine, $12,000 in counterfeit
money and 85 pounds of high explosives, Fairchild became a topic of rumor in
Silicon Valley, in the California drug culture and, oddly enough, among the
nation's top security consultants as well.

"The guy's got a brain," remarked one California investigator.  "You maybe
couldn't guess it to see the mess he's in, but he's done a lot of things -
legit things - and some say he's just slightly short of being absolutely
brilliant."  Fairchild's resume indicates success in a half-dozen careers,
most recently as an EDP consultant in Silicon Valley.  It claims he holds 11
U.S. patents, and states that he was one of the authors of Digital
Research's Concurrent PC-DOS.  The police say this work record is accurate.

Predictably, Silicon Valley police have been among the first to confront the
probleme of criminal enterprises that digitally encrypt incriminating records.
"There's one case like that every six weeks around here," noted a local police
reporter.  "It's become quite common."  The method of choice is, of course,
the Digital Encryption Standard (DES), the cipher approved by the U.S.
government for commercial data security.

Fairchild used a Winterhalter DES board in a DOS micro to keep what police
believe to be an extensive diary of the affairs of a "large international drug
ring."  Local, state and federal narcotics agents are all very eager to gain
access to Fairchild's records.  Indeed, Santa Clara, Calif., police reportedly
used covert FBI funds to have a privately owned supercomputer grind away at
cracking the DES-encrypted data.

The attempt was not a big secret.  Several EDP security consultants were
asked to suggest crypto attacks.  What made the DES attack feasible, if
still unlikely to succeed, was that the Winterhalter device uses a program
to transform a 6-to-16-character password into the 64-bit DES key.

The cops got lucky:  With a pass through a full English dictionary, and by
culling significant names and such from Fairchild's personal history, they
were apparently able to guess three of four passwords that were used to
encrypt files stored on his micro.

The passwords were all eight or fewer characters in length, and all in
lowercase letters.  The diary file continued to elude their efforts, but
the police reasoned that if the DES password for the diary was less than
eight characters, a "brute force" approach to finding it was possible.  A
cryptoanalyst who is a leading consultant for California banks was hired to
make the attempt.

The supercomputer may have actually been chewing away when the Justice
Department stepped in late last month to confiscate copies of the encrypted
diary, presumably as evidence in a federal drug case against Fairchild.  This
pre-empted local authorities from possibly making the big score.

The situation is in fact much worse (and farcical) than seems credible.
Firstly, there is no accurate estimate of the size of the fraud, with the
revenue preferring to err in low figures.  To date the "figure" of 300,000IR
(about $4.2m) is being suggested as the *most* accurate.  However, no one
seriously believes this, least of all tax consultants in the large
accountancy firms.  Secondly, John's comments about officials causing the
disappearance of defaulters files is not quite accurate.  Many of the
cheques which were altered came from quite respectable companies and
self-employed business people -- I am trading on the knowledge of friends who
are in taxation consultancy -- it was the deposit time lag in revenue which
provided the gateway to the fraud.  Between the receipt of a cheque and its
lodgement there could be a delay of three months.  Finally, and I think this
is what John was referring to, the revenue have a "pending file" where
information on possible defaulters is kept.  By flicking through this file
it would have been easy to select the right targets.

P.S. Since the banks no longer have a policy of automatically returning cheques
many companies and individuals may be totally unaware that theirs' have been
altered.

This is the second major fraud to affect the revenue services here. I reported 
a previous fraud involving tax repayments to RISKS a few months back.  It 
remains to be seen what comprehensive overhaul of the system will be pursued.

Summary: It can make a $ignificant difference.
Date: 8 Sep 87 17:18:32 GMT

  The argument probably does not apply to long-lived systems such as
operating systems and major suites of applications.  Honeywell-Bull
found some years ago that the cost of fixing things that could have
been done correctly before release was significant, and started a 
rather successful quality programme, thereby saving themselves
money. Most of the areas they saved money were in the maintenance and
correction of old, long-running systems, both hardware and software.

  Moral: We have met the enemy and ... oh-oh, do we really want this war?

Disclaimer: the above is the opinion of neither Honeywell-Bull nor Geac.

There seems to be quite a lot of public criticism of steer-by-wire etc.  at
the moment.  Perhaps Honda is just trying to cash in on the current wave of
Luddism.  Perhaps their electronics don't work.  Perhaps they can't produce
electronic cars fast enough.

These reasons are all fairly legitimate, and all could explain why Honda plugs 
the lack of electronics and points out that the car is "mechanical and sure".  
Honda doesn't have to be particularly safety-conscious to make a profit.

In regards to the 18 year old that developed "computer syndrome" in Denmark.
My question is did the kid develop it because he was working on the computer,
as if they pose some inherent social risk, or was the kid already at risk to
developing some type of neurosis and because he had a computer it settled on
that?  Was the kid just as likely to develop a drug habit in an effort to
conform and have friends, or possibly take his own life out of frustration and
loneliness due to an illogical world he could not fit into.  If so, then did
the computer save his life by temporarily giving him the logic and structure he
craved?  Sort of like using a small bomb to destroy a larger bomb, but its
still a bomb.

About the inventor who has a developed a telephone receiver that can be
implanted behind a human's ear:

Sometimes, no matter how much the potential for good, the dangers can far out
weigh them, and therefore the potential good must be denied.  A perfect example
is the recent Supreme Court ruling for Preventative Detention, that persons can
be held with out bail if they are shown to be a danger to the community.  The
intent was to hold drug pushers and Mafia figures that could easily make bails
of 5 or 10 million dollars, and then continue to run their empires, or skip out
and not thing twice about it.  Well now a D.A. in Florida is using that ruling
to hold juveniles that are accused of murder or drugs, or simply have a history
of arrests, showing that history as a pattern to prove they are a danger to the
community.

Suddenly we have incarceration without trial.  Preventative Detention was
viewed as having both good and bad effects, but was thought that properly
controlled and regulated, it could be used for the good of society without the
bad effects.  Thomas Jefferson argued for strict interpretation of the
Constitution, so that such finely cut interpretations as Preventative Detention
could not be legislated by the courts.  In our modern society, we feel "smart"
enough to be able to maximise the good and minimize the bad.

I agree with the original poster and PGN [You mean "MS"?  PGN], sometimes
no matter how helpful some technological innovations may be, you must take
into account their implications, which are sometimes to grave and it is
better left uninvented.  I think the article about the Dutch Crime Computer
is a perfect example that we are human and do err (even something as
*stupid* as dropping your backup system).  Could you imagine the chaos if
the Dutch allowed Preventative Detention and you couldn't get bail while you
waited around for the authorities to straighten things out.  That's exactly
why Preventative Dentention is supposed to be forbidden by the constitution,
but we just think we're so smart.  What a glorious 200th birthday present
for our constitution.

I don't think the moderator or anyone else is being paranoid here.  It is
issues like this that make me very glad there are groups like the ACLU.
There is a real risk of Big Brother in this.  The issues here are very
similiar to those of mandatory AIDS testing - when is violating individual
rights outweighed by the good to society?  Given that such a device would
violate existing laws, be easily abusable, and / or be unnecessary because
there are other ways of accomplishing the same thing, it should be banned.
Engineers and professionals do have a duty to act responsibly.  The
moderator is correct.

           [Actually the comment prompting this was marked with 
           "MS", the contributor, NOT the moderator.  PGN]

1) The parole laws were not written with the idea that the Government
know where the parolee was at every instant in time.  To implant a
device that did so is certainly violating the existing law and the most
probably the parolee's constitutional rights.

2) Parent's should not be allowed to implant this sort of thing.  While
parents have a responsibility to take care of their children.  They
should do so by taking an active interest rather than using technology
to snoop on their children.  Perhaps you think it is OK for parents to
bug phones their children might use too?  And what about employers
recording calls employees make without telling them?  Besides, unless
there is someway to remove this "wonderful" device onc the person
reaches 18, it is subject to being misused later by Government.

3) As to pet owners, anyone who lets their pet roam freely tearing up
lawns, breaking into garbage, and playing "chicken" with cars shouldn't
be allowed to be a pet owner.  I'm sure a lot of people will disagree
with me on this one but as far as I am concerned this is another misuse
of techology.

4) As for criminals in jail, implanting them would be OK as long as the
device was removable after they were released so as not to violate their
rights.  But, then if it is removable, they could get a shady doctor to
do it if they escaped (which is presumably (hopefully?)  what you are
trying to guard against here).

5) If someone wants to have one implanted to guard against kidnapping
that if fine, but I would urge such a person to consider the
disadvantages.

This should be an interesting case for the patent attorneys, because the
idea Dr. Man has patented was used as the climactic plot twist in "The
President's Analyst", a wonderful film that came out around 1969.

	KEEP THE CASH, JUDGE TELLS MAN WHO WON $335,000 IN BANK BUNGLE
	--------------------------------------------------------------

	A Fairfield man who made a windfall $335,000 profit after the National
Australia Bank made a mistake in quoting an exchange rate on Sri Lankan rupees,
won a Supreme Court action yesterday over the money.

	Mr Justice Beach dismissed a claim by the bank that Mr Peter George
Rogan had taken an unfair advantage of the bank because he must have known the
bank had given him the wrong figure.

	On 23 December last year, Mr Rogan, who had developed an interest in
foreign currency transactions, collected a National Australia Bank list of
exchange rates which showed 78.5 Sri Lankan rupees to the Australian dollar.
The figure was confirmed in a telephone call to the bank. He bought rupees to
the value of $104,500 and sold them to the Commonwealth Bank the next day for
$440,258.  (...)

	Mr Justice Beach said he had found Mr Rogan to be an honest witness
who believed than the Commonwealth and not the National had given him the
wrong rate.

	The manager of the National Australia Bank's international
operations section, Mr Bob Farmer, ... told [Mr Rogan] that the bank had
mistakenly entered the exchange rate for Central Pacific francs instead of
Sri Lankan rupees into its computer on the day Mr Rogan bought the rupees.
Mr Farmer asked if the bank could do a deal to rectify the loss, but Mr
Rogan sought legal advice and declined to make any payment to the bank.

	Mr Justice Beach said he accepted Rogan's belief at the time that
the rupee must have been devalued because of internal strife, and that he
believed he had been given the correct figure by the National Bank and that
the Commonwealth's much different, unconfirmed figure, on the same day was
because it had been slow to catch up and adjust its rate.  He described Mr
Rogan as an amateur in the world of foreign exchange dealings, rather than
an experienced professional.  He found that although an irregularity in the
exchange rate entered into the bank's computer on 23 December was noticed
within minutes, and the rate was withdrawn from use by bank staff, the
incorrect figure remained on the bank's computer screens, and Mr Rogan had
been given the rate on a number of occasions that day, including the three
times that he had bought rupees during the morning, at lunchtime and in the
afternoon.  Mr Justice Beach dismissed the allegation that Mr Rogan had
deliberately split his purchases into a number of parcels each below $10,000
to delay scrutiny of the transaction, and found that it was the National
Bank which had first advised him to split deals in an earlier transaction. ...

30,753 Minneapolis school children were victimized by a misaligned computer
merge operation, with almost everyone receiving assignments for the wrong
school bus for the new school year.  For example, some first-graders were
assigned to high school and teenagers were assigned to grade school.  In
each case the correct bus route for a given name was assigned to the name
following in the list.  (Thus, just a few children actually received the
right assignment -- if two adjacent entries were to be on the same bus for
the same school, as in the case of the first one of a pair of twins.)

The Playboy Channel was hit on the evening of 6 September with an attack
reminiscent of the Captain Midnight case, when someone ``stepped on their
transponder'', i.e., uplinked through the satellite dish antenna.  The cable
TV program interjection warned viewers to ``repent your sins.''

[Unspecified Local newspaper headline, 12 Sept 1987]

Thirteen telephone exchanges in downtown Minneapolis went dead about
4 a.m. when a computer program for the Northwestern Bell switching
system malfunctioned.   About 50,000 customers were affected.

Although some service was restored by 8:35 a.m., Bell spokesman John
Walker said the company was electronically limiting use of the troubled
exchanges because of a surge in customer demand.  That meant that calls
were interrupted in some cases by a recorded message explaining all cir-
cuits were busy, in other cases by a continuous busy signal.

Walker said the situation was not unlike a freeway traffic jam.  "At this
point, the wreckage has been cleared, but traffic is still moving slowly
because lane use is limited," he said.

The exchanges involved were 332-6, 330,2,3,4,8, 370,2,5.  The 348 exchange
covers Minneapolis police and fire, but Paul Linnee, directory of emergency
communications, said there were no emergency calls that went unanswered.

Walker said the glitch developed while the company was making what he
described as a routine equipment modification in one of two computers.
Employees were changing computer software that was to extend limits of
customer service and add new features, he said.

"We don't know what went wrong with the new software," Walker said.  He
acknowledged there have been other service interruptions this year, "but
nothing of this magnitude."

Walker said Northwestern Bell will continue to limit use of various
exchanges "until we are satisfied the system is again stable."

The first occurrence of this that I have heard of involved the tab equipment
used on the Manhattan Project during the Second World War.  The following
account is from "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" (Richard P. Feynman,
W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1985); does anyone know of an earlier incident?

  Anyway, we decided that the big problem -- which was to figure out exactly
  what happened during the bomb's implosion, so you can figure out exactly how
  much energy was released and so on -- required much more calculating than we
  were capable of.  A clever fellow by the name of Stanley Frankel realized
  that it could possibly be done on IBM machines.  The IBM company had
  machines for business purposes, adding machines called tabulators for
  listing sums, and a multiplier that you put cards in and it would take two
  numbers from a card and multiply them.  There were also collators and
  sorters and so on.
  
  So Frankel figured out a nice program.  If we got enough of these machines
  in a room, we could take the cards and put them through a cycle.  Everybody
  who does numerical calculations now knows exactly what I'm talking about,
  but this was kind of a new thing then -- mass production with machines.  We
  had done things like this on adding machines.  Usually you go one step
  across, doing everything yourself.  But this was different -- where you go
  first to the adder, then to the multiplier, then to the adder, and so on.
  So Frankel designed this system and ordered the machines from the IBM
  company, because we realized it was a good way of solving our problems...
  
  Well, Mr. Frankel, who started this program, began to suffer from the
  computer disease that anybody who works with computers now knows about.
  It's a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work.  The
  trouble with computers is you *play* with them.  They are so wonderful.  You
  have these switches -- if it's an even number you do this, if it's an odd
  number you do that -- and pretty soon you can do more and more elaborate
  things if you are clever enough, on one machine.
  
  After a while the whole system broke down.  Frankel wasn't paying any
  attention; he wasn't supervising anybody.  The system was going very, very
  slowly -- while he was sitting in a room figuring out how to make one
  tabulator automatically print arc-tangent X, and then it would start and it
  would print columns and then "bitsi, bitsi, bitsi", and calculate the
  arc-tangent automatically by integrating as it went along and make a whole
  table in one operation.
  
  Absolutely useless.  We *had* tables of arc-tangents.  But if you've ever
  worked with computers, you understand the disease -- the *delight* in being
  able to see how much you can do.  But he got the disease for the first time,
  the poor fellow who invented the thing.
  
  I was asked to stop working on the stuff I was doing in my group and go
  down and take over the IBM group, and I tried to avoid the disease.  ...

This happened to me once, two summers ago, when I was in the middle of a
development effort that was taking up about 75 hours of time a week.  One
day, I was talking to a friend of mine and wanted to change the subject, to
what we were doing tomorrow. Almost subconciously, I said the words 
"cd calendar" (cd being the unix comand to change directory) and saw the
letters glowing in light green at the bottom of my visual field.

It started happening a lot. It scared me.   Finally, I gave up computers.

From the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, date unknown

FAKE COMPUTER MESSAGE FREED DRUG KINGPIN
By Bill Johnson, Herald staff writer

One or more Sheriff's deputies or civilian employees inside the Los
Angeles County Jail aided an alleged cocaine dealer's escape from
custody, Sheriff Sherman Block said yesterday.

Block said a computer message directing jailers to release William
Londono could only have been generated by one of the nearly 70
deputies and civilians assigned to the jail the morning of Londono's
Aug. 25 escape.

It is also clear, Block said, that someone inside the jail assisted 
Londono once he left his jail cell to avoid a series of checkpoints
where his release would have been reviewed and found to be in error.

"The most troubling aspects of this [are that] we don't know exactly how
this happened, and the apparent complicity of someone in this building,"
Block said.

A team of twelve investigators hasn't yet determined who sent the computer
message or how Londono, 23, was able to slip out of the jail virtually 
unnoticed.  Ordered held in lieu of $3 million bail on charges of conspiracy
and possession of narcotics for sale, Londono wasn't discovered missing
until Monday, six days after his escape.

Any jail employee who could have been even remotely involved is being
interviewed, Block said.  No action has been taken.

Exactly how Londono was able to bypass as many as five security checkpoints
unnoticed remains a mystery, Block said.

"We are able to trace Londono's exodus to a particular point, but haven't
been able to go any farther," Block told reporters as he led them from
Londono's former jail cell to a holding area where inmates are released.
Clothes Londono wore into the jail, for example, are missing, but there
isn't any record of him or anyone else retrieving them, Block said.

Investigators on Wednesday determined that the jail's computer system could 
not have been accessed from outside the building, Block said.  It is 
"highly unlikely" that the release message was sent in error, the sheriff 
added.

There have been two escapes from the maximum security Central Jail during
the past two years.  In both instances, inmates switched identification
wristbands with soon-to-be-released prisoners, and walked out.

Block said the department has conducted an "almost X-ray type evaluation"
of the inmate release process, and have added additional security measures
to ward against a similar escape.

"No one is going to leave here today, tomorrow, or at any time in the near
future by the same method," the sheriff said.

According to a Boston Globe article, relatives of persons killed in the recent
Detroit crash have filed a suit against the airline.  Part of their filing
apparently contains claims that the Cockpit Voice Recorder reveals not only the
omission of the flap setting during pre-flight checklists (in violation of FAA
and nature's rules) but also a discernible voice shouting at the last second,
"Oh, [expletive deleted] flaps!"  (as in, "oops")

The interesting part is that they go on to discuss the 'circumvention' of a
circuit breaker which had de-activated the automatic flaps warnings.  Does this
mean they could have had multiple systems fed throught the same breaker but
that the flaps warning is the only one that was inadvertently shut off?

In my experience with Aviation Electronics (Avionics), most modern indicators
have a big 'OFF' flag, usually orange or red-and-white-striped, dropped across
the face when required power is missing (or a blank CRT).  Being unfamiliar
with complete jet panels, I can only speculate that there is an observable
flaps-setting indicator which might be a good place to show subsystem outages.
(I recall at one Aerospace company where I worked, they went to great lengths
 to run test signals through EVERY required harness, connector and subsystem so
 as to detect outages at various points and interlock man/mission-critical
 processes, not to mention announcing alarms.)

Is there a System Safety Engineer in the house?  Who is responsible for getting
the data from one system to the other so as to be easily interpreted as a
hazard?  Are we to expect an obviously fallible checklist to overcome this?

Today's Washington Post and yesterday's Chicago Tribune had articles
on Herbert Zinn, who apparently broke into a variety of AT&amp;T UNIX systems
and copied some sensitive files -- including a pre-release version of an
artificial-intelligence program valued at $1,000,000 in potential sales.
The articles contain considerable misinformation but again indicate the
intrinsic difficulties in making systems secure.

Reports say West German hackers broke into NASA computer system

  FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) -- Computer hackers broke into NASA's worldwide
data network throughout the summer and gathered secret information on space
shuttle projects and rocket failures, West German media said Tuesday.
  News reports said young West Germans gained regular access to at least 20
computers of the U.S. space agency and had the ability to paralyze the entire
network.
  The ARD television network said a flaw in the network's security system
allowed the hackers to enter the network from May to September.
  Hackers are computer enthusiasts who often try to break into private computer
systems for the challenge or for criminal gain.
  The NASA system connects more than 1,600 computers worldwide that share
information on space research, nuclear physics and molecular biology, ARD said
in a report broadcast Tuesday night. The network includes U.S. atomic research
facilities in Los Alamos, N.M.
  In Washington, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said in a
statement that the tapped network provides unclassified information to
university and industry researchers.
  "We know of no classified information which can be accessed through the
network," the statement said.
  The statement said NASA uses a number of computer networks with varying
degrees of security to provide "appropriate inviduals" with access to data.
  The Hamburg-based magazine Stern reported information similar to the ARD
report in an advance telexed to news media Tuesday.
  "When I saw "Welcome to the NASA headquarters . . . installation' on my
screen, I was a little shocked, to say the least," the magazine quoted one
youth as saying.
  The Hamburg-based "Chaos Computer Club" said in a statement to news media
Tuesday that the youths turned to the club for help when they realized the
enormity of their discovery.
  The statement said the hackers penetrated the network to show the
"unbelievable weaknesses" of the security system and had no interest in the
secret data.
  The reports did not say how many hackers were involved or where they lived.
  Stern said the youths obtained NASA memos to employees on daily space shuttle
program updates and on how to deal with the media.
  The magazine, quoting one youth's records of computer transactions, said the
hackers were able to read users' electronic mail and had the ability to
paralyze the entire network.
  In one of the most serious security breaches, the hackers obtained NASA
information on space shuttle projects, computer security studies and rocket
boosters, the television network said.
  Scientists in at least eight other countries besides the United States are
linked to the computer network. Stern said the system is called the "Space
Physics Analysis Network," or SPAN.
  Michael Butz, a spokesman for the West German Interior Ministry, said his
office had no information about the incidents. The Interior Ministry supervises
many police functions in West Germany.
  In addition to the NASA computers, the hackers gained access to computers at
some of Europe's most sophisticated research institutions, including the
European Space Agency in Darmstadt, West Germany; the European Nuclear Research
Center in Geneva, an the European Laboratory for Molecular Biology in
Heidelberg, West Germany.
  Lennart Philipson, director of the molecular biology laboratory, said the
institute is re-evaluating its use of the computer network.
  "We are considering whether we should restrict our exchange of data with
other institutes, even if that might hinder our research," Philipson told ARD.
  The hackers said they gained access to the NASA computers by asking for files
stored under such key words as "shuttle," "challenger," and "secret," ARD said.
  Under those categories, the hackers said they saw data reports on "Shuttle C
Study Contracts," a "System Security Study" on computer security, and a study
on "Booster Rocket Incidents," the television network said.
  The hackers described a step-by-step process of gaining more and more access
to the network's computers until they achieved "unlimited access" to all data
banks and the ability to "manipulate at will" all information stored there,
according to ARD.
  ARD said the hackers provided more than 200 pages of documents pertaining to
entry into the NASA computers for Tuesday night's television broadcast.
  The computer club said the penetration was discovered in August and all
organizations who use the network were notified.
  So far, no charges have been filed in the case.
  Justice Ministry spokesman Henning Gehl said the hackers' actions are
punishable by up to three years in prison and fines.

&gt;From "The Australian", Tuesday Sep 22nd:

"Heathrow crash causes delays (headline)

A software problem last week triggered a computer crash at one of the
world's busiest airports, London's Heathrow, causing delays and diversions
during a peak period.

The main computer at London's Air Traffic Control Centre broke down for
more than three hours at 4.51am on Thursday at a peak period for long-haul
arrivals, a Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said.

He insisted there was no danger but said four flights had been diverted to
other European cities.  Engineers spent more than three hours repairing the
computer [system].  The computer at West Drayton, just north of Heathrow,
controls all civilian air traffic movement in England and Wales.

The aviation authority spokesman said while the computer was out of
commission, air traffic controllers had switched to a manual system and
aircraft were ordered to keep a greater separation as a safety precaution."

Comment: why no backup computer?

From the Echoes-Sentines [?], Somerset County, NJ, Sept. 17, 1987:
 
GILLETTE RESIDENT IS ARRESTED AFTER SHOOTING HIS COMPUTER
 
PASSAIC TWP. -- A Gillette man was arrested at his home last
Thursday night after he fired eight bullets at his home computer,
according to police.
 
The man, Michael A. Case, 35, of 64 Summit Ave., was arrested
shortly after 11 p.m., at his house, when police said they received
a report that shots were fired.  They arrived at the home to find
a .44 Magnum automatic handgun and a shot-up IBM personal computer
with a Princeton Graphics System monitor.
 
The monitor screen was blown out by the blasts and its inner
workings were visible, Lt. Donald Van Tassel said on Monday.  The
computer, which had bullet holes in its hardware, was hit four times
while four more bullet holes were found in various areas next to the
computer, Van Tassel said.
 
"The only thing he (Case) said was that he was mad at his computer
so he shot it," Van Tassel said.
 
The handgun, which the lieutenant identified as an Israeli Arms
Desert Eagle .44, has "a lot of firepower," he said.  "It's a big
gun."  Case used hollow-point, or dum-dum, bullets, he added.
 
Case was surprised when police arrested him because he didn't think
he was breaking the law, Van Tassel said. "He couldn't understand
why he couldn't shoot his own computer in his own home," Van Tassel
said.
 
Case was charged with recklessly creating a risk and using a firearm
against the property of another, because the house is reportedly
owned by a relative.  The walls were also damaged by the shots,
according to police.
 
He was also charged with unlawful posession of a firearm without a
permit, and with possession of illegal bullets, police said.
 
In addition, Case was issued to summonses, for discharging a weapon
in a restricted area and for discharging a single-projectile weapon,
police said.
 
Case spent early Friday morning in the Morris County Jail and was
released later in the day on $2,500 bail, according to police.
 
A Municipal Court appearance is scheduled for today, Sept. 17.

I just heard a report on the radio this morning, while struggling from the
foggy depths of sleep.  It was one of those filler items they use to take
up the space between adverts...

The National Health Service computer in Great Britain sent out letters
to several hundred men, inviting them to make an appointment with their
gynaecologist for a cervical examination.  Apparently, the computer used
their first names as the selection basis, and got confused by "foreign"
sounding names, and "androgynous" names (their words) like "Lesley".
The real kicker is that someone actually responded...

The Montreal Gazette reported an interesting problem over the weekend
(9/19/87). It seems that a Ms. Josee Gagnon, a 19 year old student from
Repentigny (near Montreal), had sent in her tax return and expected to get a
modest refund from a summer income of roughly $4000. Revenue Canada informed
her, however, that she owed them an additional $400 in taxes.  The tax
department claimed that this was the tax owed on two additional jobs in
Matane, over 300 miles away. Apparently there is another Josee Gagnon, with
the same birthdate, living in Matane, and the government issued the two of
them the same social insurance number (SIN). A Revenue Canada spokesman says
the mixup is due to an "unlikely coincidence".

The newspaper does not identify the cause of the problem, but it appears
that the Canadian government uses name and birthdate to key social insurance
numbers. Perhaps they should think about including birthplace as well.

It might be that my paranoia comes from the title of the article:

		"TV cheats uncovered"

The article (in the London Times) runs:

	"The Post Office has uncovered the address of every home in Britain
	without a television licence as it begins its biggest crackdown
	against licence dodgers, it was disclosed yesterday.

	An estimated 1.4 million people avoid paying the licence fee each year.

	Until now attempts to catch licence dodgers have been hampered by
	lack of precise information, but the Post Office has used a
	computer system to pinpoint evaders.

	A spokesman said: `For the first time the computer now has a record
	of every address in Britain without a television licence. There is
	no doubt we are closing in on evaders. It may well be a record year
	for prosecutions' "

A (simple ?) diff operation between 2 databases and you have it: my name on
a list of potential lawbreakers! (My strange behaviour (not owning a TV)
could be used as evidence for all sorts of other oddities!) I am worried
because I think these databases were not really designed for this purpose.

		US SPRINT SUES OVER ALLEGED THEFTS
	
	US Sprint Communications Co., Kansas City Mo., late last week
	filed federal lawsuits in three states, seeking more than $20
	million in damages in connection with an alleged multistate
	long distance theft ring. The suits were filed in U.S. district
	courts in Kansas City, Seattle and Los Angeles. The thefts 
	allegedly involved hackers who used computers to identify US
	Sprint authorization codes, and individuals and companies that
	sold the codes and used them to place unauthorized telephone
	calls. Defendants named in the lawsuits are Frederick Deneffe III
	and Burton Andrews of the Portland, Ore., area; Paul Lindahl, Ralph
	Purdy III and Kenneth Sheridan, all of the San Francisco area; and
	Gyan Syal and Karlheinz Mueller of the Los Angeles area. Charges
	previously were filed against some of the defendants by federal 
	authorities. The defendants allegedly did business under various
	company names, including Unitel Systems Inc., California Discall Inc.,
	and Hello America. US Secret Service agents, with the help of US
	Sprint investigators, seized hundreds of illegally obtained US Sprint
	authorization codes, along with computer equipment, in a series of
	raids in Kansas, California, Washington and Texas. Bernard Bianchino,
	the US Sprint attorney heading company actions against such offenders, 
	said the stolen codes were used to place more than $20 million worth
	of long distance calls.

&gt;    [What will it take before inventors of technology consider
&gt;    implications of their work as part of their responsibilities?  MS]

Individual action cannot stop these developments; it can at best slow
them.  Few technological applications are so remarkable that only one
person could conceive of them.  Even if Dr. Man avoided this line of
research, someone else would take it up eventually, someone who either
didn't care about, didn't notice, or sought the Big Brother applications
of this new technology.

This century has seen many successful totalitarian societies, and none
of them needed Dr. Man's devices to function.  His devices, while they
may facilitate or strengthen such regimes, will not create them of
themselves.  The problem of totalitarianism is a human problem and
requires a human solution.

This is not to say that scientists have no responsibility in these matters.
"Advances" such as Dr. Man's carry with them grave risks, and it is the
responsibility of all people who care about such issues to make sure those
risks are known, and to do what they can to prevent the risks from becoming
realities.  Part of that responsibility is to stem the flow of such threats
by avoiding the research that develops them.  By doing so, we give society
extra time to learn about and to deal with these threats.

But that will not win the fight.  It is only a part of it.      --bob--

&gt;From the Sydney edition of "The Australian", Tue Sep 15:

``Human error blamed in great ATM card snatch

A fault in the Commonwealth Bank automatic teller machine on
Saturday - which impounded more than 900 Mastercards - has been
attributed to human error.  But technicians are continuing to
investigate the system's software.

Mastercard users were confronted with "No account, card retained" messages
on Saturday morning when they attempted to use their cards in Commonwealth
Bank or Westpac ATM's, and 921 cards were impounded.

The Commonwealth Bank's acting general manager for retail banking, Mr John
Koch, said that although the Mastercard reference file had been loaded into
the system on Friday, "it did not take".  "Every night the Mastercard file
is updated and loaded ... but as the computer did not take the Mastercard
file on Friday night it had no record of the accounts.  The next step was
for the ATM's to impound the cards, which is a very desirable security
feature.  The principle of the system is fine, it's just the practical
application that went wrong." ''

Went wrong indeed! It left hundreds of customers without cash for the
weekend.  The article went on to say that it was "almost certain the fault
lay with incorrect loading commands by a human operator".

Readers will recall a previous snafu with Westpac ATM's, when they went live
with a new version of software.  The repercussions are still rippling...

YOUTH ACCESSES AT&amp;T'S COMPUTERS

A 17-year-old Chicago high school student using a personal computer in his
bedroom broke into AT&amp;T's computer systems around the country, stole $1 million
worth of sophisticated software and was "on the verge" of being able to 
disrupt the company's telephone network, according to federal prosecutors.

The youth also appears to have gained access to AT&amp;T computers at two
military bases: the NATO Maintenance and Supply Headquarters in Burlington,
N.C., and Robins Air Force Base in Georgia, an Air Force logistics command
center, according to prosecutors.  The computers did not store classified or
sensitive material, they said.

[Comments on other attempted penetrations, including the Washington Post's
own computer system.]

[...AT&amp;T says: ] "We view this as a kind of Yuppie vandalism [...].

[The investigation involved] agents from the Secret Service, the FBI, and
the Defence Criminal Investigative Service [...].

[The youth's lawyer] said yesterday that the youth "categorically denies
doing anything that he should not have been doing.  I can assure you that
my client had absolutely no sinister motives in terms of stealing property.
Right now we're very much in the dark as to what this is all about."

[...] several persons familiar with the case said the incident was highly
embarrassed [sic] AT&amp;T and showed potentially serious lapses in its security.
[...] AT&amp;T officials believe the incident does not demonstrate flaws in the
company's security system but in the failure of its employees to follow
proper security procedures. [...] "We're saying the locks are pretty damn
good, but we need to remind people to close the door."

      THIS SOFTWARE ROBOT FIXES SYSTEMS - WHILE THEY'RE RUNNING

   With computer systems growing more pervasive and complex, maintenance
is a mounting headache - especially as networks rope together more
unrelated brands of equipment.  Finding and fixing problems too often
turns into a finger-pointing contest among vendors.

   But suppose there were a robot technician residing in software that
could worm its way freely through the system, periodically "exercising"
the diagnostic programs provided for each piece of equipment.  Imagine
that this software robot is "smart" enough, when it discovers problems,
to run the applicable repair routines.  Command Technologies Inc., a
Boston startup, claims its SoftRobot software does this and more.  For
example, if a hard disk crashes, the SoftRobot might move data to
another system, restart the first drive, and restore the data.  The
program, says Command President Franco Vitaliano, "fools the system into
thinking that a person is doing the work." As a last resort, the system
summons a human.  SoftRobots, which cost about $2,500 for
workstation-level systems, are being evaluated by a dozen computer
companies.

&gt; A (simple ?) diff operation between 2 databases and you have it: ...
&gt; Cliff Jones, Manchester

Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't this info used merely for the enforcement
authorities to decide where to search for unlicensed TV receivers?  They
won't arrest you solely because you're not in the database, will they?

What's the alternative?  When we uncover risks or abuses in the use of
computer systems, we are obliged to compare these with the risks or abuses
in accomplishing the same job without computer systems.  The only effect of
the automated databases is to help find unlicenced TV sets more quickly than
by searching manually.  In either case, some number of such sets will be
found.  Only the numbers differ.

    [Cliff's notes that he is indeed paranoid and abviously STRANGE for not
    owning a TV, plus the statement that they have uncovered EVERY HOME
    WITHOUT A LICENCE -- irrespective of the presence of a TV -- are indeed
    illustrative of the more general problem of drawing inferences from
    information gathered out of context from networks of networks of databases.
    This is by no means a new problem, and has been discussed here in the past.
    It gets more difficult to control HUMAN misuse as the scope of the search 
    widens.  But the key point is that the linking together of databases for
    purposes other than their original intent does raise social questions.
         (Cliff and friends -- help!  The network is suddenly
         no longer accepting your CS.UCL.AC.UK relay.)   PGN]

The following recently appeared on modsim distribution, a mailing list on
issues in simulation.  I thought RISKS would appreciate the point that the
simulator understood the complexity of the simulation task, but not the fact
that the simulation is easy compared to the real problem of SDI control.

I've deleted the name of the poster, but not his organization.

    This has been touched onb before but I'd like to see if
  some more discussion can be generated. I am involved in developing
  a distributed simulation of a large SDI communication network.
  The two approaches to distributed simulation are the roll-back, TimeWarp
  and the Chandra Misra message passing. I am leaning very heavily
  towards the Chandra Misra model mainly because of my misgivings
  about the TimeWarp model. These misgivings are
  
   1) The amount of memory devoted to maintaining a history one
  can roll back to. The networks we will be modelling will consist
  of 500 to 1500 satellites, each with at least 10 queues and/or
  buffers. Checkpointing could be expensive.
  
   2) The roll-back support would have to be developed from scratch.
  We would be building a complicated software support environment
  along with the simulation itself.
  
   3) Debugging in such an environment would be a BEAR. We would
  be catching bugs in the roll back support, bugs in the simulation
  itself and bugs in the interaction between the support and the simulation,
  I can see us tracing a message, not being sure its valid or not
  and then seeing it being "taken back" and not being sure whether
  the "take back" is valid - oooh gives me chills.
  
  I'd welcome some discussion on these points (or others)

All of us have been exposed to the question of whether or not an engineer
should consider the implications of his or her work.  The question is
usually posed in the following way: Should an engineer work on certain
projects if the social implications of that project are negative?  Questions
like "Can (or will) the project be used to do bad things?" become relevant.
This is one kind of ethical dilemma.

Another type of ethical dilemma arises when a similar question is asked of
policy makers.  Do policy makers have an ethical responsibility to prevent
engineers from having to confront ethical dilemmas?

At first, I thought the answer was clear -- Don't ask someone else to do
something you wouldn`t do yourself.  But that's insufficient.  I am willing
to pay someone to provide food for me (I'm not vegetarian), and that
involves things I am unwilling to do myself.

The problem for a policy maker comes from the fact that he must plan for an
uncertain future.  That means hedging against the possibility that his
judgments might be wrong.  As a defense policy maker, for example, it may be
that he cannot imagine any circumstances under which a certain weapon might
be used.  Should he then not think about how to use that weapon at all?  Or
should he spend a little bit of time, money, and energy thinking about
possible ways it could be used in the event that his judgment is wrong?  If
the latter, that could mean that he would have to ask someone to think about
doing things that he (the policy maker) would never want done and moreover
could not imagine wanting done.

It is clear to me that the policy maker should not spend a lot of money etc and
thus ask many people to confront ethical dilemmas.  But should he ask a few?
I invite comments.   

   [This could lead to an interesting, albeit rather free-form, discussion.

The following story appeared in the paper almost two months ago. Since it
hasn't been reported in RISKS before, I thought I would pass it along.  It
is interesting mainly because of comments by DDN spokesmen and consultants.
While taking pains to assure reporters that classified data is not kept on
the network, they also made the point that information on MILNET might be
useful "in aggregrate" - foreign intelligence agencies could piece together
information from diverse sources to infer some classified information.  This
same argument has been used to justify restrictions on presentations of
non-classified material judged "sensitive."  I find it interesting that this
doctrine is invoked in this case; it mitigates against the usual attempt of
the breakin victims to assure the press that the breakin was really no big
deal.  I think usually it is the press that exaggerates the importance of
these incidents, but clearly the blame must be shared here.  Incidentally,
it appears that the breakins were accomplished by taking advantage of
well-known holes in typical Unix security practices that have been explained
at length in RISKS, in articles in CACM and lots of other places, probably
including THE WEEKLY READER by now.

Here are some excerpts from the August 3, 1987, story in THE SEATTLE TIMES,
p. A5.  It is attributed to NEWSDAY:

  'HACKERS MAY HAVE CRACKED PENTAGON COMPUTER SYSTEM'
  
  NEW YORK - Young computer users under investigation in connections with
  recent seizures of equipment and records in Brooklyn and elsewhere have
  penetrated ... a network of computers used by military researchers and bases
  - MILNET - that the Pentagon said in 1983 it overhauled to prevent casual
  breakins and data vandalism.
  
  A Pentagon computer specialist, Lt. Col. Taylor Landrum of the architecture
  and planning group of the Defense Department's Defense Data Network ...
  said the methods the youths described were plausible ... 
  
  He and other security experts emphasized that the Pentagon does not keep
  classified data on the network.  But he agreed taht some data on the network
  was sensitive and could be useful "in aggregate" - by piecing together the
  work product of many people - to foreign intelligence agencies." ...
  
  A 15-year-old West Coast youth who calls himself "Solid State" (said) "They

The following story got a full page, with artwork, inside the front section
of the Sunday, Sept. 20 1987 SEATTLE TIMES:

  A NEW BATTLEFIELD: SOFTWARE WARFARE - RISING FORM OF COMPUTER SABOTAGE MAY
  BE NEXT GREAT MILITARY EQUALIZER
  
  by Scott A. Boorman and Paul R. Levitt - Chicago Tribune
  
  If members of the John Walker spy ring could betray their positions of trust
  to the Soviets for nearly 20 years, what could US adversaries do to sabotage-
  quietly, from the inside - the complex computer programs on which US weapons
  vitally depend? ...
  
  Software warfare - attacking the software that controls or operates such
  weapons - may be the cheapest, simplest, and most effective way to cripple
  US defenses.  Such sabotage is coming of age as a new type of systematic
  warfare, which can be waged far removed from space and time from any
  battlefield to influence not only combat outcomes but also peacetime
  balances of power ...
  
  Given a host of recent US spy scandals, it is easy to envision a computer
  programmer offering, if the price is right, to add or modify critical lines
  of software to benefit a hostile country...
  
  Given its scale and mission ... it is SDI that merits special scrutiny in
  light of software concerns. ... The effort to develop and coordinate all the
  necessary SDI software seems destined to involve several thousand software
  professionals working alone, working over many years. ... The extreme
  complexity of SDI software also suggests that significant bugs may be nearly 
  impossible to trace - even after some future software saboteur is caught...
  
  Software warfare's relative cheapness .. may make it the next great military
  equalizer. ... (It) certainly lies well within the grasp of any number of
  agressive lesser military poweers with the means to buy insiders to plant
  crippling bugs ...
  
  It is vital to bring software warfare into focus in broad arenas of US
  national security planning.
  
  (End of excerpts)
  
The story cited an article by the late Rear Adm. Henry Eccles in the June 1986 
Naval War College Review.  It did not cite other sources who have mentioned
this idea, including David Parnas and the French authors of a thriller
titled SOFTWAR that appeared in translation in the USA a few years ago.

The article also claims "American teenagers using home computers have
developed the capability to alter orbits of commercial satellites, as
demonstrated by a recent incident in New Jersey."  Surely this must be an
exaggeration?

The following appeared in the "Dear Ann Landers" advice column in the Seattle
Post Intelligencer, Saturday Sept. 26 1987, under the headline, "HERE'S
PROOF THAT COMPUTERS CAN GOOF UP."  It is interesting for several reasons:
the correspondent's apparent prior unfamiliarity with computer bug stories, 
and the antics of the service people.  I pass it along without permission
from the newspaper or from Ann Landers:

  Dear Ann Landers:
  
  I've read one too many articles that proclaim "computers don't make
  mistakes."
  
  Five of us would like to challange that statement.  We made an audit of one
  month's business and found that accounts were out of balance by more than
  $80,000.  Everything was on the computer.  We worked far into the night and
  finally discovered that 21 bank deposits were on the printout but the total
  was dropping one.
  
  A programmer was called in.  He worked seven days and called another from the
  home office.  They worked another two weeks.
  
  They had the original entries re-entered 50 times.  More than 150 reprintouts
  were made, but the same error kept occurring.  They admitted it was not a 
  human error.   
  
  The machine was crated and sent back to the factory.  A replacement arrived
  within days.  We were asked not to discuss this matter with anyone.

Three men in Rochester, Minnesota, have been arrested after they telephoned
the police for a prostitute.  After a family complained that men were calling
their new phone number and asking for women, Northwestern Bell agreed to
give the number to the Rochester Law Enforcement Center.  If a call comes in
and a vice team is available, a female officer wired for sound is sent out.

Lt. Barry Fritz, supervisor of the vice unit in Richfield, MN, says they have
not used abandoned outcall service numbers because of the difficulty of
finding such numbers and possible data privacy violations.

The above information is from a well-balanced article by Bill McAuliffe in the
9/25 Minneapolis Star Tribune, pg 14B.

Flight International for Aug. 29 reports that a British Airways Concorde
burst five tires on landing at JFK on Aug. 11.  Nobody was hurt and no
emergency evacuation was necessary, but two engines were later replaced
as a precaution because they had ingested debris.  (If the Concorde was
being designed over again, in hindsight one definitely would not put the
landing gear directly in front of the engine intakes!)  The interesting
part is the reason for the tirebursts:  the main hydraulic system was
down due to a "minor fault", leaving the brakes on the standby hydraulic
system... which has no antiskid control.  The disturbing aspect here is
that the crew evidently had come to rely completely on the antiskid
braking system.  Unless, perhaps, the pilots were unaware that they were
back to "dumb" brakes -- seems unlikely -- it's disturbing that they made
such a drastic error in braking procedure.  These were not second-rate
pilots, by the way; my understanding is that the Concorde is the most
sought-after assignment in BA, and it is likely to have BA's best crews.

this rendering of a UPI article:

  Stockholm (UPI) -- Swedish police issued a national alert for two stolen

  sell them to Soviet-bloc countries.  The two Micro-Wax 2 computers were

  &gt;From: Brint Cooper &lt;abc@BRL.ARPA&gt;
  &gt;Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't this info used merely for the enforcement
  &gt;authorities to decide where to search for unlicensed TV receivers?  They
  &gt;won't arrest you solely because you're not in the database, will they?

    I can't speak about the UK, but here in New Jersey, any evidence
obtained through such a database cross-match would probably be ruled
inadmissable in court.  The N.J.  Supreme Court has held on several
occasions that a search warrant (as would be needed to actually enter a
house to find a TV set) cannot be issued on the basis of such "fishing
expeditions".  Rather, the Court expects the person requesting the warrant
to show "probable cause" that a crime has been committed, thus justifying
the search.  The legal requirements to demonstrate probable cause do not
allow generalizations, such as "No persons without a TV License may own a TV
set, therefore all persons not owning TV Licenses should be searched." The
preferred form is to limit the request to those suspected of committing a
crime, as in "No persons without a TV License may own a TV set, therefore
all persons whose homes openly sport a TV antenna and who do not own a TV
License should be searched."  This, of course, means that the database
cross-match provides the police with no additional homes to be searched,
since they still must identify the homes in question by some criminal criteria.

  &gt;What's the alternative?  When we uncover risks or abuses in the use of
  &gt;computer systems, we are obliged to compare these with the risks or abuses
  &gt;in accomplishing the same job without computer systems.  The only effect of
  &gt;the automated databases is to help find unlicenced TV sets more quickly than
  &gt;by searching manually.  In either case, some number of such sets will be
  &gt;found.  Only the numbers differ.

    More important is the ability to derive a new datum from the conjoining
of existing data.  Specifically, the cross-matching of a list of all
addresses in Berlin with a list of all Christians in Berlin would yield a
list which would contain all Jews in Berlin.  This is a far more efficient
method of locating groups of people that Hitler had at his disposal, and as
you say, provides quicker results than by searching manually.  Only the
numbers differ.

    Before the flamers start complaining about the use of loaded terms, my
point is that ethics and social responsibility, while largely ignored in
computing to date, are rapidly becoming critical to our continued survival
as a planet and a race.

   I was/am quite offended by the use of my letter out of context to
advertise the uncertainty of star wars.  I said nothing about SDI itself nor
about my beliefs.  All I was talking about were detailed problems in a
distributed simulation.  That letter was part of a larger discussion.  Taking
what I said out of context, and making assumptions about my perceptions,
judgements and opinions on the real thing and then indicating surprise and
indignance over the result is intellectually dishonest and unfair.  I think
the issues raised by SDI are important enough not to need this sort of
puerile potboiling.

The following appeared on the back page of one of Australia's more outrageous
computer publications, "Computing Australia", 21st Sept 1987:

  ...  Blame it on the computer.           

  An unfriendly computer has been held responsible for a "potentially lethal
  error" involving a Mafia loan collector.

  A New York paper inadvertently put the `heavy' in the running for a pair of
  custom-fitted concrete shoes when it identified him as a "ruthless informer".

  According to a published retraction (and apology!), a writer on the paper had
  actually typed "ruthless enforcer" - but the computer system's spelling
  checker liked it the other way.

And I thought the worst you could expect from a "computer error" was a bill
for a million dollars!

Now, this particular publication (Computing Australia) is not known as the
"computer gutter press" for nothing, so I would appreciate any comments from
indigenous Americans...

AT&amp;T's attitude that the break in was just 'Yuppie vandalism' and the
defense attorney's comments on motives make me wonder when, if ever, the
view of computer crimes will merge with society's view of other property
crimes: we have laws against breaking and entering. You, as property owner,
don't have to provide 'perfect' security, nor does anything have to be taken
to secure a conviction of unauthorized entry. That conviction should be
easy. Also, using CPU resources (a demonstrably saleable product) amounts to
theft. There still seems to be the presumption that computer property,
unlike other property, is fair game.

I do not imply that we should relax our security efforts -- merely that we
deserve the same legal presumption that our imperfectly protected systems
and work are private property subject to trespass and conversion protection.

  &gt;The article also claims "American teenagers using home computers
  &gt;have developed the capability to alter orbits of commercial
  &gt;satellites, as demonstrated by a recent incident in New Jersey."
  &gt;Surely this must be an exaggeration?

Yes, it is a case of misinformation.  The 17 July 1985 issue of the
New Jersey newspaper "The Star-Ledger" reported 

  &gt;The unidentified juveniles, arrested following an intensive
  &gt;computer theft probe by South Plainfield, county and federal
  &gt;authorities, also participated in elaborate schemes to steal
  &gt;merchandise using stolen credit card numbers and reprogrammed
  &gt;an American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) communications
  &gt;satellite to disrupt phone conversations on two continents,
  &gt;according to Prosecutor Alan A. Rockoff.

An article in the same paper two days later, on 19 July 1985 reported

  &gt;The seven, who are strangers to each other but communicated
  &gt;regularly on part of a nationwide computer "billboard" network
  &gt;for hobbyists, are accused of stealing computer informational
  &gt;services, stealing telephone services, disrupting satellite
  &gt;communications and exchanging information on how to make
  &gt;explosives and tap into Pentagon and defense contractors over
  &gt;coded phone lines.

Time magazine reported on July 29, 1985 (p 65)

  &gt;The New Jersey episode assumed heroic proportions when
  &gt;Middlesex County Prosecutor Alan Rockoff reported that the
  &gt;youths, in addition to carrying on other mischief, had been
  &gt;"changing the positions of satellites up in the blue heavens."
  &gt;That achievement, if true, could have disrupted telephone and
  &gt;telex communications on two continents.  Officials from AT&amp;T
  &gt;and Comsat hastily denied that anything of the sort had taken
  &gt;place.  In fact, the computers that control the movement of
  &gt;their satellites cannot be reached by public phone lines.  By
  &gt;week's end the prosecutor's office was quietly backing away
  &gt;from its most startling assertion, but to most Americans, the
  &gt;satellite caper remained real . . .

This New Jersey case is not very "recent", but seems to be the one 
being referred to.  If anyone knows of another more recent New Jersey
"satellite caper", please fill me in.

How does this jive with a vaguely remembered NPR article of last week

social security database is searched for draft-age candidates and
those registered with the selective service are subtracted out.  All
this despite existing laws that state SSN's are to be used only for
social security and not as a identification number.  Unfortunately,
few people know the law only states you have the right to refuse to
give your SSN and must instead be assigned some other ID number (which
presumably would be different for each service and prevent this type
of abuse).  If you "voluntarily" give your SSN, you essentially waive
your privacy rights.  The only service I have dealt with that treated
my refusal to give my SSN as a normal operation was the Massachusetts
Registry (I won't bore the list with a diatribe on its faults which
far outweigh this one feature).  Most services simply will refuse to
deal with you when you decline to give your SSN, whether they
understand the law or not.

  Ross Patterson:
&gt; The preferred form is to limit the request to those suspected of
&gt; committing a crime, as in "No persons without a TV License may own a TV
&gt; set, therefore all persons whose homes openly sport a TV antenna and who
&gt; do not own a TV License should be searched."  This, of course, means
&gt; that the database cross-match provides the police with no additional
&gt; homes to be searched, since they still must identify the homes in
&gt; question by some criminal criteria.

It's a little more complicated than that, though:  My understanding is
that it is possible to detect the use of a TV set from outside the
house.  Is it then permissible for the authorities to use the database
cross-match to identify houses to check (since the check does not
involve a search)?  Or is that the fruit of the poisoned tree?

Disclaimer: this information came to me third-hand.  Bear this in mind.
This happened several years ago.

A friend once told me that his parents had been threatened with court action
for not having a television licence, when they did not have a television.
They protested to the licensing authorities, which backed down
apologetically.  It looked as though everyone in town who didn't have a
licence was being threatened.

This could have been a mere clerical mistake, of course.

Buried near the bottom of the daily report of Credit Markets on page
29 of the Friday, October 1, Wall Street Journal is the following
intriguing paragraph:

  "The rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other
  overnight, averaged 7.6%, down from 8.38%, according to Fulton
  Prebond (U.S.A.) Inc.  At one point Wednesday, the rate was as high
  as 30% because of a computer problem, the Fed said."

That one somehow sounds a little scarier than usual.  Does anyone have
any facts?

A short blurb in today's paper reports that the Pac Bell computers logged
over 300,000 phone calls in the six minutes after the earthquake.  The
system appears to have degraded gracefully under the excessive load - the
only problems reported were delays in getting a dial tone.

     A recent message in the RISKS Forum raises an issue that I think needs
more careful discussion.  The opinion expressed was similar to many I've
heard in the last few years, in its complaint that people regard the theft
and disruption of computer services more tolerantly than theft and vandalism
of "other forms of property."

     I think such opinions are based on the mistaken belief that society and
the law regard the property holder's rights as absolute and final.  I'm not
a lawyer or a serious student of social mores, but it's obvious to me that
both law and society recognize that a property holder has an obligation to
take reasonable measures to prevent tresspass, vandalism, and theft.

     Society in general has little sympathy for people who are careless with
their property, as many system administrators have sometimes been.  An
administrator who accidentally publishes all his user passwords (something
that I've actually seen happen!) is certainly like a person who absent
mindedly leaves his front door unlocked.
     
     Providers of computer services are right to be frustrated with the
slugish way judges and legislators apply existing moral and legal concepts
to the new technology.  But they should be aware that existing legal concepts 
are not entirely on their side.  Consider the laws of easment, for example.

     They should also not pay excessive attention to the arguments of
defense attorneys, whose jobs obligate them to take a very narrow view of
these problems.
     
     None of this excuses the Matt and Ally fans who think that fouling up a
Big Corporation's operations is just a fun prank.  And it certainly doesn't
justify more serious forms of hooliganism and brigandage. But system
administrators should not feel that society is giving them a special bum deal.

In RISKS DIGEST 5.41, Richard.S.D'Ippolito@sei.cmu.edu writes: 

  " . . . the defense attorney's comments on motives make me wonder when, if
  ever, the view of computer crimes will merge with society's view of other
  property crimes: we have laws against breaking and entering...

I think we all agree with the fundamental premise, i.e. that information
is a form of property and is entitled to the same protection as any
other form of property.  However, there is a difference between
information property and tangible property that complicates the issue
and may be responsible for much  of the confusion in  society's view and
the ambiguity in current law.

To extend the analogy, in real property ("real" as in "real estate") the
law makes a clear distinction between "fully private" property and
"places of public accommodation."  (I may not have the legal terms
right, but you get the idea.)  I'm allowed to walk at will through a
shopping mall, for example, even if I have no intention of buying
anything.  I can come in out of the rain, use the rest rooms, sit on a
bench and warm up, and not be subject to prosecution for breaking and
entering.  The "resources" that I use, bench space, warm air, rest
rooms, etc. are "saleable items" in the sense that the mall owner has to
pay for them, and recovers that cost in rent from merchants.

On the other hand I can't simply walk into your house at will.  Not even
if you leave the door wide open.  Furthermore, your house doesn't have
to have a sign saying "private property" on it.  If I did that, I would
be subject to charges of trespassing, illegal entry, and burglary, or at
least attempted burglary.  You wouldn't be required to show that you had
taken any special measures of protection, let alone had "perfect
security."  It is assumed that everyone knows that a house is private
property and furthermore it  is assumed that everyone is capable of
recognizing a house. 

That's the point.  Through long custom and usage, we have all come to be
aware of the distinction between private places and places of public
accommodation.  The key phrase here is "long custom and usage."  The
problem that we face with computer security is that society has not yet
had a chance to form a conceptual model of the distinction of what is or
is not a private information resource.  The era of the widely accessible
computer is hardly ten years old.

Education is one part of the process.  One of the functions of the
security measures that we computer operations people take must be in a
sense educational.  People who literally don't know any better, because
they've never been taught, must be told, in one way or another, "Look
here, this is private.  Keep out."  Schools, government, etc., have a
responsibility, too, of course, but ultimately, computer professionals
have the greatest stake and must accept the fact that we must take the
lead.  Some day, the view of computer crimes will indeed merge with
society's view of other property crimes, but we better face the fact
that it may not be soon.

    The recent talk in this group about cross-correlating public
databases for questionable purposes reminds me of the method used to
catch insider trading on the NYSE.

    Above "the floor" is a computer room that constantly monitors the
movements of stocks.  If a stock moves up or down more that a certain
percentage of its selling price in a given day, or if more shares
trade hands than normal, an alarm sounds.  The analysts then
cross-correlate that stock with all available press releases, wire
service reports, and stock offerings to try to determine if there is a
valid reason for this movement.  If no reason can be determined, the
incident gets investigated further.  The buying and selling
stockholders get cross-correlated with the members of the board and
all employees of the company in question.  They also cross-correlate
all known data about the parties in question: club memberships,
professional societies, civic organizations, to try to determine if
any contact was likely.  If these joins come up positive, the case
gets investigated by old-fashioned "legwork."  The above information
was related in an NPR story as the insider trading scandal was
breaking a while back.

    I have long suspected that if "big brother" were to come into
being, it wouldn't be created by the government.  The government is
far to big, slow, and open to public inspection.  If "big brother" is
to be created, it will probably be done by private enterprise, as
above.  But it's not just the "big-wigs" of the NYSE.  It's you and me
being cross-correlated as below:

    There are companies known as "list brokers."  These companies buy
and sell names and addresses.  Everyone notices that once you get on
one "junk mail" list, you soon get mail from a plethora of other
organizations.  Your name has been brokered.  All types of
organizations from credit-card companies to non-profit fund raisers
buy and sell lists.  The price depends on the quality of the name,
from a cent or so for inactive names to upwards of a dollar a name for
high quality lists.  The average is about 10 to 15 cents.  How do the
most profitable companies make money?  By cross-correlating.  One of
the largest list brokers has taken the census information and run
cluster analysis on a wide range of socio-economic scales.  The result
is a clustering of the nation into 17 groups.  These have colorful
names like the "pickups and shotguns" cluster, and the "money and
brains" cluster.  Now suppose a shotgun shell maker wants to drop a
direct-mail piece to new prospects.  What kind of list should he buy?
The list broker pulls up the "pickups and shotguns" profile and
determines that a greater than average number of people in that
segment also own electric freezers, so they sell the shell maker a
list of names of people who returned warranty cards for freezers.
Viola!  Everyone makes money: the freezer manufacturer who sold the
freezers, then sold the names to the broker, the broker who re-sold
the names at a mark-up (the value added being the cross- correlation
he ran) and the shell maker who stands to sell more shells than to an
unqualified list.

    Add another wrinkle: the intelligent set-top cable converter.
This is an individually addressed converter used for "pay per view"
cable.  You see a good movie will be on HBO tonight.  You call your
cable company.  They turn on HBO for you house tonight so you can
see RAMBO or whatever.  Thus they collect information on you as to
who wants to see what movie.  Another new feature is the "people-meter."
At 8:07 p.m. tonight, the central cable computer sends out a "poll"
message.  The set-top captures what channel it's currently tuned to
and over the next 24 hours, all the little set-tops report back to
the home office.  This can go into the database as well.  It's only
a matter of time until this information is merged with the list-brokers
profile.  Now we have a complete demographic profile of your household:
Area of town, cost of house, number of incomes, favorite TV shows, 
most recent major purchases, etc., etc.

    I claim if "big brother" is to be, it will come from the private
sector for marketing reasons, motivated by profit.  There is legislation
in the works to prevent the cable companies from selling information.
But will the set-tops encrypt the data they send?  If not, a simple
passive tap could generate reams of data.  The potential for invasion
of privacy is large here, simply because of the scale of the mailing
list and cable systems.  Also by the nature of the beast, the
correlations are done on a huge scale, hence only approximate in many
cases, so the potential for mismatches is large.

Detecting a TV inside a house is easy, and is a process that has been refined
over the years to cope with such things as multiple occupancy and high-rise
flats etc. I have also heard of people being sent letters about TV licences
when they had no TV, but I don't think they were any more threatening than
your average government letter. I would doubt very much that the search for
licence evasion is as simplistic as has been suggested - the impression I get
is that the letters sent by mistake tend to be caused by people with no TV
moving into a new house where the previous occupant did have one. I would
suspect that the address is a more important part of the check than the
occupant, rather like some credit validation schemes, where information
concerning previous occupants can blight you for up to 6 years - I got caught
by this recently, and to add insult to injury, the information was not even
correct! The previous occupant had been summonsed AFTER he had vacated out
house, but for some reason was still listed as being at our address...however
the companies involved sorted this out very fast and very politely.

My parents (who do not have a TV) get  a letter every year  stating that
they do not hold a license and then giving  a list of reasons as  to why
this may be so (just bought the TV, forgotten it expired, etc).  Nowhere
on this note does it suggest the possibility that they  don't have a TV!
This letter can only be being generated by cross-matching  some "list of
everyone" with a "TV license-holders list", as they  have  had the house
from new in  1961 and have  never  had  a  TV  in that  time.   [I can't
remember when  radio licenses were  subsumed into TV licenses and waived
for the non-TV 1% of the population; I'm too young :-)]

I don't know how easy it is to detect TV's from a distance (though I suspect
anything using heterodyning is detectable from the emissions from the IF
oscillator), but I recall a story about detecting satellite-TV thieves:

The satellite TV company drove down a street with a RF signal analyzer
and detected the emissions from rooftop dishes.  Each house with a dish
tuned to the (im)proper frequencies was sent a harsh letter describing the
(fairly accurate, in this case) evidence against them.  Apparently this
was effective (partially it was a publicity-motivated crackdown, the satellite
company wanting to show that they could catch "signal-stealers").

Last election in 1986 several cities in Holland used voting machines in
order to keep a count of the votes for the candidates of the various
parties.

It appeared that several voters were confused by the lay-out of the buttons
and inadvertently choose the wrong candidate by pushing the button at the
wrong side of the candidate's name.  This was discovered in the little
village of Katwijk because suddenly a conspicuous great amount of people
voted for a very left-wing party (whereas in other years the vast majority
votes for the very right-wing "Gereformeerde Partij").

military, on financial affairs, on privacy and civil liberty, on  the  medical
and educational professions, and on commerce and business.

The aim of the  symposium  is  to  consider  these  influences  in  a  social,
economic,  and  political  context as well as a technical one.  The directions
and  implications  of  current  computing  technology,  including   artificial
intelligence  and  other  areas,  make attempts to separate science and policy
unrealistic.  We therefore solicit papers that directly address the wide range
of  ethical  and  moral  questions that lie at the intersection of science and
policy.

Within this broad context,  we  request  papers  that  address  the  following
suggested  topics.   The  scope of the topics includes, but is not limited to,
the sub-topics listed.

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS                      DEFENSE APPLICATIONS

  Ethical Issues in Computing Research     AI and the Conduct of War
  Sources and Effects of Research Funding  Limits to the Automation of War
  Responsible Software Development         Automated Defense Systems

COMPUTING IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY        COMPUTERS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST

  Community Access                         Computing for the Handicapped
  Computerized Voting                      Resource Modeling
  Civil Liberties                          Arbitration and Conflict Resolution
  Risks of the New Technology              Software and the Professions
  Computing and the Future of Work         Software Safety

Submissions will be read  by  members  of  the  program  committee,  with  the
assistance  of  outside referees.  The program committee includes Steve Berlin
(MIT), Jonathan Jacky (U. WA), Richard Ladner (U. WA),  Bev  Littlewood  (City
U., London) Nancy Leveson (UCI), Peter Neumann (SRI), Luca Simoncini (U.Reggio
Calabria, Italy), Lucy Suchman (Xerox PARC), Terry  Winograd  (Stanford),  and
Elaine Weyuker (NYU).

Complete papers, not exceeding 6000 words, should include an abstract,  and  a
heading  indicating  to  which  topic  it  relates.  Reports on in-progress or
suggested directions for future work will be given  equal  consideration  with
completed work.  Submissions will be judged on clarity, insight, significance,
and originality.  Papers (4 copies) are due by  April  1,  1988.   Notices  of
acceptance  or rejection will be mailed by June 1, 1988.  Camera ready copy is
due by July 1, 1988.  Send papers to Professor Nancy Leveson, ICS  Department,
University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717.

Proceedings will be distributed at the symposium, and will be available during
the  1988  AAAI  conference.   The  DIAC-87 proceedings are being published by
Ablex.  Publishing the DIAC-88 proceedings is planned.  The program  committee
will  select a set of submitted papers to be considered for publication in the
Communications of the ACM.

    [For those of you on BITNET, you should be aware of the instructions for 
    the automatic self-maintaining mailing list indirection (which apparently 
    is going to change in the near future).  PLEASE DO NOT send any mail to 
    the designated RISKS address except the properly formatted SUBSCRIBE and 
    UNSUBSCRIBE messages.   All other messages get rebroadcast to the BITNET 
    RISKS community, and then I get complaints...  Instructions upon request,

    Update on the new forwarding when available.  PGN]

It seems that computers indeed aren't flawless - especially as regards
automated redistribution of the RISKS Digest on BitNet.  For several weeks
(ever since I subscribed, in fact) I have been getting various messages,
none of which has to do with RISKS (mostly subscription requests &amp;c).
Wondering if something was amiss, I sent a message to the address used for
BITNET subscription.  Much to my surprise, when I logged in several days
later, I found 12 messages waiting for me.  They were typically from people
experiencing the same difficulties, but two held the key to the problem.

It seems that the address for BITNET subscription/distibution has a very
limited intellect.  If it receives mail of the proper for (ADD ...  or
DELETE ...), it is processed.  Any other mail is assumed to be a RISKS
issue, and is distributed to the subscribers.  Needless to say, my query was
treated as a RISKS Issue, and was subsequently distributed.

Remailed-By: ckk+@andrew.cmu.edu (Chris Koenigsberg)

   WASHINGTON -- The IRS acknowledged that last summer it accidentally
placed a lien against President and Mrs. Reagan. 

   The error, by a trainee in the Austin, Texas, IRS district, followed
a demonstration of the agency's electronic lien system. Despite an IRS
policy against using the names of real people in training, an instructor
used the Reagans as a hypothetical example. 

   Later, when the trainee was practicing, she pushed the wrong button,
accidentally filing a lien of $338.85 at the Travis County courthouse
in Austin. The incident was recently reported in the Kiplinger Tax Letter.

   Although the lien was discovered and rescinded, it will remain a permanent
entry in the Travis County Court records because the courthouse doesn't
routinely remove a record of a lien even after it's been lifted. But
the IRS notice releasing the lien also remains part of the record. 

   Since the entry had assigned the Reagans a fictitious address and
Social Security numbers, "there was never any real danger of a real lien
being filed," said an IRS spokesman. 

   Ellen Murphy, IRS public affairs director, said the IRS has taken
steps to prevent a repeat occurrence, "including appropriate disciplinary
action where needed."

[Response from Jeffrey to my message to him regarding the ARPANET collapse,
article by Eric Rosen, Software Engineering Notes 6 1, January 1981.  PGN]

Extremely interesting, and personally relevant.  I wrote the "RELAY" package
for Bitnet which is essentially a distributed message service of real-time
interactive messages as opposed to mail.  A "chat" if you prefer the
Compuserv example, only there are multiple Relays across a broad geographic
area (Bitnet is store-and-forward).  Each Relay services users in its local
area, and exchanges messages with its neighbors, who exchange redistribute
locally and further send to neighbors, etc.  It's a very simple flooding
algorithm since it is a closed network with no loops.

At any rate, a missing edit check and an innovative student discovered
that Relay allowed him to sign on to channel "1.0"; the code is written
in a high-level language and it asserted 1.0 to be a whole number.  The
message packet was created and with the "1.0" channel prefix header and
was then flooded to the neighboring Relays to update their user tables.
With that done, it then goes back to a ready state, which is handled by
a front-end Assembler routine.  The assembly code tried to download the
user table, in the process tried to pack and convert to binary the "1.0"
value, which abended on an data exception.  Meanwhile, the neighbors
receive the update, flood it, and try to go ready.  Abend for same.
The net result:  36 Relays on 4 continents abended almost simultaneously.

Moral of the story:  If it's garbage in, eat it :-)           /Jeff/

We've heard much about computer crime for personal gain, about vandalism
committed by crackers out for kicks, and now "software warfare" in which a
superpower might attempt to undermine an opponent's warfighting capability by
sabotaging its software.  But has there been any discussion of real or
hypothetical civil disobedience by computer? 

A loose definition of "civil disobedience" might be nonviolent lawbreaking
by morally motivated individuals, often in what they perceive as obedience
to a "higher law" (e.g. constitutional or international law or a religious
or ethical principle).  A few famous examples of CD in the non-computer
world include Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of a bus, occupation
of power plants and weapons facilities by anti-nuclear protesters, and
"Plowshares" actions in which priests and nuns have destroyed components of
nuclear weapons.

It seems to me that as the computerization of society continues, the idea of
engaging in civil disobedience via computer is bound to come up more often. 
Some computer CD might resemble ordinary computer crime and sabotage except
for the motivation of the individuals carrying it out.  I've heard folklore
about politically motivated crackers for years now; do RISKS readers know of
any actual examples?

Other forms of civil disobedience might be engaged in by members of the
general public with no special expertise in computers, especially as
computerized communications systems become more pervasive.  For example,
rather than physically occupy a street or building, protesters might clog up
a computer network by engaging in bogus transactions.  (This has already been
done with telephone systems: reputedly some fundamentalist right
organizations have had to abandon their toll-free numbers after it became a
common pastime in certain gay and countercultural circles to call them up and
waste their money.  This was known as "the Falwell game.")

Like all civil disobedience, computer CD raises many ethical and tactical
questions.  Can anyone out there think of any particularly frightening or
promising scenarios for computer CD looming on the horizon?

I just discovered that the much-touted BSD4.3 release of Unix
silently truncates passwords to 8 characters.  I found this out
by having an easier time guessing a password for an account than
I thought I would -- because the user name had 8 characters and
the password was the user name with a suffix.

Let's get this info out to the user community... BEWARE!

 Teen computer 'hacker' to be tried as adult  (Page D1)
  By Lorraine Ahern -- Staff writer

 A Hanover youth who police claimed used a home computer to charge thousands
of dollars worth of electronic equipment to stolen credit card numbers will be
tried as an adult, a judge ruled yesterday.

 [NAME DELETED], 18, is accused of ordering more than $6,400 worth of computer
accessories and radar detectors, and having UPS deliver them to his family's
home address last summer.

 Circuit Court Judge Eugene Lerner granted a prosecutors request that [NAME
DELETED], who turned 18 last month, be charged and tried as an adult for
felony theft.

 "It's not a kid walking into a 7-Eleven and walking out with a Snickers bar
in his pocket," Assistant State's Attorney Eugene Whissel argued.  "It's a
mature crime for an adult --- a sophisticated crime."

... non-related discussion ...

 [NAME DELETED] mother said that [...] her son became depressed and "obsessed"
with the home computer he had set up in his bedroom.

 "Initially, I did think that it was good," said [his mother], who testified
that she was unaware of any UPS-credit card scheme.  "Getting him down to 
even eat with us ... he was on it all the time.  I knew it was not healthy.
I even took the plugs at times."

[He allegedly confessed that he got the equipment using an illegal MasterCard
number from a Brooklyn, NY computer contact through an electronic bulletin 
board.  The Secret Service is "already" being investigated by the Secret 
Service.]

During the same period last spring when state police began investigating
[NAME DELETED]' computer activities, police in Baltimore County arrested
a number of computer "hackers" in the Annapolis [MD] area and charged them
with gaining free illegal access to long-distance telephone service.

  'Hacker' pleads guilty  (page A13)
  By Lorraine Ahern -- Staff writer

 An Annapolis [MD] man pleaded guilty yesterday to stealing long-distance
telephone service using his home computer, which a judge ordered destroyed.

 In a case that began a year ago with raids on the homes of sever computer 
"hackers" in Annapolis and the Baltimore suburbs, J. Scott Meenen [...] pleaded
guilty to theft of service in Baltimore County Circuit Court.

 Meenen, a 28-year-old former audio-visual repairman [...], was put on
probation and ordered to pay back $477 to MCI Telecommunications for 
stolen long-distance service.

 Police claimed that Meenen had operated an electronic bulletin board known
to a circle of computer hackers as "The British Exchange."  Using an
automatic sequential dialing device, police said, the hackers would hit upon
MCI code numbers and then, sharing them on the bulletin board, use those 
numbers for free long-distance calls.

 MCI began to pick up on the unauthorized use of the codes through a 
switching station at Towson [MD (about 30 miles north of Annapolis], and
police ultimately traced the calls to computer telephone lines at several
addresses.

 MCI spokeswoman Pamela Small said yesterday[,] thefts that cost the 
long-distance carriers an estimated $500 million in 1986 alone have
decreased.

 Under Chesapeake &amp; Potomac's [local phone provider] gradual conversion
to "equal access," long-distance carriers such as Sprint or MCI will no
longer need to assign code numbers for customers to dial.

 Equal access, which Ms. Small said is now 80 percent complete, means
that the subscriber can simply dial the long-distance number itself, as
they would if they used AT&amp;T.

end of article
-----------------

Comments: During the 1987 National Computer Security Conference in Baltimore, 
Detective McCleod (sp?) of Arizona discussed that he likes to visit and
arrest youthful hackers when they turn 18.  This was based on a bad experience
in the court system for a case against a 14 year youth.  This youth was
successfully prosecuted and convicted to some community service and a 2 page,
hand-writted, double-spaced paper.  The "convicted" youth then demanded his
computer equipment back and got it.  He was not obligated to pay back the
fraud.  [I remember $14,000 but I could be wrong.]

 Maybe police and judicial activities like this will bring back the original
definition of "hacker".  

 If "equal access" reduces losses, maybe it's time to invest in those
companies.

"Computer Watch Aids Body ID     06-Oct-87   

   BLAUVELT, N.Y. (AP) - Police used a computerized wristwatch that had phone
numbers stored in its memory to identify a man whose body was found last week
in a park.  ...  State Police Inspector William Sprague said police tracked
down acquaintances of Bly's through his wristwatch, which had their telephone
numbers programmed into it." (remainder of article describes the death)

RISKS DIGEST was recently discussing implanted transmitters.  A computerized
wristwatch is not as threatening to one's privacy as an implanted transmitter.
But other personalized technology can pose threats to the users, or benefits to
society: A recent drug arrest near Minneapolis led to several more arrests
after police investigated a phone number from the memory of the drug dealer's
cellular phone.

These examples show the electronic equivalent of scraps of paper in pockets,
except that people are presently not usually aware of them nor know how to
alter them.

Medical technology with serial numbers can also be used for identification, at
least for dead people.  An anonymous live suspect with a surgical implant would
pose a dilemma, although there already have been court cases of evidence
(bullets) in living people.  Simple pacemakers with a serial number are already
numerous.  Near-future technology may cause more complications, such as a
computerized nerve replacement implant with a memory of recent motions (ie,
pulling a trigger or route recently walked).

Scot E. Wilcoxon, Data Progress     sewilco@DataPg.MN.ORG    +1 612-825-2607

(Peter: Pacemakers DO have serial numbers.  I called Medtronic and theirs
do.  I assume other manufacturers also have them in case of recall.)

This is in response to the recent discussion of TV licenses and Brent
Laminack's comments concerning "Big Brother".

One of the greatest guarantees of privacy is anonymity.  For example, there's
hardly a house made that absolutely can't be burgled, and most would be rather
trivial, and police and crime experts have often stated that the best pro-
tection is anonymity - looking less interesting than someone else.  Similarly,
were someone *really* interested in you and your habits it probably would
not have been difficult for them to learn a great deal about you - where you
live, work, shop, relax, etc.  But anonymity protected you, because it was
just too expensive to do this checking on a random basis with no justification.

That's all changing now, because simple operations on readily available data-
bases can find the needle (us) in the haystack of teeming masses with very
little expense.  And a degree of anonymity is lost.  Many of us are still
as indistinguishable as before, but not all.  Going back to the example of
burglary, the potential exists for some smart crooks to do some neat cross-
referencing of addresses of people who buy (or even read about) high-ticket
items that are small in size and easily fenceable (cameras, electronics,
jewelry, etc. - many readers of this group would probably qualify) and target
them.  Going one step further, they might eliminate from this list people
with burglar alarms or a high chance of owning a large dog, or come better
prepared for such contingencies.

One aspect of this that I find particularly disturbing is its affect on the
notion of "innocent until proven guilty".  Barring widespread, indescriminate
government harassment, one of your biggest protections against being hassled
by the government was your anonymity.  If you're just an average Joe, then
there's no reason for the government to suspect you of anything, gratuitously
assuming guilt until convinced otherwise.  There was no return on the invest-
ment from the government's standpoint.  Not anymore.  Now they can assume
you're guilty ("You don't have a TV license, and you must own a TV, therefore
you must be guilty of not obtaining a needed license".) in some subtle ways
in their uses of database cross-referencing, and get a pretty good return
on their (minimal) effort.

	Nic McPhee	(mcphee@ratliff.cs.utexas.edu)

    [Incidentally, for those of you wondering how you can detect whether
    someone's TV set is in use, read Peter Wright's SPYCATCHER.  It is easily
    available outside of the U.K., and I understand copies are creeping into
    Britain at a great rate.  PGN]

From The Wall Street Journal of October 13, 1987 page 47:

"But the DOT [Direct Order Transfer - a computer system that makes
large-scale stock trading faster and more efficient] system isn't
foolproof, either.  Mr. Nelson [whom the article is about] said he
heard a story about a man who pushed his DOT button intending to buy
one $25 million package of securities. When he didn't get a
confirmation of his order, he hit the button again, and then again and
again. A few minutes later, he received four confirmations showing
that he had just bought $100 million of stock."

The article itself is very interesting for those who are looking for
another view on a topic that has been discussed is RISKS for some time
- computer assisted stock trading and "program trading."

Only 17 categories of people!! That's not very sophisticated - Britain is
broken down into 45 distinct groups by one of the companies who sell mailing
lists. They have a very neat acronym for this system which eludes me at the
moment. They have also introduced a new system called "Monica" which
classifies people by their first names (Monica is a slang pun - I don't know
if it is meaningful in the US). The idea is actually very obvious - certain
first names are popular at certain times and don't get recycled at regular
intervals so having a first name like "Florence" tends to indicate that you
are older, whereas "Darren" is a younger person's name. I don't know how this
would apply in the US, but the short extracts I have seen are strikingly
accurate when compared with people I know. It does fall down on names like
"John" and "David" which are perennial favourites, and also on very unusual
names or he/she names like Lindsay of course.

Also on the subject of mailing lists, there was an interesting letter in the
Guardian from someone who received a batch of junk mail about investments,
expensive holidays and subscribing to the Tory party. The man has no money
and has been unemployed for 2 years. The letters started arriving six weeks
after he had a letter printed in the Times newspaper...
                                                             Lindsay

                [I wouldn't want to Harm Monica, but a moniker is a
                nickname, as is Nick, and Phil (Harmonica?).  PGN]

Nic McPhee's essay on anonymity reminded me of an innocent-looking way
that names and demographic information are entered into
frequently-merged databases:  the so-called "warranty registration"
cards that come with nearly everything that we buy.   What our sex, job,
age, and gross annual income have to do with validating the warranty on
a TV or a computer escapes me.  While government doesn't necessary get
ahold of these databases, shady characters in the private sector should
have no trouble posing as legitimate businesses and buying these
databases.

On a related note, and one not directly related to risks in computers
(sorry Peter), the British Government's use of "questionable" means of
searching for unlicensed TV receivers may not in fact be a violation
of THEIR law or traditions.  In many ways, the British system is far
less protective of an individual's rights than is ours in the U.S.

Yes,  yes,  I too get the annoying annual letter asking me why I haven't got a
licence for my non-existent  television.  I thought  everyone  did.  You can't
mean to say that some people have televisions?
    Surely  the greatest risk of all this information  refining is the risk to
the ego  of the  individual  who  thought  he was  unique,  or at least  in an
`elite'-sized  minority.  I mean,  I thought  I was  the only  bald,  bearded,
Methodist,  owner of a tandem  south  of the Trent;  what am I going  to think
when  I get  the  direct-mail  advertisment  for a hair  restorer  and a beard
trimmer  in with  my invitation  to a tandem  rally  from  the  church's  home
mission division?
    Perhaps there is some comfort here for Cliff Jones' original paranoia.  He
was originally bothered --  RISKS 5.38 --  by the suggestion that he was being
marked down as a potential lawbreaker and that someone might carelessly  treat
that as being the same as having a criminal  record.  I cannot yet conceive of
being in a mechanically-detectable  minority small enough for it to be safe to
make  wild  generalisations  about  us.  To be lumped  in with a large  enough
proportion of the population is not to be discriminated  against in any new or
unusual way.
    There are,  for example,  one in twenty of us (not 1%, as Ian Batten RISKS
5.42)  in the  UK without  haunted  goldfish-bowls  in  our  houses.  I forget
whether  that  is  5%  of  the  population,  or  5%  of households  --  we are
uncommonly likely to be one- or two-  person households,  so it is a different
proportion.  What is depressing is the number of us who seem to be in computer
science.                                                                    gj

In this issue of comp.risks you wrote . . .
&gt;(Peter: Pacemakers DO have serial numbers.  I called Medtronic and theirs
&gt;do.  I assume other manufacturers also have them in case of recall.)

	Why don't you drop us a line if you have questions about pacemakers.
I believe we are the only pacemaker company on the net right now. Currently
we are about #3 worldwide and growing. We currently have pacemakers with and
without serial numbers; they made be read electronically without explanting
the pacemaker. In general the trend in the future will be towards such
numbers. They are actually most useful for identifying whether we have a
problem with our manufacturing process. If we know the serial number of the
problem pacer, then we can identify which components when into it, and who
worked on it here. (All our pacemakers have serial numbers, but the older
one can be read only on the outside of the pacemaker. Our more complicated
pacemakers store their number electronically, which can be read by a
pacemaker programmer.  I work on pacemaker programmers.)  --

&gt; From:  Jack Holleran &lt;Holleran@DOCKMASTER.ARPA&gt;
&gt; Subject:  News Media about hackers and other comments 

&gt; MCI spokeswoman Pamela Small said yesterday[,] thefts that cost the long-
&gt; distance carriers an estimated $500 million in 1986 alone have decreased.

&gt; If "equal access" reduces losses, maybe it's time to invest in those
&gt; companies.

This is a very curious kind of loss.  If they stole $500 million dollars
in services, the company didn't lose $500 million, unless somehow they
were unable to provide $500 million dollars in service to someone else
as a result of the misappropriation of resources.  While there would be
some of that, I find it very difficult to believe that the real number
is even a significant fraction of that.  There are other real costs
associated with this sort of theft--loss of goodwill by the mischarged
party, accounting costs associated with rebalancing the books, etc--but
those are probably small as well.

In short, the companies have a vested interest in making their losses
appear as large as possible.  While they show a paper loss of $500
million to theft, all that was stolen was paper money that will not be
replaced if the theft ceases, and their revenues will not increase by an
appreciable amount.

Phone theft is not so much an economic problem as a social one.  The
phone companies pursue the legal aspects of it quite aggressively
because they want to prevent it from becoming widespread enough to do
actual damage, but they don't take obvious preventative measures to
prevent it or detect it earlier.  They don't, for example, look for
sudden large changes in service levels and flag them as suspicious.

--bob--

P.S. I heard the other day that the average driver commits about 10
traffic violations every mile here in California.  I'm looking forward
to the day when the CHP can track my car through its computers.

After reading Geof Cooper's posting on the password truncation problem,
I tried it on every Unix machine I could find.  Only the first 8
characters counted on any of them.  Here's the list:

       Machine            Operating System
     ----------         --------------------
      VAX 750              Ultrix 1.2
      VAX 8600             Ultrix 2.0-1
      VAX 750              Berkeley 4.3
      Celerity 1260D       Accel Unix 3.4.78
      IBM RT-PC            AIX 1.2
      Sun 3/160            3.0

Looks like this bug has been there for quite some time - maybe since
   the beginning.  Can you spell propagation?  Maybe this bug
   can be used for some copyright infringement suits?  I suppose
   all of the Unix-computer producing companies assumed this part
   of the code worked and didn't need looking at.  My guess is that
   there are actually few of us who use more than 8 characters anyway,
   so the implications are not as severe as it might seem, but it
   sure decreases the search time.  Where might the most serious
   implications of this be?  Unicos machines with classified data?
   Other defense machines?

Geof (no relation) expresses surprise that 4.3 Unix "silently" truncates
passwords to 8 characters.  Was this a secret?  Did not 4.2 and 4.1 do
the same?  I don't believe that there has been a 14-character password
since the days of the PDP-11.
                                              Brint

      [More importantly, any algorithmically generated password is easier
      to crack...  In this case, once you know more than one password, you 
      could easily infer the algorithm...  With my 7-character name, I get
      only one free character.  The password generating scheme Geof refers 
      to is much dumber than the 8-character truncation.  But it is nice to
      know about the truncation!  PGN]

In Risks Digest 5.43, I find:
&gt;It seems to me that as the computerization of society continues, the idea of
&gt;engaging in civil disobedience via computer is bound to come up more often. 
&gt;Some computer CD might resemble ordinary computer crime and sabotage except
&gt;for the motivation of the individuals carrying it out.  I've heard folklore
&gt;about politically motivated crackers for years now; do RISKS readers know of
&gt;any actual examples?

   I seem to recall a mention that the Berkeley computer center was
occupied by protesters sometime in the sixties, who claimed that the
computers were being used for war work.  A sit-in was staged, as well 
as the damage of some equipment and a large number of tapes.  I don't
know precisely if any significant damage was done.

   On a slightly more current note, a couple of years back, a student
who was upset with the student government policies here at Georgia
Tech formed an organization called the Barbecue Liberation Front
(the gripe, as I recall, had something to do with a cancelled cookout),
which among other things froze the student government accounts, and
sent messages to all users each second on one of the undergraduate 
class machines, making it unusable.

   This is as close to political motivation as I have ever seen on
the Tech campus.  Although it may be a rather pitiful example, it is
as political as anything ever gets in a place where Poly Sci profs
refer to the Washington Post as an "anarchist rag."

different computer than the return for credit base and they don't talk
to each other). The only (simple) way to clear this was to pay the
rental data base people for the item, even though the sales data base
people had already been paid by return of the item.

Prentiss Riddle brought up the topic of computer civil disobedience.  The
example of Falwell is an excellent one, and I believe that some
organizations have thought about this type of blocking both for offense and
defense.  First, the organizations that are really worth blocking typically
don't have dial-in access.  Second, some "good organizations" might be
`blocked' by those with differing opinions (creationists blocking science
BBSs?).  But the real reason I wanted to send you this is to point out that
some bureaucratic organizations like the FBI and Service Service take dim
views of civil disobedience, partly this is because of their mission.

Recently, a Vietnam Viet lost his legs to a train in an act of civil
disobedience at the Concord Naval Weapons Station.  All parties agree
this is a tragic act.  If anyone is going to embark on computer
civil disobedience, they had better think about all possible consequences
INCLUDING getting shot.  The people who work for the SS and FBI may
not know computers very well, but computers are increasingly used in
criminal capacities.  At the time of suspicion, they (their perspective)
might not have the time to evaluate, but might run into a building with
guns drawn when there are only teenagers there.  The situation for them
is something similar to the issue of Toy Guns; it's that WE see the
situation from a different perspective.  Softwar is a real possibility
for these people (even though they may not be aware of it, now).

One of the risks of computers we have not discussed is the "evil" unintended
(and non-military) uses of computers.  One BBS in the Bay Area (noted as a
headline story) was a neo-Nazi BBS.  Dan Pasquale of the Fremont PD is most
concerned with the BBSs of pedophiles.  More likely than not there are
neo-Nazis and pedophiles reading RISKs, so "evil" is a minority perspective.
The problem becomes discriminating between crime and liberties, disobedence
versus threat [sorry, I lost the "real" word].

I don't wish to defend the actions of what I regard as an increasingly
police-state mentality of the country (it's largely, "WE" the people
who are pushing this BTW), but I do wish to avoid severed legs and
teenagers shot by carrying laser tag pistols.

Are US Navy aviators at risk from Phalanx systems on their own ships?  I
mention this because I noticed that aircraft carriers have Phalanx guns
mounted at the stern of the ships - in a perfect position to shoot at
aircraft approaching a carrier for a landing.  I noticed this while
glancing at a Varian advertisement on page 2 of the Oct. 87 issue of
Defense Electronics.

I think it is time we put this notion to rest once and for all.
How can you say that is the only legal use for the SSN when I was just
required by law to get my daughter (8 yrs old) a SSN and I will have to
include that number on MY income tax return from now on.  Now, unless
they have revoked the child labor laws, she is unlikely to need that 
number, for Social Security purposes, for at least 9 more years. :-)

With the Dow losing 508 points today (down 22.6% from 2247) and 744 points
since the beginning of last week, please be on the lookout for any careful
analyses of the extent to which computers were involved in setting off and
extenuating the crash -- e.g., computer-programmed selling, rapid
responsiveness of the computer systems (despite the delays in the tickers),
trying to optimize locally, etc.  (No speculations, please.)  Certainly, margin
calls and the human tendency toward fear and panic in that kind of a crisis
contributed to an extremely unstable feedback loop.  But let's see if we can
identify precisely what roles the computers played, for better or for worse.

Also, I hope one of our European readers will follow up on any further
reports that computer systems have been partially blamed for the failure of
weather predicters to warn about the once-in-a century hurricane-force storm
that blew through England and Western Europe on 16 October 1987.  Apparently
predicters still did not have a clue even after the winds (which reached up
to 110 mph!) had begun.  But the home secretary said it would be unfair to
blame the forecasters -- the wind shifted suddenly and sped up unexpectedly.

The truncation of UNIX passwords to 8 characters is not a bug, it's a
feature.  If you have source, examine the code to libc/gen/crypt.c.

Your password is *not* actually encrypted on UNIX.  Rather, it is used
as the *key* to encrypt a standard block of text (a block of zeros,
although this is irrelevant) using a modified version of the DES
algorithm.  The result of this encryption is what is usually called
your "encrypted password".

The keys for DES are 56 bits long.  8 characters, at 7 bits per
character, makes 56 bits.  There's no point in using characters after
that, since you can't put them into the key.

It seems to me this isn't that serious; if I choose a password you're going
to guess easily, chances are the length isn't going to matter -- guesses
made on names, birthdates, etc. are not based on length, but based on other
criteria.  Using a list of about 2000 proper names I have, only 9% of those
names are longer than 8 characters.  Birthdates (mmddyyyy) are eight
characters long.  Phone numbers are 7 digits, unless you add area codes
(although if you use *your* area code, the cracker now has 3 characters of
your password...).

The only thing truncation makes easier is exhaustive search generating
passwords like "aaaa", "aaab", "aaac", etc.  Even with only 8 characters,
that would take a *long* time...  (although you could do it on a Cray, I
guess).  SSNs are 9 characters long, but the number of 9-digit permutations
of 10 digits is still small enough to make exhaustive search reasonably
trivial.

Recent issues of Risks have mentioned juvenile hackers who perpetrated com-
puter crimes.  One youth's computer was destroyed, by court order.  A reader
felt that was inappropriate.  I disagree.  It should have a significant 
deterrent effect.  

In the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia there is a judge who orders that con-
victed poachers' guns be destroyed, and that the poachers watch.  When I met
the judge (socially!) I suggested that they be sold as confiscated goods 
rather than being destroyed.  He replied that the poachers were emotionally 
involved with their possessions, and that destruction was far more effective
than mere confiscation.  

After 14 years of hiking and hunting in his jurisdiction, meeting people who
lived in that area, I have to agree with him... and with the judge who 
ordered the computer destroyed.    Perhaps both judges are Gilbert and 
Sullivan fans.

Prentiss Riddle raises the possibility of using computers for civil
disobedience or protest.  I remember reading a few months ago about a person
who was really upset at one of the fundamentalist religous organizations
(Falwell's) and programmed his PC to use its auto-dialer to call their
toll-free number, wait 30 seconds, hang up and call again.  The article in
the paper was because he had been arrested and his equipment confiscated,
although it was not clear to me what law he had violated.          jim

   [... Mention of the Falwell case...]

  As an aside, and not a risk, to my mind, You might be amused to know that
one of the Michigan State Representatives (Perry Bullard) operates a
conference on a large computer bulletin board in his district.  Along with
answering questions from the BBs'ers, he posts the text of various bills he
is introducing, and accepts the comments of the readers.  On a couple of
occasions, I think he modified the bill after reading the reactions of the
folks.
  At this point, he is selecting for a small segment of  the voters he 
represents, but as more and more households acquire modems, this might
make our system more of a democracy than it's been since all the voters
in a town could attend one meeting.  
  Of course, as reading the Net shows, you also get a lot more noise...

   RISKS the dangers of overly instant reaction to events.  But there are also
   denial of service issues, flooding with bogus computer-generated messages

   computer-generated mass mailings sent by special-interest groups, etc.  PGN]

I think the notion of civil disobedience needs some clarification:

While the term "civil disobedience" is full of ambiguities, I believe the
most common use is to describe _public acts of protest_.  Thus the lunch
counter sit-ins, the Concord Naval Base protest, the Women's Peace Encampment
protests at Romulus, the Berrigan's blood-drenched draft files, draft card
burnings, etc.  Such acts are carried out after much consideration of the
consequences, and are planned to have an impact on public opinion.  This
is not to say that these acts always take place in a glare of publicity;
often it is hoped that a long series of such acts will draw attention and
perhaps convince some of the public of the conviction of the protestors.

Computer break-ins and BBS/800 number flooding are normally private actions.
If they were performed publicly, they would have little effect of the sort
the protestor would like: a hacker pounding away at his computer doesn't
make for high drama.

In <A HREF="/Risks/5.44.html">RISKS-5.44</A>, Scott Dorsey (kludge@pyr.gatech.edu) writes:
&gt;   I seem to recall a mention that the Berkeley computer center was
&gt;occupied by protesters sometime in the sixties, who claimed that the
&gt;computers were being used for war work.  A sit-in was staged, as well 
&gt;as the damage of some equipment and a large number of tapes.  I don't
&gt;know precisely if any significant damage was done.

I've been here for a little over three years, and I've always found it
curious that, in general, the users here have little or no idea where the
machine rooms are.  They're not really hidden, but their locations aren't
really advertised, either.  I don't know if that's a reaction to what Scott
mentioned, or not.  To my knowledge, there aren't any "showcase" machine
rooms; you know, the "glass cages" we all love to hate...

The EECS building at Berkeley (Cory Hall) has a fancy card-key system to
control access to critical areas (machine rooms, labs, and such), and to the
building itself after hours, apparently installed after a grad student was
injured when he opened a package found lying in a terminal room that turned
out to be a bomb.  Getting around the system is fairly easy; you just stick
your head into the terminal rooms _outside_ the controlled zone and shanghai
someone you know who has a card for a few seconds.

The building in which most of the CS division and the Computer Center are
located (Evans Hall, along with the Math Dept., Stat Dept., and several
others) is also supposedly locked up after hours.  It doesn't have a
card-key system like Cory; they just lock things up.  In theory, you can get
to the terminal and printer rooms in the basement, but not to the rest of
the building.  In practice, once you get to the basement, you can get to the
rest of the building.

At Stanford, on the other hand, in order to get to the comp center staff
offices, you have to go _through_ the machine room -- the door is wide open.

I don't know how much of this is "justified", and how much of it is just 
bureaucratic paranoia.  How "secure" are other academic and commercial
comp centers?  Is Berkeley the only campus to try the "security through 
obscurity" approach, rather than showcasing their toys?  Have there been
any cases of terrorist or political attacks on comp centers?  We're
all used to considering the electronic access considerations of computer
security (networks, dialups, etc.) here; how about the physical 
considerations?  How many of you have no idea where the machines you
use are physically located?  How many of you don't even know exactly
what type of machine you use (for example, is your VAX a 750, a 780, or
a 785?)?  Is the unawareness of the details of the underlying hardware
becoming more or less prevalent, and is that good or bad?

This should give us all some food for thought...

&gt; I think we all agree with the fundamental premise, i.e. that information
&gt; is a form of property and is entitled to the same protection as any
&gt; other form of property.

Absolutely *NOT*!!!  I know of no one who thinks (e.g.) that their
house, their car, their wallet and their Unix files (or their IBM-PC
software) are entitled to *the same* protection.

The significant difference between information and "real" property is
that if you steal real property, your victim is denied access to that
property; whereas if you "steal" information, your victim still has hir
copy of it, and may not even notice the "theft".  That is why the word
"steal" is no longer appropriate in this context.

What *I* think many of us agree on (except R.M.Stallman, of course) is
that information is a form of property and is entitled to *some*
protection.  What our linguistic, ethical and legal systems have not
yet come to cope with is just what sort of protection information is
entitled to, and what sort is feasible.

My new explanation why computers sometimes do random unexplicable
things.  (replacing my previous, "sun spots").

[about the first sentient system] ... and she amused herself by
planning, and sometimes carrying out, malicious computer failures and
data losses in order to watch the humans flail about helplessly like
ants around a crumpled hill.

Excerpted from the 'Los Angeles Times', Tuesday, Oct. 20, 1987:

  PORTFOLIO INSURANCE MAY HAVE WORSENED SELLOFF, TRADERS SAY
                 By Michael A. Hiltzik

In December, 1986, New York Stock Exchange Chairman John J. Phelan warned a
Washington audience that a new form of computerized stock and futures trading 
known as portfolio insurance could someday lead to "financial meltdown."

The markets laughed him off.... [T]here are strong indications that
computerized portfolio insurance programs inspired the snowballing waves
of selling during the market's catastrophic collapse.  The impact of
portfolio insurance programs on the market's epic fall Monday and last
week cannot be precisely gauged.  But estimates place the amount of
assets "protected" by the programs ... at as much as $61 billion.

Because of the mechanics of portfolio insurance, a significant portion
of that pool of cash was poised before last week to begin marching, all
at once, in a single direction: down....  [T]he leading insurance
technique involves selling not stocks, but related stock-index futures,
and using the porceeds to offset stock losses.  As the selling waves hit
the futures markets, they drive futures prices down, which in turn drag
stock prices down....

Even people who sell portfolio insurance acknowledged that the technique
is probably a leading villain of the market collapse -- and what's more,
failed to protect clients from the lossses they thought they would
avoid.  Portfolio insurance firms all use somewhat different computer
models to dictate trading for clients; some were apparently more
successful than others in protecting clients from losses this week and
last week.  But all showed they had devastating shortcomings, [Preston
W. Estep, head of a leading portfolio insurance firm] said....

[discussion of the past warnings and fears about the growing
interrelationship between future and stock markets]

Program traders... have often been blamed for exacerbating the sharp
stock price moves of the last few years because their computer programs
are designed to order the sale or purchase of millions of dollars of
stocks in the blink of an eye.  Portfolio insurers add another bias to
that system: one that encourages sharp downturns.

[detailed discussion of one scheme:  "dynamic hedging" developed by
University of California, Berkeley business professors Hayne Leland and
Mark Rubenstein]

More important than clients' individual losses, however, is the way
portfolio insurance tends to magnify market slumps.  Because the
clients' concerted selling forces futures prices down, that attracts
investors who strive to make money from the difference in price between
the futures and their related stocks.  In roughly simultaneous
transactions, they buy the futures and sell the corresponding stocks.
In turn, that forces stock prices further down, which kicks in more
insurance-related sales in the futures markets, and so on.

From the Times, London, 20th October 1987:

Computer Horizons, Jobscene, by Darrell Ince,
Prof of Computer Science, Open University, UK.

`The new Consumer Protection Act, which comes into force next year, could
provide a number of headaches for British software developers. At the same
time, it is also likely to result in an increase in both job opportunities and
salaries for one neglected area of software engineering -- quality assurance.

 Until the new law takes effect anybody who is injured because of an
error in a software product has to carry out the difficult process of
establishing fault on the part of the company which supplied the product.

 Once it comes into force all that will be required is to establish a
casual link between the injury suffered and a defect in the software product.

 This puts immense pressure on software companies to make sure that
their software is correct.  ...

[The article goes on to mention the techniques which quality assurance
specialists can use including...] one American concept...the Black
Team. This is a collection of hackers whose function is to try and make
a completed software system crash. 

[Prof Ince suggests that...] ...the bulk of companies...still take a
relatively relaxed view of software quality.

 The new law will change this, and, if as expected, companies start
becoming directly liable for software products, then there should be a
massive expansion which, initially, may not be meet be current levels
of staffing. ...

[The article concludes] ...I think we can all excuse current software
quality practitioners their broad grin as they read the newspaper
accounts of the problems that British software houses will face over
the next three years.'

Any comments?                    [Had any jobscene phone calls lately?  PGN]

I don't know how it played in the national media, if at all, but the
telephone systems in the five midwestern states surrounding Minneapolis/St.
Paul were essentially thrown continuous strikes for three hours yesterday
(Saturday) morning.

After some minor skirmishes in the lines where the local tickets (i.e.,
non series ticket holders, non-bigwigs, etc.) for the first two games
of the World Series had been sold earlier in the week, the sole ticket
franchisee (one of the local major department store chains) decided to
make things more pleasant by selling the 10,000 local tickets for games
six and seven by taking orders over the phone.  The number to call,
which was staffed by 35 operators, was announced at 0755AM Saturday on
the local television and radio stations, some of which cover a good part
of five states (North and South Dakota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota.)
200,000 calls an hour were attempted to that number until the last
ticket was sold at about 11:00 AM.  Most phone exchanges in the area
were for all practical purposes shut down by the overload.

The news reports weren't very specific about how bad the delays were
where, but did mention that the effects were spread over the five-state
area.  I was unable to get a dial tone during the entire period.  911
service was useless -- the 911 equipment of course was all right -- if
one could have gotten a dial tone in any reasonable time.  It was
reported that one suburb realized the danger quickly and stationed its
fire trucks at strategic intersections just in case and police
departments broadcast a note requesting people with problems to drive to
the nearest precinct rather than try to call.  It was very fortunate
that apparently there were no emergencies -- the only incident reported
was that someone had discovered that a relative had died and tried to
call for help on 911; in that case a rapid response would not have
mattered.  And there was also the poor fellow in Rochester, Mn., (area
code 507) who happened to have the same number as the ticket line (area
612) -- and was waiting for calls in response to a newspaper ad to sell
some of his belongings before he left for college that afternoon.  He
was not amused.

The ticket people said they'll have to come up with a third game plan
next year.  (Of course they'll need it!)

A computer system being used to flood a BBS with calls is *NOT* civil
disobedience - it is an act of terrorism.  Civil disobedience is an effort
to *increase* dialog - to make people aware of a specific concern.  It is
typically undertaken at some risk to the participants (either physical,
legal or both), as recent events have dramatically demonstrated.  It is in
the highest traditions of democracy and this nation's history.

Flooding a BBS, on the other hand, is an act designed to inhibit dialog.
It is meant to intimidate and debilitate other participants in the debate
of public policy.  Ultimately this is an act of cowardice and not worthy of
being justified as "civil disobedience."

Mike McLaughlin (RISKS 5.45) suggests that destruction of confiscated
computers should have a significant deterrent effect and cites poachers in
Virginia.  He perhaps should look at the history of Moonshining in that area
(or in any other area/country that you care to name).  The destruction of
the "tools of the trade" has NEVER deterred them - moonshiners are famous
for coming out of court, straight into the hardware shop and buying the
materials for new stills.  I dont see why poachers should be any different
nor hackers - let's face it probably doesnt cost that much to replace the
sort of computers they are using (at least in the US anyway).  I accept that
SOME people MAY have strong emotional ties to particular pieces of
equipment, but its destruction is more likely to make these people think of
revenge than anything else.  Let's face it Judges aren't famous for their
knowledge of human psychology (OK neither are computer scientists....).

There have been a variety of stories about weather forecasting and the recent
bad weather. The gist of these seems to be (sorry about hazy details...) :-

1) The system based on a Cyber (the Met office?) failed to predict the storm.

2) A system based on a Cray DID predict the storm.

3) Le Monde carried a correct forecast on WEDNESDAY!

4) The bad predictions have been attributed to a lack of upper air
   measurements, satellite data not being particularly useful in this case.

5) Old Moore's Almanac said that there would be storms in October.

6) It's God's revenge on the Thatcherite Yuppies........

In risks 5.43 Nic McPhee introduced anonymity as the best protection:
&gt;From: mcphee@ratliff.cs.utexas.edu (Nic McPhee)
&gt; One of the greatest guarantees of privacy is anonymity.

This hits right to the heart of the matter, and the question remains one of how
to preserve anonymity in an age of increasingly sophisticated, tireless, and
undistractable records searchers.  The common property of all answers to this
question is that it requires effort: anonymity is no longer available by
default, but that does not mean that it is unavailable.

There are three strong (high probability of success) approaches to achieving
electronic anonymity:

    1. Thoroughly understand the legal position and fight for your rights;

    2. Use cut-offs that break the search chain; and,

    3. Generate the crowd in which to hide.

This forum has discussed legality quite extensively.  There are plenty of
mechanisms available for finding out and getting changed or deleted information
that is held on file about you.  You can also do a lot to ensure that there are
as few direct pointers (common ID's like social security number) as possible.
The drawback of this approach is that it attracts the attention of the
beureaucracy, which may lead to more trouble than the protection is worth, and
further lays you open to trojan horse attacks by people who obtain access
(legal or otherwise) to government files which contain information on you.

However, as an example, I was once extremely paranoid about having my private
life analysed when automated mailing lists started to appear.  I therefore kept
a precise record of EVERY occasion when I released certain information in
writing (I always refused to give details over the phone) and carefully
inserted one variant as a key in each case.  If a particular variant started
appearing from another source it was 100% certain that the information had been
propagated, and I would go directly (and angrily) back to the original
recipient of the information and demand an explanation.  This achieved the
desired effect until proliferation led to corruption, and the trace keys became
hard to devise with sufficient robustness to guarantee their survival across
compressed address lines and so on.  Of course, I may have become an entrant on
a blacklist of some kind, but I don't think THEY were sufficiently organized.
What I did find was that a letter to the wife of the president at home (amazing
how easy that sort of info was to discover :-) ) with copies to the president
plus the relevant department at work guaranteed attention.  Firm contention
that one understood how computer systems work, and discussion of operator
liability usually resulted in speedy remedial action.  But this takes hard
work.

At the other end of the scale, simple cut-offs to break chains work wonders.
There is very definitely no direct link between roberts@cognos.uucp and, for
instance, the residential address of Robert Stanley, private citizen.  All my
junk mail, including credit cards, subscriptions, and so on, goes via an
address of convenience.  (by the way, should you crack Cognos' personnel
database, you will find a correspondence rather than a residential address, but
a telephone number for a telephone that does ring at my home).  A PO box is the
simplest, and Canada Post at least limits the connection between a PO Box and
an actual person to a single local post office ledger entry.  The only positive
link they require is a telephone number, which could be at work.  Next best is
to use a service agency, and you'd be surprised at how cheap and convenient
they can be.  In fact, your worst danger is from your real friends, who may
have your personal information thoughtfully recorded among their own records.
Most of us don't tend to keep these encrypted.  Yes, the memory telephone is a
lethal instrument, as is the last number redial facility.

Finally, it is possible to create your own haystack, by making the information
explosion work to your advantage.  Get on every kind of list you can, at every
opportunity.  When faced with too much information, particularly contradictory
information, systems and people alike usually decide to ignore the case in
favour of an easier one.  You can just see the evidence for the prosecution
against a TV license non-payer including letters of application for game-show
appearance, when in fact you are one of the 1% TV non-owners!  Innocent until
proven guilty does still apply.

When Berkeley's computer center was occupied in the early 1970's, the only
thing which saved us from major damage was ignorance.  Damage (which was
not severe as I recall) was concentrated on tape drives and other things
with moving parts.  One of the operators told me that if he had been
sympathetic to the demonstrators, he would have directed them to the
innocuous box which held the CDC 6400's mainframe.

A little more history of machine room physical security at Berkeley,
as raised by Dorsey (<A HREF="/Risks/5.44.html">RISKS-5.44</A>) and Chapman (<A HREF="/Risks/5.45.html">RISKS-5.45</A>):

 "I don't know if that's a reaction to [the sit-in that] Scott
  mentioned, or not"

At the time of the anti-war sit-ins, the computer center machine room
was in the basement of the old math building, and had no physical
security to speak of. Users would submit jobs by walking into the
machine room and placing their card decks on a counter that was about
six feet from the twin CDC 6400 mainframes. When the demonstrators tried
to get in, physical security consisted of a burly operator trying to hold
the door closed!

Independent of any actual damage done during the demonstrations (very slight,
as I recall), the computer center management virtually freaked out about their 
vulnerability. The machine room in the new math building was already more
secure -- for example, card decks were submitted in a separate room and handed 
via a small pass-through into the machine room -- but they looked very
hard for other risks. One wall of the new room had large observation windows
of thick reinforced glass; they decided even that was too risky, so the hallway
outside the windows was closed to the public. Access by computer center staff
became much more controlled, and machine room tours were curtailed. Of course, 
by the time these and other measures were in place, the demonstrations were
pretty much a thing of the past, but it's an interesting example of how a
tough security policy often results from an earlier flimsy one plus a bit
of scary experience.

    What *I* think many of us agree on (except R.M.Stallman, of course) is
    that information is a form of property and is entitled to *some*
    protection.

I think that this is a somewhat inaccurate characterization for a
couple of reasons.  Firstly, RMS appears to be quite concerned that the
informational property rights of others are not violated, although it
could certainly be argued that hir motives are of the CYA variety.
Secondly, e goes to great lengths to explicitly spell out the
protection of GNU project software.  If e didn't feel a need for any
protection, the software could simply be placed in the public domain.

  &gt; house, their car, their wallet and their Unix files (or their IBM-PC
  &gt; software) are entitled to *the same* protection.

Information purveyors do.

  &gt; The significant difference between information and "real" property is
  &gt; that if you steal real property, your victim is denied access to that
  &gt; property; whereas if you "steal" information, your victim still has hir
  &gt; copy of it, and may not even notice the "theft".

Information certainly does have value.  And that value is altered when the
information is spread around, whether the originator retains a copy or not.
Ask any spy.  And what makes 'sharing' information more defensible than
stealing it?  Want to share your lover/spouse with me?

BTW, I think the legal term 'real property' refers specifically to land and
improvements thereto, like houses.  All other forms of property are personal
property.

  &gt; What our linguistic, ethical and legal systems have not yet come to 
  &gt; cope with is just what sort of protection information is entitled to, 
  &gt; and what sort is feasible.

How long have copyright, trademark, and patent laws been in existance?
I'm not claiming that these laws remain the most appropriate means of
redress, but only that the concept of protecting information and other
'copyable' property is hardly new.

An interview on this afternoon's (21 Oct 87) "All Things Considered" with an
investment expert named Thomas Tisch [sp?] discussed the impact that
programmed stock trading had on last Monday's stock market losses.

According to Mr. Tisch, aggressive programmed trading typically is an
attempt to take advantage of a difference in prices between different
offerings of the same stock.  For example, analysts will compare the price
of a group of stocks on the NY Stock Exchange with the price of an option on
the same stocks on the Chicago exchange.  If a sufficiently large disparity
exists, the programmed sales will be activated, buying the lower priced
package and simultaneously selling the higher priced package.  Because the
disparities in price are usually small, this strategy requires large
purchases, on the order of $25 million.  During Monday's decline, trading on
index futures was suspended, reducing the impact of this form of programmed
trading on the market.

In the case of Monday's fall, Mr. Tisch felt that a lot of the volatility
the market showed was caused by another kind of programmed trading.  Many
large institutional investors, such as insurance companies, pension funds,
and university endowments, had tried to protect their assets with "portfolio
insurance."

To protect against their assets being wiped out, these investors had
programmed in a bail-out if their portfolio's value dropped too far.
This resulted in an automated panic once the market as a whole started
to drop.

[ I didn't tape previous the broadcast, so I can't give you Mr. Tisch's
credentials.  All I have is hastily scribbled notes I took during the
interview.  I did, though get the following item on tape ]

On Tuesday, during an address to the National Press Club, Garrison
Keillor was asked what effect the market's decline would have on Bob's
Bank in Lake Woebegone.  Keillor replied,

    "I think the terrifying thing about this stock market crash
    is the idea that this could all be going on between computers
    with human beings hardly involved at all.  That these vast
    banks of computers all over the country, using the phone
    lines, are battling each other for stocks, and that we have
    no part in this."

On Monday, a number of NASDAQ market makers abandoned their posts while
stockholders were trying to bail out.  (A good thing?  Don't let 'em sell
until it goes up again?)  Although this was not a computer-caused problem,
it kept the computers from handling the relevant trading during the
508-point drop.

On Tuesday, computerized trading in stock-index futures and options was
temporarily suspended for the first time in history in New York, Chicago,
and Kansas City.

On Wednesday, the PSE had to shut down its computerized trading system
(SCOREX) for about five hours yesterday due to intolerable transmission
delays resulting from the avalanche of orders.  This was its first complete
shutdown since installation in 1979.  Volume dropped significantly.  (On
Monday SCOREX trading was halted in about 5% of the options, due to
"technical problems".)

This morning's (Thursday, October 22) Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition
page 44, contains an article with the above headline, which continues:

"Two top BankAmerica Corp. executives quit after being asked to resign . . .
in an action related to data processing problems that cost the company an
estimated $25 Million.

"The two men were held responsible . . . for problems in converting to a new
computerized accounting system for the bank's trust department last March.

". . . A bank spokesman said the conversion to a new system, called MasterNet,
disrupted data processing records to the extent that BankAmerica is frequently 
unable to produce or deliver customer statements on a timely basis."

The good (?) news is that ". . .the spokesman said . . . 'to the best of our
knowledge, no customer information has been lost. . .'"

From the Federal Computer Week (10/19/87) (excerpted, without permission):

The Air Force has issued technology assessment contracts to four teams to
explore deployment of a multibillion-dollar Air Defense Initiative that
could rival SDI for cost, complexity, and possibly for political debate.

Issued by the Air Force Electronics Systems Division, the contracts, though
slightly less than $1 million each, signal the beginning of a major
tri-service effort to protect North America from attack by Soviet bombers or
cruise missiles.

A central impetus for the ADI research is the effect SDI will have on
Soviet strategic planning, according to Air Force officials.  The Air 
Force operates on the assumption that the ongoing progress on SDI has 
already pushed the Soviets to improve their bomber and cruise missile 
forces.  If this improvement continues, the US will need to deploy ADI 
even if the threat it is designed to counter is an indirect result of SDI.

The ADI system will bear more than a casual resemblance to SDI, according
to Pentagon officials.  Like SDI, it probably will include numerous
space-based sensing platforms, which can see the entire North American
continent and which can control air, ground, and space-based interceptors
or hypersonic aircraft.  ADI will require a complex real-time
computerized command and control system to monitor threats coming from
every compass quadrant.  Like SDI, ADI's command and control system will
have to be able to assess these multiple threats and then control widely
dispersed defensive systems...

John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists, a long-time critic of
SDI, said the command and control problems of ADI will be even more complex
than SDI.  "Airplanes tend to blend into the background, especially when
they are flying only a few hundred feet above the ground ... The Soviets are
obviously going to have their missiles coming in from the north, but
airplanes could come in from any direction." ...  Former Defense Secretary
James Schlesinger estimated that total costs for ADI could run as high as
$50 billion.

(The rest of the article discussed contractors/subcontractors and some of
the suggestions for methods and timing.  One interesting item was the
suggestion that airships (lighter than air) are a possible sensor
platform alternative.)

&gt;   I seem to recall a mention that the Berkeley computer center was

I attended Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, in the 1970s at the
height of the student rebellions.  The Computer Centre, fearing an imitation of
events in the U.S., posted large notices on the doors of the machine room
alleging that after the fire alarm bells went off, you had 45 seconds to
clear the room before the carbon dioxide came in, the oxygen disappeared, and
those remaining died. (This was before the advent of Halon.)  It was assumed
that the operators were expected to trigger the fire alarm at any sign of a
student invasion, though the administration denied this.

&gt;How many of you have no idea where the machines you use are physically located

In teaching first year, I always make a point of telling the students what the
machine is, where it is, and telling them to have a look at it (through the
glass).  Reason:  I want them to have a mental image of the machine, and to
understand clearly that the terminal is not the computer.

This is less important than it used to be, but it is still a good idea; many of
our freshmen are still complete computer novices (though no longer the
majority).  Also, knowing the name, power, ability, etc., of many machines will
be important for some of the students later on, if they become systems
programmers or administrators.	It's never too early to start learning that the
old ones are Vaxes, the new ones are Suns, the 3/280 is about three times as
powerful as the Vax, etc.

I'm not sure about the current state of affairs here in the States, but
about three years ago a fellow in Buffalo was being harassed by the Postal
Service for setting up just such a service, where people could get a PO box
under a pseudonym.  Their excuse was the need to prevent mail fraud, which
he said he would always co-operate in the investigation of.  For every box
the Postal Service wanted to see a real name and a real occupation.  When
mail pseudonyms are outlawed, only outlaws will have mail pseudonyms.

P.S. I presume the Internet has a rule against anonymous messages.

The eight character limit may have been designed in, but direct mapping
into DES keys is no feature.  The average entropy of English is about one
bit per letter over blocks of eight or more letters; so rather than 56 bits
of equivocation the routine assuredly provides eight.  Hashing long strings
together using CBC or CFB message authentication techniques yields eight
byte hex strings in which every last trace of equivocation is present in
a 'random' looking pattern.  Time for a change of password routines.

In  RISKS 5.45 (Brent Chapman, Re:  Civil Disobedience),  several
minimal computer physical security mechanisms were listed.

Although it may be slightly dated, I have found  the  FIPS-PUB-31
(Guidelines For Automated Data Processing  Physical  Security and  
Risk Management,NBS,1974, 95 pp) to be a good basic reference for 
the  issues needing  consideration, including: security analysis,
natural  disasters,  supporting  utilities,  system  reliability, 
physical  protection,  internal  controls,  off-site  facilities,
contingency  planning, security  awareness, and  internal  audit.

Of course, there are more recent  texts  dealing  with  the  same
topic,  but this is one of the more complete ones  I've seen that
focuses on computer facilities, control and contingencies.

It is axiomatic that organizations will supply only that security
that   is  (a)   affordable   and  (b)   justifiable   under  the
circumstances.  Someone must take the responsibility to  identify
the  various  options  available  and  evaluate  the local risks,
making a final recommendation to the top management.

A very interesting fictional treatment of Civil Disobedience in a terminally
automated society is to be found in John Brunner's novel "The Shockwave Rider"
which has achieved the status of a minor classic in the science fiction world.

Some very telling points are made, and the subject is explored in considerable
depth.  However, it also points up the fact that the distinction between CD and
criminal activity is not so much a point of law, as the degree of fear/anger
triggered in the targetted beureaucracy, which usually has sufficient dollars
to overwhelm all but the most visible of protestants.

From front page of "Computer News", 22 October:

  ``The Metorological Office will look at the performance of its Control Data
  Cyber 205 supercomputer as part of its investigation following last week's
  hurricane-force winds.  The office has been criticised for failing to
  predict the speed and path of the storm.

   A spokesman for the Metorological Office said that the equipment,
  including computers, was always under consideration. He added: "The
  Cyber is not an easy machine to work with but all computers are
  fallible." Control Data did not comment.

   The Reading-based [southern England] European Centre for Medium Range
  Weather Forecasting, which supplies longer range data directly to the
  Bracknell centre [Met Office, close by], is happy with its Cray X-MP 48
  machine. "We originally had a Cray-1 before upgrading to an MP 22 and MP 48
  and we are exceedingly happy with our machine.  "It gets better and better,"
  said a spokesman.''

My understanding is the main reasons for lack of success in predicting
the winds were a) lack of data (the storm came from over the sea --
fairly normal in Britain! -- where there are few weather stations) and
b) lack of computing power (and lack of good algorithms?).

It has been reported in Britain that (mainland) Europeans were warned
not to come to Britain up to 36 hours before the storm (presumably by
forecasts from the European Centre mentioned above). It was not made
clear as to whether storms were predicted in the English Channel or
actually in England. The storm unexpectedly changed direction and
increased in ferocity when it struck England.

The BBC TV weather forecast (which uses the Met Office) the night
before mentioned than someone had rung up to say they had heard a
hurricane was heading in our direction, but the weather forecaster
assured us it was not. The storm WAS predicted by the Met Office a few
hours before it struck, but most people were in bed by this time.
England being rather parochial, most radio and TV stations shut up shop
at night. Had it occurred during the day, then storm warnings would
have been broadcasted.

The following letter was published in The Independent on Wednesday 21 October.
It comes from Norman Lynagh who is the managing director of Noble Denton
Weather Services. I have no idea whether he is offically associated with
the Meteorological Office but his letter seems to be a clear and accurate
statement of what went wrong with the forecasting of last weeks gales.
It also contains some interesting insights into the state-of-the-art
in weather forecasting. The bottom-line seems to be the familiar GIGO.

Dear Sir,

The Met Office has come under a great deal of criticism as a result of its
failure to predict the severe storm in SE England last Friday morning. Some
of what has been said is accurate but a great deal has been unfair criticism.

Despite what has been said by many people, it was not until about 8pm that
it was really apparent that something out of the ordinary was developing.
Even at that stage it was not at all certain that exceptionally strong winds
would hit SE England. It was only an increasing threat. By about 11pm it was
certain that a storm of unusual severity would hit the SE.

There have been reports from various sources that warning had been given
by other meteorological services several days before the event. This is only
half true and, in any case, the Met Office was one organisation which did
give such a warning.

Several of the most powerful meteorological computers, including those at the
Met Office in Bracknell and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather
Forecasting at Reading, predicted five days in advance that there would be
a major storm somewhere in the region of southern England or northern France
towards the weekend. In broadscale terms, this prediction continued each day
after that, but the state-of-the-art in weather forecasting is such that it
was impossible to predict in any detail either the severity of the storm
or precisely when it would strike.

The depression which caused the storm had existed for several days before
it struck in SE England. Indeed, it was giving force 11 winds NE of the Azores
two to three days earlier. However, during last Thursday, as it moved quickly
NE into the Bay of Biscay, the structure of the depression was far from clear.
As Murphy's Law always seems to dictate in such situations, there were very
few observations available in the vicinity of the depression and it was very
uncertain as to what was exactly happening in Biscay.

As mentioned earlier, it was not until Thursday evening that the situation
became clear and it became obvious that the SE was going to have a night
to remember.

Meteorology now uses the most powerful non-military computers in existence
but the advances in the quality and quantity of input data have not kept up
with the computer technology. No matter how good the computer and the software,
it will not do a very good job if it is given inaccurate input data.

Summarising all the above, I do not think the Met office can be blamed for
failing to give a day or two's warning of a once-in-a-lifetime event.

The state-of-the-art of weather forecasting is such that the way this storm
developed and the precise detail of its effects could not be forecast more
than a few hours in advance.

What is more open to close scrutiny is why warnings to the public were not
issued until after midnight. I think they could well have been issued three
or four hours earlier but that is with the benefit of hindsight and it is
really a question which only the Met Office can answer.

Yours sincerely,

Norman Lynagh, Managing director, Noble Denton Weather Services, London EC1

As reported in RISKS 5.46, on October 17th the sale of World Series tickets
in Minneapolis, Minnesota, severely affected telephone service throughout the
upper midwest.  NW Bell estimates about 200,000 calls were attempted to the
sale number in the first hour, and a similar load continued for hours.

Most telephones in the Twin Cities area had delays (with clicking noises) until
a dial tone eventually appeared (20-40 seconds on one of my phones and I
stopped measuring at 2 minutes on the other).  Phone service was slowed
throughout the state and in parts of Iowa, Wisconsin, North and South Dakota.  
Some incoming long-distance callers to other numbers report no problems.

At the customer's request, before the sale Northwestern Bell had set up a
temporary choke-type network to restrict the number of calls to the prefix and
number from central offices in the area.  Despite the restrictions, the sheer
volume of calls overwhelmed the network.  A NW Bell spokesman says the problem
was probably exasperated by customers with automatic redial.  Fortunately the
sale was not scheduled for a business day.

There were interesting differences between this situation and those caused by
broadcast prize giveaways.  The first was the large quantity of tickets that
stretched the demand over several hours, even after the sellout at 11:30 AM.
The Minneapolis-St. Paul toll-free calling area is one of the world's largest, 
but since every successful caller would get rewarded by being able to buy 
these prized tickets there were many incoming long-distance call attempts.

Iowa might have had an interesting situation if St. Louis had attempted the
same thing at the same time from the south -- a possibility due to the limited
time to sell the tickets.

Phone calls for UUCP sites generally failed, since most modems and systems can
not detect dial tone.  UUCP logs showed 80-85% failure rates during that time.
Fortunately, most USENET news transfers in the state are scheduled for times
other than the period affected so there was not a large backlog of data trying
to flow through most sites.

I will be suggesting to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission that they
try to have 911 protected from this kind of problem.  I think the way to reduce
giving a delayed dial tone to everyone is to try to give greater delays to
people trying to dial a number causing an overload.  Preferably also give
even greater delays to repeat callers or autodialers.  Presently the local
carrier is required to give equal service to everyone, even if that means
giving equally bad service.

Along about 1970 (around the time of Kent State) there was a bombing at the
comp center (and a megabuck fire at the student union) at the University of
Kansas. I was on my way to the comp center from my office when the bomb went
off, and had it not been for some fortuitous circumstances that delayed me
that evening, would have been at a terminal about 15 feet from the explosion
when it happened. The computer operators suffered some minor injuries and some
permanent hearing losses. Our terminal server was a Datanet 30. The explosion
blew the doors off it, but it was still running until the machine was shut
down. I could probably tell some war stories about the incident, but this
digest is not the proper place for that. If anybody is interested, I'll provide
more details on the haziness of my recollections privately.

The computer center at U.C. Santa Barbara was taken over by protesters in
the spring of '75. Although the computer room was secured behind locked 
doors it was easy for them to get control - several demonstrators merely
lounged in the hall outside until an operator came, then when she unlocked
the door to go in one grabbed her and held the door open for the rest.

One operator inside shut the machine down immediately. Then the protesters
ushered (all?) the operators out, and took over the entire building - taping
printouts over all the windows and doors. They threatened to destroy the
computer if their demands (more money for radical leftist groups) weren't met.

The place was held for several hours (interesting sight: small group of
demonstrators just outside the building, group of angry EECS students around
*them*) before the police moved in and hauled the demonstrators away. (Another
interesting sight: the leaders of the demonstration, very visible throughout
the takeover, managed to vanish just before the police reached the building,
leaving the rest to be taken away in the paddy-wagons.)

The machine was not damaged.

During the student riots at Columbia (April, '68), the computer center
lobby was briefly 'occupied'.  The operators prevented access to the
machine room, and the center was then closed and locked for the duration
of the disturbance.  The occupiers (who included physics grad students
and others familiar with the computer center and its operation) were
 aware that the university's corporate data processing was done on a
separate system; that having the administration shut down the computer
center was as effective and as disruptive to the routines of the
university as shutting it down themselves; and, that due to the pricetags
of the equipment involved (several million $$), the administrators might
act 'irrationally' to protect the equipment.

In RISKS 5.45, Dave Curry explains the process that is used in UNIX to get
from a password to an encrypted password.  There are other systems that use
similar schemes.  For example, Multics also uses the low-order seven bits of
each character in the ASCII password as input to a cipher routine.  Multics
uses these bits as both the key and the data.

Dave claims that the truncation of the password to eight characters is not
serious.  I agree -- if the user knows that only the first eight characters
are really being used.  When a user enters more that eight characters for
the password, UNIX should provide a warning that only the first eight are
used.  Multics provides such a warning.

Is the "modified DES" used by UNIX a one-way hash?

The eight-character limit may have been designed in, but direct mapping
into DES keys is no feature.  The average entropy of English is about one
bit per letter over blocks of eight or more letters; so rather than 56 bits
of equivocation the routine assuredly provides eight.  Hashing long strings
together using CBC or CFB message authentication techniques yields eight
byte hex strings in which every last trace of equivocation is present in
a 'random' looking pattern.  Time for a change of password routines.

We know that the new tax law requires a Social Security number for each
dependent age 5 or older (if you want to list them as a deduction).  Our
school district is doing its part to make this easier for parents (and
themselves).  They are required "to identify students with either a
Social Security number or an assigned number."  Since many kids may not
have an SS number, they have sent home a form to fill out to apply for
a number.  The school will provide copies of their (the school's) records
to SS as part of the application for SS, and the SS cards will be
distributed through the school.

Of course, the form (that HAS to be returned) includes six options
including (1) My child already has a social security number of ___ __ ____
(2) We have already applied; I will notify the school of the number
when it arrives, (3) ...

There is no option for (7) My child has one and it is not to be used to
identify school records.
