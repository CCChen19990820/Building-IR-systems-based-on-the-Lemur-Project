<H3>Regulation:</H3>
<DL><DD>
2 Illinois Administrative Code 560
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>IV:  Requirement Description:</H3>
<DL><DD>
The purpose of this Act is to regulate persons who directly communicate with legislators, constitutional officers, and other officials, such as agency directors, deputy directors, and general counsels, for the ultimate purpose of influencing an executive, legislative, or administrative action.  This Act may affect any business that does business with the State.  A business may be required to register if any salaried or contractual employee, as any part of their job duties, undertakes to influence the outcome of an executive, legislative, or administrative action.<P>

The employee would be required to register as an attachment to the
business' registration.  (Section 560.210 of the Code explains exemptions
from the Act).  The Secretary of State's Office does not have the statutory
authority to make the determination as to whether a business falls within
the purview of the Act and parties unsure as to whether the Act applies to
their business should consult with their lawyer. All registration
statements expire on December 31, and must be renewed by January 31.  The
primary purpose of this Act is to disclose expenditures (travel and
lodging, meals, beverages, entertainment, gifts and honoraria) on behalf of
officials by businesses subject to the Act.  Violations are a business
offense; parties convicted may be prohibited from lobbying for 3 years.<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.  Registration Process:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Businesses must file a Registration Statement with an attachment for each employee who lobbies solely on behalf of the business.  It is not necessary to file an attachment for contractual lobbyists who are registered on their own or with another entity. (The Index Department provides a free "lobbyist packet" which contains rules, registration and reporting forms, and "A Guide to Lobbyist Registration and Reporting," with a copy of the Act.)
</DD></DL>

<H3>VI.  Pre-Requisites, Co-Requisites & Post-Requisites:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Registered, authorized agents are responsible for filing a semi-annual expenditure report by July 31 for the period of January 1 through June 30, or the final day of the General Assembly session, and an annual expenditure report by January 31 for the entire previous calendar year. Reports must be filed even if the business did not make reportable expenditures.
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>VII.  Fees:</H3>
<DL><DD>
Registration fee for the business: $50, plus $50 registration fee for each salaried employee lobbying on behalf of the business (contractual lobbyists with other clients pay in conjunction with their own registration).  Registration statements and expenditure reports received within 15 days of a filing deadline must be accompanied by a $50 late filing fee.<P>

Registration statements and expenditure Reports received after 15 days of a
filing deadline are subject to an additional $100 penalty.<P>

improving a buyer's credit record, history or rating, (2) obtaining an
extension of credit for a buyer or (3) providing advice or assistance to a
buyer with regard to either (1) or (2) above. (Exceptions to this

savings and loans eligible for FDIC insurance, credit unions, some non-
profit organizations, real estate brokers, attorneys, broker-dealers
registered with the Securities Exchange Commission, and consumer reporting
agencies.)<P>
</DD></DL>

<HR>
<H3>V.  Registration Process:</H3>

A CSO may contact the Secretary of State Index Department to receive a "Credit Services Organization Registration Statement".  Prior to conducting business, the registration statement must be filed in the Index Department along with a $100 filing fee.  A surety bond of $100,000 may also be filed for organizations that "charge or receive any money or other valuable consideration prior to full and complete performance of any services the credit services organization has agreed to perform for or on behalf of the buyer."  The Index Department will process the registration statement in approximately one week.   A CSO must update their registration within 90 days of any change in information listed on the original statement.

<center><h3>TIPS for using the WORD SEARCH function</h3></center>

Be careful spelling the word(s) you enter!  It will search for exactly what 
you specify.<p>  

The search is not case sensitive.  For example, if you type 'INCOME', the 
system will return a list of documents that have 'INCOME', 'Income' or 
'income'.<p>

The system will return a list of documents that have ALL of the words that 
you enter.  Thus, if you enter INCOME TAX, you will get a list of all 
information profiles that have BOTH 'INCOME' and 'TAX'.  They need not be 
together in a document but only profiles containing BOTH (all) words will 
be selected for you.<p>  

The search function uses the entire word, as entered, in selecting 
'matching' documents.  It does not return documents containing `partial' 
word matches.  For example, if you input 'ENVIRONMENT' for your search, you 
will not get documents that may only contain the word 'ENVIRONMENTAL' or 
vice versa.<p>  

Start by using single words rather than combinations.  You are basically 
'guessing' what words may be used in a document that covers the subject 
matter you need.  After you get a list of documents with one word relating 
to your subject, try limiting the number of matching documents by adding 
another word.  For example, if you start with 'ENVIRONMENTAL', you may get 
a long list of documents.  You can then do another search using 
'ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS' to reduce the list to only those documents more 
closely relating to your desired subject.<p>  

If you don't find what you need on your first selection, try another word 
or words that would logically have the same or similar meaning.  Using 
search functions can be an art.  Don't be discouraged when you don't 
initially find something that you request.<p> 

<em>Note: </em> The quotation marks in the examples above are for clarity only.  
Don't use them when you input your word selections.<p>

1996 Outstanding Year for Film, Television Production in Illinois
</h3>

<strong>CHICAGO,  ILL.</strong>  --  Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that 27 film and television productions provided temporary jobs for more than 25,000 Illinois residents and pumped $100 million into the state's economy in 1996.<p>

"The Illinois film industry is thriving," the Governor said.  "We are seeing the results of the rebuilding efforts of the Illinois Film Office in film and television productions such as 'Chain Reaction,' 'A Thousand Acres," 'My Best Friend's Wedding,'  'ER,' 'Early Edition,' and 'Chicago Hope.'  Hollywood is investing in Illinois because of our willingness to accommodate the demands of the film marketplace and the excellent cooperation between labor unions and state and local governmental bodies to meet the industry's needs."<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, said the film industry makes a significant contribution to the state's economy.<p>

"This is only the second year in the 20-year history of the Illinois Film Office that revenue has reached $100 million in actual cash expenditures in Illinois," Kustra said.  "Since 1976, the motion picture and television industry has contributed more than $800 million to the state's economy and provided more than 250,000 temporary jobs."<p>

Some of the highlights of 1996 include "A Thousand Acres," filmed in Rochelle, Creston, and Mendota in September, and "35 Miles from Normal," filmed last summer in Pontiac.  Chicago productions include "Michael," due for release at Christmas; recently released "The Chamber." and 1997 releases such as "Love Jones," "Dogwater," "Hoods," "Reach the Rock," "Home Alone 3," and "My Best Friend's Wedding."<p>      

In addition to big Hollywood productions, which clearly boost the Illinois economy, the Illinois Film Office is seeing strong growth in independent film productions originating in Illinois, a major indicator of the future health of the local film industry.<p> 

The Illinois Film Office, a division of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, is responsible for attracting productions and promoting the film and television industry in Illinois.  Activities include location scouting, acting as a liaison between state and local governments, and providing information that outlines available film facilities and services, ranging from accountants to screenwriters.<p>

Governor Releases $1 Million in Emergency Heating Funds to Help Low-Income Families Re-Establish
Utilities Service
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong>  --  Gov. Jim Edgar today released $1 million in state emergency heating assistance to help low-income Illinois families and individuals re-establish utility services.<p>

"With the onset of frigid winter temperatures, thousands of Illinoisans who can't afford the cost of utilities may well find their lives threatened by the bitter cold," the Governor said.  "I have asked that state government tap all available resources to help low-income citizens currently without heat for their homes." <p>

The $1 million released today comes from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs.  Nearly half -- about  $465,000 -- would go to residents of the City of Chicago and Cook County.  The rest will be distributed throughout the state to areas with the greatest need.<p>

Up to $500 a year in emergency funds is available to households that have had utilities disconnected or that fuel suppliers refuse to serve without immediate payment.  The funds also can be used to help pay for repair or replacement of heating systems that do not work.<p>

To qualify, applicants must show that they are low-income households and that they are responsible for the energy bill from the disconnected utility or fuel vendor.  They must also show they have paid at least 10 percent of the household's past 90-day income toward energy services.<p>

About 6,000 residents already have received emergency assistance through state and federal programs this year.  An additional 95,000 have received one-time payments toward their energy bills.<p>

Additional information about the program is available by calling DCCA's Energy Assistance Hotline toll-free at 800/252-8643.<p>

DCCA to Host Competitive Communities Workshops
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL. </strong> --  Illinois communities interested in participating in the Competitive Communities Initiative (CCI) administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) are encouraged to attend one of three workshops to be held next week.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, Governor Edgar's senior advisor for economic development, said the program is designed to give local governments the tools to help themselves become more competitive. <p>

"The Competitive Communities Initiative is one of  DCCA's most popular local government programs," said Kustra.  "Economic development opportunities often hinge on how prepared a community is for growth.  A community of any size or level of economic development sophistication that is determined to improve itself can benefit from the rigorous self-assessment and action plan developed as the result of this program."  <p>

DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone said the program is already successfully in place in 30 communities throughout Illinois.<p>  

"CCI helps communities focus on leadership, assess their foundations for growth and build upon past economic development efforts," said Whetstone.  "Mayors and other local leaders have told us that their participation in CCI has helped them identify local development issues and develop consensus."<p>

Application workshops will be held in three different locations during the week of November 18, 1996.  At the workshops, CCI staff members will give a brief description of the goals and objectives of CCI and answer any questions concerning the application process.  Communities do not have to attend a workshop in order to submit an application.<p>

Applications are due no later than December 16, 1996 at the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, Office of Local Initiatives, 620 E. Adams Street, Springfield, Illinois  62701.<p>

The workshops will be held at the following locations:<p>

<strong>CHICAGO, ILL.</strong> --  Illinois First and The Society of the Plastics Industry, Inc. will co-sponsor the Illinois Plastics Summit, to be held November 19, 1996 in Oak Brook, Illinois.  The event will focus on the identification of key issues facing the plastics industry, and offer recommendations to address industry concerns.<p>

"Businesses with a stake in the plastics industry are urged to attend this summit," said Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) director Dennis Whetstone.

Governor Awards $41.5 Million in Grants to Improve Public Infrastructure in 157 Communities Throughout Illinois
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, IL</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today awarded grants worth $41.5 million to help 157 Illinois communities improve and expand public water and sewer systems to meet the demands of economic growth while protecting the state's environment.<p>

"If Illinois communities are to thrive and grow, they must have adequate and safe water and wastewater treatment systems," the Governor said.  "Through the Community Development Assistance Program, smaller communities throughout Illinois can get the help they need to pay for costly improvements to public infrastructure, a financial challenge that few smaller communities can meet on their own.<p>

"Beyond demands of economic growth, improved water and sewer systems also are crucial to protecting the Illinois environment and the health and safety of Illinois residents.  We want to help Illinois communities build a brighter economic and environmental future."<p>

CDAP grants are available to most Illinois communities with populations of 50,000 or less.  The grants are administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<p>

The Governor pointed to projects in Hillsboro and Carthage as examples of improvement needs funded across Illinois.<p>

The City of Hillsboro will receive a $375,000 grant to help improve sand filters at its wastewater treatment plant.  The city has not met Illinois Environmental Protection Agency standards because wastewater volumes have overtaxed the existing filter system.  The improvements will eliminate the discharge of inadequately treated wastewater and bring the plant into compliance with state environmental guidelines.<p>

The City of Carthage will receive $50,000 in CDAP grant funding to help replace a key sewer main.  The existing line is too small to handle current sewage volume.  It is deteriorating and is exposed in several locations along a drainage ditch.  Sewage backups have occurred in several homes in the service area, creating hazards to public health and safety.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, said the funding is a sound investment in the future of Illinois.<p>

"Smaller communities must be prepared for economic expansion," Kustra said.  "Infrastructure improvements set the stage for development, improve the quality of life, and protect the health and safety of our citizens."<p>

DCCA officials received 308 requests for CDAP funding, totaling $89.7 million.<p>

CDAP grants are funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  The grants are awarded on a competitive basis to cities outside the seven most populous Illinois counties.  Low to moderate income benefit is a primary factor in awarding the grants.<p>

A list of project grants awarded today is attached.<p>

Governor Announces Third Consecutive Decrease in High-Risk Workers' Compensation Rates
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that Illinois workers' compensation insurance rates among high-risk employers will be reduced for the third consecutive year in 1997.<p>

"Lower workers' compensation insurance rates help strengthen the Illinois business climate," the Governor said.  "This 10.1 percent rate decrease for 1997 and similar decreases over the past two years are lowering the cost of doing business in Illinois.  That allows business owners to reinvest the savings in their companies, their workforces and our economy."<p>

The rate reduction, requested by the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI), is expected to save $15.5 million for Illinois manufacturers and businesses involved in the Illinois Workers' Compensation Assigned Risk Plan.  NCCI administers the high-risk pool for about 300 insurance companies serving employers who are unable to buy workers' compensation insurance through the voluntary insurance market.  The high-risk pool insures more than 9 percent of the total Illinois workers' compensation market.  Workers' compensation rates for high-risk employers decreased 6.8 percent in 1995 and 13.6 percent in 1996.  Rates generally are based on the frequency and severity of recent claims.<p>

Illinois Director of Insurance Mark Boozell approved NCCI's rate reduction request today, assuring an overall average 10.1 percent rate decrease next year for companies in the high-risk pool.  The new rates take effect Jan. 1.<p>

NCCI recommended a corresponding 10.1 percent rate decrease for employers in the voluntary market.  "Insurance companies must file their voluntary rates with the Department of Insurance on an individual basis," Boozell said.  "Although voluntary rates can fluctuate above or below the recommended decrease, the level of competition in the market will ultimately determine how much companies charge."<p>

Rates in the voluntary workers' compensation insurance market are roughly 20 percent lower than rates in the high-risk pool, Boozell said.<p>

Governor Announces Auto Part Company will Locate New Plant in Lawrenceville; State Helps to Create About 125 Jobs
</h3>

<strong>LAWRENCEVILLE, ILL</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced Trim Masers, Inc., an automobile parts manufacturing company, will locate a new plant in Lawrenceville with assistance for the state. <p> 

"I am delighted that Trim masters has joined many, many other companies that have decided to invest in Illinois and create jobs here because of our excellent business climate and quality workforce, " the Governor said.<p>

"More than 360,000 new jobs have been created in our state in just the last four years, reflecting our retooled and re-energized efforts to make Illinois a place where businesses want to expand and locate," Edgar said.<p>

Kentucky-based Trim master will employ about 125 and invests as much as $12 million in the 100,000 square-foot facility at Lawrenceville.  At least two other states were competing for the plant.  Construction will begin next May and is expected to be complete in December 1997.  Trim Masters manufactures seat trim covers, door trim and complete seats for automobiles.<p>

The state, through the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, will provide $187,000 in job-training funds and $500,000 in infrastructure assistance to help fund water and wastewater projects.  The City of Lawrenceville will donate the plant site.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, said the state worked with Lawrenceville area officials to make the project a reality.<p>

"This project was a team effort," said Kustra.  "Assistance at the state and local level was needed to bring Trim masters to Lawrenceville, and we are pleased to see much-needed jobs come to this community."<p>

Lawrenceville Mayor Jerry Harper said residents are excited about the jobs that will be created.<p>

"This announcement gives Lawrenceville an economic shot in the arm," Harper said.  "We wouldn't have been able to land this project without the assistance of the State of Illinois.  The help provided by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs clinched the deal to bring Trim Masters here, and we are very appreciative."<p>

Philip Ashcraft, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Trim Master, said the company is looking forward to working with the community.<p>

"The enthusiasm of the people in Lawrenceville area was one of the reasons we chose to locate here," said Ashcraft.  "that local support, combined with an excellent labor pool and the incentives offered by the State of Illinois, helped to make locating in Lawrenceville an easy decision for Trim Masters."<p>

Governor Congratulates Eli's Cheesecake Co. on Opening of New Headquarters
</h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, ILL.</strong>  --  Gov. Jim Edgar today joined with business and civic leaders in Chicago to celebrate the grand opening of the new $9 million bakery and headquarters for Eli's  Cheesecake Co. in Chicago Industry-Tech Park on the city's northwest side.<p>
  	    
"This opening represents an economic development milestone for the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois," the Governor said.  "First, Eli's reputation is much of the reason people across the country think of Chicago and Illinois when they think of fine cheesecake, and this opening certainly reinforces that connection.  <p>

"But the opening also represents the first project in a plan to redevelop the former Chicago-Read Mental Health Center site.  That creates exciting new opportunities for businesses to relocate and grow within the city of Chicago at costs competitive with the surrounding suburbs.  Eli's is to be commended as the first company to recognize the potential of Industry-Tech Park with the opening of Eli's Cheesecake Co."<p>

The Edgar administration will provide Eli's with a $300,000 Small Business Development Loan for the project through the state Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<p>  

Eli's Chicago's Finest Cheesecake President Marc Schulman said his company is proud to open Eli's Cheesecake Co. in Chicago.<p>

"The support of the city and the state and the loyalty of our customers made possible the achievement of our dream to build a state-of-the-art facility," said Schulman.  "We appreciate the opportunity to relocate in our current neighborhood, and we have built a true showcase for food products made in Illinois."  <p>         

"Today's event is just the latest example of how our investments in revitalizing economic development throughout Illinois are benefitting our businesses and our citizens," Edgar said. <p> 

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the development of Industry-Tech Park is a true partnership.<p>

"Public and private interests at the state and local level have a stake in realizing our goal of developing Industry-Tech Park," Kustra said.  "With Eli's Cheesecake Co. as an anchor we will continue to work together to build on our initial success."<p>        	

Chicago Industry-Tech Park was formally created in June of 1995 when the state agreed to provide 73 acres of surplus land that was part of the Chicago-Read Mental Health Center campus.<p>        

The redevelopment project is expected to take six to eight years and yield 580,000 square feet for modern industrial facilities, including processing, light-manufacturing and assembly facilities.  When fully developed, DCCA has estimated the park will generate more than $36 million in retail sales, $2.6 million in net state revenues, $2.8 million net local taxes and $100 million in payroll earnings.<p>

Governor Announces $5 Million Investment to Expand, Push Marketing of Illinois Coal
</h3>

<strong>CARBONDALE, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today unveiled a sweeping multi-million-dollar plan to expand markets for Illinois coal and improve the state's coal transportation, export and delivery systems.<p>

"The Illinois coal industry faces some tough challenges.  By moving forward with a sharply focused and aggressive marketing effort, we believe Illinois can solidify and expand its coal market opportunities," the Governor said. <p>

Edgar announced the state will spend $5 million to support coal marketing and transportation improvements, including $2 million for the Illinois Coal Marketing Campaign. The grant through the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs goes to the Illinois Coal Development Board.<p>

The proposed Illinois Coal Marketing Campaign includes two main components:  The Market Development Program and the Strategic Projects Program.<p>

The Market Development Program includes coal market research and analysis.  Analysts will identify promising domestic and international markets and provide the Illinois coal industry with information and strategies to tap those markets and to increase the value of Illinois coal.  Market Development analysts also will evaluate improvements needed to more efficiently transport Illinois coal to U.S. and global markets.<p>

The Strategic Projects Program will analyze infrastructure needs to improve coal transportation, export and delivery systems in Illinois.  State dollars will be used to leverage private and public investment to improve infrastructure and to increase coal shipments from Illinois.<p>

For instance, the Strategic Projects Program will look at ways to improve Illinois rail and barge loading facilities.  The idea is to move ore coal at lower costs to the Gulf of Mexico and on to international markets.<p>

"We have an opportunity to greatly expand our domestic markets as U.S. electric utilities restructure to comply with Clean Air Act rules," the Governor said.  "In addition, the global market potential for coal is only beginning to be realized as the demand for coal increases, particularly in developing countries.  This strategic marketing plan will help the Illinois coal industry take full advantage of changing market conditions around the world."<p>

State Senator Dave Luechtefeld (R-Okawville) joined the Governor in announcing the marketing plan.<p>

"I am proud to work with the Governor in developing this plan," Luechtefeld said.  "Coal production is the major economic force in many of the Southern Illinois communities I represent.  This plan will push us toward our goal of developing new markets for Illinois coal and developing systems for the most cost-efficient movement of coal to foreign markets."<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, said international markets show great promise. <p> 

Working with leaders of the Illinois Coal Association and the United Mine Workers of America, Kustra last year created the Illinois Coal Strategy Group, whose goal is to seek ways to improve the economic viability of Illinois coal and ensure positive impacts on local communities.<p>

"Illinois coal exports are up," Kustra said.  "Exports in 1995 increased 10-fold over 1994 levels and current analysts' projections indicate that we could double foreign export sales by the year 2000."<p>

The Governor asked that the Illinois Coal Development Board act quickly to approve the Illinois Coal Marketing Campaign.  The board reviews and approves all coal research, development and demonstration projects, as well as all expenditures from the Coal Technology Development and Assistance Fund and the Coal and Energy Development Bond Fund.<p>

Governor Announces Grant to Boost Economic Development in Red Bud
</h3>

<strong>RED BUD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced a $500,000 grant that will aid a business development in Red Bud, creating at least 15 new jobs and retaining more than 50.<p>  

"Red Bud is poised for economic growth," the Governor said.  "This Community Development Assistance Program grant is expected to help the city retain one of its most important employers and create exciting opportunities for new businesses to locate in Red Bud." <p>

The $500,000 grant through the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will go to the City of Red Bud.  The city will loan the money to TPC Properties, L.L.C., to purchase the building that houses Total Process Corp., a manufacturer of structural steel, piping and electrical components.  Two Red Bud banks will lend TPC Properties $1.3 million to complete the purchase.  The city of Red Bud will loan TPC an additional $200,000 at no interest to renovate the building.<p>

After acquisition and improvements are completed, Total Process Corp. will sign a long-term lease with TPC Properties and other tenants will be actively recruited for remaining space in the building, now owned by Inter-City Products.<p>

"There is tremendous economic development potential in small communities throughout Illinois," Edgar said.  "My administration is committed to helping small towns and cities realize that potential."<p>

Red Bud Mayor Clement L. Esker said the project will renew optimism in the community's future.<p>

"Red Bud is turning around," Esker said.  "We appreciate the efforts of the Edgar administration to help put our community on the comeback trail.  Red Bud is ready to move on to a brighter future with new growth and job opportunities for our citizens."<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, called the project an excellent example of public-private cooperation.<p>

"The Edgar administration is a partner in economic development with local governments and the private sector," Kustra said.  "All of us must work together to accomplish our common goal of improving the quality of life for citizens across Illinois."<p>

Governor Commends International Partnership that Resulted in Reopening Sparta Printing Plant
</h3>

<strong>SPARTA, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today joined with community leaders, area residents and Mexican dignitaries in celebrating the re-opening of a printing plant that has employed thousands over the years in Sparta.<p>

"With the opening of Sparta International Printing Co. we congratulate a community and region that never lost hope despite the serious economic setback suffered early this year," the Governor said.  "We also pay tribute to our international partner in this endeavor, Grupa Serla of Mexico, which saw the wisdom in establishing a new printing firm here."<p>

Sparta International Printing Co. (SIPCO), a subsidiary of Grupa Serla, will employ 24 initially and as many as 200 within a year.  The printing plant formerly housed Spartan Printing Co. which went out of business in February after 47 years.  The shutdown put 850 employees out of work.<p>

SIPCO officials say they intend to hire as many dislocated Spartan workers as possible into the new jobs.<p>

The Governor joined other state officials, local leaders, plant workers, officials from Grupo Serla, and Mexico Consul Humberto Zamora-Trevino for the ceremony commemorating SIPCO's opening.<p>

Edgar commended the community for its efforts in finding a buyer for the idled plant.  "You never gave up," he said.  "My administration has bee there for you and, together with our friends at Grupa Serla, we got the job done."<p>

After the Spartan plant closed, the state made available $1 million in Job Training Partnership Act funds to help employees who lost their jobs.<p>

To help the new firm get started, the Edgar administration offered up to $360,000 in Industrial Training Program funds for worker training.  The administration also provided $500,000 in Community Development Assistance Program funds to the City of Sparta for infrastructure needs at the plant.<p>

"Things looked bleak last winter, but this opening represents a solid beginning on the long road back," Edgar said.  "We owe a lot to the opportunities presented by the NAFTA agreement in 1993.  NAFTA made the result we see here today possible.  We've heard concerns about jobs leaving the United States.  Here's the reality:  A Mexican firm reopens an Illinois plant, hires Illinois workers and looks forward to years of growth.  That's real progress."<p>

DCCA Sponsors Events to Celebrate Illinois Recycling Day
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> --  The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) is sponsoring events in West Peoria and Genoa to celebrate Illinois Recycling Day, October 1, 1996.<p>

"Illinois is proud of its many outstanding recycling programs," said DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone.  "Our efforts to reduce waste and encourage recycling in our homes, schools, offices and factories are increasingly successful, as these events demonstrate.  Illinois Recycling Day is another opportunity to highlight state programs aimed at producing a better environment for all Illinois citizens."<p>

In West Peoria, a ribbon cutting ceremony is scheduled to kick-off West Peoria's new curbside recycling program.  The City of West Peoria, Illinois' newest municipality, used an $18,000 DCCA grant to purchase recycling bins and to support the project's educational and promotional efforts.  The bi-weekly program will provide all residents of West Peoria the opportunity to recycle a full spectrum of recyclable commodities, including newspaper, plastics, glass and metals.<p>

In Genoa, a ribbon cutting and dedication ceremony is planned at Pace Mat, Inc., a scrap tire-derived material mat production facility.  Pace Mat received a $500,000 DCCA grant to purchase hydraulic presses, tool and die equipment and other related equipment to produce scrap tire-derived mats and mat type products, including gymnasium mats and noise reduction flooring.  Pace Mat has matched DCCA's grant with more than $1.2 million worth of related equipment, engineering and design work and cash.<p>

"The market for recycled products is growing," said Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, Governor Jim Edgar's senior advisor for economic development.  "State government will continue to work with the recycling industry to develop innovative new ways to meet consumer demand, and at the same time improve the environment for our citizens."<p>

As the lead agency charged with supporting waste reduction and recycling efforts in Illinois, DCCA administers a variety of waste management programs, including the Materials Recycling Grants Program, the Used Tire Recovery Program and School Recycling Grants Program.  For more information on recycling programs, call DCCA at 217/785-2800 (TDD users call 217/785-0211).<p>

Local Officials Urged to Attend Revolving Loan Fund Workshops
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> --  Public officials, bankers, economic development professionals, revolving loan fund administrators and others involved in financing for economic growth are encouraged to attend one of a series of workshops on the management of a successful revolving loan fund system.<p>  

Effective use of revolving loan fund dollars is critical to stimulating job creation and retention in an era of limited financial resources for economic development.  The one-day workshops have been developed to assist administrators and community representatives in designing and administering a successful revolving loan portfolio at the local level.          
Topics to be covered include revolving loan fund design, credit analysis based on sound lending principles, loan closing and documentation, servicing the loan portfolio and tips on working with problem loans.<p>

The first workshop was held September 17 in Crystal Lake.  In addition, workshops are scheduled on October 9 in Effingham, October 23 in Peoria and November 6 in Carterville.<p>

Each of the workshops will cover the same agenda, with representatives from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and the Illinois Revolving Loan Fund Association available to answer questions and discuss strategies.  DCCA and the Illinois Revolving Loan Fund Association are sponsors of the workshops, in cooperation with Western Illinois University.<p>

Governor To Lead Trade Mission to Japan, South Korea, China and Hong Kong
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced he will lead a trade mission to Japan, South Korea, China and Hong Kong in an effort to solidify relations and expand markets for Illinois firms.<p>

The Governor, First Lady Brenda Edgar and representatives from more than two dozen Illinois businesses, trade organizations and labor groups will meet with business and government leaders in the four countries.<p>

Becky Doyle, Director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture, and Norman Sims, Executive Deputy Director of the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, also will be among those accompanying the Governor.<p>

"This mission represents an excellent opportunity for Illinois firms -- large and small -- to explore new market opportunities," the Governor said.  "The countries we'll be visiting are particularly interested in Illinois products and technological assistance in a variety of industrial areas, including our state's number one industry, agriculture."<p>

In each country, the delegation will meet with industrial leaders whose firms have facilities or subsidiaries in Illinois, or who seek to expand trade with Illinois firms.<p>

The delegation leaves for Japan on September 15.  The Japan visit includes a tour and address on the campus of Southern Illinois University - Nakajo campus.  SIU President Ted Sanders will host the Governor's visit there.<p>

Edgar and the Governor of Niigata, Japan, are expected to reaffirm the Niigata-Illinois Educational and Economic Development Council agreement that was signed during the 1980s.  <p>

The slate of industrial meetings in Japan includes talks with leaders of Koito, parent company to Illinois-based North American Lighting, and of Mitsubishi Motors, which oversees several Illinois-based facilities.<p>

In South Korea, the Governor will meet with Prime Minister Soo Sung Lee, and with U.S. Ambassador James Laney.<p>

In South Korea, the mission also will meet with the chairman of Samsung, which recently announced a distribution center in Bolingbrook, and with the chairman of Lucky Goldstar, which owns controlling shares in Zenith Corporation, a Chicago-based firm.<p>

The trip to China includes meetings with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, and a Chinese vice premier.<p>

In China, the delegation's schedule includes visits with officials from Motorola, Deere & Co., and Ameritech.<p>

In Hong Kong, Edgar will meet with Gov. Chris Patten, and British Trade Commissioner Francis Cornish.<p>

The delegation also has meetings scheduled with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, and China Aerospace International Holdings.  Edgar also will witness the signing of an agreement between DCCA and the Hong Kong Metal Merchants Association.<p>

The delegation is scheduled to return to Illinois September 28.<p>

"We expect this trip, like our previous trade missions to Mexico, Europe and the Middle East, to broaden our export horizons, a long standing priority of our administration," Edgar said.<p>  

"We were pleased to be invited by leaders of each of the countries we'll be visiting.  As we improve our business relations abroad, Illinois' export industry should grow.  That means a stronger Illinois economy, and more good-paying jobs for Illinoisans right here at home."<p>

Edgar Administration Announces Grants to Aid Small Manufacturers in Illinois
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- The Edgar administration announced today that a $2.67 million grant from the National Institute for Standards and Technology, coupled with $1.2 million in state grants, will enable the Illinois Manufacturing Extension Center to expand and improve its technical assistance for small- and mid-sized manufacturers throughout Illinois.<p>
 
IMEC provides a range of technical services to firms, including manufacturing assessment, engineering assistance, modernization demonstrations, support in product and network development, and referrals for services provided by other private firms.<p>

The grants mean greater access and more comprehensive support for all of the nearly 9,700 small and medium-sized manufacturers in Illinois outside the Chicago metropolitan area that are not currently served by the federal government.  The federal grants supplement existing state programs that serve all 24,000 industrial firms in Illinois.<p>

"The manufacturing sector in Illinois is of critical importance to the future of the state's economy," said Dennis Whetstone, director of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, which will provide $600,000 of the state's commitment.  "At the same time, small and medium-sized manufacturers employ large numbers of Illinois workers.  By providing greater support for this crucial segment of our manufacturing base, we will both improve the state's economy and increase the number of good jobs available to Illinois workers."<p>

"The state of Illinois with support form NIST, has invested for more than three years in developing the state's manufacturing service system," said Bob Weinstein, interim executive director for IMEC.  "These investments and the grants announced today will let IMEC be established as an independent, not-for-profit corporation to provide substantive assistance to Illinois manufacturers."<p>

The $2.67 million NIST grant, through the U.S. Department of Commerce, can be awarded annually for up to six years.<p>

The balance of the $1.2 million commitment from the Edgar administration comes through the Illinois Board of Higher Education.  The center also gets about $200,000 in cash grants and fees from private firms, along with about $1.3 million through in-kind contributions from private firms.<p>

The total $2.7 million in state and local support represents the matching funds needed to qualify the center for the $2.67 million federal grant announced today.<p>

The president of the Illinois State Chamber of Commerce, Sally Jackson, applauded the public-private partnership that resulted in the center's expansion.  "I commend Governor Edgar for his strong leadership in forging innovative public-private alliances that will assure continued economic expansion in Illinois," Jackson said.<p>

Bradley University President John Brazil commended the cooperative effort among Illinois businesses, institutions of higher education and the state and federal governments that led to the establishment of IMEC.  "Bradley is proud to have been able to play a facilitating role in the creation of the IMEC," Brazil said.  "We are committed to the success of IMEC and pledge our full cooperation and continuing support for the fulfillment of its mission."<p>

IMEC will be based in Peoria, with sub-centers on the campuses of Bradley University in Peoria, Rock Valley College in Rockford, and Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.  Field extension offices are located in the Quad Cities, Joliet, LaSalle-Peru, Bloomington-Normal, Springfield, and Edwardsville.<p>

The federal grant announced today doubles the center's annual budget.  It will help the center expand its offerings in existing offices and add four new field extension offices.  Areas under consideration for the new offices include Champaign-Urbana, Decatur, Effingham and Quincy.<p>

The expansion means that more than 80 percent of the state's small- and medium-sized manufacturers outside the Chicago area will be within 40 miles of an IMEC office.<p>

"In the first year, we expect to reach at least 1,000 manufacturers in providing some level of service," Weinstein said.  "We expect to link with all the state's small- and medium-sized manufacturers at some point.<p>

"Being part of the national network with NIST allows us to meet the specific needs of our area's smaller manufacturers while leveraging national resources that previously had not been available to us.  In addition to these national resources, the establishment of IMEC brings together a partnership of Illinois higher education institutions, research laboratories, business assistance centers, employer and trade associations and private sector companies who are committed to the continued growth and vitality of Illinois manufacturing," Weinstein said.<p>

Edgar Statement about State & Federal Grants for the Illinois Manufacturing Extension Centers
</h3>

Gov. Jim Edgar issued the following statement about the state and federal grants announced today for the Illinois Manufacturing Extension Center:<p>

"We're delighted that federal officials agree with us that Illinois small and medium-sized manufacturers need and deserve public support as they strive to take full advantage of global market opportunities and grow stronger.<p>

"Only a diverse and supportive economic climate for small businesses can create the good-paying manufacturing jobs Illinoisans need and want.<p>

"This first-year federal grant for the Illinois Manufacturing Extension Center, coupled with the Edgar administration's financial support over the past few years, means our state's small- and medium-sized businesses can enjoy an even more comprehensive level of technical support and assistance as they seek to enhance productivity, improve technology and compete more effectively.<p>

"The establishment of the center as an independent, not-for-profit corporation, and its planned expansion to better serve companies across the state shows the positive impact of public/private partnerships as we in Illinois continue to lead in our efforts to foster innovative, cost-effective ways to help Illinois businesses improve."<p>

Governor Visits Excel Railcar; Notes NAFTA's Benefits to Company
</h3>

<strong>KENNEY, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today commended Excel Railcar Corporation on its success in promoting trade between Illinois and Mexico.  The company, one of the fastest-growing Hispanic companies in the U.S., has been a strong supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).<p>

On a tour of the firm's plant in Kenney today, the Governor also announced new agreements the firm has signed, which will enable Excel to begin exporting Illinois grain and grain products to Mexico next year.<p>

"In supporting passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, we were convinced that the agreement would be important, not just for large exporters, but also for small businesses like Excel Railcar Corporation," the Governor said.  "Excel's experience has shown that our convictions were right on target.  The company is one of our state's most enthusiastic partners as we promote trade between Illinois and Mexico. <p>

"Illinois offers a wide range of personalized assistance to help companies develop their export potential.  From one-on-one assistance through our network of International Trade Centers and NAFTA Opportunity Centers, to participation in trade and catalog shows and trade missions coordinated through our International Business Division and its foreign offices, Illinois is linking businesses with the resources they need to become successful in the global marketplace."<p>
 
Eugene Constance, President of Excel Railcar Corporation, often serves as a consultant to other small businesses entering the Mexican marketplace.  Constance said the state has been instrumental in helping his company broaden trade relationships. 	<p>

"I had the privilege of attending a trade mission to Mexico with Governor Edgar in March," he said.  "The contacts I made during that trade mission have already resulted in inquiries from Mexican companies and other U.S. firms, particularly Illinois firms, that have an interest in exporting to Mexico.  The state's trade office in Mexico City also has been extremely helpful.  Its director, Raymundo Flores, truly has a finger on the pulse of the business climate in Mexico."<p>

Excel Railcar Corporation, headquartered in Naperville, was founded in 1980 to provide railcars on full-service leases for the U.S., Canadian and Mexican markets.  Since then, the company has leased more than 1,500 new and refurbished railcars to companies using them for international service between the U.S. and Mexico.  Its Mexican customers include Cemex (cement), Vitro (glass) and Apasco (cement).  Excel this year also entered the U.S. railcar leasing market.  <p>

Growth led Excel to reactivate its railcar repair facility at Kenney in 1995, enabling the company to refurbish and repair its own fleet and other railcars.  The Kenney plant employs seven and expects to expand to 15 employees in late 1997.  Excel also employs 14 at its Mexico City subsidiary.<p>

Zenith to Expand in Illinois
</h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today joined Peter S. Willmott, Chief Executive Officer and President of Zenith Electronics Corporation, in announcing the company's plan to build a $100 million state-of-the-art, picture tube manufacturing facility in Woodridge, creating about 280 full-time jobs.<p>

The company also will invest $80 million in its Melrose Park manufacturing facility to automate existing television picture tube production lines and to install a new line for computer display tubes (CDTs).  The expansion and modernization program is expected to create 120 new jobs in the Melrose Park plant, where the company currently employs more than 2,800 workers.<p>

"For nearly eight decades, Zenith has been an important member of the Illinois business community," the Governor said.  "In that time, the company has grown to be a worldwide electronics leader that employs more than 4,000 workers in Illinois.<p>

"Obviously, in choosing a location for this expansion, Zenith had many options, both in the U.S. and Mexico.  Its decision to expand in Illinois proves once again that our state has the skilled workers, excellent infrastructure and positive business climate needed by companies growing for the future."  <p>

Willmott commended state and local authorities on their assistance in making the firm's expansion plan possible.  "We at Zenith are proud of our reputation as an Illinois business leader, a reputation that no doubt will be enhanced by our new state-of-the-art operation in Woodridge," Willmott said.  "We appreciate the tremendous assistance from the State of Illinois, Will County and the village on this important Zenith competitiveness initiative."<p>

The new Woodridge facility will enable Zenith to add a new production line in Illinois to make 32- and 35-inch color picture tubes, and ultimately, wide-screen tubes for digital and high-definition television sets.  This, coupled with improvements in the company's Melrose Park plant, will help Zenith be more competitive.<p>

Both the Governor and Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development advisor, met with Zenith officials as the company considered locations.  Kustra said Illinois will provide job training assistance, road improvements and tax incentives to assist Zenith with the expansion.  <p>

"Our state is committed to helping businesses expand and grow in Illinois," Kustra said.  "We have developed programs to build upon our excellent resources to ensure that Illinois remains the location of choice for tomorrow's business leaders."<p>

The Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will provide up to $600,000 in Industrial Training Program (ITP) grant funds over the next two years to assist the company in training its workers.  In addition, the Illinois Department of
Transportation (IDOT) will provide up to $429,000 in Economic Development Program funds to finance 50 percent of the cost of construction of an access road from Internationale Parkway in Woodridge to the new Zenith site.  The Village of Woodridge will also contribute to the road funding and will provide utility tax rebates to the company.  Will County and Valley View School District #365 also have granted property tax relief to Zenith.<p>

The new Woodridge facility will include 325,000 square-feet of floor area on a 70-acre site.  The Melrose Park plant is being expanded by 70,000 square-feet for the new CDT line.  The modernization program there also will include automating various          components of the existing picture tube manufacturing lines.<p>

Zenith Electronics Corporation employs more than 15,000 workers worldwide, including 4,000 in Illinois.  U.S. operations include the company's corporate headquarters and research center in Glenview, the Melrose Park color picture tube plant, and a printed circuit board fabrication plant in Chicago. <p>

Construction is expected to be completed in 1997.<p>

Breakfast Meetings Help Small Businesses Learn About Environmental Compliance, OSHA
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Environmental regulations, safety and health requirements, plus many other local, state and federal requirements, are often seen as burdensome to small businesses and entrepreneurs.  In an effort to help ease compliance and understanding, the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) is teaming with the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) to host a series of regulatory compliance breakfasts in nine locations around the state.<p>

At the breakfast meetings, experts from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency; Illinois State Fire Marshal's office; and DCCA's On-Site Health and Safety Consultation Program, Small Business Environmental Assistance Program and First Stop Business Information Center will discuss environmental compliance and OSHA's most frequently cited standards.  Topics include safety and health training, hazard identification, emergency preparation, the impact of the Clean Air Act amendments on small business, underground storage tank requirements for 1998, an update on the status of the LUST fund, and the new Brownfield legislation's impact on cleanup.<p>

After the presentations, participants will be able to discuss their concerns one-on-one with the regulatory experts.  These informal, confidential consultations will be for informational purposes only.  No punitive actions will be undertaken as a result of the consultations.<p>

The breakfast meetings will begin at 7:30 a.m. and conclude at noon.  Cost to attend is $25.00 per person and  pre-registration is suggested.  To register, or for further information, contact Dave Voepel of the NFIB at 217/523-5471 or Annette Lingleo of DCCA at 800/252-3998 (TDD users call 800/785-6055). <p>

DCCA Welcomes State Fair Visitors to the Ethanol Exposition
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, IL</strong> -- The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) invites fairgoers to visit the Fifth Annual Ethanol Expo and register for a chance to win a John Deere Gator all-terrain vehicle provided by the Illinois Corn Growers' Association, CIBA and Brownfield Network.<p>

The Ethanol Expo will provide fairgoers with free popcorn and ice water, courtesy of Archer Daniels Midland Corporation; Growmark, Inc.; the Illinois Corn Growers' Association; DCCA; the Illinois Department of Agriculture; Midwest Grain Products, Inc.; and Pekin Energy Company.<p>

"Illinois is the leading producer of ethanol fuel in the country," said Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development.  "This exhibit gives visitors a chance to learn more about this clean alternative fuel, and our aggressive promotion and demonstration programs."<p>

Fairgoers can take a break from the heat by sitting in the comfort of the air-conditioned "Corn Bus," one of the 14 ethanol-powered buses currently operating in Peoria.  The Greater Peoria Mass Transit Authority is the first in the nation to use ethanol-fueled buses for transportation.  The Corn Bus operates on 93 percent ethanol and is painted to resemble an ear of corn, serving as a moving reminder of the benefits of ethanol fuel.<p>

Friday August 16, the Expo will feature Ford Motor Company.  On display will be the 1996 flexible-fueled ethanol-powered Ford Taurus.  In addition to the Taurus, the Expo will also feature Ford's recycling display and one of its flexible-fuel vehicle engines.  Ford Motor Company is one of the leading manufacturers using recycled materials in the production of its vehicles.  The Expo also will feature the pre-production E-85 Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck and several E-85 Chevrolet Lumina autos.<p>

The Ethanol Exposition is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily throughout the 1996 Illinois State Fair, August 9-18.<p>

<STRONG>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</STRONG> -- Not-for-profit organizations may receive financial assistance to help them create opportunities for young people to assist with community service work, under a grant program being administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<P>

The Learn and Serve Program grants, awarded to DCCA through the Corporation for National Service, encourage youths to volunteer their services, while helping to improve a community's public safety and increasing young peoples' knowledge of health and wellness issues.<P>

DCCA has received $64,792 to fund the grants, which will pay for activities conducted during the fall and winter months.       "Volunteers are the foundations of our communities," said Dennis R. Whetstone, DCCA Director.  "Service learning programs like this one link academic learning with volunteer community service.  In doing so, we help to instill in our young people an understanding and appreciation of their communities and help them increase their self-esteem and develop the skills they need to become future leaders."<P>

Not-for-profit (IRS 501(c)(3)) organizations are eligible to apply for the grants.  Eligible applicants must partner with a school (K-12) and a for-profit business to ensure community-wide support.  Selected programs are expected to meet a community need by raising safety awareness, decreasing the opportunity for criminal activity, or increasing the knowledge and participation in health and wellness activities in the community.  <P>

The average grant award will range from $2,000 to $7,000.  Eligible applicants must provide a cash or in-kind match of 10 percent.<P>

Applications are due August 30, 1996.  Programs will operate between October 1, 1996 and March 15, 1997.<P>

GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES $3 MILLION GRANT FOR DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION
</h3>





<STRONG>CHICAGO, ILL.</STRONG>  --  Gov. Jim Edgar today announced a $3 million grant to help offset the City of Chicago's expenses for hosting the 1996 Democratic National Convention, bringing the state's total contribution to the event to nearly $7 million. <P>

"Illinois is fortunate to have an opportunity later this month to showcase our State and the City of Chicago to the world," the Governor said.  "It should be a major boost for the local economy, as well with the 35,000 visitors we expect producing $360 million in economic benefits.   <P>

"Our investment in helping the city put on a premier event will pay immediate dividends as the convention takes place.  In the future, tourism should increase because of heightened interest in Chicago and Illinois as travel destinations."<P>

The $3 million grant to the City of Chicago was awarded through the Tourism Private Sector Grant Program, administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), Illinois Bureau of Tourism.  <P>

In addition to the fiscal year 1997 grant announced today, the City of Chicago received $2.75 million in fiscal year 1996 and $1.2 million in fiscal year 1995 for convention activities and planning.<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the grant program is designed to help attract national and international events to Illinois. <P>

"Tourism is a $16 billion industry in Illinois," Kustra said.  "To help keep those numbers growing, this supports public/private partnerships that are key to bringing major conferences, conventions and sporting events to our communities."<P>

The private sector grant program, funded entirely by taxes generated by the hospitality industry, was made possible through legislation approved in 1993 that increased the percentage of the state's hotel/motel tax designated for tourism promotion.  Grants provide a 50/50 match to applicants who can document matching private sector investment.<P>

GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES CREATION OF SMALL BUSINESS ADVISORY COUNCIL
</h3>

<STRONG>CHICAGO, ILL.</STRONG> --  Gov. Jim Edgar today announced the creation of the Illinois Small Business 100, a council of small business owners who reflect the unique diversity of the 617,000 small businesses in Illinois.<P>

"Small businesses are the backbone of the state's economy," the Governor said.  "They play vital roles as job creators, employing millions of Illinois citizens, and they provide tremendous opportunities for those who have the determination to work hard and succeed.  And we are seeing some of the most dramatic growth in small businesses owned by women and minorities.	<P>

"Through this council, my administration is forging an even stronger relationship with small business--one that is designed to foster a better understanding of the ongoing issues and challenges facing this important segment of our economy.  We will work together to promote business growth and expansion in a low-tax, common-sense climate that does not choke economic growth."   <P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the small business council will have the ability to communicate the most pressing concerns of small business directly to state government.<P>

"The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will develop a site on the World Wide Web for the council that will include links to the members' E-mail, business pages, chambers of commerce and trade organizations," Kustra said.  "Members will be regularly polled on regulatory and small business issues, creating a sounding board for sound economic development policies."<P>

In conjunction with announcing the creation of the council,  the Governor also today presented the first Governor's Illinois Business Leadership award to Campagna Turano Bakeries, Inc. of Berwyn.  <P>

In the nearly half century since it was founded, Turano has grown from a small family business into a nationally known company, servicing accounts ranging from fast food outlets to fine dining establishments and from small neighborhood grocery stores to the largest supermarket chains.<P>

ALCOA CHOOSES DANVILLE FOR NEW PLANT SITE
</h3>





<STRONG>SPRINGFIELD, IL</STRONG> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today congratulated Alcoa on the company's decision to invest $48 million in a 165,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Danville, initially creating 35 new jobs with the potential for further growth.<P>

"Illinois is beating the competition for new industry," the Governor said.  "Alcoa reviewed more than 100 sites in five Midwestern states before making a final decision, and we are delighted that this facility is coming to Danville.  Our commitment to providing a skilled workforce and maintaining a high quality of life in our communities played key roles in Alcoa's choice of location."<P>

Alcoa's Aerospace/Commercial Rolled Products Division has purchased nearly 96 acres of land south of I-74 in Danville's Southgate Industrial Park.  The facility will house an automotive aluminum sheet finishing operation and feature state-of-the-art technology and equipment.<P>

Tim Wilkinson, Vice President of the Division, indicated that a site search had been underway since May.<P>

"Our need was for speed and Danville is a community with a vision and the strategies to meet our needs," Wilkinson said.  "The educational facilities are exactly what we need and there is a strong sense of family values here.  Danville is clearly the number one place to build a facility in the Midwest."<P>

Danville Mayor Robert E. Jones and Vicki Stewart, President of the Danville Area Economic Development Council, praised the team effort that brought the facility to Danville.<P>

"Funding and timely completion of all infrastructure to the site was of vital importance to this project," said Stewart.<P>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) will provide funding totaling nearly $1 million for road, sewer and water line development.  DCCA also has committed to provide up to $70,000 in Industrial Training Program (ITP) funds for worker training at the new facility.<P>

Alcoa's expansion is prompted by expected growth in the North American automotive market.  The Danville facility will provide just-in-time delivery to customers in the U.S. and Canada.  <P>

A groundbreaking for the facility is planned later this fall.<P>

WEBER TO EXPAND IN ILLINOIS, CREATE 225 JOBS
</h3>





<STRONG>HUNTLEY, IL</STRONG> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that Palatine-based Weber-Stephen Products Company will invest up to $14 million to build a 300,000 square-foot manufacturing and distribution facility for its barbeque grills, creating 225 jobs and significantly expanding the company's presence in Illinois.<P>

"Illinois continues on a record-setting pace for business expansions and relocations," the Governor said.  "Weber is the most recent company to recognize that our friendly business climate, sophisticated transportation system and support of worker training are excellent reasons to stay and grow in Illinois."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, unveiled the project at ceremonies in Huntley.<P>

"We weekend barbecue experts look for the best grills for our backyards.  When Weber looked around for the best place to expand, Weber found it right in its own backyard.  Today's announcement is a tribute to the strength and productivity of the Illinois workforce," Kustra said.<P>

"We are delighted to be expanding our operations into Huntley and look forward to a long relationship with the village of Huntley," said Jim Stephen, President of Weber-Stephen Products Company.  "We are thankful to the State of Illinois for its assistance."<P>

Huntley Village President Jim Dhamer commended the cooperation of state and local officials in putting the project together.  "Everyone involved in bringing this facility to Huntley put in long hours and showed tremendous determination.  I am thrilled that the Weber-Stephens project will soon become a reality."<P>

In conjunction with The Prime Group, Inc., Weber will build a combined manufacturing facility and Midwest/international distribution facility on the 33-acre site, located two miles north of the Northwest Tollway and Illinois Route 47 in Huntley.  Construction will begin this month with completion of the buildings expected in the second quarter of 1997.<P>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will provide a $287,500 Industrial Training Program grant for worker training at the new facility.  In addition, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) will provide $530,000 for improvements to Illinois Route 47 and construction of Oak Creek Parkway from Rt. 47 to the site.<P>

George Stephen invented Weber Kettle in the late 1950s.  Now headquartered in Palatine, Weber-Stephen manufactures charcoal and gas grills and accessories that are internationally distributed.<P>

<H3 align=center>GOVERNOR AWARDS GRANTS TO ASSIST HOMELESS ILLINOISANS</H3>

<STRONG>SPRINGFIELD, IL</STRONG> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced nearly $1.7 million in grants to assist 50 not-for-profit organizations in 34 communities in providing emergency assistance to homeless people.<P>

"Homelessness is a tragedy that exists in both urban and rural areas," the Governor said.  "We are fortunate to have a number of excellent organizations that provide homeless people with both temporary shelter and services that can help them become self-sufficient.  These grants will help many of the organizations continue to provide these valuable services."<P>

A Hillsboro project is an example.  A Salvation Army survey of agencies and law enforcement officials in Montgomery County found nearly 275 cases of domestic violence had been reported, and more than 300 orders of protection filed during 1995.  The closest available shelter for victims of domestic violence is more than 50 miles away.  The Salvation Army will receive a $73,799 grant to assist in renovating the second floor of its building in Hillsboro to serve as a shelter facility for victims of domestic violence.	<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser on economic development, said the grants were awarded through the Emergency Shelter Grants Program, administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<P>

"Without these grants, many facilities would find it difficult to provide services," Kustra said.  "The grants not only help with essential operating costs, but also help underwrite some of the expenses for food, transportation and medicine, as well as programs designed to help homeless people identify and address their problems."<P>

Federally-funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Emergency Shelter Grants Program provides funding for projects that help homeless people in communities outside Cook County.  Grants are awarded on a competitive basis to projects that demonstrate clear need, an immediate ability to utilize the grant, and complement existing homeless shelter activities.  The maximum grant is $75,000 and must be matched by an equal amount from other sources.<P>

A list of grantees is attached.<P>

<H3 align=center>GRANTS HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
REMOVE ARCHITECTURAL BARRIERS</H3>

<STRONG>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. </STRONG>-- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced grants totaling $1 million to help 15 Illinois communities renovate public buildings to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities.<P>

"Many small communities face financial hardships in renovating public buildings to comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act," the Governor said.  "These grants provide local governments with the funds they need to proceed with the necessary renovations.  We want to ensure that regardless of their disabilities, all citizens may access public services."<P>

The grants are made available through the Removal of Architectural Barriers component of the Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP).  <P>

Projects to renovate the Tuscola Public Library and the Joy Village Hall are examples.  <P>

Tuscola's library was built in 1903 with funds from the Carnegie Foundation.  The historic building is a two-story structure accessible only by stairs, with floors connected by narrow, steep stairways.  The City of Tuscola will receive a $145,000 CDAP grant to assist with the costs of installing an elevator, accessible restrooms, and constructing an accessible parking area.  <P>

Joy's village hall is the location for village board meetings and is the office of the village clerk and president, police department, and maintenance superintendent.  Citizens also pay village utility bills in the building.  The village will receive a $15,000 CDAP grant to install an entrance ramp and handrails, renovate the restroom to make it accessible, and install accessible parking.<P>

"CDAP grants are one of Illinois' most important tools to help small communities meet the needs of their citizens," said Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development.  "This component was developed to ensure that even in small communities, public buildings comply with the provisions under the Americans with Disabilities Act."<P>

The Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) is administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).  Applications for ADA grant funding were awarded following a competitive review that looked at a community's justification of project need, financial need, and eligibility of the activities outlined in the project implementation plans. <P>

Funded with federal block grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), CDAP grants are awarded by DCCA to units of local government with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven large urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD.  The maximum grant available under this component is $150,000.  <P>

<H3 align=center>OUTDOOR RECREATION SUPER STORE EXPECTED TO BOOST ILLINOIS TOURISM</H3>

<STRONG>GURNEE, ILL.</STRONG> --  Gov. Jim Edgar today congratulated Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World on the company's decision to build a 125,000 square foot super store featuring shopping and entertainment facilities at Gurnee Mills Mall.<P>

"Tourism is an important industry in this state and contributes nearly $16 billion to the Illinois economy every year," the Governor said.  "Gurnee Mills Mall has quickly become a leading travel destination, and Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World will lend new appeal for those who enjoy the abundant natural resources of Illinois and the entire Upper Midwest.<P>

"My administration and Bass Pro Shops also share a commitment to conservation programs and encouraging outdoor recreation.  Since 1991, we have significantly expanded opportunities for recreational activities such as fishing and bicycling, and acquired and begun the development of site M in central Illinois, at more than 15,000 acres the largest property for outdoor recreation owned by the state.  Illinois and Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World are a perfect match."<P>

In addition to separate departments for activities such as fishing, hunting and camping, the store will feature such attractions as a four-story natural stone waterfall and a rough-hewn log cabin with a turning waterwheel and stocked trout pond.<P>

The store will be the company's third in the nation and first in the Upper Midwest.  It is expected to open next spring and will employ about 300 workers.<P>

My administration and Bass Pro Shops share a commitment to conservation programs and encouraging outdoor recreation," Edgar said.  "Since 1991, the state has significantly expanded opportunities for recreational activities such as fishing and bicycling.  In addition, we have acquired and begun the development of more than 15,000 acres of site M in central Illinois, the largest property for outdoor recreation and nature presenvation owned by the state.<P>

"Illinois and Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World are a good match because we understand the importance of preserving open space and recreation opportunities for future generations," the Governor said.<P>

The Gurnee Mills Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World will be modeled after the company's flagship store in Springfield, MO, ranked as Missouri's number one tourist attraction with more than four million visitors annually.

Governor Announces $1.3 Million in State Recycling Program Grants
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced more than $1.3 million in grants to help Illinois communities, businesses and organizations expand or establish recycling programs.<p>

"Recycling is an important part of our effort to promote a clean environment," the Governor said.  "These grants will help us reduce our reliance on landfills by encouraging the collection and processing of recyclable commodities and supporting the practice of recycling in the home and workplace."<p>

The grants provide capital needed to improve and expand recycling services to Illinois consumers.<p>

Administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), the grants will fund 30 projects, including residential recycling projects such as curbside and multi-family collection programs, commercial programs for business, health care, educational and recreational facilities, and primary processing facilities.<p>

Grants are awarded competitively and may total no more than 50 percent of a project's cost.  Individuals may receive up to $50,000 for a residential or commercial project, while primary processing facilities may receive up to $100,000.  An amount equal to 10 percent of the money awarded must be used to purchase products containing recycled materials.<p>

DCCA's recycling programs are funded through the Solid Waste Management Fund.  Revenues in the fund are generated by a surcharge on the tipping fee on landfill disposal and are earmarked specifically for the programs. <p> 

Since the recycling grants program began in 1987, more than $12 million in state grants has been awarded to 316 recycling projects -- projects which have attracted more than $52 million in matching funds.  The 30 new projects are expected to attract more than $12.5 million in matching funds.<p>

Governor Announces Grant to Help Displaced Coal Miners
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced the U.S. Department of Labor has approved his request for $5.7 million in federal job training assistance to help more than 400 workers dislocated by the closings of five Southern Illinois coal mines.<p>

"Although we agree that a clean environment is important, the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 have had a devastating effect on the Illinois coal industry," Edgar said.  "We are working diligently to find new markets and explore clean coal technologies that will enable us to regain our market share.  In the meantime, we must ensure that miners who have lost their jobs can receive the training and other services they need to continue to be productive workers."<p>

The $5,755,360 grant was approved by U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich and was allocated from Clean Air-related national reserve funds under Title III of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA).  <p>

The grant is expected to provide services to approximately 416 miners dislocated from the Zeigler Coal Company's Old Ben Mine #24 near Benton and #26 near Sesser, Arch of Illinois' Captain Mine in Percy, Freeman United Coal Company's Orient Mine #6 in Waltonville, and Consolidated Coal Company's Rend Lake Mine near Sesser.<p>  

Job skill assessment, career counseling, job search assistance, relocation assistance, vocational/occupational skills training, on-the-job training, and supportive services such as child care and transportation assistance will be available to dislocated workers.  Because the dislocation was related to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, eligible workers also will receive needs-related payments.  <p>

These payments enable dislocated workers enrolled in training or education programs who have exhausted their unemployment insurance (UI) benefits to continue receiving an amount approximately equal to the UI benefit or the poverty level, whichever is higher.<p>

Training will be administered through the Management, Training and Consulting Corporation (MAN-TRA-CON) Service Delivery Area #25 in Zeigler.<p>

Grant to Help Displaced AATCOM Workers
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that Illinois will work with the State of Missouri to administer a $5.85 million federal grant intended to provide job training and assistance to workers dislocated by the closing of the Army Aviation and Troop Command facility in St. Louis.<p>

"Last year, when the Department of Defense issued its recomendations for base closures, we successful argued the case for keeping several Illinois military facilities open, including Scott Air Force Base and the Rock Island Arsenal," the Governor said.  "Because approximately 800 of the 4,200 workers employed at the AATCOM facility were Illinois workers, we also teamed with the State of Missouri to try to keep that facility open, to no avail.  Now we must do all we can to help the workers being dislocated to find new employment.  <p>

"Illinois officials worked closely with their Missouri counterparts to pursue federal assistance for the workers who will lose their jobs as a result of this closing.  This grant ensures that these workers will be able to access the services they need to find new, productive employment."<p>

Edgar was notified of the grant's approval by U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  Funds were allocated from Title III Defense Conversion Program funds under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA).  The grant is expected to provide services to approximately 1,500 of the 2,000 workers who do not transfer to other defense installations or retire.<p>  

Under terms of the grant agreement, the State of Missouri will receive the grant, and will contract with the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) to provide services to the Illinois workers affected by the closing.  <p>

Services to be provided include assessment of job skills, career counseling, job search assistance, job development and placement, classroom training, on-the-job training, and supportive services such as child care and transportation assistance. <p>

Because the dislocation was related to a base closing, workers can be eligible for assistance up to 24 months prior to the closure date.<p>

Training will be administered through Madison County Employment and Training Department (Service Delivery Area 22) and the St. Clair County Intergovernmental Grants Department (Service Delivery Area 24). <p>

Closure of the U.S. Army Aviation and Troop Command in St. Louis is slated for completion by December 15, 1997.<p>

Governor Approves Sales Tax Break for Oil Drilling, Exploration Equipment
</h3>

<strong>MT. VERNON, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today signed legislation eliminating the sales tax on equipment costing less than $250 used for oil field exploration, drilling and production. <p> 
 
"This legislation will save companies involved in Illinois oil-drilling about $1 million a year, giving them new funds to maintain and expand their investments in Illinois," the Governor said.  "It gives this industry the same tax benefits other industries in Illinois already enjoy."<p>

The legislation, similar to a bill the Governor signed on Monday for the coal industry, eliminates the sales tax on equipment in the oil exploration industry costing less than $250, the same tax advantage given to manufacturers and farmers during the 1980s.  Equipment costing more than $250 already was exempt from the sales tax.<p>

Chief sponsors of the measure, House Bill 2703, were Reps. John Jones (R-Mt. Vernon), Terry Deering (D-DuBois), Mike Bost (R-Murphysboro), Ron Stephens (R-Troy), Gwenn Klingler (R-Springfield) and Thomas Holbrook (D-Belleville) and Sens. Harry "Babe" Woodyard (R-Chrisman) and William O'Daniel (D-Mt. Vernon).<p>

It is effective immediately.<p>

Edgar Signs Kustra-Backed Coal Legislation; Measure Provides Tax Relief
</h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, Ill.</strong> -- Lt. Governor Bob Kustra today lauded Governor Jim Edgar for signing into law coal legislation granting tax fairness and relief to Illinois' coal producers.<p>

The legislation is a product of Kustra's "Coal Strategy Group" formed in 1995 to identify ways to improve the economic viability of Illinois coal.  The group is comprised of leaders of the Illinois Coal Association, United Mine Workers of America and state agencies.<p>

"Our coal producers and miners are doing their best to meet the current challenges of today's marketplace," said Kustra.  "The tax savings will help to make the cost of Illinois coal more competitive with Western coal and encourage coal producers to invest in new equipment."<p>

The legislation signed by the Governor removes a current 6.25 percent tax on purchases of coal mining equipment and spare parts valued at less than $250.  Kustra noted that similar thresholds on the purchase of farm and manufacturing equipment were removed by the legislature in the 1980s.<p>  

"Today we are extending the same tax fairness enjoyed by other Illinois industries to coal.  I am grateful to Governor Edgar, the legislature and members of the Coal Strategy Group for making today's signing a reality," said Kustra.  "The elimination of this use tax is the first of many recommendations the strategy group will make as we look to improve the economic viability of Illinois coal and work to ensure its positive impact on our local communities."<p>

Kustra also commended the legislation's chief sponsors, Senator Dave Luechtefeld (R-Okawville) and Representative Mike Bost (R-Murphysboro) for securing legislative passage of the measure.<p>

Governor Signs Tax Relief Bill for Illinois Coal Industry
</h3>

     <strong>CARBONDALE, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today signed legislation saving Illinois coal producers about $2.5 million a year by eliminating the remaining sales tax on coal mining equipment and spare machinery parts.<p>

     "The coal industry in Illinois continues to face some very tough challenges," the Governor said.  "This legislation gives our coal producers the same tax benefits other industries already enjoy, and these tax savings will free up capital resources for maintenance, investment and potential expansion."<p>

     The legislation, developed by a coal task force organized by Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, eliminates the sales tax on coal mining equipment costing less than $250, the same tax advantage given to manufacturers and farmers during the 1980s.  Equipment costing more than $250 already was exempt from the sales tax.<p>

     "This legislation is good for Illinois coal miners, it is good for Southern Illinois, and it is good for Illinois as a whole," Edgar said.<p>

     Edgar noted the Illinois coal industry has annual sales of about $1.5 billion and employs more than 6,600 workers in the state.  Another 20,000 jobs are supported by the coal industry.<p>

     "Today's bill signing is the best example of the good that comes when industry, labor and government work together to keep our workers and industries competitive," Kustra said.  "I am grateful to Gov. Edgar, the legislature and members of the coal strategy group for making this a reality."<p>

     Chief sponsors of the legislation, Senate Bill 1361, were Sens. Dave Luechtefeld (R-Okawville), Bill O'Daniel (D-Mt. Vernon), and Jim Rea (D-Christopher) and Reps. Mike Bost (R-Murphysboro), Bill Black (R-Danville), Terry Deering (D-Nashville), John Jones (R-Mt. Vernon) and Ron Stephens (R-Troy).<p>

     It is effective immediately.<p>

State to Assist Mine Workers Affected by CIPS Fuel Switch
</h3>

     <strong>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today directed the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES) to move immediately to assist workers affected by Central Illinois Public Service Co.'s plan to cease taking delivery of high-sulfur coal from the Delta mine near Harrisburg.<p>

     "Our response to this announcement is already underway," the Governor said.  "State government agencies will coordinate efforts to begin providing unemployment and job training assistance to the Delta mine workers, and we have applied for federal assistance under provisions of the Clean Air Act.<p>

     "While we applaud CIPS's effort to lower customers' utility costs, we are disappointed that it comes at the expense of Illinois mine workers and their families.  My administration is committed to finding new markets and exploring new technology that will shape a brighter future for the Illinois coal industry."<p>

     CIPS announced today that it will switch to burning out-of-state coal at its Newton Power Station Unit 1 in Jasper County.  CIPS had purchased 1.3 to 1.5 million tons of coal annually from the Delta mine of Amax Coal Co., a Cyprus Amax Minerals company.<p>

     Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, explained that once the displaced workers are identified, DCCA will deploy a Rapid Response Team to visit the Delta mine and conduct pre-layoff meetings.<p>

     "Services provided to Delta workers will include assessments of job related skills, job development, search and placement, and supportive services such as child care and transportation allowances," Kustra said.  "Workers will also have access to classroom and vocational training, and IDES will make staff available for on-site filing of unemployment claims."<p>

Governor Congratulates Illinois Company for Largest Stamping Press Built in North America
</h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, ILL. </strong>- Gov. Jim Edgar today congratulaed Chicago-based Allied Products Corporation on the production of the largest automotive production presses ever built in North America, an order that added 100 jobs to the company's payroll.<p>

Three of the giant "A"-sized presses will be manufactured by Allied's Verson Division on Chicago's southeast side, two for shipment to a Chrysler production plant in Mexico and the third for use at Chrysler's Belvidere plant in northern Illinois.<p>

"The critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement argued it would cause the United States to export jobs across the border," the Governor said.  "Today is proof that NAFTA is creating good jobs for Illinois workers.  We are producing the goods that are necessary to produce goods throughout the world."<p>

"Illinois is an international powerhouse in the production of industrial machinery," Edgar said.  "Allied has made a tremendous contribution to our global reputation by being the first North American manufacturer of the "A"-size press, the largest machine tool made."<p>

Stamping presses make parts, such as fenders and hoods, from flat sheets of metal, usually steel.  The size and weight of 12 railroad locomotives, the presses are used primarily to make large body parts for automobiles and trucks.<p>

"We are also proud that Chrysler plans to use one of these presses at the Belvidere plant right here in Illinois and that two Illinois-made presses will be shipped to Mexico," Edgar said.   "This is a significant example of how the lowering of trade bariers is creating economic opportunity for Illinois companies and their workers."<p>

In 1995, the export of industrial machinery by Illinois companies reached $8.3 billion dollars, a 15 percent increase over 1994.<p>

Allied Products CEO Richard A. Drexler said the quality of the Illinois workforce has been a leading factor in the company's success.<p>

"Allied Products has been headquartered in Illinois for more than 30 years," Drexler said.  "The superb teamwork of our employees and our suppliers, coupled with the support of state and local governments, has enabled us to attain this milestone."<p>

The Verson Division of Allied Products Corporation is the only remaining American-owned-and-operated builder of heavy metal-forming presses.  Approximately 650 people are employed at the company's Chicago headquarters and manufacturing facility.<p>

Hometown Awards Honor Contributions of Local Volunteers
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> --  Gov. Jim Edgar tonight congratulated winners in the 15th annual Governor's Home Town Awards, which recognize volunteer efforts that better the quality of life in Illinois communities.<p>

"Illinoisans have a strong sense of community," the Governor said.  "If there is a problem to be solved, or work to be done, we accept the challenge of changing things for the better.  Even the simplest project can make a difference in the lives of our fellow citizens. The volunteers honored with these awards have planted gardens, tutored students, sponsored plays and festivals, and built libraries, shelters and police stations.  They are an inspiration to us all, and this is our opportunity to show our appreciation for their efforts."<p>

The Governor's Cup, a traveling silver trophy, was awarded to Woodford County for its "Heart House" project, selected as this year's project most representative of the spirit of volunteerism in Illinois.<p>

Four years ago, a group of concerned citizens representing various religions came together to discuss establishing a homeless shelter in Woodford County.  Funded with donations, Heart House was opened in a former fraternity house near the Eureka College campus.<p>

When the fraternity decided to reactivate its chapter, the Heart House board decided to build a new shelter.  Hundreds of volunteers, including civic groups, labor unions and school groups, donated funds and assisted with the construction of the new facility, performing tasks from painting to carpentry.  The result is a homeless shelter valued at more than twice its cost that provides needed services totally without tax support.<p>

In all, the Governor presented awards to 73 projects.  In addition, a special award was presented to Palos Hills, which has received an award every year since the program's inception.<p>

The Governor's Hometown Awards competition is administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<p>

More than a hundred applications were submitted applications for this year's awards.  A group of volunteer judges reviewed the applications, judging them on the basis of local need and participation, continuity of the project and results.  The judges personally visited the communities they selected as finalists before making the final ranking decisions.<p>

Awards were presented in eight categories based on community participation.  Eligible projects involve economic development, community service, community facilities, human enrichment, achievements for or by youths and achievements for or by senior citizens.<p>

First place winners of general awards, youth awards, senior awards and economic development awards received commemorative plaques and road signs recognizing their achievements.  Second, third and fourth-place winners received plaques.<p>

Governor Announces Water and Sewer Planning Grants
</h3>

SPRINGFIELD, IL - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced 26 communities throughout Illinois will share $500,000 in Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) grants to help fund planning activities for local water and sewer system improvements.<p>

"Adequate infrastructure is the foundation of community development," the Governor said.  "Improvements to local water and sewer systems enhance a ocmmunity's quality of life and its ability to attract and retain business.  These planning grants help local governments through the first stage of that improvement process."<p>

Edgar said a project in eastern Illinois is an example.<p>

Champaign County applied on behalf of the unincorporated area of Wilbur Heights for a sewer study.  The low-income neighborhood of approximately 80 homes is served by private septic systems, which are experiencing difficulties due to the soil type and small lot sizes.  Alternatives to the individual septic systems will be studied, including connection to existing treatment facilities in a neighboring city.<p>

Units of local goverment may apply ofr up to $25,000 for planning activities which will result in infrastructure improvements to water, sanitary or storm sewer systems.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said CDAP funds are especially important to smaller communities.<p>

"Infrastructure improvements are expensive," Kustra said.  "This program helps to remove the financial barriers a small community may face in upgrading their water and sewer systems."<p>

CDAP grants are funded with federal block grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  They are awarded by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs to units of local government with population of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven large urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD.<p>

At least 51 percent of a proposed project's beneficiaries must be people with low or moderate incomes.<p>

A list of communities receiving CDAP Planning Assistance is below.<p>

Governor Joins in Groundbreaking for $37.5 Million SuperValu Distribution Center
</h3>

     <strong>OGLESBY, Ill.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today joined company and local officials in breaking ground for a $37.5 million Supervalu Inc. regional distribution center in Oglesby, serving a dozen states and creating more than 275 new jobs.<p>

     "This project is a terrific example of the economic development potential of Illinois' smaller communities," the Governor said.  "Our central location, high-quality transportation system and commitment to investing in infrastructure improvements continue to be major factors in attracting distribution centers and other facilities to Illinois. <p>

     "Supervalu expects to become the largest employer in the Oglesby area, with the likelihood of additional expansion.  State and local officials worked closely with this company to give Oglesby and the entire Illinois River Valley a significant economic boost."<p>

     Plans call for the 308,000 square-foot facility in LaSalle County to distribute more than 11,400 general merchandise and health and beauty care items to 1,500 stores in 12 states served by Minneapolis-based Supervalu, a leading food distribution company and the nation's 14th largest food retailer.<p>

     Jeff Noddle, President and Chief Operating Officer of Supervalu's wholesale food companies, said the new facility is an essential component in the company's plans for the future.  <p>

     "Supervalu's new multi-tiered distribution network will make major changes in the way food is distributed to our customers, and we believe ultimately this will have an effect on food distribution in this country," Noddle said.  "Today we celebrate the realization of many hours of hard work and much support from the State of Illinois, Oglesby Mayor Greg Cullinan, and many other representatives of Oglesby."<p>

     Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor on economic development, said the resources of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) were tapped to assist in the project.<p>

     "Our assistance with these infrastructure improvements was one of the key factors in bringing Oglesby and Supervalu together," Kustra said.  "Sanitary sewer, water main and roadway improvements are required to build and operate this facility."<p>

     DCCA will award the City of Oglesby a $500,000 Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) grant to help fund the improvements.  <p>

     The Illinois Department of Transportation has committed $1.2 million in Economic Development Funds toward the cost of improving County Highway 23 and Mallick Road that will provide access to the Supervalu facility.<p>

     The roadwork includes intersection improvements at County Highway 23 and Mallick, new traffic signals and drainage work along Mallick Road.  In addition, a Tax Increment Financing District was created at the local level to facilitate the project.<p>

     The Midwest distribution center is the second of three Supervalu regional distribution facilities to be developed as part of the company's strategic reinvention, a multi-year process called ADVANTAGE from Supervalu.<p>

     Construction on the Oglesby site will begin immediately.  The company expects to begin shipping from the new facility in early 1998.<p>

Governor Joins in Opening of New Ameritech Cellular Services Facility
</h3>

<em>RANTOUL, IL</em> - Gov. Jim Edgar today joined in ceremonies marking the official opening of a $2 million Ameritech Cellular Services call center at the former Chanute Air Base in Rantoul that is expected to create as many as 200 new jobs.<p>

"This facility is another milestone in Chanute's economic comeback," the Governor said.  "Working as a team, we have made aggressive efforts at the state and local levels to market the redevelopment potentials of Chanute, and those efforts are being rewarded with the creation of new jobs.<p>

"Ameritech has also cited the quality of the workforce in the Rantoul area as one reason it chose to locate here.  I am delighted that a company with Ameritech's record of excellence in customer service has given central Illinois worker such a strong vote of confidence."<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the opening of the Ameritech facility is another indicator of the healthy economic climate in Illinois.<p>

"Ameritech has recognized our efforts to make Illinois a great place to do business for their company, and for the increasing number of companies which rely on access to state-of-the-art communications technology," Kustra said.  "Our strong economy has helped companies such as Ameritech market their products to Illinois customers, which in turn has produced the need for expansion, and new job opportunities for our citizens."<p>

Explosive growth in the number of cellular and paging customer s in central Illinois prompted Ameritech Cellular Services to search for a site for the call center.  Chanute's 90,000 square foot former weather training facility underwent extensive renovation to create the new center.<p>

"Rantoul is thrilled with Ameritech's investment at the Aviation Center," said Rantoul Mayor Katy Podagrosi.  "I hope that Ameritech Cellular continues its growth here and throughout the region."<p>

The center is expected to provide 150 jobs by the end of 1997, and eventually in expected to employ as many as 200 people.<p>

"Ameritech's growth and investment in Rantoul reflects the leadership of Gov. Edgar and the General Assembly in developing a fully open and competitive telecommunications marketplace," said Doug Whitley, president of Ameritech Illinois.<p>

"Ameritech commends that leadership and the investment that the state itself is making to help train our expanding work force in Rantoul."<p>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will provide up to $210,000 in worker training funds through the Industrial Training Program (ITP).<p>

Responding to billing inquiries and fulfilling customer requests such as the addition of new cellular features are among the services to be provided by Ameritech paging and cellular associates.  Requests from central Illinois customer were previously routed to operations in Chicago.<p>

Lt. Governor Kustra Announces Production of Chrysler Neon for Overseas Markets
</h3>

<em>BELVIDERE, IL</em> - Lt. Governor Bob Kustra today joined Chrysler officials at the Belvidere Assembly Plant to unveil a new right-hand-driven Dodge and Plymouth Neon designed for export to overseas markets.<p>

"Consumers in the global marketplace have come to expect quality and value when they purchase products made in Illinois," said Kustra, who heads economic growth and job creation efforts in Illinois.  "With record-setting exports in 1995 of $32.6 billion, Illinois has become a leader in producing the goods and services in demand abroad.  I am confident the new Neon will be another example of the manufacturing excellence of our Illinois companies and workers."<p>

The Belvidere Chrysler facility will be able to produce approximately 90 right-hand-drive models daily, or 32,000 annually, for shipment to markets in eight counties: Japan, Australia, United Kingdom, South Africa, New Zealand, Cyprus, Cayman Islands, and Thailand.<p>

Chrysler invested more than $500 million in the plant to produce the first Neon, which rolled off the Belvidere assembly line in November of 1993.  The company subsequently announced plans to invest an additional $20 million in capital improvements and add 300 jobs at the Belvidere facility.<p>

Kustra noted that the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) has provided $5.9 million dollars in Industrial Training Program (ITP) funds to ensure employees of the Belvidere plant have the necessary skills to work in state-of-the-art auto plant.<p>

"Chrysler made a tremendous commitment to Illinois when the Belvidere plant was retooled to build the Neon," Kustra said.  "Our commitment was to provide Chrysler workers with the hi-tech skills needed to build the best possible automobiles.  It was a win-win proposition, and we are seeing the results in this announcement."<p>

The Chrysler Belvidere plant currently employs 3,700 workers and produces approximately 267,000 Dodge and Plymouth Neons annually.<p>

"The addition of right-hand-drive Neons to Belvidere will add incremental units to our production, but it means more than that," said Belvidere Assembly Plant Manager John Felice.  "Our ability to produce left and right-hand drive vehicles on the same line affords us additional flexibility in terms of responding to the global marketplace." <p>

Governor Announces Buyer for Spartan Printing Plant
</h3>

<em>SPRINGFIELD, IL</em> - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that a Mexican company will invest $6 million in the purchase of the former Spartan Printing facility in Sparta, Illinois, creating 300 new jobs and ensuring the continued  economic health of the southern Illinois community.<p>

"This is great news for Sparta and southern Illinois," the Governor said.  "The closure of Spartan printing was a severe blow to this small community, but our determination to find a buyer for the facility and provide new job opportunities for the affected workers has paid off.<p>

"My administration has also recognized the importance of maintaining excellent economic relationships with our top trading partners, including Mexico.  I am pleased that those ties have contributed to creating more Illinois jobs."<p>

Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V. will invest $1 million in the purchase of the Spartan Printing facility.  The company will also invest a minimum of $5 million in the purchase of state-of-the-art printing equipment.<p>

Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V. will be eligible for up to $360,000 in Industrial Training Program (ITP) funds provided by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).  Grupo Serla will be encouraged to make every effort to re-employ individuals previously employed at the Spartan Printing Company.  In addition, DCCA will provide a list of those employees to Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V. for consideration for re-employment.<p>

Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V. is also eligible for up to $500,000 in Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) funds.  The funds would be granted to the City of Sparta, which in turn would loan the funds to Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V.<p>

Spartan Printing shut down earlier this year, laying off more than 800 workers by early February.<p>

DCCA has received $1 million in federal emergency funding from the U.S. Department of Labor to assist dislocated workers in returning to the workforce.<p>

Governor Edgar directed his staff to become personally involved in the negotiations leading to the purchase of Spartan Printing, including traveling to Mexico City to conclude an agreement.<p>

Lt. Gov Awards Grants for Multi-Company Network Demonstration Project
</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, IL </strong> --  Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra has announced that multi-company network demonstration project grants have been awarded to the Center for Governmental Studies at Northern Illinois University and the Illinois Chamber of Commerce.<p>

"This initiative is designed to improve the competitiveness of Illinois' small, medium-sized and mature firms," said Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development.  "In multi-company networks, firms join forces to accomplish what they cannot do on their own." <p>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) administers the program.  DCCA Director Dennis R. Whetstone explained that two key types of assistance are emphasized in the projects.<p>  

"Network broker training will prepare individuals to act as leaders in establishing manufacturing networks," Whetstone said.  "The brokers will link manufacturing firms to each other in order to promote cooperation.<p>

"Network planning and development will provide for activities which increase the capacity of firms across the state to establish networks or better operate existing networks, which then link them to key markets or public sources of assistance." 	<p>

The Illinois Chamber will oversee the Southern Illinois Linkage Study Project, which will receive $85,000 to inventory, classify and analyze the existing products, manufacturing processes, inputs and outputs of the manufacturing sector in the southernmost 30 counties in Illinois.<p>  

"Assisting businesses in the Southern Illinois region is a major priority for the Illinois Chamber," said Sally A. Jackson, President and CEO of the Chamber.  "We commend the participants for taking this progressive step in economic development.  More business and job creation are our goals, and we are very happy to have a leadership role in this effort."<p>

The results of the inventory will be linked to DCCA's Industry Analysis System, in order to provide a more comprehensive database for brokers and firms to use in building networks.<p>   	

The project is a partnership between the Illinois Chamber, Southern Illinois manufacturers, Central Illinois Public Service Company, Illinois Power, GTE, Carbondale Business Development Corporation, Williamson County Marketing Committee, and the Electric Cooperatives of Southern Illinois.<p>  

The Center for Government Studies at Northern Illinois University will receive $69,920 over two years to deliver broker training services.  The Center will utilize the services of USNet, a program which will supply consultants to train brokers and Center staff.  The Center will coordinate and facilitate broker training, provide technical assistance to networks, and conduct other activities to encourage the development of multi-company networks across the state.<p>  

The grant also serves as the required matching funding for a federal grant which has been provided to USNet to assist states in multi-company network development.<p>

Once the demonstration projects are concluded, the techniques learned will be transferred to local and regional economic development organizations to help them incorporate network development in their day-to-day operations. <p>	  

Anyone interested in further information about the demonstration projects may contact DCCA's Office of Program and Policy Development at 217/524-5696 or TDD 800/785-6055.<p>

Governor Unveils New Economic Development Web Site
</h3>

<em>CHICAGO, ILL.</em> -  Gov. Jim Edgar today unveiled a World Wide Web site that puts Illinois' technology and economic resources at the fingertips of manufacturers.<p>

"Illinois is becoming a national leader in developing unique ways to encourage economic development," Governor said.  "The new Illinois web site, using the technology of the Internet, will help companies locate and utilize sources of technical and business modernization assistance that can help them become more competitive.<p>

"It will help market the products of Illinois suppliers to manufacturers in the state and throughout the world.  It promotes economic development through a unique partnership between the public and private sectors, and it sends a clear signal that Illinois cares about manufacturing and is open for business."<p>

The site, designed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is the first of its type in the country to be electronically connected to a major on-line manufacturing publisher.<p>

The URL address for the site is http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/illcoalition.  Under an agreement with Thomas Regional Directory Company, Inc., Illinois will be the first state in the nation to connect its technology and business resources for manufacturers to the new on-line version of the Thomas Regional Electronic Directory for the North Central Tri-State Region, the publisher's popular industrial buying guide for Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana.<p>

"When I talked about this new venture in my State of the State address in January, I said i  will help attract new industry and jobs to Illinois by publicizing the expertise and skilled workers readily available from our universities and colleges, Argonne, Fermilab and other institutions," Edgar said.  "I am confident this one-stop shopping site will help make Illinois even more attractive to business expansion and job growth."<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development, said the site creates a virtual work space for manufacturers.<p>

"When fully completed by June, the site will enable interested companies to learn about the broad range of technical and business modernization assistance offered to small and medium-sized manufacturers through COMPETE, Illinois' statewide manufacturing extension network," Kustra said.  "Another highly innovative feature of the site is its direct connection to an electronic database providing a comprehensive listing of the technology resources in Illinois of use to manufacturers."<p>

The database is being developed with $175,000 in state grant funds by Argonne National Laboratory and more than 30 universities, community colleges, laboratories, research institutions and industrial organizations, collectively called the Manufacturing, Engineering, Research and Training Coalition (MERTC).  When finished this summer, the MERTC database will enable manufacturers to search a broad range of topics, such as computer-aided design, environmental issues in manufacturing, quality control and ISO-9000 certification.<p>

Users visiting the on-line version of the Thomas Regional Electronic Network Directory (TREND) industrial buying guide will be able to review and order the products and services of thousands of Illinois manufacturers.  They will also be able to click on buttons throughout the site marked "Illinois Manufacturing On-Line" that connect them to the COMPETE web site.  Likewise, manufacturers using the COMPETE web site can directly connect to TREND.<p>

"The two-way Internet traffic between TREND and COMPETE will increase the use of both sites and will make it easier for manufacturers to access the Illinois resources and products that can help improve their business performance, " Edgar said.  "This project is the ultimate in one-stop shopping and confirms that Illinois is a leader in the use of technology to encourage job creation and economic growth.<p>

KUSTRA ANNOUNCES JOB RETENTION INITIATIVE
</h3>

<em>CHICAGO, ILL.</em> - Citing recent pro-business legislation and national studies that rank Illinois as a top location for business expansion, Lt. Governor Bob Kustra today announced a new initiative to retain Illinois jobs by alerting companies to new advantages to staying in Illinois.<p>

"In recent weeks, three national surveys ranked Illinois and the Chicago area among the top locations for business growth, "Kustra said.  "A few months ago, Industry Week magazine did the same.  There has been a sea-change in business that keeps getting better."<p>

"Illinois companies considering a relocation or other change affecting Illinois jobs could be strongly influenced by the vote of confidence expressed in these impartial survey results.  In the next year, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) will contact 1,000 Illinois businesses to make sure they've heard about the great new business climate in Illinois, the new legislation enacted and the consistently high rankings we have earned.<p>

"By analyzing Dunn and Bradstreet data and looking at sales trends, we will target companies that are likely to outgrow their current facilities or show other potential need for the state's attention.  We'll make sure they know what they already have here in Illinois, and we'll make sure they know how DCCA can help them prosper in the years to come."<p>

The surveys reflecting Illinois' economic strength are:<p>
	
CFO Magazine, in January 1996, ranked Illinois among the top ten states for effective business retention strategies.  Said CFO: "Some states are doing a better job at (business retention) than others... While there is no way to scientifically rank the quality of retention efforts... 10 states, based on interviews with tax experts, stand out for their diligent efforts to cater to home-based companies."<p>

Site Selection Magazine last month published its annual survey of business relocations and expansions.  Illinois ranked in the top five, up form 21st just two years ago.  The Chicago metropolitan area ranked first in the nation among metro regions.<p>

Atlas Van Lines, the moving company, in recent weeks released a study of corporate executive relocations it was hired to perform.  The Chicago metro area ranked among the top destinations for corporate executives.<p>

Industry Week Magazine last summer surveyed its readers.  Illinois was preferred as a relocation and expansion site more than any other Midwest state, ahead of Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin.  Chicago was ranked as the third-most-popular city in the nation, beating out 16 other cities.<p>
	
"Taken together these surveys show an indisputable trend," Kustra said.  "We are reaping the benefits of our economic development policies emphasizing the things most important to business retention growth-including worker training, infrastructure improvement, export development, regulatory reform, and high-technology initiatives.<p>

"New legislation enacted in Springfield has given our state the most aggressive business growth strategy in a generation.  We are attacking unemployment insurance and workers comp cost. We are putting a stop to silly lawsuits without sacrificing legitimate legal rights.  We are holding the line on taxes.  Illinois has a whole new environment for business growth and we need to make sure business knows it," Kustra said.<p>

COMMERCE AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS TO INVEST IN BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, WORKER TRAINING AND TOURISM
</h3>

<em>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</em> - Gov. Jim Edgar today recommended a $774.6 million budget for the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) to help Illinois businesses continue to thrive and increase their export capability in a strong and expanding state economy.<p>

The budget will provide additional assistance to business, invest more dollars in worker training, maintain community development projects and promote tourism throughout the state.<p>

"The Illinois economy is very healthy," the Governor said.  "In the past year, we have seen our unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in two decades.  Some of our most prominent corporate citizens, including Motorola and McDonald's, have announced major expansions, and national studies have ranked Illinois and the Chicago metropolitan area among the most attractive in the country for business expansions and relocations.<p>

"To continue our economic momentum and increase our competitiveness, we must be willing to renew our commitment to invest in the services and programs that have encouraged growth.  This budget allows us to train more Illinois worker, improves our ability to help companies and communities seeking assistance and expands our highly successful tourism promotion efforts."<p>

The Fiscal Year 1997 budget request includes $40.2 million in general revenue funds.  The budget also includes $600.4 million in federal funds and $134 million in other state funds.<p>

A highlight of the fiscal 1997 budget request is $39.2 million to fund business development programs.  The Regional Industry Development and Building and Sites initiative is designed to enhance DCCA's working relationships with local economic development officials and improve responsiveness to all in-coming business expansion, retention and location inquiries.  The Building and Sites component will allow the department to more accurately represent facilities and development sites to business prospects.<p>

"This budget makes an important investment in our businesses and our workers," said Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser for economic development.  "Increased funding for worker training will help keep businesses in Illinois and make our workforce more competitive.  Worker training funds suffered severe cuts in the early '90s, but this increase recognizes many of our recent successes are due in large part to productive and well-trained workers."<p>

The high quality of the Illinois workforce is a key factor in business expansion and retention.  To keep pace with the demand for worker training, funding for the Industrial Training Program (ITP) will total $15 million, and increase of $2.75 million.<p>

"As technology in the workplace has advanced, so has the need for worker training," said DCCA director Dennis Whetstone.  "The ITP program has been highly successful in ensuring that the quality of Illinois workers is second to none, providing direct grants to individual companies and supporting multi-company networks of small and medium-sized suppliers.  This increase will give nearly 5,000 workers at approximately 350 companies the opportunity to upgrade their job skills."<p>

DCCA's International Business Division will use a budget allocation of $3.5 million to promote the exporting of Illinois goods and services throughout the international marketplace.<p>

An additional $200,000 in funding is provided to continue technology transfer and business modernization efforts provided for in the state's Technology Advancement and Development Act.<p>

The request also includes $2.3 million to fund the state's network of Small Business Development Centers, which provide one-on-one assistance to entrepreneurs.<p>

In addition, DCCA's fiscal 1997 budget request projects $237.2 million for federally funded Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs, which assist dislocated workers, economically disadvantaged youths and adults, older workers, and other who face barriers to employment.<p>

Tourism and film programs will receive $33.4 million under the Governor's budget proposal.  An increase of $1.4 million in tourism promotion funds, generated exclusively by the Illinois hospitality industry, will be used by the Bureau of Tourism to attract major national and international events to the state, develop a heritage-cultural tourism program, increase individual contact with Illinois travelers through a direct marketing effort and handle increasing call volume to the 1-800-2CONNECT hotline.<p>

In addition, $13.6 million has been allocated to administer the Office of Energy Conservation, promoting the efficient and environmentally safe use of Illinois' energy resources.<p>

Appropriations for community development programs that assist low-income Illinoisans and provide services to local governments are proposed at $376.7 million.<p>

The budget proposal also includes $17.8 million for Coal Marketing and Development, of which $2 million will leverage more than $9 million in federal funds for a low emission boiler demonstration project to promote the continued use of Illinois' vast coal resources.  The budget also includes $600,000 in coal bond funding for an ethanol-powered fuel cell bus project and a corn-to-ethanol research pilot plant.<p>

GOVERNOR'S EXPORT AWARDS
</h3>

<em>CHICAGO, ILL.</em> - Gov. Jim Edgar today urged Illinois businesses and trade organizations to apply for the 1996 Governor's Export Awards.<p>

"International trade is one of the foundations of the Illinois\rquote  economic growth," the Governor said.  "The Governor's Export Awards recognize companies that have made outstanding contributions to this key segment of Illinois' diverse economy and encourage other firms to expand into overseas markets."<p>

"Our aggressive export assistance programs aid Illinois firms in trading with new established markets.  A recent $450,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce for export development, one of only eight such grants awarded this year, will help businesses target emerging markets, including China And Mexico.  All of these efforts reinforce Illinois' status as an important presence in the global marketplace."<p>

"Illinois products are recognized throughout the world for their value and quality.  Once again this year, the Governor's Export Awards will honor our most successful Illinois exporters and encourage other firms to enter the global marketplace."<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said Illinois continues to be a national leader in the export field.<p>

"Illinois firms have what it takes to compete in the global marketplace," Kustra said.  "More than one-half million jobs in Illinois are related to exports, and one in four manufacturing jobs here are tied to exports.  Illinois exports consistently outpace the nation, thanks in part to our commitment to helping businesses maximize their export opportunities."<p>

The Governor's Export Awards program is administered by DCCA.  Awards will be given in three categories:  New to Export, awarded to Illinois companies that have successfully exported Illinois products for one to five years; Continuing Export Excellence, awarded to Illinois companies successfully exporting for more than five years; and Export Awareness and Development, recognizing Illinois-based not-for-profit organizations involved in the promotion of Illinois exporting and raising export awareness.<p>

Companies and organizations may be nominated for the award by others or complete the applications themselves.  Applications should be submitted to DCCA's International Business Division, Suite 3-400, James R. Thompson Center, 100 W. Randolph St., Chicago, IL 60601, or phone 312/814-2325.<p>

GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES ENERGY GRANTS TO HELP 13 HOMELESS SHELTERS
</h3>

<em>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</em> -- Gov. Jim Edgar announced today that $259,000 has been awarded to 13 homeless shelters to reduce their utility bills.<p>

"This is the fourth consecutive year the state of Illinois has provided funds to make homeless shelters more energy efficient and less expensive to operate, the Governor said.  The money saved on heating and lighting bills can be put into services that help homeless families and individuals get back on their feet.<p>

Support for the energy grants comes form the Homeless Shelter Energy Conservation Program operated By the Department of commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and taxpayers' contributions to the Homeless Assistance Fund administered by the Department of Public Aid.<p>

"The combined effort of DCCA and Public Aid allows the State to upgrade homeless shelters and  reduce their annual operating expenses, which frees up funds to serve people in need every day of the year," said State Public Aid Director Robert W. Wright.<p>

DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone said, "The cost of major energy improvements often exceeds the financial means of community organizations.  Offering this assistance is an investment in the future of these facilities and the homeless families and individuals they serve."<p>

Frank Marshall, operations manager for the Chicago Christian Industrial League, said, "A portion of the grant will allow us to insulate on of our nine buildings that was constructed more than 80 years ago.  We expect a major energy cost savings which we'll be able to reinvest into our job training programs."<p>

"A new, efficient lighting system that we will install will mean a savings of $7,400 a year," said Russell Kinzinger, executive director of the Home Sweet Home Mission in Bloomington.  "Money provided by the state for these improvements allows us to replicate savings over the years."<p>

Rebecca Payne, executive director of the Woman's Center in Carbondale, said, "We're delighted to receive funding from the state, which has been instrumental in supporting homeless shelters with these energy grants."<p>

Since fiscal year 1993, the state has provided a total of $1.1 million for 64 energy conservation projects at homeless shelters.<p>

This year taxpayers can again help the homeless by contributing $1 or more to the Homeless Assistance Fund on line 15d of the 1040 - Illinois individual income tax form or on line 7d of the 1040EZ form.  Taxpayers using the Illinois Department of Revenue's TeleFile program also cam make a contribution.<p>

Contributions are either deducted from a tax refund or added to the taxes owed.<p>

CHICAGO METRO AREA RANKS FIRST IN NATION FOR FACILITY LOCATION AND EXPANSION; ILLINOIS IN TOP FIVE
</h3>

<em>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</em> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced the Chicago metropolitan area is ranked first in the nation in the categories of metropolitan area new/expanding facilities, and new manufacturing plants, in a n annual survey conducted by Site Selection magazine.  Illinois as a whole ranked in the top five in both categories.<p>	

"Illinois isn't just a great place to do business, it is becoming the place to do business," the Governor said.  "We offer manufacturers the advantages of a central location, an excellent transportation system and a superior workforce.  We invest in highly valued infrastructure improvements and worker training and we have enacted significant pro-business reforms that encourage growth.<p>

"Hundreds of companies have located new or expanded facilities in Illinois during the past year, more than half of them in the Chicago metropolitan area.  These expansions have created thousands of job opportunities for our citizens.  There is no better testimony to the overall success of our economic development policies."<p>

Site Selection ranked the Chicago metropolitan area first among metropolitan areas for new and expanded facilities with 265, and first in metropolitan area new manufacturing plants with 101.<p>

In the category of statewide new and expanded facilities, IIlinois is ranked fifth, with 451.  In the category of statewide new manufacturing plants, Illinois ranks fourth, with 142.<p>

"During the past two years we have seen our rankings improve dramatically, reflecting the economic comeback that Illinois has made," Edgar said.<p>

The survey also notes the strongest regional contender for new plants and expansion was the East North Central Region, led by Ohio, Michigan and Illinois.<p>

The Site Selection rankings echo the recent findings of other national surveys.  Illinois was first in the East North Central region in a relocation and expansion study conducted for Industryweek.  The same study ranked Chicago second only to Atlanta when companies were asked what major cities they would consider for new or additional sites.  In addition,  Illinois remains the corporate-transfer capital of the Midwest, according to a survey of household-goods shipments by Atlas Van Lines.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) has worked diligently to assist companies expanding or locating new facilities in Illinois.<p>

"It's clear our efforts to build public/private partnerships and be more responsive to our business customer have paid off, " Kustra said.<p>

Published by Conway Data, Site Selection has tracked industry location trends for more than four decades.  The annual tally is based in the company's New Plant Database, which counts new and expanded corporate facility investments of at least $1 million, involving at least 20,000 sq. ft. and employing 50 or more workers.  The annual survey of new and expanded manufacturing facilities appears in the February issue.<p>

GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO ASSIST SPARTAN PRINTING WORKERS
</h3>

<em>SPRINGFIELD, IL</em> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today announced the state has received $1 million in emergency funding to assist the more than 800 workers affected by the closure of Spartan Printing in Sparta.<p>

"The shut down of Spartan Printing is a severe blow to the residents of Sparta and Randolph County," the Governor said.

"This grant will support the operation of the Sparta Career Center, where those affected by the shut down will have access to a full range of services, such as job search classes and placement services.  I have also directed the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) to seek additional funding that will provide dislocated worker services through 1998."<p>

The $1 million grant is being provided through the federal Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), administered in Illinois by DCCA.<p>

Participants will be provided with a full array of services, including basic readjustment, assessment and job development.<p>

GOVERNOR APPROVES U.I. TAX CUT FOR BUSINESS
</center></h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today signed legislation he called for in his State of the State message to help spur business growth and expansion through a $128 million cut in unemployment insurance taxes.<p>

"Coupled with an automatic $123 million reduction through the existing tax rate formula, this legislation means a savings of a quarter billion dollars this year for Illinois business," the Governor said.  "That money can bolster business growth and expansion rather than sitting idle in a government trust account."<p>

Illinois employers will save an average of 18 percent on their 1996 unemployment insurance tax bills because of the reduced rates.<p>

"With the state's unemployment levels at a 21-year low, we had fewer unemployment insurance claims, leaving a higher-than-expected balance in the U.I. trust fund, "Edgar said.  "This legislation strengthens our economy and gives Illinois employers a competitive edge -- without jeopardizing the fund or benefits for the unemployed."<p>

The year-end trust fund balance was $1.6 billion, $600 million higher than projected in 1992, based on a consensus of economic forecasts.  Unemployment insurance taxes are collected quarterly from employers and deposited in the fund, which can only be used to pay benefits to unemployed workers.<p>

"We will begin immediately to process the new tax rates, and statements will be mailed to all Illinois employers before the end of the month, " said Lynn Q. Doherty, Director of the Illinois Department of Employment Security.  "The new rates apply for the entire year of 1996."<p>

Under the legislation, the minimum rate is decreased to 0.5 percent from 0.6 percent, and the maximum rate drops to 6.8 percent form 8.2 percent.  The rate applies to the first $9,000 in annual wages paid to an employee.<p>

The legislation is effective immediately.<p>

Chief Sponsors of the measure, House Bill 1740, were Reps. Terry Parke (R-Hoffman Estates), Verna Clayton (R-Buffalo Grove), Bernard Pedersen (R-Palatine) and Ann Hughes (R-Woodstock)  and Sens. Chris Lauzen (R-Aurora), Dave Syverson (R-Rockford), Martin Butler (R-Park Ridge), Dick Klemm (R-Crystal Lake) and Dan Cronin (R-Elmhurst).<p>

GOVERNOR UNVEILS PLAN TO ENHANCE CHICAGO'S POTENTIAL FOR ATTRACTING MEGA CONVENTIONS, ENTERTAINMENT SHOWS AND ATHLETIC EVENTS WITHOUT RAISING OR ADDING TAXES
</center></h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, IL</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today unveiled his plan to enhance the potential for attracting mega conventions, entertainment shows and athletic events to Chicago by further expanding the McCormick Place complex.<p>

"Without raising taxes or creating new taxes, we have a tremendous opportunity to build a facility that will create thousands of jobs and bring hundreds of millions of dollars into the economy of the Chicago metropolitan area and the State of Illinois each and every year,"  the Governor said.<p>

Edgar pointed out that Chicago currently does not have the facilities to accommodate many of the largest conventions and assemblies.<p>

He said the entertainment and convention center he is proposing could allow the city to attract national and international meetings of such groups as the Promise Keepers, which would bring nearly $70 million into the city; Alcoholics Anonymous, which would bring nearly $50 million; the Youth Gathering of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which would bring more than $40 Million, and the Lions International convention, which would bring more than $30 million.<p>

"A super city should be able to host a Super Bowl.  The enclosed facility I am proposing will accommodate a Super Bowl, the Final Four and other events that could bring tens of thousands of people to Chicago.  These events would showcase a world-class city and a great state."<p>

Edgar said, "The facility also would offer the Chicago Bears a state-of-the-art home in which to battle for a Super Bowl berth.<p>

"As I have said repeatedly, I want to keep the Bears in Chicago, but I don't want to subsidize a professional sports team or build a football stadium.  Under this proposal, the Bears will help pay for a facility that can be used for many, many other purposes -- a facility that will attract millions and millions of people to events that have nothing to do with shoulder pads and helmets and pay huge dividends for the city and the state."<p>

The Governor said he is counting on the Bears to help fund the extension of McCormick Place.  "We need the backing of the Bears.  We need the backing of the Legislature.  And we need the backing of the Mayor of Chicago," the Governor said.<p>

"I am optimistic that support will be forthcoming.  It is difficult to imagine that we would not seize this great opportunity to launch an initiative that will create thousands of jobs."<p>

The Bears and the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority would share the cost of constructing the center, which is expected to take four years.<p>

The Bears would provide $175 million, and the authority would provide $185 million.  In addition, the authority would construct and operate a $50 million parking garage and garner all the revenues from it.  It also would contribute $5 million in construction-related administrative costs.<p>

The City of Chicago and the State of Illinois would contribute $25 million each for land acquisition and infrastructure costs.<p>

"The state has provided infrastructure for economic development initiatives throughout the state and typically called upon local governments to do their share.  This is consistent with that policy.  It is consistent with what we did at the United Center, and we will work together with the United Center to assure that it will continue to realize its full potential."<p>

The Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority would fund its share by fully utilizing revenues from taxes paid primarily by visitors to Chicago.  The taxes were supported in 1991 by the Governor, the Mayor and the Legislature to expand McCormick Place.  They are pledged at their current rates to bond holders through the year 2029.  However, they will produce a surplus that can be used to add the enclosed facility proposed by the Governor without raising or creating any new taxes.<p>

GOVERNOR TARGETS HEATING ASSISTANCE FUNDS TO EMERGENCY RECONNECTIONS DURING FRIGID WEATHER
</center></h3>

<strong>CHICAGO, ILL.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today ordered that $5.2 million in heating assistance funds be targeted toward re-establishing utility service for low-income Illinois households that are currently without heat.<p>

"This week's record-setting bitter cold has dramatically heightened the urgent need for emergency heating assistance," the Governor said.  "For those with no utility service, the frigid weather is life-threatening.  Our immediate priority must be to reconnect low-income residents who do not have the financial means to re-establish electrical and heating service on their own.<p>

"I have directed the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) to work with local organizations to meet the current demand for emergency services before making funds available for other forms of assistance."<p>

Of the $5.2 million in Low-Income Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds released Thursday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, $1.8 million will be allocated to the City of Chicago.  The remainder of the funds will be distributed throughout the state on the basis of population, poverty, heating degree days and fuel costs.<p>

"Emergency assistance is available to eligible households that are disconnected from their primary and/or secondary utilities, or where a supplier has refused to deliver fuel without immediate payment," Edgar said.  "This assistance may also be available to help households with repair or replacement of inoperable heating systems."<p>

The amount of emergency assistance is the minimum amount necessary for reconnection of energy services.  Emergency assistance payments may not exceed a total of $500 per year per household, and eligible households are limited to one emergency assistance payment for the primary energy source and one for the secondary energy source.<p>

Applicants must prove that they are low-income, responsible for the energy bill from the disconnected utility or the delivered fuel vendor and have made a "good-faith effort" to maintain their energy services.  A good-faith effort is defined as having paid at least 10 percent of the household's past 90-day income toward energy services.<p>

LIHEAP funds may also be used to provide a one-time payment to utilities on behalf of eligible households.  The payment is applied toward a participant's energy bill.<p>

Including the $5.2 million, Illinois has received $50.2 million in federal LIHEAP funding to assist low-income residents during the current winter.  Approximately 7,000 residents have already received emergency assistance.  An additional 140-,000 have received energy assistance.<p>

Even with the addition of the latest round of funding, the federal government has provided only two-thirds of last year's funding, when $74.7 million was used to assist 13,000 residents with emergency reconnection assistance and 210,000 residents with energy assistance.<p>

For information about the program, residents may call DCCA's Energy Assistance Hotline at 800/252-8643 or 800/419-0667 (TDD).<p>

<h3>GOVERNOR AWARDS REHABILITATION GRANTS TO IMPROVE HOUSING IN 31 ILLINOIS COMMUNITIES</h3>

<strong>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</strong> -- Gov. Jim Edgar today awarded $7 million in grants to assist 31 Illinois communities in efforts to renovate substandard housing.<p>

"Safe, decent housing is important to the well-being of all Illinois families," the Governor said.  "home repairs, such as replacing a roof for making plumbing and electrical improvements, are often beyond the budgets of low-income families, as well as too costly for those with disabilities and senior citizens surviving on fixed incomes.<p>

"These grants will help smaller communities throughout the state rehabilitate hundreds of aging and unsafe homes.  They represent an investment in better living conditions for thousands of people, and they represent a commitment to a better overall quality of life in Illinois."<p>

Examples of the grant program include rehabilitation projects in Carbondale, Newton and Monmouth.<p>

Carbondale will receive $350,000 to assist in rehabilitating 28 homes.  This year's grant continues efforts to improve housing the northeast section of the city, where nearly a third of the homes are more than 40 years old.  Improvements will include roof repairs, upgrading electrical and plumbing systems and correcting other deficiencies.<p>

Monmouth will use $188,000 to implement a housing rehabilitation program.  Twenty home located in the south central section of the community are targeted for assistance.  Nearly half of the homes in the neighborhood were constructed prior to 1940, and lower income residents have had difficulty in maintaining the integrity of their homes.  Improvements are designed to bring the properties up to code.<p>

Newton, in Jasper County, will use $194,500 to undertake the second phase of a housing rehabilitation project for 15 owner-occupied homes.  Local officials surveying the targeted area reported extensive deterioration of the modes, single-family frame structures.  All of the homes have common problems such as damaged roofs, inadequate wiring and out-dated plumbing and heating systems.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor on economic development, said the housing rehabilitation grants represent just one component of the Community Development assistance Program (CDAP) administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<p>

"Smaller communities across Illinois continue to benefit from this program," Kustra said.  "CDAP grants are awarded for a number of different purposes - they include making public infrastructure improvements, encouraging business development, and providing greater accessibility to government buildings.  Today we are announcing assistance to upgrade substandard housing.<p>

"All of these components fit together to help local governments make their communities better places to live, work and raise a family."<p>

The community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) is funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  The grants are awarded on a competitive basis to units of local government with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven large urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD. The maximum grant is $400,000.<p>

<h3>GOVERNOR APPLAUDS PRODUCTION OF NEW ETHANOL POWERED FORD; ALSO AWARD JOB TRAINING GRANT</h3>

CHICAGO, ILL. --  Gov. Jim Edgar today joined officials from Ford Motor Company and the corn industry in launching production at Ford's Chicago Assembly Plant of a redesigned flexible fuel Ford Taurus optimized for the use of ethanol.<p>

The Governor also awarded the company an $800,000 job training grant to upgrade the skills of nearly 3,000 workers at the plant, the Chicago Stamping Plant and five supplier companies.<p>

"Illinois continues to be the nation's leader in promoting the production and use of ethanol," the Governor said.  "Illinois has the largest government fleet of ethanol-powered cars in the country.  We are the top producer of ethanol fuel, and motorists in Illinois pump more ethanol blended-fuel into their gas tanks than in any other state.<p>

"Ford's production of a new vehicle designed specifically for optimal operation with ethanol is another milestone in efforts to increase the use of this clean, renewable fuel derived from corn.  We are especially proud that a vehicle that can run on ethanol produced from Illinois corn is being manufactured by Illinois workers right here in Chicago."<p>

The new flexible fuel Tauruses are optimized for the use of E-85 fuel, a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline.<p>

Rand Griffin, Chicago Assembly Plant manager, said "The Taurus in known to meet a wide variety of customer needs, a tradition that has made it America's best selling car for four years in a row.  With out latest flexible fuel Taurus, customers will have another way of making this car fit for their lifestyles."<p>

The Illinois Department of Central Management Services (CMS) has already ordered 40 of the flexible fuel Taurus models, and additional orders are expected.  Currently, there are 139 ethanol-powered vehicles in the state fleet.  Local governments throughout the state have purchased an additional 25 ethanol vehicles through CMS.  The state has also established 11 ethanol refueling stations for the government vehicles.<p>

 Vic Riddle, President of the Illinois Corn Growers Association, voiced appreciation for Edgar's efforts on behalf of ethanol.<p>

"The Governor has been a champion for this Illinois-made fuel.  He has put the backing of his administration and his political influence behind ethanol at the state and national level,"  Riddle said.<p>

Up to 6,000 of the ethanol-powered vehicles are expected to be produced.  The Chicago Assembly Plant produces a total of more than250,000 vehicles a year which are distributed throughout the United States and 17 other countries.<p>

The $800,000 Industrial Training Program grant will be used by Ford to train employees in areas such as the use of technical equipment, preventive maintenance and leadership skills.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said the grant strengthens the state's partnership with Ford.<p>

"The Edgar administration is committed to investing in a highly-trained workforce," Kustra said.  "Production of the redesigned Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable vehicles at the Chicago Assembly Plant, and so many key pieces at the Chicago Stamping Plant, required the installation of significant new technology.  Stringent export standards also contribute to Ford's need to consistently upgrade the skills of its own employees and those of its suppliers.  I am pleased we can assist Ford in helping workers meet this challenge."<p>

The Industrial Training Program, administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), is a state-funded program that assists employers with the training and retraining of their workforce.  ITP grants may be awarded to individual employers, as well as multi-company employee training projects.<p>

  Governor Applauds $38 Million Deere Development Project                  
</h3>





<EM>MOLINE, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today joined local officials in announcing a $38 million development project that will create 260 jobs in the Quad-Cities area and rejuvenate Moline's downtown area with the headquarters for John Deere Health Care.<P>

"This development project will pump millions of dollars into the Quad-Cities economy," the Governor said.  "The jobs to be created will provide opportunities for area citizens in field ranging from health care administration to retail, hotel and restaurant management.<P>

"There was intense competition from other states for the centerpiece of this development, the headquarters for John Deere Health Care, but this fast-growing corporation preferred to stay in Illinois.  Our willingness to make the needed investments in infrastructure improvements and worker training to help the Illinois economy grow has once again made the difference.  We are proving yet again that Illinois is a good place to do business."<P>

Richard Van Bell, President of John Deere Health Care, said the company was pleased to be located in a state with progressive job training programs for its citizens.<P>

"We commend Governor Edgar and the State of Illinois for supporting this project, which is an example of what government can do for the common benefit of its people," Van Bell said.  "This is a cost-effective way to upgrade the skills of our employees, which will improve their service and productivity, therefore having a strong impact not only on John Deere Health Care, but also our community and the state of Illinois."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said there was outstanding community cooperation in bringing the project together.<P>

"The public/private partnership we have seen demonstrated in pulling this complicated project together is a tribute to the leadership of those involved," Kustra said.  "All of the components in the development fit together to produce a complex that will create jobs and spur economic development."<P>

The development plan calls for the construction of a 100,000-square-foot building to serve as John Deere Health Care's corporate headquarters.  It will house 300 current employees, as well as another 100 employees to be added later.<P>

Another 160 jobs created by the development will be in the tourism-driven retail, hospitality and restaurant industries.<P>
	
Adjacent to the office building will be a 15,000-square-foot John Deere Visitor Pavilion that will serve as a destination point for the company's out-of-town visitors.  The pavilion will feature displays and historic exhibits and is expected eventually to draw up to 400,00 visitors.<P>

The development also includes a new Community Transportation Center that will serve as an intercity bus transfer center and a staging area for bus tour groups.  A first-class hotel is also planned to accommodate overnight visitors to the downtown area.<P>

The City of Moline, the Rock Island County Metropolitan Transit District, Renew Moline and the Quad Cities Civic Center Authority are all committing substantial resources to allow the development plan to move forward.<P>

The State of Illinois is providing more than $1 million toward the project, including a $600,000 loan to the City of Moline through the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs' public infrastructure program.  Up to $300,000 in job training funds also will be allocated over three years to assist John Deere Health Care with Worker training.  In addition, DCCA also has approved a $100,000 tourism attraction program grant for the program to rejuvenate the downtown area.<P>

The Illinois Department of Transportation also is expected to provide assistance for infrastructure improvements at the Arsenal Island Bridge to accommodate traffic flow and increased demand for parking. <P>

Governor, Motorola Announce Location of Worldwide Sector Headquarters in Elgin                    
</h3>




<EM>ELGIN, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today joined Motorola officials in announcing the company will locate the worldwide headquarters of its Messaging, Information and Media Sector (MIMS) in Elgin, investing more than $40 million in a northwest suburban plant and creating 1,500 jobs.<P>

"Illinois' reputation as a great place for high-technology firms to do business continues to grow," Governor said.  "Illinois is becoming known as the Silicon Prairie because we deliver on our promise to provide the well-trained workforce, infrastructure improvements and excellent transportation system these companies require.<P>

"Motorola's steady expansion in Illinois has created thousands of high-quality jobs, and demonstrates the confidence of this communication giant tin our economic development policies.  This new expansion will further strengthen Illinois' partnership with a valued corporate citizen."<P>

Robert Growney, Executive Vice President, Motorola Inc., and President and General Manager of MIMS said, "the anticipated growth of Messaging, Information and Media Sector compelled us to find a site where we could support this opportunity.  The site in Elgin provides the ideal environment for us to significantly grow our business.  The interest and support from the State of Illinois, Kane County and the City of Elgin made it an easy decision for us to stay in Illinois."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development advisor, said the facility will be a tremendous asset to the area.<P>

"The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) worked diligently to make this project a reality," Kustra said.  "MIMS produces some of Motorola's most innovative products, and we expect the Elgin facility to attract some of our best and brightest Illinois workers as the global demand for the latest in communication technology continues to skyrocket."<P>

The MIMS site meets the investment and job creation requirements for designation as a High-Impact Business Zone, providing the company with $1.7 million in tax exemptions.  In addition, DCCA has allocated $1 million for worker training through the Industrial Training Program.<P>

The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) will provide up to $1.9 million for area infrastructure improvements, and the Illinois Toll Highway Authority will contribute an estimated $200,000 for roadway modifications.<P>

Kane County and the City of Elgin have also committed to invest in transportation improvements in order to make the project feasible.  In addition, an overall transportation plan already in place for the region contributed to Motorola's decision to locate in Elgin.<P>

The MIMS headquarters will be built on a 130-acre parcel near I-90 at the northwest corner of Elgin.  The facility will include general office space, manufacturing, and research and development.<P>

When completed in 1997, it will consolidate 750 jobs currently scattered throughout the Chicago metropolitan area, with an additional 1,500 jobs to be added by the year 2000.<P>

Illinois Communities Awarded Grants to Upgrade Public Water and Sewer Systems                    
</h3>





<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced 87 communities throughout Illinois will share more than $22.6 million in Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) grants to help fund improvements to local water and sewer systems.<P>

"Public health and safety, and the potential for economic growth, depend on our ability to maintain adequate public infrastructure systems," the Governor said.  "My Administration has made infrastructure improvement one of the cornerstones of Illinois's' overall economic development policy.  These grants will provide cities and towns with the financial tools to make much-needed improvements.<P>

Edgar said a project in Fulton County is an example.<P>

Boil orders are often issued in the city of Farmington because of severely encrusted watermains that frequently break or lose pressure.  Farmington will receive a $350,000 grant combined with city funds to make the necessary water system improvements including replacement of water mains and construction of a new water tower.<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, said growth in rural areas depends in part on maintaining Illinois' high standards for public infrastructure.<P>

"Adequate water and sewage treatment systems are an important selling point for communities hoping to attract new economic development to their areas," Kustra said.  "Assisting local governments in making these improvements is a sound investment in the future of our state."<P>

CDAP grants are funded with federal block grant funds form the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  They are awarded by Department of Commerce and Community Affairs to units of local government with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the six large urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD.<P>

The maximum grant available is $400,000.  At least 51 percent of the project's beneficiaries must be people with low or moderate incomes.<P>

A list of the communities receiving CDAP public facilities and design engineering grants may be obtained by calling 217/785-6142. (TDD 800/785-6055).<P>

          Governor Announces $2.75 Million Tourism Grant to Help Chicago Host Democratic National Convention          
</h3>




<EM>CHICAGO, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced a $2.75 million tourism promotion grant to assist the City of Chicago with expenses in hosting the Democratic National Convention next summer.<P>

"The 1996 Democratic National Convention promises to showcase Illinois to the 35,000 delegates, alternates, staff, guests and media representatives expected to attend, and to an international audience following the activities," the Governor said.  "This grant is part of our commitment to the City of Chicago to be a partner in hosting a world-class event.<P>

"Sixteen cities competed for the economic benefits and prestige that hosting the convention will bring.  A spirit of teamwork in the public and private sectors helped win the convention for Chicago, and we will continue to work together to prove that Chicago was the right  choice, "Edgar added.<P>

The economic impact of the convention is expected to reach an estimated $122 million.  The grant to the City of Chicago Office of Budget Management is made through the Tourism Private Sector Grant Program, administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), Illinois Bureau of Tourism.<P>

Other grants through the program this year include:<P>
<ul>
<li> $25,000 to the City of Chicago/Department of Cultural Affairs to assist with costs from hosting the fourth International Congress of Educating Cities<p>

<li> $28,961 to the Rockford Area Convention and Visitors Bureau for costs form hosting the 1996 ASA Men's Nationals 40 & Over Softball Tournament<p>

<li> $25,546 to the River Bend Growth Association, headquartered in Alton, which will assist with the expenses of hosting the 1996 U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links Golf Championship.<p>

<li>n $18,400 grant to the Quad Cities Convention and Visitors Bureau for costs associated with hosting the NCAA Division I Women's National Invitational Softball Championship was announced earlier.<p>
</ul>
Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development adviser, said the grants are an important part of Illinois' overall tourism promotion effort. 
"Tourism continues to set new records in Illinois," Kustra said.  "Last year alone, travelers to our state spent nearly $16 billion and the travel industry employed more than 240,000 workers.  It just makes sense to encourage development of more public private partnerships to keep those numbers growing."<P>

The Tourism Private Sector Grant Program, funded entirely by revenue generated by the hospitality industry, was made possible through legislation approved in 1993 that increased the percentage of the state's hotel/motel tax designated for the Tourism Promotion Fund.<P>

Grants provide a 50/50 match to applicants who can document matching private sector investment for efforts to attract major national and international events to Illinois.<P>

Wal-Mart to Build Distribution Center in Olney
                    
</h3>




<EM>OLNEY, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. will build a Midwestern Distribution Center in Olney, creating up to 250 new jobs within 18 months and as many as 400 fully operational.<P>

"Illinois is a leader in the warehousing and distribution field," the Governor said.  "our strong central location, coupled with an excellent transportation network, has already made Illinois the choice for nearly 300 Fortune 500 companies that have major regional or national distribution centers in our state.<P>

"One of the world's premier retailer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. is known for carefully scrutinizing every detail when making location decisions.  I am delighted that the company's exhaustive review found Olney and Illinois to be the best location for this new facility."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development advisor, praised the public/private cooperation that made the project possible.<P>

"Officials for the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) and the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) worked closely with Olney Mayor Tom Fehrenbacher and Stan Wieber, Director of the Richland County Development Corporation, to pull together state and local resources to help this company make its decision," Kustra said.<P>

City officials, the Richland County Boar, the Olney Township Board and Road Commissioner, the East Richland School Board and the Illinois Eastern Community College Board also assisted in making needed Enterprise Zone changes.<P>

The private sector played a crucial role in making the project possible, as well.  Central Illinois Public Service Company, the local GTE office and Norris Electric Coop all agreed to make utility improvements necessary to service the facility.  The First National Bank of Olney agreed to provide temporary office and storage space to Wal-Mart to enable the project to get up and running quickly.<P>

"This type of cooperation between the state, the community and the private sector demonstrates the depth of Illinois' commitment to helping businesses achieve success," Edgar said.<P>

DCCA will award a $640,000 Community Development Assistance Program grant to the City of Olney, which will be combined with $900,000 from the City to extend water and sewer lines to serve the new facility.  DCCA will also provide a grant of up to $250,000 from the state's Industrial Training Program to assist in training the new workers.<P>

IDOT will provide $300,000 in Economic Development Program funds to finance 50 percent of the roadway improvements needed to serve the site.  The improvements will include the construction of turn lanes form U.S. 50 into the Wal-Mart facility, and an eastbound truck acceleration lane from the site onto U.S 50.  The Department will also provide $90,000 for the necessary engineering and plan preparation for the project, as well as construction supervision.<P>

In addition, city and county officials have agreed to extend the Olney/Richland county Enterprise Zone to include the site, a move that will enable Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. to benefit from state and local sales tax exemptions and other incentives.<P>

The 830,00-square-foot warehouse and food distribution center will serve Wal-Mart's Supercenter grocery stores throughout the Midwest.  Construction is expected to begin next spring, with completion slated for spring 1997.<P>

  Illinois Film Office Sets New Hi-Tech Production Guide Standard                 
</h3>




Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs director Dennis Whetstone announced today that the Illinois Film Office, working with Chicago based Brand X Filmworks, will soon distribute the Illinois Production Guide on CD-ROM.<P>

"The Illinois Film Office is responsible for ringing motion picture and television production to film on-location in Illinois.  Illinois is the first state in the country to digitize their resource manual, vastly expanding the amount and accessibility of information available to national production executives," said Whetstone.<P>

Brand X Filmworks has developed a custom application as an alternative to the printed 250 page Illinois Production Guide.  The CD-ROM offers easy reference on the set, on the road, or anywhere.  The user still has access to the names of local companies and individuals, in addition to newly enhanced information including catalogs, credits, and photographs.  Thousands of easily searchable answers will be at the film industry's fingertips.  Filmmakers will now be able to customize their resource information which can then be printed or saved.<P>

Beginning in October, 2500 discs will be distributed free of charge to motion picture and television industry leaders around the country.  The list will include production executives at the major studios in Los Angeles, independent production companies nationwide, cable producers, location managers, production managers, producers, directors, anyone who might have a say in deciding where a picture will shoot.<P>

"As the competition for on-location production dollars continues to grow, the Illinois Film Office must take an increasingly pro-active position in the marketplace," said Suzy Kellett, director of the Illinois Film Office.  "In addition to offerings the local production industry the opportunity to use the cutting edge technology of CD0-ROM to sell themselves more effectively, the Illinois and Chicago Film Offices have been actively promoting the State through other mediums."<P>

The first Illinois/Chicago Screenwriter Competition has just been completed to rave reviews.  In October, the Film Offices and Chicago labor leader conducted 22 meetings in Los Angeles on a joint sales trip.  Recently a 15-member industry Task Force Was formed to examine the local filming infrastructure and develop an industrywide national marketing campaign.  The Illinois Film Office has dedicated a staff member to be a Community Liaison responsible for monitoring locations and maintaining relationships with location contacts.<P>

All of these activities are designed to keep Illinois in the limelight as an on-location filming choice, because Kellett believes, "If you ain't the lead dog, the scenery never changes."<P>

   Illinois Chosen to Implement One-Stop Career Center Network                
</h3>




<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL.</EM> - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced that Illinois is one of seven states chosen by the U.S. Department of Labor to implement a One-Stop Career Center Network.<P>

Illinois was awarded a grant of nearly $6.7 million form the U.S. Department of Labor to fund activities during the first year of the three-year project.<P>

"Illinois has always been at the forefront in designing services to help our citizens prepare for rewarding, productive careers," the Governor said. "It is natural, then, that our state should be leader in implementing the new One-Stop Career Center Network concept.<P>

"Two years ago, we started initial planning to consolidate career-related services administered by various agencies and educational institutions under one roof.  Our goal is to make it easier for people who need these services.  Rather than driving all over town, people can visit one place to get the information they need about a wide range of services, from unemployment assistance to job training and educational programs.<P>

"Already, we have opened full-service centers in Decatur, Rockford and Mattoon, and are well on the way to consolidating services in dozens of other communities around our state.  This grant will help us speed up that process so that people throughout our state will benefit from One-Stop Career Centers."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser on economic development, said state officials worked closely with local service providers to design the Career Center Network.<P>

"Although each center will be customized to fit local labor market conditions and customer needs, they will offer a standard set of high quality employment, unemployment and training services.  They also will make maximum use of computer and telecommunications technology to link center, increase program access and ensure efficient service."<P>

During the three-year implementation period, Illinois plans to establish 55 full-service centers and 93 satellite offices.  It is anticipated that 40 new centers will be operational by the end of the first year.  At the end of the three-year development period, people throughout the state are expected to be served by a Career Center.<P>

Dennis R. Whetstone, Director of the Department of commerce and Community Affairs, which administer Illinois' Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs, said the centers will build upon JTPA's programs to help displaced and disadvantaged workers train for new employment.<P>

"Besides making services convenient to clients, we have built in a new component to tailor our services to the needs of the business community,"  Whetstone said.  "These centers will offer businesses and clients easy access to labor market information, making it possible for clients to match their skills with the places that need those skills.  Center staffers will also work with local businesses to ensure that participants are being trained in skills that those businesses need."<P>

Lynn Q. Doherty, Director of the Department of Employment Security (IDES), said the success of the early one-stop centers has been encouraging, both for the public and for the staff people who work in the centers.<P>

"Illinois has worked hard on its plan for a one-stop system of employment and training centers, and we are proud to have been selected as one of the states to fully launch this program, which offers comprehensive services in one location and also provides cost savings for the people who foot the bill, the Illinois taxpayers," Doherty said.<P>

Armstrong to Expand In Kankakee                    
</h3>




<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today congratulated officials of Armstrong World Industries, Inc. on their decision to undertake a $36.5 million expansion at the company's Kankakee facility, retaining 350 jobs.<P>

"My administration has made economic development a top priority in Illinois," the Governor said.  "In our efforts to convince Armstrong to expand in Illinois, we have seen a strong partnership both between state agencies and between state and local government to keep jobs in Illinois.  By choosing Kankakee over other sites, Armstrong has signaled its confidence in our quality workers, our excellent infrastructure and our competitive business climate."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser on economic development, personally worked with Armstrong World Industries Inc. to help convince the company to choose Illinois for its expansion.<P>

"We have many tools to help companies grow in Illinois," Kustra said.  "From enterprise zones to low-interest loans, infrastructure assistance and workforce training programs, our programs are designed to meet the needs of individual employers, both new companies and firms expanding for th future.  The bottom line is job - retaining jobs for current workers and attracting new jobs for tomorrow's workers.  I am pleased our negotiations with Armstrong World Industries Inc. have resulted in today's announcement."<P>

The Kankakee plant, located at Hobby and Brookmont Avenues, is among Armstrong's oldest vinyl tile production facilities, in operation for more than 47 years.<P>

The project will include construction of a new distribution center and a new commercial floor tile line.  Improvements are slated for completion during 1996.<P>

Several state agencies and officials were involved in the negotiations with the company.  The final incentive package is expected to include tax benefits from the company's location in the Kankakee River Valley Enterprise Zone and worker training assistance through the state's Industrial Training Program administered by the Department of commerce and community Affairs (DCCA).<P>

In addition, the company is expected to receive financial assistance through the Linked Deposit Program administered by State Treasurer Judy Baar Topinka, as well as low-interest financing through the Illinois Development Finance Authority (IDFA).  The Illinois Department of Transportation is working with the company to meet its roadway needs.<P>

The City of Kankakee also has offered assistance through local Enterprise Zone benefits and tax increment financing (TIF).<P>

Steve Husak, Armstrong's Kankakee plant manager, thanked state officials, Mayor Don Green and the plant's employees for their interest and support.
"Without all their help, these projects would not have been approved for our plant," Husak said.  "These projects are very important to the future success of the tile business.  All of us should be proud the Kankakee plant has been selected for these investments."<P>

Governor Announces Infrastructure Grants                    
</h3>





<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced $2.9 million in grants it help 10 Illinois communities improve their public water and sewer systems.<P>

"Infrastructure is among government's most important responsibilities," the Governor said.  "Citizens turn to government to ensure that the water they drink is healthy and plentiful, and that waste is safely treated.  These grants will help these 10 communities address infrastructure needs that pose a threat to the health and safety of their residents."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser on economic development, said the grants are awarded through the federally funded Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP).<P>

"This program is among our most important tools to help smaller Illinois communities address their infrastructure and economic development needs," Kustra said.  "With these grants, communities have the funds necessary to undertake public facilities improvement projects needed to preserve the quality of life and help attract new development."<P>

Dennis R. Whetstone, Director of the Department of commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) which administers the grants, said the 10 projects will be funded through moneys left unspent from other CDAP components.<P>

"These grants are funded through the community Development Block Grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development," Whetstone said.  "When we draw up the budget, we allocate our block grant funds among several CDAP components that fund public facilities improvements, planning, housing rehabilitation, economic development opportunities, emergency public facilities needs and other projects.  This year, we determined that the best use for any unspent CDAP funds is to provide grants to deserving communities with qualifying public facilities projects."<P>

Whetstone cited a project in Jerseyville as an example.<P>

Jerseyville's central water supply began operations in 1923.  The average age of water lines in the community is 50 years.  One section"washed out" in 1989 due to its proximity to Otter Creek, and other sections often experience breaks, threatening the reliability of the city's water supply.<P>

Jerseyville will receive a $360,000 CDAP grant to assist with installation of new transmission mains, valves, hydrants and other system needs.<P>

CDAP grants are provided to communities with populations of 50,000 or less that are not within one of the seven urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD.  The maximum grant available under the Public facilities component is $400,000.  At least 51 percent of the project's beneficiaries must be people with low or moderate income levels.<P>

A list of communities receiving funds may be obtained by calling 217/785-6142 (TDD 800/785-6055). <P>

Hoopeston Foods Acquires Pillsbury Plant; Project Will Retain 50 Jobs in Vermillion County                    
</h3>




<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today congratulated company officials on the announcement that Hoopeston Foods, Inc. will purchase the Pillsbury plant in Hoopeston, retaining 50 jobs with plans for further growth in the future.<P>

"The City of Hoopeston has a long and proud tradition in the food processing industry," the Governor said.  "When Pillsbury announced plans earlier this year to close its Hoopeston plant, we began working with local officials and economic developers to find a buyer for the facility.  Thanks to this close cooperation, coupled with innovative programs from both the state and community, Hoopeston Foods will keep the food processing tradition alive in Hoopeston."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development adviser, said the project was made possible inpart by a $650,000 Participation Loan provided by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<P>

"This program enables the state to work with private lenders to make capital available to businesses like Hoopeston Foods that are creating and retaining jobs in our state," Kustra said.  "Our funds made it possible for the company to obtain conventional financing at a rate favorable enough to make the project feasible."<P>

The company will also receive a $100,000 participation loan from the Vermilion county Community Development Corporation, and a $100,000 loan form the city's revolving loan fund.  American National Bank and Trust, Chicago is the primary lender.<P>

John Steele, Hoopeston Foods, Inc. President, said the state and local support was critical to the project.<P>

"Financing of this project would not have been possible without a great deal of state and local assistance," Steele said.  "It has been a true public-private partnership to retain and grow a long-standing business in this community."<P>

Steele also thanked Hoopeston Mayor Robert Ault and the Hoopeston City Council, and Vicki Stewart of the Danville Area Economic Development corporation for their Assistance with the project.  Stewart, who said the state's involvement with the project was responsible for retaining invaluable manufacturing jobs for the Hoopeston community, commended Senator Harry "Babe" Woodyard and Representative William B. Black for their support.<P>

Hoopeston Foods, Inc. plans to establish a core business canning and labeling private-label dry-pack beans.  The company also plans to expand into a variety of food categories to complement its core product offering.<P>

        Twenty-seven Communities Awarded Grants; Funds Help Plan Public Facilities Improvements            
</h3>




<EM>SPRINGFIELD, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today announced grants totaling $500,000 to help 27 Illinois communities initiate formal planning for future improvements to public water and sewer systems.<P>

"Infrastructure is one of the foundations of economic development," the Governor said.  "While Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) public facilities grants can help many smaller communities fund critical improvement sot water and sewer systems, some communities lack even the funds necessary to compile the plans needed to seek the grants.<P>

"For that reason, we have developed a separate CDAP component specifically to help fund these planning efforts.  Once plans have been developed, the communities will be in a position to seek future assistance to actually undertake the improvements needed to meet their public facilities needs."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser on economic development, said the need is always great.<P>

"Communities know when they have a public facilities problem; however, finding the best and most efficient solution to the problem may not be within their reach," Kustra said.  "Through this program, we can provide assistance that will enable many smaller communities to investigate the various alternatives and develop plans to solve their water and sewer needs."<P>

Projects in Biggsville and Stockton are examples.<P>

Biggsville, population 349, has no sewer system.  Many of the existing septic systems discharge into a community tile constructed in the 1920's, creating a hazard to public health and safety.  The village will receive a $10,800 grant to study various alternatives to collect and treat the sanitary sewer discharge.<P>

The wastewater treatment plant in the Village of Stockton is inadequate to meet its needs, placing the community on restricted development status.  Its water system is also insufficient, causing a threat to public health and safety.  Two major employers are particularly affected.  An egg washing and separating plant that has large wastewater treatment needs has been forced to cut back production and lay off workers to reduce its wastewater discharge.  An automotive systems manufacturer moved some of its production to another community because Stockton's labor force was insufficient - a problem made worse by a shortage of available housing in Stockton and the village's inability to undertake additional housing development to attract new residents.  The village will receive a $21,200 grant to review existing water and sewer facilities and develop alternatives to solve the problems.<P>

CDAP grants, funded with federal block grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), are administered by the Department of Commerce and community Affairs (DCCA).  DCCA awards funds to units of local government with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven large urban counties that receive funds directly form HUD.<P>

The maximum grant available under the CDAP Planning Assistance Grant component is $25,000.  At least 51 percent of the project's beneficiaries must be people with low or moderate income levels.<P>

     Governor Helps Cut Ribbon on New Motorola Manufacturing Facility               
</h3>




<EM>MCHENRY, ILL</EM>. - Gov. Jim Edgar today joined company officials in ceremonies officially opening Motorola's new multi-million-dollar Cellular Infrastructure Group manufacturing facility in McHenry.<P>

"Motorola is truly an Illinois success story,' the Governor said.  "Headquartered in Schaumburg, the company is known worldwide for its leadership in the fields of wireless communications, semiconductors an advanced electronic systems and services.<P>

"Through the years, Motorola and Illinois have forged a strong partnership based on our state's ability to provide the infrastructure, skilled work force and business climate conducive to growth.  Today, the company employs more than 20,000 Illinois workers, and will create up to 500 new jobs at this facility.  I am delighted that Motorola continues to grow in Illinois."<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior adviser on economic development, said, "This is a great example of our state government working in partnership with local communities and businesses to create economic expansion."<P>

The state provided more than $1.1 million in infrastructure improvements to assist with the project.  The Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) provided a $315,000 Public Infrastructure Program grant to the City of McHenry for water and sewer improvements.  The Illinois Department of Transportation contributed $800,000 i matching funds through its Economic Development Program to provide access to the site, which was matched by a $400,00 grant form the City of McHenry and $400,000 form Prime Commercial Corp., the site's developers.<P>

The 217,000 square-foot facility is located on 20 acres in the McHenry Corporate Center.  The new plant will manufacture cellular infrastructure equipment for customers worldwide.<P>

Motorola has facilities in Arlington Heights, Schaumburg, Northbrook, Libertyville, Itasca, Buffalo Grove, Grayslake, Urbana, Vernon Hills and McHenry, and is currently constructing a $100 million cellular phone manufacturing facility in Harvard.<P>

The company also has facilities in Florida, Texas, New York and Arizona.  Motorola's major equipment businesses include cellular telephones and equipment, two-way radios, pagers and data communications, automotive, defense and space electronics and computers.  Communications devices, computers and millions of consumer products are powered by Motorola semiconductors.  The company's 1994 sales totaled $22.2 billion.<P>

<h3>AMERICORPS--HELPING PEOPLE HELP THEMSELVES</h3>
<h4>by Curt Farrar, DCCA Division of Economic Opportunity</h4>

AmeriCorps, a national service initiative administered in Illinois by DCCA's Division of Economic Opportunity, is much more than just another service program.  It's a movement that unites diverse Illinoisans in efforts to improve neighborhoods and the quality of life for their residents.<p> 

AmeriCorps seeks to strengthen communities by providing manpower to help meet local educational, human, environmental and public safety needs, particularly those affecting children and young people.  Programs selected for funding recruit and train individuals who are willing to devote at least one year to serving as AmeriCorps members.<p>

Non-profit organizations, units of local government, state agencies, institutions of higher education or partnerships among such organizations are eligible for AmeriCorps participation.  Organizations submit proposals, which are reviewed by the 25-member bi-partisan Illinois Commission on Community Service (ICCS) and then sent for final approval and funding to the federal Corporation for National Service.  Successful proposals outline ways to meet identified needs, develop capacity by involving community volunteers, and have measurable outcomes to benefit the community.<p>

Organizations may apply for one of three different types of grants.  Planning grants provide organizations with up to $35,000 to plan an operational program.  Operating grants require a program design using 10 to 20 members and include funding for member support costs, staff salaries and administration.  The average size of operating grants is $250,000.  Education grants include awards for post-service education.<p> 

Participating organizations must operate an AmeriCorps-type program and bear total cost for the program.  This includes modest living allowances and health coverage for volunteers participating in the program.  Volunteers come from all ages and backgrounds.  After completing a year of service (at least 1,700 hours), AmeriCorps volunteer members receive an education award of $4,725 which can be used to help pay off student loans or finance college, graduate school, or vocational training. <p>
 
To date, ICCS has awarded more than $3 million to 13 grantees to develop programs through non-profit and state government agencies.  More than 300 people have been employed as AmeriCorps members throughout Illinois.  These volunteers have renovated 12 homes, tutored 1,500 children, cleaned five Illinois streams, trained 44,000 people in health and  safety, provided 4,000 day care referrals, and delivered case management and assistance to more than 200 homeless individuals.<p>

The ICCS has been assured that funds will be available for AmeriCorps operational grants for the 1997-98 program year.  For further information about AmeriCorps, contact the Illinois Commission on Community Service at 800/592-9896 (TDD users call 800/419-0667).<p>

<h3>TRAVEL INDUSTRY IS KEY TO THE ILLINOIS ECONOMY</h3>

The Illinois travel industry is flexing its muscles.  Recently, DCCA's Illinois Bureau of Tourism reported that the growth rate of Illinois tourism matched or exceeded the U.S. growth rate for the 13th consecutive time.  By establishing new partnerships within the public and private sectors, expanding the use of technology, and administering an award-winning advertising campaign, the Illinois Bureau of Tourism expects to continue this outstanding growth.<p>

Tourism's success reflects positively on the overall Illinois economy.  During Calendar Year 1995 (the most recent data available), domestic and international travel within Illinois showed a direct economic impact of $16 billion -- a 3.2 percent improvement over the $15.5 billion spent in 1994.  This includes an 8.75 percent increase in international travel to Illinois, which is now the sixth most popular U.S. state for overseas visitors.<p>

Besides the direct economic impact, tourism generates jobs; in fact approximately one in 10 Illinois workers is directly or indirectly dependent on tourism for employment.  In 1995, the Illinois travel industry employed 335,500 workers and contributed to the need for another 354,700 indirect jobs.  The travel-generated payroll in Illinois was $5.8 billion, an increase of 3.8 percent over 1994.<p>  

Travel is also good for the state treasury.  Travelers in Illinois contributed $3.7 billion in taxes during 1995.  State hotel/motel taxes, a portion of which fund all Illinois tourism programs, were up 10 percent during that time, reaching $111.7 million.<p>

The Illinois Bureau of Tourism is working with its Illinois travel partners to continue this record of success.  In addition to the successful "Million Miles from Monday" campaign, the Bureau administers a sophisticated travel counseling system that enables customers to customize travel plans with a simple phone call (1-800-2-CONNECT, TTY users call 800/406-6418); a web site (www.enjoyillinois.com) that gives users trip ideas, trip planning opportunities and updates on festivals and events; and an ambitious international marketing initiative that targets travelers in Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany.  The Bureau also administers the Tourism Matching Grant program, the Tourism Private Sector grant program, and the Illinois Convention and Visitors Bureau grant program, which provide assistance to local units of government and local organizations to help promote and market travel-related activities in their areas.<p>

New technologies being implemented by the Illinois Bureau of Tourism enable the Bureau to identify Illinois' best tourism customers, thus making it easier to target efforts toward motivating them to travel in Illinois.  These technologies, combined with the Bureau's other activities, should help to keep Illinois at the forefront in travel industry growth.<p>

<h3>ENERGYWISE HOMES OF ILLINOIS GETS TOP BILLING IN SUN-TIMES ARTICLE</h3>

DCCA's EnergyWise Homes of Illinois program recently received front-page status in the Chicago Sun-Times weekend HOMELIFE section.  The story, which pointed out ways the program can help homeowners save substantial dollars while promoting energy conservation, has been a real boost to efforts to educate the general public about the benefits of home energy conservation.<p>

The story, written by Hilary Anderson, focused on energy-efficient mortgages that use standardized ratings to determine the energy efficiency of both newly-constructed homes and existing dwellings.  By qualifying for an Energy Edge Mortgage (EEM), those who purchase energy-efficient homes often can extend their debt ratios, thus enabling them to purchase a higher-priced home because of its lower monthly energy costs.  Energy Improvement Mortgages (EIMs) that finance improvements that make existing homes more energy efficient also are available to many current homeowners and those seeking to purchase such homes.<p>

To qualify for the special mortgages, homes must undergo an energy audit, conducted by a certified home energy rater.  These raters collect data on the home's energy efficiency and enter the data into a computer at DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling.  DCCA then issues a home energy rating and a report that recommends areas where energy improvements could be made.<p>  

The ratings may be used by homeowners or builders to assist in qualifying for the special loans, but they also can be used as important informational tools in helping homeowners identify ways to increase a home's energy efficiency.<p>

For more information about the EnergyWise Homes of Illinois program, contact John Marley at DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling at 217/785-2007 (TDD users call 217/785-0211).<p>

<h3>IMA ANNOUNCES TEAM EXCELLENCE AWARD COMPETITION</h3>

Move over Bulls, Blackhawks and Bears -- a whole new kind of team spirit is sweeping Illinois, and it's saving Illinois companies thousands of dollars every year.  Employees of Illinois companies are teaming together to develop innovative ways to improve quality, reduce costs and build enthusiasm on the job.  These impressive efforts are deserving of recognition, and they're getting it through the Illinois Team Excellence Award.<p>

The Illinois Team Excellence Award was founded by the Illinois Manufacturers' Association to provide a forum for Illinois employees to show how their involvement, teamwork and innovation make Illinois businesses more competitive and successful.  In the past four years, nearly 100 companies have illustrated their team projects in 15-minute presentations to audiences of peers, program judges and the public in the competition for this Illinois team-based quality award.<p>

Everybody wins in the Illinois Team Excellence Award program.  Team players whose ideas have worked to better the company take to the stage with their projects and shine in the spotlight.  Companies supporting teamwork demonstrate and publicize their commitment to employee empowerment.  The program is an active exchange among the state's most innovative companies and employees, sharing ideas for a strong and healthy business climate in Illinois.<p>

Since excellence knows no boundaries, the program welcomes all Illinois businesses, be they manufacturing, service, government agencies, educational institutions and health care providers.<p>

This year, the Illinois Team Excellence Award program culminated in the IMA's Quest for Excellence, a day of teaching, training, learning and celebrating people and quality held in October in Rosemont.  Nine teams that had advanced from the regional stage of the competition polished their team presentations for one more performance to a record-breaking crowd.  While teams presented their projects throughout the day, breakout sessions featured expert speakers on issues such as management practices in the 21st Century, organizational survival in the next century, recognizing and rewarding employees and continuous quality improvement.<p>

In the end, Motorola, Quartz Products Division, of Schaumburg claimed the large company title, and Craftsman Custom Metal Fabricators, Inc. of Schiller Park netted the top small company prize.  The silver medal in the large company division went to Caterpillar Inc.'s Aurora plant, and bronze to Brach and Brock Confections of Chicago.  Rockford's Zenith Cutter Co. claimed the silver in the small company division, and Alpharma of Chicago Heights took home the bronze.<p>

Companies of all shapes and sizes with a plant or headquarters in Illinois are invited to participate in the 1997 Illinois Team Excellence Award program.  Entry forms will be available in February.  A video of the 1996 Illinois Team Excellence Awards also is available from the Illinois Manufacturers' Association at a cost of $9.00.  <p>

For an application or more information about the Illinois Team Excellence Award program, contact Jane Frech, vice president of Public Affairs, at the Illinois Manufacturers' Association, 220 E. Adams St., Springfield, IL  62701-1123.<p>

<h3>EXPORTS KEY TO THE FUTURE OF ILLINOIS COAL</h3>

Developing new export markets for Illinois coal is key to the future of the coal mining industry in our state, according to a new report, Export Markets for Illinois Coal, prepared for DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing (OCDM).<p>

The report notes that global demand for coal will rise dramatically over the next decade as more countries turn to coal for electricity generation.  In particular, the Atlantic market is expected to grow by 20 to 30 million tons.<p>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, Gov. Jim Edgar's senior adviser for economic development, said, "Our goal should be to identify where Illinois coal can be competitive and target those markets.  There are some 'niche' markets we should be able to penetrate -- markets where Illinois producers can deliver the coal efficiently and where the quality of our coal matches the demand of the buyers."<p>

Aggressive industry marketing resulted in a ten-fold increase in Illinois coal exports in 1995, reaching a record 2.7 million tons, with Morocco, Germany, the United Kingdom and Denmark as major buyers.  Kustra noted that a new $2 million initiative, recently announced by Gov. Edgar, will be instrumental in OCDM's efforts to further market Illinois coal to prospective buyers.  The funds will be used to develop information and contacts that Illinois coal producers can use to target specific foreign markets.  <p>

"The Illinois coal industry continues to face many challenges," Kustra said.  "We are committed to working closely with the industry to help promote Illinois coal exports.  Exports represent not only a realistic marketing objective, but a potential stabilizing force in these challenging times."<p>

<h3>FEDERAL GRANT HELPS EXPAND TECHNICAL SERVICES FOR SMALL AND MID-SIZED ILLINOIS MANUFACTURERS</h3>

Small and medium-sized manufacturers in Illinois just got a better tool to help their efforts to utilize new technologies to modernize and expand for the future.<p>

The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) recently awarded a $2.67 million grant that, coupled with $1.2 million in state grants and in-kind contributions from private resources, will help the Illinois Manufacturing Extension Center (IMEC) expand and improve its services. IMEC, located at Bradley University in Peoria with sub-centers on the campuses of Rock Valley College in Rockford and Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, is part of DCCA's statewide Manufacturing Extension Partnership of Illinois.  IMEC field offices are located in the Quad Cities, Joliet, LaSalle-Peru, Bloomington-Normal, Springfield and Edwardsville.  DCCA was a partner both in the creation of IMEC and in the preparation of the successful grant application.  <p>

IMEC provides a range of technical services to firms, including manufacturing assessment, engineering assistance, modernization demonstrations, support in product and network development, and referrals for services provided by other private firms.<p>

The federal grant will help IMEC expand its offerings at existing offices and add four new field extension offices.  The goal is to ensure that 80 percent of the state's small and medium-sized manufacturers can access an office within 40 miles of their locations.<p>

"We're delighted that federal officials agree with us that Illinois small and medium-sized manufacturers need and deserve public support as they strive to take full advantage of global market opportunities and grow stronger," said Gov. Jim Edgar.  The Governor pointed out that the grant, coupled with his administration's financial support over the past several years, will mean that the state's small and medium-sized businesses can enjoy an even more comprehensive level of technical support and assistance as they seek to enhance productivity, improve technology and compete more effectively.<p>

IMEC and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership of Illinois replace the pilot "Project COMPETE" technology extension effort.<p>

For more information about IMEC or the Manufacturing Extension Partnership of Illinois, contact Jack MacLennan in DCCA's Office of Business Technology and Competitiveness at 312/814-2366 (TDD users call 800/419-0667).<p>

<h3>JTPA WINNERS DEMONSTRATE ILLINOIS' "CAN-DO" ATTITUDE</h3>

The Twelfth Annual Illinois Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) Awards Banquet, held in Springfield in October, demonstrated once again why Illinois' workforce development efforts consistently lead the nation:  the attitude of JTPA's administrators, participants and the employers whose support of the program makes it all worthwhile.  Those employers include Kraft Foods, Inc. and WQAD-TV, winners of the 1996 JTPA Private Sector Awards.<p>

Kraft, nominated by the Private Industry Council of Northern Cook County (PIC), sponsors numerous programs designed to promote workforce development efforts.  From an education/teacher training program that encourages minorities to pursue careers in education and provides funds to institutions that concentrate on these programs, to contributing staff, funds and products to support PIC's efforts, Kraft has demonstrated an outstanding commitment to the betterment of the state's workforce.  Kraft also is a significant contributor to the Resource Development Campaign, a pool of funds contributed by private sector firms to provide scholarships for people who do not wish to seek public assistance but need financial aid to pursue skills training.  Kraft's leadership has been instrumental in convincing other companies to participate in the workforce development system.<p>

WQAD-TV, Channel Eight, takes its public service commitment to the Quad Cities area seriously.  When Special Projects Director Clifford Brockman heard that federal funding for the area's Summer Youth Program was unlikely, he approached the Workforce Employment and Training Center with a strategy.  The "Kids Count Job Exchange," using television to match job seekers with available jobs, was born.  WQAD staffers wrote scripts, traveled to local high schools to shoot video resumes from participating youths, amd approached businesses to encourage their participation as employers or sponsors.  A live broadcast, backed by phone banks, featured the video resumes and fielded calls from youths and potential employers.  The Kids Count Job Exchange helped ensure that many Quad City-area youths found the jobs they needed.<p>

Businesses like Kraft and WQAD-TV are instrumental in Illinois' efforts to build a skilled, productive workforce.  Also key are the efforts of individual programs, program staffers and participants.<p>

The TARGET program, operated by DuPage Job Training, is an example.  TARGET is designed to give women the ability to set realistic goals and plan a career path leading to economic independence.  The program includes career guidance, employment and training opportunities, life skills training and job search/placement assistance.  TARGET successfully graduated 93 percent of those enrolled in its 1995 program, with 77 percent of those entering employment.  Thirty-four percent were trained and obtained employment in a non-traditional job, far surpassing the U.S. Department of Labor standard of 6 percent. <p> 
Martha Kahle, Field Office Supervisor for the Northwest Suburban Employment and Training Center, Private Industry Council of Northern Cook County, is one of the JTPA staffers singled out for recognition this year.  As Supervisor, Martha has instituted policies in the Center to ensure that clients are served in a professional, courteous environment.  But beyond her administrative duties, Martha often works 12 hour days, Saturdays and Sundays to accommodate the needs of her clients.<p>

Typical of this year's participant winners was Angela Bowers, a single mother of two.  Although she worked in housekeeping at a local hotel, Angie's salary was not enough -- she needed public assistance to feed and support herself and her children.  Angie realized that her high school diploma would not qualify her for the kind of job opportunities she needed.  With the help of the Business Employment Skills Team, Inc. (BEST), the JTPA  provider serving Bureau, LaSalle, Lee and Putnam counties, Angie enrolled at Sauk Valley College studying medical transcription.  Despite her many responsibilities and the tragic death of her father in an automobile accident, Angie earned high grades.  Today, Angie has realized her dream and is employed full-time as a medical transcriptionist at KSB Hospital.<p>

JTPA's stories are often inspirational and always gratifying.  In Illinois, the private sector, state government, area service providers, staff and participants are dedicated to the concept that training, hard work and opportunities can keep Illinois' workforce among the best qualified in the world.<p>

<h3>MAPPING PROGRAM WINS NATIONAL RECOGNITION</h3>

The Mapping the Future of Your Community Program, administered by the Illinois Institute for Rural Affairs (IIRA) at Western Illinois University and sponsored by DCCA and the Governor's Rural Affairs Council, recently received the 1996 Innovation Award from the National Association of Development Organizations (NADO).<p>

MAPPING, which is an acronym for Management and Planning Programs involving Non-metropolitan Groups, is a series of community-based strategic visioning and planning sessions designed to help rural community leaders create a long-term focus ad action plan for community and economic development.  Since its inception, the program has worked with approximately 50 communities, as well as more than 20 school districts and health agencies to help them develop integrated decision-making plans.<p>

Norman Walzer, IIRA Director, said MAPPING is an exciting program because it is based on local initiatives and incorporates University talent in addressing local needs.  "We're trying to create a seamless approach," Walzer said.  "We start with the MAPPING program to help a community set its vision.  This can lead to participation with DCCA's Competitive Communities Initiative (CCI) or Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra's Main Street program, helping community leaders take the necessary steps to develop that vision.  Another step may be to bring in a Peace Corps Fellow to provide the necessary technical expertise to help the community further develop its goals and objectives."<p>

Steve Kline, director of the MAPPING effort, said the program often works with clusters of communities rather than individual communities.  "We try to get communities with shared interests to work together; for example, communities within a large rural school district might work together to develop a regional vision, as well as a vision for each community." <p>

Kline said the enthusiasm generated within the communities is encouraging.  "In Havana, community leaders wanted to open a shuttered movie theater.  With permission from the owner, they went in, cleaned up the theater, and held a community meeting there.  They turned on the lights, popped popcorn, and attracted more than 200 people who could see the vision in action and find a way to participate."<p>

IIRA staff work with about six new communities and five school districts each year, as well as following up with technical assistance to communities that have completed the MAPPING program.  A current project involves working with rural communities to help them create community home pages on the World Wide Web.<p>

MAPPING was featured at the NADO national conference as a model program and also will be highlighted in a special report to be distributed to community development professionals throughout the U.S.<p>

Gov. Jim Edgar visited the SIU-Carbondale campus in October to announce a $2 million coal marketing initiative to be administered by DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing.  The new program will help Illinois coal producers expand their sales into growing domestic and international coal markets, and also address infrastructure limitations that affect the production and movement of coal within and out of Illinois.  Illinois coal exports increased to 2.7 million tons in 1995, up from 236,000 tons in 1994.  The new initiative is expected to increase coal exports to 5 million tons by the year 2000.<p>

<h3>APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE FOR GOVERNOR'S HOME TOWN AWARDS</h3>

It's time once again to think about honoring the commitments made by volunteers in Illinois communities by nominating their efforts for recognition in the 16th Annual Governor's Home Town Awards program.<p>

Any local government, community-based organization or volunteer group within Illinois is eligible to enter the competition.  Successful entries typically involve volunteer efforts to make their communities a better place to live, work and do business.  Projects must demonstrate broad volunteer support and participation.  Although projects that span more than one year are acceptable, judges will only examine activities accomplished within the most recent calendar year.<p>

Projects are judged using four criteria:  addressing a specific community need; heavy involvement of volunteer resources; generating results; and community support.  Projects compete against those conducted in communities of similar population size.  Each population category includes specific categories under which projects may apply.  These include General Awards (efforts on behalf of the community at-large), Youth Involvement (projects selected, planned and carried out by the community's youths and/or projects that directly benefit youths), Economic Development (projects involving volunteers that help create or retain jobs in the community), and Senior Citizen Involvement (projects selected, planned and carried out by the community's seniors and/or projects that directly benefit senior citizens.)<p>

Communities compete for first, second, third and fourth place awards in each of the categories.  First-place winners compete against each other for the coveted Governor's Cup, a traveling silver trophy awarded each year to the project most representative of Illinois volunteerism during that year.  Judging is done by a group of volunteers who represent organizations that have won Governor's Home Town Awards in the past.  Awards are presented during a recognition banquet, which will be held in Springfield in June 1997.<p>

The deadline to apply for the 1997 Governor's Home Town Awards is February 21, 1997.  For further information or an application guidebook, contact Lou Ann Ladage at DCCA, phone 217/785-6154 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).<p>

<h3>1997 COAL CALENDARS NOW AVAILABLE</h3>
<h4>by Barbara Antonini, Office of Coal Development and Marketing</h4>

The 1997 Coal Calendars are now available!<p>

Each year, hundreds of fifth- and sixth-grade students from throughout the state submit essays and art work about the Illinois coal industry and its importance to our state.  The winning work is displayed in the Illinois Coal Calendar, showcasing their efforts.<p>

This year's calendar, the eighth annual calendar, is particularly noteworthy.  J. Davitt McAteer, Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health at the U.S. Department of Labor, said the calendar reaches out to the mining community and is a daily reminder of the need for safety in our mines.  In fact, McAteer was so impressed with the calendar that he requested the original art work be available for display at the National Mine Health and Safety Academy in Beckley, West Virginia.  Each poster has been matted and placed in an oak frame for the display, which provides an opportunity for many industry students and international visitors to the Academy to view the ways that young Illinoisans communicate important safety messages.  McAteer also sent personal congratulatory letters to the 25 students whose essays and art work are reproduced in the calendar.<p>

The 1997 Coal Calendar Contest was co-sponsored by DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing, and the Coal Research Center, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.  To request a calendar or for further information about the contest, contact Barbara Antonini, DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing, 325 W. Adams, Springfield, IL 62704, phone 217/524-3280 (TDD users call 217/785-0211).<p>

<h3>DCCA EFFORTS RECOGNIZED BY ILLINOIS EPA</h3>

DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance Program and the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network (ISBDCN) recently received 1996 Certificates of Commendation from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) for their work in helping implement the "Clean Break" environmental amnesty program in Illinois.<p>

Clean Break, a recently-completed initiative enacted in response to recommendations made by the Governor's Small Business Environmental Task Force, gave auto body, auto repair and printing business owners free technical assistance from IEPA experts while offering them amnesty from fines and penalties resulting from environmental violations uncovered during the review process.  The program was founded on the theory that most small business owners want to comply with environmental regulations but need help to determine what those regulations are.<p>

DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance Program served as an initial contact for the program, enabling business owners to seek information on a confidential basis.  The Illinois Small Business Development Center Network sponsored numerous local seminars to explain Clean Break and helped with intake.<p>

The IEPA's Certificate of Commendation recognizes individuals or groups for outstanding contributions to protection of the environment or other significant achievements in Illinois.  DCCA also receoved a Certificate for its work during 1995.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS F.I.R.S.T. PROMOTES ILLINOIS' POSITIVE BUSINESS CLIMATE</h3>
<h4>by Peter W. Ramirez, DCCA Bureau of Business Development</h4>

Illinois F.I.R.S.T. (Focused Industrial Retention Support Team) is off and running.  Illinois F.I.R.S.T. is a joint effort that brings together the resources of DCCA and Argonne National Laboratory, NORBIC (North Business and Industrial Council), Chicagoland Enterprise Center, ComEd, People's Gas and the Chicago Tribune to identify and assist manufacturers interested in expanding, modernizing, relocating, training, retraining or developing new technologies.<p>    

Illinois F.I.R.S.T. is a pro-active effort that specifically targets manufacturers in Northern Illinois.  Initially, businesses are contacted with an outreach letter from Gov. Jim Edgar, which is followed up by a phone call from Illinois F.I.R.S.T.  After an initial screening, a Client Summary Sheet is filled out that establishes the position of the company and the problems and challenges it faces.  Resources and information are then provided to assist with the client's needs, with all activities tracked and recorded, and files monitored constantly.  In addition, a follow-up survey is sent to each client to provide Illinois F.I.R.S.T. with client satisfaction information.<p>  
 
The response of the manufacturing community to this pilot effort has been gratifying.  Using both marketing efforts and a direct mail campaign, Illinois F.I.R.S.T. has contacted 320 manufacturers.  To date, 70 of these businesses have received information or technical assistance with expansion support, environmental issues, integrated management support, production evaluation, relocation and site selection, training, workers compensation and turnaround services.<p>  

Illinois F.I.R.S.T. continues to work with the private sector to expand its efforts.  The partnership has engaged the Society of the Plastics Industry, American Plastics Industry, and the American Electronics Association to host industry summit meetings to discuss the needs of these specific industries.  It is working with the DuPage Area Association of Business and Industry to assist with client screening and intake.  And nearly two dozen additional professionals have agreed to provide pro bono services in their areas of expertise<p>.

For information about Illinois F.I.R.S.T., contact Peter W. Ramirez in DCCA's Bureau of Business Development at 312/814-5252 (TDD users call 800/419-0667).<p>

<h3>TQM TEAMS MAKING A DIFFERENCE</h3>
<h4>by Karen Ruwe, DCCA Division of Fiscal Management</h4>

DCCA's efforts to incorporate the principles of Total Quality Management (TQM) into the agency's processes are beginning to show an impact that will benefit the agency's clients, as well as streamline DCCA's internal processes.  The efforts of the Grant Processing Team, for example, are expected to cut the time it takes for DCCA to process grants, thus improving the grants cycle for external clients.<p>

The Grant Processing Team set out last spring to review the manner in which DCCA processes and awards grants.  The Team conducted both cycle time and quality defect studies to determine where changes could be made.<p>

The Team's review resulted in the elimination of Financial Commitment Committee (FCC) approval for all grant programs that currently have an approved internal review process in place.  With the aid of the Chief Internal Auditor, quality review processes were documented and approved for most grant programs.  These steps are expected to cut grant processing time by approximately two weeks per grant.<p>

The Grant Processing Team also recommended standardizing the agency's grant boilerplates.  DCCA's Legal office, working with representatives from program and fiscal staff, has already completed work on standardizing boilerplate sections that are the same in all agency grants.  Meetings are currently being held to complete program-specific boilerplates.  It is expected that boilerplate standardization will lower the chances that incorrect boilerplate sections are used, and thus lessen the time needed for grant review and copying.<p>

The Grant Processing Team continues to look at new ways to streamline and improve DCCA's grant processes.  Areas now being considered for study include further automation of the review and approval process, and paperwork reduction efforts.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS BUSINESSES LEARNING TO REDUCE ENERGY COSTS</h3>
<h4>by Don McGee, DCCA Bureau of Energy and Recycling </h4>

Businesses are often large users of energy.  To help them identify energy conservation practices that can help them reduce energy usage, DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling and Central Illinois Public Service Company (CIPS), have joined with Southern Illinois University at Carbondale (SIU-C) to establish a prototype energy educational project for regional businesses.<p>   

The new program, Creating Energy Management Opportunities for Industry (CEMOI), under direction of professor Manohar Kulkarni, PE, Ph.D., of the SIU-C Department of Mechanical Engineering and Energy Processes, provides businesses with on-site energy inspections conducted by the university's graduate and engineering students.  Each student receives specialized energy training from DCCA Energy staff and CIPS service representatives to teach ways to identify immediate, low-cost and no-cost dollar savings for businesses.<p>  

As part of the service, Illinois businesses receiving an energy inspection from CEMOI staff are provided an executive summary of the findings.  Participating businesses will receive an "Energy Analysis Report" identifying potential dollar-saving opportunities that require no financial investment or a small investment.  CEMOI also will develop and maintain, free of charge, an Energy Resources Directory, which will include information about private sector energy service providers in their region, as well as governmental and educational resources that are available to assist area businesses.<p>  

This fall, CIPS sponsored a CEMOI kick-off luncheon at the SIU-C Incubator.   Professor Kulkarni reported that in just the preliminary phases of the program, eight businesses receiving services have already realized an average savings of $1500 per business or 10 percent of their annual costs, with a maximum of a five-month payback on investment.<p>   

It is hoped that, with DCCA's assistance and regional support from the private sector, the CEMOI program will eventually become a self-sustaining business assistance program in Southern Illinois.<p>

The CEMOI office is located in the SIU-C Incubator facility at 150 East Pleasant Hill Road, Carbondale, IL  62901-6890, phone 618/453-2067.  Or, for further information, contact Don McGee at DCCA at 217/785-2862 (TDD users call 217/785-0211).<p>

<h3>DCCA WINS 1996 "WEB WARRIOR" AWARD</h3>

DCCA's Internet home page is winning recognition for its business savvy.  The page recently was named as the Sixth Place Winner of the "1996 Web Warrior Award" by Fuld & Company Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a pioneer in the field of competitive and regional intelligence that provides assistance to economic development organizations and utility companies to help them define their competitive advantages.<p>

Fuld & Company selected DCCA's site after a review of more than 100 Websites from around the world.  Using as its criteria Clarity, Strategic Focus, Business Climate, Depth of Resources, and Access to Information, company officials examined the sites from the corporate CEO's perspective and what that individual would need to know when considering relocating or expanding a facility in a region.  The company noted that, "With more than 50 million worldwide users and over 600,000 businesses on-line, the World Wide Web is today's global marketplace.  To effectively compete in this new arena, economic development agencies need to provide relevant, timely and targeted information to business leaders and investors."<p>

In reviewing DCCA's Website, Fuld & Company noted, "The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs wants your business in Illinois and they have the professional staff, relevant information, and assistance programs to help make your decision an easy one.   This is a no-frills, hands-on site that provides good, detailed information and access to individual assistance to help you find the right location."<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS DISLOCATED WORKER PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO WIN RECOGNITION</h3>

Illinois continues to lead the way in promoting excellence in its services to dislocated workers.  Recently, six more of Illinois' 26 Service Delivery Areas (SDAs) were certified as members of the Enterprise, joining nine of their Illinois counterparts as members of this prestigious organization.  Today, nearly 58 percent of Illinois' SDAs are Enterprise members; nationally the average is only 25 percent.  The only states even close to Illinois in membership are Florida, where 48 percent of the state's organizations have won recognition, and Texas, where 34 percent of organizations are members.<p>

What is so important about Enterprise membership?  Selection to the Enterprise signals that a dislocated worker organization is dedicated to providing excellent services to its clients.  To receive membership in the Enterprise, an organization has to achieve at least an 80 percent placement rate for those enrolled in dislocated worker programs, meet or exceed the employment standard for Governor's reserve and national discretionary projects, achieve a rate of at least 75 percent on a standard customer satisfaction survey administered by an independent research firm, and demonstrate a commitment to continuous improvement in 10 quality management dimensions.<p>

Enterprise membership also is rewarding for those organizations that achieve it.  Members benefit from advanced training and assistance provided by nationally-recognized experts and their peers.  In fact, even the process of applying for membership has benefits because the organizations can get important feedback from the independent customer satisfaction survey.<p>

Illinois' leadership is nothing new.  Illinois has long been recognized as a leader in administering the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) program.  Between July 1, 1995 and June 30, 1996, 30,588 dislocated workers were served by Illinois' dislocated worker programs.  Of the 17,577 who completed the program, 8,623 re-entered the labor force at an average wage of $10.48 per hour.<p>  

Last year, nine Illinois organizations were named as Charter Members of the Enterprise -- more than any other state.  Equally significant, although only about 4 percent of the nation's SDAs are in Illinois, Illinois SDAs account for nearly one-tenth of the nation's Enterprise members -- a significant measure of the quality of Illinois' services.<p>

<h3>DCCA TARGETS "ORPHAN WASTES"</h3>
<h4>by Angie Adkins, DCCA Bureau of Energy and Recycling</h4>

DCCA's Technology and Practices Demonstration Program (TPDP) has taken on the issue of so-called "orphan wastes" in Illinois.  Orphan wastes -- discarded materials other than conventional recyclables, such as aluminum and tin cans, glass bottles and jars, plastic bottles and paper -- often have the potential to be recycled, but face obstacles due to collection and processing problems.<p>  

The Bureau of Energy and Recycling recently awarded grants to the DuPage County Solid Waste Department and a Springfield paint store as part of its effort to encourage more recycling of orphan wastes.<p>

Studies have shown that construction and demolition wastes may contribute up to one-third of the wastes disposed in landfills.  At present, only clean sources of concrete and asphalt rubble from highway construction are routinely recycled as aggregate.  The DuPage County Construction and Demolition Site Recycling Project will identify quantities and types of debris generated in the construction and demolition process, and identify and implement opportunities for recycling.  <p>

DuPage County will contract for waste audits of a number of selected construction sites that volunteer to participate in the project.  Each contractor will receive the results of the audit, educational materials on methods to separate and prepare wastes for recycling, a directory of recycling service providers, and an analysis of the potential savings in waste disposal costs.  The contractors also will be surveyed at a later date to determine whether recycling activities have increased, and by what amount.<p>

The $64,488 grant will pay for subcontractor costs to conduct the waste audits and to develop educational materials for construction and demolition contractors.  Project results will be used to create two documents -- a Construction and Demolition Site Recycling Manual, and a Directory of Construction and Demolition recycling service providers in the Chicagoland area.  The USEPA has agreed to pay for costs associated with publishing the manual and directory.<p>

A $15,474 grant to Friedman's Wallpaper and Paints in Springfield will enable the firm to purchase a Mobile Earth Safe Paint Can Crusher.  Up to 90 percent of the waste collected at IEPA's household hazardous waste collection events has been leftover paint.  A mobile can crusher can promote recycling by eliminating hand scraping, paint fume inhalation, drying time and storage consideration.  <p>

Under the project, citizens may bring leftover paint cans to Friedman's or other participating drop-off locations.  The cans are placed in the mobile can crusher, which can crush up to 15 cans at a time.  Excess paints, as well as the cans, are retrieved for recycling, with the cans sent to a local recycler for further processing.<p>

Because the equipment is mobile, it can easily be transported to other Springfield-area communities for paint can recycling drives.<p>

For further information about the Technology and Practices Demonstration Program, contact Angie Adkins in DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling, at 217/785-2808 (TDD users call 217/785-0211).<p>

<h3>HENDERSON, COIL NAMED "ECONOMIC DEVELOPERS OF THE YEAR"</h3>

Two DCCA staffers were recently singled out for special awards for their efforts to promote the state's economic development.<p>

Craig Coil, Manager of DCCA's Industry Development Division, was named "Economic Developer of the Year" by the Illinois Development Council (IDC) during its fall conference held in Chicago.  Tom Henderson, who manages several DCCA programs including the Illinois Enterprise Zone Program, was selected as "Economic Developer of the Year" by the Illinois Enterprise Zone Association (IEZA) at the organization's conference, which was held in conjunction with the IDC conference.<p>

Coil, who joined DCCA in 1988, heads a staff of 18 project managers and regional representatives who work to help businesses locate, expand and prosper in Illinois.  During Fiscal Year 1996, projects undertaken by the Industry Development staff culminated in a capital investment in Illinois totaling more than $1.2 billion that will create nearly 9,000 jobs and retain more than 14,000 jobs.<p>

IDC President Lori Healey said Coil was nominated by several colleagues.  "Craig works hard and has earned the respect of his peers across the state.  We felt he demonstrated the qualities we look for in an exemplary professional in the economic development field."<p>

The IDC has presented the award annually for more than a decade.<p>

IEZA President Jeanne Gustafson said the organization unanimously chose Henderson as the first recipient of its new award.  "Tom has served as an excellent ambassador for the State of Illinois and has initiated and coordinated several partnerships between local and state levels," she said.  As examples, she cited a contract between DCCA and the IEZA for training of local enterprise zone administrators, a joint effort to place an ad in Expansion Management magazine and an Industrial Park survey. <p>   

Henderson, an small business owner who served as an internal auditor for the Illinois Department of Transportation and in numerous private banking positions before joining DCCA,  is an active member of the IEZA, the American Enterprise Zone Association, the Illinois Tax Increment Association and the IDC.<p>

<h3>EXPORTS ARE A VITAL COMPONENT OF ILLINOIS' ECONOMY</h3>

Exporting continues to grow in its importance to the Illinois economy.  Every dollar of exports generates four cents in state tax revenue.  Equally impressive, one in eight jobs in Illinois (and one in four manufacturing jobs) is dependent on exporting.  In  1995, more than 453,000 Illinoisans were employed in jobs sustained by direct and indirect exports.<p>

For the most part, these are both high-paying and permanent jobs.  Exporting companies tend to pay employees higher wages than plants that produce only for the domestic marketplace.  Exporting companies also tend to be larger than others; on average they are four times as large in employment and six times as large in sales.  Companies that export experience high worker productivity, estimated at 30 to 50 percent higher than in non-exporting companies.  Further, value-added per employee is up to 33 percent greater in exporting plants than in non-exporting plants, and sales per employee tend to be 50 percent greater in exporting companies than in non-exporting firms.  <p>

Export-related jobs are globally competitive and proving to be the key to the creation and retention of higher paying and permanent jobs in Illinois.  Wages for workers in the manufacturing and service exporting sectors, where Illinois products are the most competitive, substantially exceed the U.S. average.<p>

In addition, exporting companies are more innovative.  Exporters adopt new technologies far more frequently than non-exporters and report more significant benefits from doing so.  This tendency is especially strong in fabricated metal products, machinery, computers and transportation equipment -- key industrial sectors in Illinois.<p>

DCCA is serious about its efforts to help Illinois businesses expand their exporting opportunities.  With five International Trade Centers located throughout the state, two NAFTA Opportunity Centers, and foreign trade offices in Brussels, Belgium; Hong Kong; Tokyo, Japan; Mexico City, Mexico; Warsaw, Poland; and Budapest, Hungary, DCCA helps entrepreneurs and seasoned companies alike enter the export marketplace and build upon their exporting potential.<p>  

The efforts are working.  Illinois ranked fifth in the nation among the top 10 exporting states in 1995 -- the second consecutive year our state improved its ranking.  Illinois' export growth is evidenced by double-digit export increases in 1993, 1994, and 1995  (24.6 percent, 20.2 percent and 23.6 percent respectively.)  Illinois exports reached an all-time high of $32.6 billion in 1995, an increase of 23.6 percent over 1994 and nearly double the 13.8 percent increase of all U.S. exports for the same period. <p>

<h3>BIDC WINS NATIONAL HONORS</h3>

As part of its 50th Anniversary celebration, the National Association of State Development Agencies (NASDA) recently created two new awards recognizing researchers' contributions to the success of state economic development programs.  The  Illinois Business and Industry Data Center (BIDC) program, administered by DCCA, won an Honorable Mention in the national competition.<p>

The Illinois Business and Industry Data Center is an innovative way to use an existing program to make it easier for small businesses, independent contractors, and entrepreneurs to access the statistical data they need to make critical business decisions.  Modeled after the U.S. Census Bureau's State Data Center and Business and Industry Data Center, the BIDC is a network of 28 local and regional affiliates, many from colleges and universities, regional planning commissions, public libraries, and small business development centers.<p>  

Local affiliates deal directly with small businesses and other end users of data.  Regional affiliates collect and disseminate information to both end users and local affiliates.  Regional affiliates also prepare quarterly regional analyses that can be distributed to businesses and development offices statewide.<p>  

The BIDC program magnifies DCCA's ability to serve the research needs of entrepreneurs and the Illinois small business community by enabling users to get information locally and tap the resources of a multitude of organizations throughout the state.<p>

NASDA selected the BIDC for recognition from 21 applicants.  In naming BIDC for the Honorable Mention, NASDA said the project demonstrated a key contribution to state economic development efforts, a unique approach to utilizing researchers as part of the economic development team, a potential for applicability in other states, support for economic development across program areas, and the ability to measure success for the research component of the activity, as well as the activity itself.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS COAL DEVELOPMENT BOARD AWARDS <br>
COAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT FUNDING</h3>

Illinois continues to advance clean-coal technologies that allow for the environmentally sound, cost-effective use of our state's high-sulfur coal.  Most recently, the Illinois Coal Development Board awarded more than $3 million for the performance of 34 laboratory-scale research projects and two development-scale, clean-coal technology projects.  DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing (OCDM) will issue grants for these projects which will be monitored by the Illinois Clean Coal Institute (ICCI).<p>

Research into clean-coal technologies is essential to the future of Illinois coal because without these technologies, the market for Illinois' high-sulfur coal will erode.  Most of the basic and applied research is performed at universities, private research institutions and national laboratories.  The research is divided into five categories: coal preparation (cleaning), gas cleanup, coal-related wastes (by-products) management, conversion and combustion.<p>  

Two of the recently awarded projects are development, or proof-of-concept, projects.  The first will test a coal/water slurry in cyclone boilers at the SIPCO power plant in Marion, Illinois.  This technology will help to reduce nitrogen oxide levels (NOx), as well as some sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate in the flue gas.  NOx and SO2 are considered by the US Environmental Protection Agency as major contributors to acid rain.  The second development project will test high-sulfur coal in a flue-gas scrubber that will remove SO2, NOx , and very fine, respirable particulate.  Both projects are highly leveraged, so the Illinois Coal Development Board receives a significant "bang for its buck."<p>

Both projects are in step with the goals of the Board, which is chaired by DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone.  The Board believes the time is now to build on existing markets and open new markets for Illinois coal, particularly since more stringent Clean Air Act emission limitations for SO2 will be enforceable in 2000 and 2005, and projected NOx-emission reductions loom on the horizon.  Illinois coal has many advantages, such as a high Btu rating, or heating value, but the high sulfur content is a clear disadvantage.  And, although many current, coal-fired, power company compliance strategies include use of clean-coal technologies, they also include switching to low-sulfur Western coal, which leads to a significant loss in Illinois coal sales contracts and related jobs.<p>  

This makes clean-coal technology research even more important.  The Board, the OCDM and the ICCI are faced with difficult decisions in determining which types of clean-coal technologies and marketing strategies to advance.  But, thanks to grants such as these, new technologies are being tested and, as technologies are advanced, more companies are projected to put them in place, thus rejuvenating the Illinois coal industry in the post-2005 period.<p>  

For more information about the funding of the research and development projects, contact Michael Purnell of DCCA's Office of Coal Development & Marketing at 217-785-0010 (TDD: 217-785-0211).<p>

<h3>LINCOLN FOUNDATION AWARDS PROMOTE ORGANIZATIONAL EXCELLENCE</h3>

Continuous improvement -- both in products and services -- is the key to organizational success in today's competitive global economy.  The Lincoln Foundation for Business Excellence, which is privately supported, is helping encourage Illinois organizations to undertake continuous improvement programs and quality excellence by means of self-assessment tools, best practice workshops, conferences, and the relatively new Award for Business Excellence (ABE).<p>  

Similar to the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, but adapted to the needs of Illinois, the ABE focuses on seven areas deemed essential for organizational success:  leadership; information and analysis; strategic planning; human resource development and management; process management; business results; customer focus and satisfaction.  The award is accessible to both small and large organizations in industry, service, health care and education.  Starting in 1997, the Award will also be available to state and local units of government.<p>

Participation in The Lincoln Foundation program provides a number of important benefits to organizations.  First, by using the Foundation's self-assessment guidelines, organizations can assess their operations against the Foundation's criterial of excellence.  Second, by attending best practice workshops put on by the Foundation, organizations can benchmark their performance with Lincoln Award winners, who share their experience with others.  Third, should an organization decide to apply for a Lincoln Award, it will receive valuable feedback about its operations from more than 60 leading experts from corporations and academia who serve as Lincoln Award examiners and judges -- at a nominal cost to the applicant.  And finally, participation in a continuous improvement program sends a strong signal to employees, customers and competitors that an organization is committed to excellence.  <p>

The actual process for applying for the ABE is explained in an Application Guidelines Book, available from The Lincoln Foundation.  At least five examiners review each application.  A panel of trained judges reviews the examiners' findings and determines finalists, who receive site visits.  Judges then determine if there are winners; winners receive awards at a formal ceremony in December.  Throughout this process, all application information is kept strictly confidential; only the names of Award winners are ever made public.<p>  

All organizations who apply for a Lincoln Award benefit, even if they do not receive an award.  This is because each organization submitting an application receives a detailed written feedback report that assesses its strengths and identifies areas for possible improvement.<p>  

Honeywell's Micro Switch Division in Freeport, and Cash Management Services at The First National Bank of Chicago, were last year's inaugural winners of the Industry and Services Awards.  Two new sectors -- Education and Health Care -- have been added this year, and Government Sector Awards will be added in 1997.<p>

The Lincoln Foundation for Business Excellence is currently reviewing applications for the 1996 Awards, which will be announced in November.  For further information, contact The Lincoln Foundation for Business Excellence, 820 W. Jackson Boulevard, Suite #525, Chicago, IL  60607.<p>

<h3>NEW ORGANIZATION WILL ADVOCATE FOR ILLINOIS SMALL BUSINESSES</h3>
<h4>by Joe Weiss, DCCA Small Business Division</h4>

Saying, "Small business is big business in Illinois," Gov. Jim Edgar recently joined with many of the state's leading entrepreneurs to publicly announce the formation of the Illinois Small Business 100 (ISB100), a new advocacy group designed to provide insight, direction and guidance to the Illinois small business community.<p>

Their job is an important one.  Illinois has more than 617,000 small business owners, representing a diverse range of industries and services.  In fact, 85 percent of Illinois companies employ less than 100 people and, therefore, are classified as small businesses.<p>  

The ISB100 has targeted Internet services as an important way to communicate with Illinois small businesses. DCCA is facilitating the creation of the ISB 100's home page on the Internet, which will include a statement of purpose, as well as hotlinks to ISB 100 members' E-mail addresses, chambers of commerce and trade organizations.  Plans also call for creation of an ISB 100 newsgroup on the Internet to poll members about regulatory and business issues.  In addition, the ISB 100 plans to meet annually to discuss long-term plans and programs to assist in business development.<p>
 
Members of the group were selected from nominees submitted by trade associations, professional organizations, the Illinois Small Business Development Network, the U.S. Small Business Administration, and others.<p>

<h3>CAMP ENTREPRENEUR COMES TO ILLINOIS</h3>
<h4>by Susan Nicol, Office of Women's Business Development</h4>

Encouraging young women to pursue their dreams of entrepreneurship is one of the driving forces behind Camp Entrepreneur, an award-winning residential camp held each summer at Seton Hill College in Pennsylvania.  This year, DCCA's Office of Women's Business Development, in partnership with DePaul University's Department of Management, successfully coordinated Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago in Illinois.<p> 

In recent years, the original Camp Entrepreneur has provided comprehensive exposure to the principles of business ownership to more than 100 young women graduates.  Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago was designed as a week-long commuter day camp for young women in Cook County entering their junior or senior year in high school who have expressed interest in owning their own businesses.<p>

During the week, Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago campers participated in hands-on seminars presented by local business professionals who volunteered to work with the students in areas such as marketing, financing, management and effective decision making skills, business communications and technologies, utilization of resources, and creating a professional image.<p>

A highlight of the week was a full day devoted to site visits to Chicago area businesses that are owned and operated by women. The campers benefited from the presentations and discussions from a diverse group of women business owners who shared their experiences, and offered information and insight campers will reflect upon for the rest of their lives.  Another highlight was the campers' development of their own business plans, which were presented to a panel of business experts on graduation day.  Drawing upon newly acquired inspiration, their plans reflected the cumulative knowledge and skills they gained throughout the week, as well as true entrepreneurial approaches.  The panelists were unqualifiably impressed! <p>  

Historically, young women have not been exposed to entrepreneurship as a viable career option, nor have they been introduced to business skills.  Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago graduated 16 future leaders who are now positioned to recognize that they have the ability to run their own businesses, and they are equipped with the tools necessary to visualize their own futures and to create their own opportunities.<p>

With rave reviews from this year's graduates, sponsors, staff, and Chicagoland media, the Office of Women's Business Development and DePaul University are already talking about next year's program.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING CENTERS <br>
PROVIDE "ONE-STOP" ASSISTANCE TO WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS</h3>

All over Illinois, a quiet revolution is taking place in the way our state delivers employment and training services.  In March 1994, the first Illinois Employment and Training Center (IETC) opened, bringing together Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) services with those administered by the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES).  Within a few months, four more centers opened, and more than a dozen  centers were added during 1995.  The timetable is moving even faster today, thanks to a special grant from the U.S. Department of Labor to spur development of additional IETCs throughout the state to help both workers and employers easily access the employment, training and related social services information they need.<p>

IETCs are truly "one-stop" shops.  In the past, a dislocated or disadvantaged individual might have to travel all over town or between several different communities to access needed services.  He or she might need to visit an IDES office to register for unemployment insurance, a Service Delivery Area office to sign up for training and other services under JTPA, a Community College to register for classroom coursework, and to various other agencies to sign up for other services.  Likewise, some employers found it necessary to go to more than one location to obtain the kind of statistical information they needed to find skilled workers, and to access a pool of qualified potential employees.<p>

The IETC concept has changed all that.  IETCs consolidate these services under one roof.  For example, within a few minutes after walking into the IETC, a displaced worker can register for unemployment insurance, access computer job banks, sign up for JTPA programs, review a community college catalog, and receive the kind of detailed, one-on-one assistance needed to help get back into productive work.  At the same time, employers have access to qualified applicants, using Illinois' largest applicant database.  Staff at the IETC can identify individuals who meet a business' specific needs, from managerial to high-tech, to administrative support, and refer the best qualified candidates for the job.  Professional staff in the IETC also can help with specialized services, such as staff recruitment for mass hiring, customized training, and outplacement assistance.  The latest in statistics on the workforce and its skills is available, enabling businesses to locate potential employees.  In addition, employers can work closely with the local IETC to ensure that, as training programs are developed, they are tailored to meet the needs of the local employment community, creating a bank of potential employees armed with the skills local companies need.<p>

IETCs will also be a source of the latest labor market information (LMI) for schools, libraries and students.  LMI products will be available on-site and will be distributed by the IETC in hard copy and via computer.  Students and dropouts may also use the IETC to obtain career counseling and to learn about "second chance" education programs.<p>

IETCs offer an ambitious array of services.  They can provide career counseling to help workers assess their skills and research areas where those skills are needed.  They can help workers analyze their interests and pinpoint training that can help them learn the skills they need to follow their dreams.  They can even help students identify internship and apprenticeship opportunities that can lead to potential employment.<p>

<h3>FROM THE DIRECTOR<br>
Dennis Whetstone</h3>

Economic development is clearly a priority in most communities.  Knowing successful economic development techniques, however, may not always be so clear.   That's why, in October, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), along with the Illinois Development Council (IDC), will again sponsor the Basic Economic Development Course, designed to help economic development practitioners and community leaders help their communities become more competitive in the process of economic development. <p>

The Basic Economic Development Course is an intensive five-day course, directed by Dr. Robert Koepke of Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, and coordinated by DCCA's Rich Funderburk and Mary Renner.  Among sessions to be taught are building the foundation of a competitive community, influencing investment location, supporting existing business, stimulating international trade and entrepreneurship.  On Thursday, October 24, a special session will be held on "Servicing the Prospect."  That session is open to anyone interested in attending, even those who cannot attend the other sessions.  All sessions are taught by well-respected economic development professionals from throughout the United States, including Certified Economic Developers David Richmond of Shelbyville, Indiana; M. L. DuBrow of St. Louis; and Dean Whitaker of Holland, Michigan; consultants Kate McEnroe of McEnroe Consulting, Atlanta, Georgia; David Kolzow of Fluor Daniel Consulting, Greenville, South Carolina; and Eric Canada of Blane, Canada Ltd., Wheaton; John Quinn of the University of Illinois Cooperative Extension Service, Carbondale; Doug Dougherty, executive director of the Governor's Rural Affairs Council; Michael Boer of the Greater Springfield Chamber of Commerce; and Jeff Markland of DCCA's Office of Local Initiatives.<p>  

Participation in the Basic Economic Development Course provides graduates with a basic education that they can take back home and use in helping their communities become more successful in the economic development competition.  It also is the first step toward accreditation through the American Economic Development Council (AEDC), because graduates become eligible to attend the Economic Development Institute through the University of Oklahoma, where they can earn the coveted Certified Economic Developer accreditation.<p>

The October course will be the third Basic Economic Development Course DCCA has co-sponsored this year.  Already, nearly 100 DCCA staff people have completed the course, as well as staff people from many of our economic development partners, such as Small Business Development Centers, Community Action Agencies and others.  I feel that the course has been instrumental in helping DCCA staff to better serve you.<p>  

I heartily encourage economic development practitioners, local officials, chamber of commerce executives and others interested in making their communities more competitive to attend the next Basic Economic Development Course.  The course will be held October 21-25 on the campus of the University of Illinois-Springfield.  Registration should be made through the Office of Continuing Education, Campus Box 1084, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, Edwardsville, IL  62026.  For further information, contact Dr. Robert Koepke at SIU-Edwardsville, telephone 618/692-2142, or Mary Renner at DCCA, 217/785-6097 (TDD users call 800/785-6055.)<p>

<h3>SMALL BUSINESSES RECEIVE A "CLEAN BREAK"</h3>
<h4>by Annette Lingleo, DCCA Bureau of Business Development</h4>

Nearly 300 Illinois auto body, auto repair and printing businesses have found it easier to comply with environmental laws, thanks to the Clean Break program, an initiative undertaken by DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance Program and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA).<p>

Clean Break is a program that gives auto body, auto repair and printing business owners free technical assistance from IEPA experts, while offering them amnesty from fines and penalties for environmental violations uncovered during the review process.  The program is based on the belief that most small business owners sincerely want to comply with environmental regulations, but need help in determining what the requirements are.  <p>

DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance Program has served as the initial contact for the program, allowing business people to ask confidential questions while remaining anonymous to the enforcement agency.  Once a business owner feels comfortable in coming forward with environmental concerns, on-site technical assistance visits are arranged with the IEPA experts, who walk through a facility with its owner, discussing the business' specific requirements.  At that point, the owner can choose to go forward with the amnesty compliance agreement, working with the IEPA to set up a reasonable period of time in which to make corrections and achieve compliance with environmental rules.<p>

The Clean Break program was enacted in response to recommendations made by the Governor's Small Business Environmental Task Force, which studied the challenges faced by small businesses in complying with federal clean air standards and other environmental rules.  To date, the program has received overwhelmingly positive response, and plans are now being made to expand it to serve other business segments.<p>

Clean Break also has had another benefit.  Working directly with small business owners gave IEPA officials a first-hand look at the impacts of various rules on businesses.  For example, many wastes from auto body and auto repair shops, such as oil filters and paint filters, are classified as "special waste," subject to additional disposal rules and regulations.  The IEPA discovered that the waste still ended up in the same place, but only after the business filled out mounds of paperwork.  The agency is now using the information it gathered to examine and correct rules that placed extra burdens on businesses while adding no protection to the environment.<p>	

To learn more about Clean Break, contact DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance helpline at 800/252-3998.<p>

<h3>STATE CLEARINGHOUSE NOW LOCATED AT DCCA'S CHICAGO OFFICE</h3>

Illinois organizations that receive federal funding are familiar with the State Clearinghouse.  Also known as the State Single Point of Contact, the State Clearinghouse must review all applications for federal funds before an organization may be eligible to receive those funds. <p> 

What organizations may not know, is that the State Clearinghouse is now a part of DCCA.  Administered by the staff of the Office of Policy Development, Planning and Research, the State Clearinghouse has recently moved to DCCA's Chicago Office.<p>

All correspondence with the State Clearinghouse should now be directed to:<p>

Virginia Bova, Single Point of Contact, DCCA, James R. Thompson Center, 100 W. Randolph, Suite 3-400, Chicago, IL  60601, phone 312/814-6028, fax 312/814-1800 (TDD users call 800/419-0667).<p>

<hr>
<h3>WHAT IS THE STATE CLEARINGHOUSE?</h3>

Each year, the federal government awards billions of dollars in grants to fund a myriad of projects.  To ensure that state and local governments have a say in those projects, Executive Order 12372 was enacted in 1983, requiring federal agencies to designate certain programs and projects to be eligible for review by the states.  The Executive Order allowed each state to design a process to simplify giving state and local elected officials an opportunity to review and comment on these proposed projects.  Illinois created the Illinois State Clearinghouse, housed at the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), to handle this process.<p>

The process has several steps.  First, local grant applicants are encouraged to contact the State Clearinghouse prior to submitting an application to determine whether the grant they seek has been selected for review.  If so, the grant applicant submits the project proposal to the federal government, and sends the State Clearinghouse a standard form that includes basic project and program information.<p>

While federal officials begin reviewing the project, the State Clearinghouse assigns a State Application Identifier (SAI) number and distributes the project to reviewers representing 19 Regional Planning Commissions and 23 other organizations located throughout the state.<p>

Reviewers have 30 days in which to comment.  Any comments are submitted to both the State Clearinghouse and the applicant.  If no unfavorable comments are received, the State Clearinghouse issues a sign-off letter to the applicant, the applicable Regional Clearinghouse and the federal agency, noting the proposal's compatibility with state, regional and local development plans.  If negative comments are received, the sign-off letter will include suggestions on ways to address the compatibility defects.  Negative comments do not, however, prohibit an applicant from continuing the application process.<p>

The Illinois State Clearinghouse keeps on file a list of current grant applications submitted by various state agencies.  The State Clearinghouse also provides review for Environmental Impact Statements and Environmental assessments.<p>

<h3>NEW REPORT ANALYZES UTILITY RESTRUCTURING; EFFECT ON COAL</h3>

<em>by Dan Keefe, DCCA Division of Coal Development and Marketing</em><p>

As the electric utility industry moves away from regulated service and closer to a competitive marketplace, the Illinois coal industry faces an uncertain future, according to a new report from DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing (OCDM).  The report, "Illinois Coal Industry White Paper:  Understanding Electric Utility Restructuring," prepared by the Center for Regulatory Studies at Illinois State University, has been well-received by both coal and utility industry professionals as a thorough analysis of restructuring issues and their potential impact on coal markets.<p>

Just as telecommunications, airlines, trucking, banking and natural gas industries have undergone deregulation, the electric utility industry is now being targeted by free-market policymakers whose primary objective is to bring down the cost of electric services by allowing market forces, rather than government regulators, to set the price of these services.  Federal and state governments are working to accomplish the goal by considering various scenarios for replacing regulation with competition.<p>

The OCDM White Paper discusses several possible outcomes of the various restructuring efforts.  First, there likely will be consolidation of electric utilities as they seek more efficient operating structures (for example, the proposed merger between Central Illinois Public Service Company and Union Electric.)  Second, most jurisdictions will move from the traditional rate-of-return regulation (cost plus profit), to a performance-based regulatory system where costs are separated from revenues, thus giving utilities incentive to reduce costs.  Third, many expect development of regional power pools, where spot market transactions, administered by an Independent System Operator (ISO) are prevalent.  Fourth, due to separation of electric utility generation, transmission and distribution functions, consumers will have greater choice in both the type of service they receive and from whom they receive it.  Finally, the generation sector of the electricity market is likely to become competitive first, since federal policy decisions over the last 20 years have largely negated the monopoly characteristics of power production, wholesale power transactions and resource additions.<p>

It is difficult to predict what these changes will bring to the Illinois coal industry; however, in the near term, some observers predict that with an emphasis on efficiency, existing coal-fired power plants will increase production because of their lower marginal generation costs.  This would trigger an increase in coal sales.  Still, over the long-term, it is likely that older, less efficient coal-fired generating plants could be retired or converted to natural gas.<p>

Thus, the newest challenge facing Illinois coal is to retain as much existing market share as possible, while seeking out new markets for this efficient fuel.  Nearly all electric utility restructuring analyses project a near-term gain, mid-term loss, and long-term benefit for coal as the cost-effective fuel of choice for baseload electricity generation.  OCDM will continue to work with the Illinois coal industry to ensure that this valuable commodity plays a prominent role in a restructured electric utility marketplace.<p>

For more information about the OCDM White Paper, contact Dan Keefe in DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing, at 217/782-6135 (TDD:  217/785-0211).<p>

<h3>MEXICAN COMPANY OPENS SHUTTERED SPARTA PLANT</h3>

Gov. Jim Edgar awarded a $500,000 Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) grant to Sparta Mayor Greg Aitken, as representatives Pedro Booth and Sergio Guarneros of Grupo Serla S.A. de C.V. looked on.  The grant is part of an $860,000 package of state assistance to assist Grupo Serla in renovating the former Spartan Printing plant.  The plant, which had been shuttered since February, is expected to employ at least 300 workers when it opens early next year.  Grupo Serla, Mexico's leading producer of Spanish-language textbooks, intends to target the U.S. market and also will pursue contracts with customers of the former Spartan plant. <p>

<h3>CONFERENCE HELPS SMALL AND MID-SIZED COMPANIES <br>
BECOME SUCCESSFUL EXPORTERS</h3>
<em>by Mary Anne Brown-Rogerio, DCCA International Business Division</em><p>

More than 650 business people learned valuable information to help them become successful exporters during the second annual Crossing International Borders conference, recently held in Chicago.  The conference, cosponsored by DCCA and Arthur Andersen, in collaboration with 22 international associations and agencies, provided exporters with the best and latest information on becoming effective exporters.  It also featured presentations by the managing directors of Illinois' foreign offices, who provided market updates on the Far East, North Asia, the Americas, Western Europe and Eastern Europe, as well as presentations by professionals from Arthur Andersen and other companies.<p>

Participants in the conference were greeted by DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone, who spoke on the challenges and rewards of doing business overseas.  Luncheon featured remarks from Casey Cowell, co-founder of U.S. Robotics, a leader in the manufacture of information access products, who discussed his company's international strategy.  Participants had their choice of 36 concurrent workshops which covered the current status of trade agreements, export financing, legal concerns, customs issues, the human resource factor, reducing taxes, finding overseas distributors, protecting intellectual property, foreign sales corporations and international franchising.  The conference concluded with an International Export Forum, which featured the opportunity for one-on-one consultation with the experts.<p>

A highlight of the conference was the presentation of the Governor's Export Awards.  Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra presented the awards to 15 Illinois companies and associations, representing four categories.  Winners of the "New to Export" award included Westell International, Sabratek Corporation, Total Process Corp. and Visiontek.  "Continuing Export Excellence" awards went to Prince Castle, Inc.; The Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; Fluid Management L.P.; Frasca International, Inc.; and DICKEY-john.  Awards for "Export Awareness and Development" were presented to the Automotive Exporters' Council, the National Housewares Manufacturers Association; Central Illinois Exporters' Association and the Illinois Wheat Association.  Winners of the "Community Service Recognition Award" were the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce and JETRO Chicago.<p>

Illinois is the fifth-largest exporting state in the nation, with nearly 500,000 jobs linked to exporting.  The "Crossing International Borders" conference can help even more Illinois businesses become better exporters.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS OPENS PUBLIC E-85 REFUELING FACILITIES </h3>

DCCA's Office of Energy Conservation and Alternative Energy works closely with Illinois agricultural organizations and automobile manufacturers to promote and expand the use of ethanol as a clean-burning, renewable transportation fuel.  The recent opening of the three public E-85 refueling stations will play an important role in that effort.<p>

In June, Mitch Beaver, Deputy Director of DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling,   participated in grand opening ceremonies at the E-85 station in Dwight at Exit 220 on Interstate 55.  With remarks from U.S. Congressman Tom Ewing, state Sen. John Maitland, Chet Boruff of the Illinois Department of Agriculture, Mike Lockhart of Growmark, Inc., Vic Riddle of the Illinois Corn Growers, and Beaver, the ceremonies highlighted the partnership that has helped to encourage expansion of ethanol usage.<p>

Ethanol is important to Illinois.  Our state leads the nation in the production of ethanol, and ranks first or second in the production of corn each year.  DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling assists this industry by managing numerous ethanol test and demonstration projects, and sponsoring the research and development of new and innovative technologies to help reduce ethanol production costs.  Among its projects are partnerships with General Motors and Ford Motor Company to field-test flexible-fuel vehicles designed to operate on either traditional gasoline or E-85 fuel -- a mixture of 85 percent denatured ethanol with 15 percent natural gasoline added to aid in fuel combustion.<p>

The new Dwight station, owned and operated by Livingston County FS and supplied by Growmark, is one of three E-85 stations now open to the public in Illinois.  Others include a SuperAmerica E-85 station in Des Plaines and a Mobil station in Springfield.  Plans call for up to 40 E-85 stations in Chicago, Rockford, Peoria, the Quad Cities and other communities in Illinois and throughout the Midwest.<p>

<h3>IEZA CONFERENCE OFFERS VALUABLE TRAINING</h3>
       
DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone joined Jeanne Gustafson, President of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Association (IEZA), and Tom Henderson, DCCA's Enterprise Zone program manager, at the Illinois Enterprise Zone Administrators' Training Session, held in June in Springfield.   More than 150 communities were represented at the conference, which featured sessions on incentives, zone marketing, reporting requirements, zone alterations and use of the Internet.<p>


<hr>
<h3>DCCA IMPLEMENTING "TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT"</h3>

Total Quality Management, or TQM, is a philosophy being embraced in many industries today.  TQM involves the entire workforce, tapping the knowledge and expertise of individual workers at all levels of responsibility to help find better, faster and more efficient ways of doing a job, whether it be manufacturing widgets or providing a service.<p>

Over the past year, DCCA has been incorporating the TQM philosophy into its programs and services.  Since June 1995, 120 DCCA employees have completed TQM training to help them understand the philosophy and procedures involved in the TQM process.  This training has helped 15 TQM "teams" begin work on studying various DCCA processes and procedures, researching and developing recommendations to streamline these activities while improving quality of the services provided to both internal and external customers.  For example, teams have studied the contracting process, grant processing, payroll procedures, policy letters and other processes and procedures undertaken daily within the department.  Ten teams have already submitted their recommendations for change to Director Dennis Whetstone and top management for their approval, and steps toward implementation of their recommendations have begun.<p>

TQM is expected to have many benefits for DCCA.  The philosophy brings DCCA's employees directly into the front line to help identify barriers to quality service and uses their expertise to develop ways to break down those barriers.  In addition, by improving the quality of its processes, DCCA will be able to serve its customers in a more timely and less cumbersome manner.  Finally, TQM gives DCCA's employees a sense that they are important members of a team working together to make the agency a better place.<p>

<h3>FORUM ADDRESSES RURAL POVERTY</h3>

<em>by Curt Farrar, DCCA Division of Economic Opportunity</em><p>

Poverty is a problem that knows no geographic boundaries.  According to the 1990 census, poverty is particularly growing in non-metropolitan areas of Illinois.  As populations age and economic opportunities decline, rural communities need assistance to reverse the problem.  Phyllis "Phib" Bell of DCCA's Division of Economic Opportunity is one of those actively working to help.  Saying, "We often forget that poverty also occurs in rural areas," Bell recently helped organize the "Pathways From Poverty Forum," held in Collinsville.<p>

The forum, co-sponsored by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, the Farm Foundation, and the Rural Sociological Society Task Force on Rural Poverty, attracted more than 120 leaders from state and local organizations in 12 Midwestern states.  Some states sent as many as 15 people to participate in the conference, which was designed to increase understanding and awareness of both the individual and social aspects of poverty and stimulate thinking about steps that can be taken to create "pathways" from poverty.  Another primary objective was to build stronger relationships and facilitate communication among organizations involved in rural poverty.<p>

Forum participants developed a vision statement and action plan to stimulate more job opportunities, involve the disadvantaged in the political process, and increase access to more meaningful educational opportunities in rural areas.  The W. K. Kellogg Foundation has already committed seed funds of $1,500 to support a statewide rural poverty conference in November 1996 to continue advancing rural poverty initiatives.<p>

Members of the Illinois team participating in the forum included Ted Aggen, Mayor of Sterling; Doug Dougherty, Executive Director of the Rural Affairs Council, Lt. Gov. Kustra's office; Betty Green, Director, RIDES Mass Transit District, Rosiclare; Jack Halstead, Senior Editor, Association of Illinois Electric Cooperatives, Springfield; Sue Mahoney, retired teacher, Rosiclare; Jane Pfeiffer, Mayor of Elsah; Jane Poertner, Director, Central Illinois Economic Development Corporation, Lincoln; Ann Heinz-Silvis, Extension Specialist, University of Illinois Laboratory for Community and Economic Development, Urbana; and Randy Sumner, Vice President of Community Affairs, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.   <p>

<h3>GETTING THE WORD OUT ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAMS</h3>

Although large corporations grab the headlines, small businesses are the driving force behind America's economy.  Obtaining financing for business start-up or expansion, however, can be one of the largest hurdles for entrepreneurs.  DCCA's Small Business Division within the Bureau of Business Development is working to make sure that Illinois small business people know about the many programs available to help them achieve success.<p>

In April, the Division underwrote the costs associated with airing the public television series, "Small Business 2000," on the Convocom network (WMEC-Macomb, WQEC-Quincy and WSEC-Springfield/Jacksonville).  Each of the half-hour programs included news stories and regular features on marketing, law and technology, as well as special presentations on home offices, professional practices, book reviews and reviews of the latest in computer software.  <p>

Throughout May and June, the Division hosted a series of Lenders' Forums at locations throughout the state.  The forums featured officials from several government lending agencies, including DCCA, the Illinois Development Finance Authority (IDFA), the U.S. Export Assistance Center (USEAC) and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).  The forums gave bankers and other commercial lenders insight into DCCA's Participation Loan Program, the USEAC's Export Working Capital Loan Program, SBA's Low-Doc program, and IDFA's Direct Loan, Microloan and Industrial Revenue Bonds.  Participants got a look at upcoming changes and forecasts about the financing programs, as well as an opportunity for one-on-one discussions.<p>

Over the past decade, DCCA's Small Business Division has provided more than $500 million in business financing, helping small businesses retain more than 35,000 Illinos jobs and retain nearly 48,000 jobs.<p>

<H3>WOODFORD COUNTY SHELTER <BR>WINS 1996 GOVERNOR'S CUP</H3>

The 1996 Governor's Home Town Awards are now history, and Woodford County has taken home the coveted Governor's Cup as the project most representative of the spirit of volunteerism this year in Illinois.<P>

At the 15th annual Governor's Home Town Awards banquet on June 13 in Springfield, more than 70 projects from nearly 90 communities received awards thanking them for their efforts to improve their communities and make Illinois a better place to live, work and do business.  Of those, Woodford County's project, "Heart House," was judged as the outstanding volunteer effort of the year.<P>

Four years ago, a group of concerned citizens representing various religions came together to discuss establishing a shelter for homeless people in Woodford County.  They realized that the problems of homelessness and domestic violence  exist in small towns as well as large cities.  Using donated funds, the volunteers opened Heart House in a former fraternity house located near the Eureka College campus.  But problems soon developed.  The national fraternity decided to reactivate its chapter at the college, forcing Heart House to seek new quarters.  After assessing its options, the Heart House board decided to build a new shelter.  Hundreds of volunteers, including civic groups, labor unions and school groups, donated funds and assisted with the construction of the new facility, performing tasks from painting to carpentry.  Their efforts resulted in a new shelter facility valued at more than twice its cost that provides services to its clients without any tax support.<P>

In the 15 years since its inception, the Governor's Home Town Awards program has rewarded many Illinois volunteers like those from Woodford County.  Awards are presented in categories based on population, so that projects compete against activities undertaken in communities of similar size.  Four sub-categories of awards are presented in each population category:  general awards, awards for projects for or by youths, awards for projects for or by senior citizens, and economic development awards.  First place winners in each category receive commemorative road signs and plaques noting their achievements; other winners receive plaques.  All first place winners are eligible to compete for the Governor's Cup.<P>

Judging also is done by volunteers.  This year's judges were all volunteers who had participated in projects that won awards in the 1995 Governor's Home Town Awards competition.  The judges review all applications, then make site visits to finalist communities.  Following the site visits, the judges reconvene to make their final selections and determine the winner of the Governor's Cup, a traveling silver trophy.  <P>

Applications for the 1997 Governor's Home Town Awards will be available in late fall.  For further information, contact Lou Ann Ladage at 217/785-6154 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).<P>

<H3>JOB TRAINING LOSES AN ICON</H3>


The Illinois job training community lost an icon with the May 7 death of Samuel C. Bernstein, often called the "father" of the Illinois Unemployment Compensation Act.<P>

Bernstein was working for the Legislative Reference Bureau when he accepted a challenge from then Gov. Henry Horner to develop legislation required by the federal Social Security Act.  In 1937, Bernstein's legislation was enacted, giving Illinois an unemployment compensation law.  <P>

In subsequent years, Bernstein served in numerous state roles, including labor director and commissioner of Illinois employment security.  During the 1970s, he served as assistant to the mayor of Chicago for manpower.  He was a labor adviser to three U.S. presidents, and, until his death, was a consultant for Kane, McKenna and Associates and Target Group, Inc.  He also had been an adjunct professor at the University of Illinois - Chicago.<P>

Bernstein is survived by his wife, Dena, two daughters, one son, six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.<P>

<HR>


<H3>COAL CALENDAR CONTEST WINNERS NAMED</H3>

About two dozen Illinois school children and their families gathered at the Executive Mansion in Springfield in April to receive their awards as winners in the eighth annual Illinois Coal Calendar Contest.<P>

"This contest was established to highlight the rich heritage and tremendous importance of Illinois coal and coal mining," said John S. Moore, chief of DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing.  "Through this program, young people learn that Illinois' most abundant natural resource -- coal -- can be a safe and environmentally friendly energy source for the future."<P>

Moore joined Taylor Pensoneau, vice president of the Illinois Coal Association, in presenting the winning students with their prizes.  Each winner received a $50.00 U.S. Savings Bond and a certificate of achievement signed by Gov. Jim Edgar.

<H3>ILLINOIS FILM BUSINESS EXPERIENCING STRONG REBOUND</H3>
<EM>by Ron VerKuilen, Manager, Illinois Film Office</EM><P>


1996 has been a strong rebounding year for the Illinois film business!  January started off with a bang (literally!) when director and native son Andy Davis ("The Fugitive," "The Package," "Code of Silence," Above the Law") returned to Illinois to film "Chain Reaction" starring Keanu Reeves and Morgan Freeman.  The film opens in late August and features Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory and Barrington Hills.  Chicago also doubles for Washington D.C. (see if you can spot the Field Museum or the Museum of Science and Industry!)<P>

In March and April, two television series -- "EZ Streets" and "Early Edition" -- were shot here.  Scenes were shot for a new series produced by Chris Columbus ("Home Alone", "Only the Lonely" director), as well as for "ER" and "Chicago Hope," which regularly return to film scenes.<P>

A sizeable chunk of the movie "Michael," starring John Travolta, Andie MacDowell and William Hurt is being filmed in Illinois.  The latter two play tabloid journalists in search of the archangel Michael, played by Travolta.  Also this spring, the adaptation of the John Grisham novel, "The Chamber," has filmed in Chicago with local actor Chris O'Donnell and Gene Hackman.   In addition to these high-profile stars, Larenz Tate and Nia Long star in an independent film, "Love Jones," directed by Chicagoan Ted Wicher.<P>

During the summer, filming will begin on "My Best Friend's Wedding," starring Julia Roberts, Dermott Mulroney and Carmen Diaz; "Gangsters," set in 1930s Harlem, directed by Bill Duke and starring Lawrence Fishburne; and the Miramax feature, "Stepping in the Dog Water," directed by and starring David Schwimmer of "Friends."<P>

That's not all!  John Hughes Productions, in conjunction with Universal Pictures, will be filming a small town movie in Illinois called "Reach the Rock."  Robert Altman will direct a feature film, "The Wild Card," for MGM Studios that stars Woody Harrelson.  Scouting is underway for a feature film, "The Good Guys," starring Don Johnson as a con man who joins the FBI to expose the mob!<P>

Meanwhile, the Film Office staff is working with a number of projects that have a distinct possibility of filming in Illinois.  We take the calls, make the scouts, pass on information, and plead Illinois' case with crews, talent, labor, hotel managers, etc. to welcome the film and television business to Illinois.  This, along with a full plate of steady business with local independent filmmakers, commercial makers, documentary films, educational films, music videos and other projects, keeps the Illinois Film Office hopping!<P>

The film business is cyclical.  Local labor has made adjustments to appeal to Hollywood.  Market forces seem to be smiling on Illinois right now.  And luck always plays a part.  But the Illinois Film Office continues to work hard to attract the film dollar to Illinois.  We're having fun!  The nights and weekends get a bit full at times, but it's worth it to have the film business back strong in Illinois.  <P>

<H3>DCCA GRANTS HELP IMPROVE ACCESSIBILITY TO PUBLIC SERVICES</H3>
<EM>by Amy Zachary, Bureau of Community Development</EM><P>


Passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was a giant step forward in raising public awareness of the needs of those with disabilities.  But for many small governments, the cost to remodel and retrofit public buildings can be prohibitive.  The Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) Removal of Architectural Barriers component can make such improvements affordable.<P>

Each year, DCCA solicits CDAP applications from local units of government -- cities, villages, townships and counties -- in communities with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven urban counties that receive their funds directly from the federal government.  Removal of Architectural Barriers grants of up to $150,000 are available annually to assist local governments in paying for efforts to remove physical barriers that restrict accessibility to basic and essential local government services.  For example, a local unit of government might undertake ramp construction, restroom renovation, elevator or chairlift installation, or designate parking for those with disabilities.  The grants are awarded on a competitive basis, with projects such as improvements to courthouses; city, village or town halls; municipal centers; local government annex buildings; libraries and health departments given top priority.<P>

Since the program began in 1993, 162 units of local government have shared $7 million in CDAP grant funds.  An example is Effingham County, which submitted an application on behalf of projects in the county courthouse, county building, and health department, as well as projects in Mound Township, Douglas Township, the Village of Beecher City, the Town of Mason, the City of Altamont and the Village of Watson.  Effingham County received a $48,000 CDAP grant, which it leveraged with nearly $625,000 in local funds to undertake various improvements, including parking, door hardware, signage, door openers and buzzers, audible/visual alarms, grab bars, restroom renovation, new controls on drinking fountains, and audible controls and tactile instructions for an elevator.<P>

Thirty-three communities have submitted applications for $1 million in CDAP Removal of Architectural Barriers grants this year.  DCCA expects to award the grants later this summer.<P>

<h3>DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS:  ANOTHER TOOL<br>
FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<em>by Dale Fesser, DCCA Division of Loan Administration</em><p>

Construction of a new "spec" building in an industrial park.  Financing for a grocery store in a small town.  A business expansion loan to a participant in a "Create Your Own Business" contest.<p>

What do these have in common?  They all are projects completed by various Development Corporations -- regionally-based organizations capitalized partially through DCCA grants -- that provide financing to supplement commercial lending and support economic development in Illinois.<p>

Development Corporations are as varied as their clients.  They may specialize in development and rehabilitation of real estate, investment in or lending to businesses, or related activities.  Most often, Development Corporations are public and bank sponsored and funded financial institutions.  They serve as a source of supplemental business capital for small businesses whose credit requirements cannot be adequately served by conventional lending institutions.<p>

Of the 43 Development Corporations in Illinois, 34 have received DCCA assistance totaling approximately $2.24 million matched by more than $7.5 million in private investment.  Those 34 Development Corporations already have financed more than 89 projects.  Their loans and investments have leveraged private sector loans and investments of more than $59.1 million with total investment of more than $71 million.  Projects funded through state-assisted Development Corporations have resulted in the creation and retention of more than 3,600 Illinois jobs.  The impact will continue to grow as the original loans are repaid and the recaptured funds are used for new loans for future economic development projects.<p>

The Development Corporation program is particularly important to DCCA's strategy to help strengthen regional economic development efforts in rural areas.  Development Corporations are financial intermediary organizations.  By creating new "extra market" institutions, DCCA helps to eliminate the traditional gaps found in asset-based lending at the local level.  At the same time, DCCA itself is taken out of the direct lending business, resulting in more effective delivery of services, greater local access to capital for small and medium-sized Illinois firms, better lending decisions and a better match between the individual needs of businesses and communities.<p>

To learn more about the Development Corporation program or obtain the name of a Development Corporation serving your area, contact Dale Fesser, Development Corporation program manager, at 217/524-0165 (TDD:  800/785-6055) or by E-mail at dale.fesser@accessil.com.<p>

<h3>GREAT PRINTERS PROJECT EXPANDS OPPORTUNITIES; PROTECTS ENVIRONMENT</h3>

Protecting the environment is an important concern for everyone.  Today, more than ever, businesses and government must work together to make pollution prevention a key consideration within the nation's industries.  DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance Program is part of a team working on a major initiative to help establish pollution prevention as a standard business practice within the lithographic printing industry -- the Illinois Great Printers Project.<p>

Lithographic printing uses a variety of materials and potentially hazardous chemicals, generates wastes and consumes energy.  Although the average small print shop is not a major pollution source, the impact of hundreds of such businesses is substantial.  The Illinois Great Printers Project is researching ways to help printers prevent pollution at the source by focusing on customer demands, regulatory requirements, and access to technology and financial resources.  <p>

A steering committee, which includes representatives from DCCA, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, the Center for Neighborhood Technology, the Printing Industry of Illinois and Indiana (PII), and the Hazardous Waste Research and Information Center has identified five groups integral to the project:  printers, customers, suppliers, regulatory agencies, and technical assistance.  <p>

Over the past year, each group has been working to develop programs and policies that can help incorporate pollution prevention into the standard business practices of the lithographic printing industry.  For example, activities undertaken by the Customers group include working with the printing industry to develop environmentally sound printing specifications.  The Suppliers group is working with the printing industry to identify environmentally-friendly materials and equipment, promote and disseminate information concerning environmentally sound alternatives, develop a standard form containing product information and environmental benefits, and adopt a standard protocol to identify potentially hazardous chemicals.  Among its activities, the Regulatory Agencies group is trying to revise existing environmental assessment policies to ensure they support and provide incentives for voluntary auditing and pollution prevention.  The Technical Assistance group is working to establish a Resource Center that would provide pollution prevention information to the lithographic printing industry.<p>

Assisting with the efforts is an Advisory Committee of representatives from the printing industry, printing supply industry, printing customers, financial institutions, citizens groups, relevant government agencies and environmental organizations.  This committee provides a sounding board for exploring relevant issues and reviewing the activities being undertaken.<p>

Although much work remains to be done, educating the public is seen as a key to the project's ultimate success.  Criteria are now being developed under which printers may be designated as "Great Printers."   Efforts will be undertaken to publicize the meaning behind the Great Printers designation and encourage consumers to seek out these printers for their printing services.  It is hoped that the educational effort will reward Great Printers by increasing their customer base.<p>

Illinois is one of four states, including Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, designing pilot programs to standardize pollution prevention as a business practice in the lithographic printing industry.  It's all part of a larger effort started in 1992 by the Council of Great Lakes Governors, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Printing Industries of America.  Called the Great Printers Project, this effort aims to create a business environment conducive to pollution prevention for an entire industry sector, thereby helping to expand a strong regional printing industry while retaining a clean Great Lakes ecosystem.<p>

<h3>TOURISM ADS WIN AWARDS, GET RESULTS</h3>

It's summer and time to get away for a weekend or that badly needed vacation.  DCCA's Illinois Bureau of Tourism is out to help you find the perfect getaway in Illinois.  An aggressive television advertising campaign hit the airwaves April 1 reminding tourists that they can travel a "Million Miles from Monday" right in our state.<p>  

The television campaign already has earned both critical acclaim and impressive tourism gains.  The 1995 "Million Miles from Monday" campaign was named the best tourism campaign of the year in a worldwide competition at the New York Festival -- the only U.S. campaign to make the finals.  It also won acclaim as the Best Creative of the Year at the Chicago International Film Festival, and won the 1996 ATLAS Award from the Association of Travel Marketing Executives.<p>

Even more important, the ads have been an integral part of Illinois' success in attracting tourists.  Over the past nine months, calls to the Illinois Travel Counseling System (ITCS) have increased 22 percent compared to the same period a year ago.  Follow-up studies show that 62 percent of callers end up traveling to one or more Illinois destinations.  Since September 1995, calls to the 800 number have broken monthly totals.<p>   

The television ads are part of a $10 million domestic tourism campaign that includes print ads, direct response television and showings of the ads at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports.  All of the print ads and several direct response television spots feature the benefits of calling ITCS, which puts callers on the line with an expert travel counselor who can use one of the largest tourism databases in the U.S. to help them with their Illinois tourism plans.<p>

Are you ready for a getaway?  Call 1-800-2-CONNECT and go a "Million Miles from Monday" in Illinois.<p>

<h3>BASIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COURSE<br>
HELPS EXPAND STAFF KNOWLEDGE </h3>

Forty-two DCCA staffers and colleagues from other economic development organizations learned more about the foundations of successful economic development as participants in the Basic Economic Development Course, sponsored by DCCA in March.  The intensive five-day course, presented by Dr. Robert Koepke of Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, provided the graduates with accreditation through the American Economic Development Council (AEDC) and is the first step toward accreditation as a Certified Economic Developer.<p>

The course included presentations by a wide range of economic development experts from throughout the United States.  Bill Browning, president and CEO of the Heartland Partnership in Peoria, described how to build an effective economic development organization, while Kate McEnroe, a location consultant from Atlanta, Georgia, discussed the use of incentives and tips for working with consultants.  David Richmond, a veteran economic developer from Richmond, Indiana, shared his insight into innovative financing programs.  A highlight of the program was an address by Rick Thrasher, president and CEO of WI/SE Partnership for Growth in Wichita, Kansas.  Thrasher, who serves as first vice chair of the American Economic Development Council, and Lori Healey, president of the Illinois Development Council, joined DCCA Director Dennis Whetstone in awarding certificates of completion to the 42 graduates.<p>

Response to the course was so enthusiastic that DCCA plans to sponsor a second BEDC class in June.  Typical of the comments:  "The BEDC was excellent.  I learned a lot about economic development that I really didn't know.  In addition, it helped me to better understand the overall mission of the agency better than anything I had previously read or heard."<p>

All graduates of the course become eligible to attend further training through the University of Oklahoma toward earning the Certified Economic Developer designation.<p>

<h3>DCCA SUPPORTS RESEARCH USING COAL BY-PRODUCTS<br> 
TO PRODUCE ARTIFICIAL MINE ROOF SUPPORTS</h3>

Research, supported by DCCA through the Illinois Clean Coal Institute (ICCI), could soon lead to recycling fly ash, a by-product produced when coal is burned, into artificial timbers to support the roofs of coal mines.<p>

Mining engineering Professor Yoginder P. "Paul" Chugh of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale recently demonstrated the strength of two-foot timbers made of fly ash and other fluidized-bed combustion by-products.  The demonstrations were the first step toward receiving approval from the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration to use the new timbers as mine roof supports.<p>

Chugh, chairman of SIUC's mining engineering department, and a team of scientists spent two years developing the timbers.  The timbers are made with about 65 percent fly ash, cement and fibers which are added to give the timbers characteristics similar to wood.  Like ordinary wood timbers, the fibers will "splinter" when the artificial post exceeds its design load capacity, signaling that the timber needs to be replaced.<p>

Chugh says the timbers weigh significantly less than concrete and are as strong as traditional wood timbers.  An economic analysis shows the cost of making the six foot timbers is about the same as making them from wood.  The real benefit comes from conserving trees while using a product that currently goes to landfills.<p>

"Coal-burning utilities from Illinois put more than 3 million tons of fly ash and other coal combustion by-products into landfills each year," Chugh said.  "In addition, more than 60 million cubic feet of wood are used every year as timbers in U.S. coal mines."  Chugh estimates that 2.5 million tons of fly ash would be used each year if every U.S. coal mine switched to artificial timbers.<p>

The study is just one in a series of coal-related by-products management studies being sponsored by the ICCI.  Other projects include using coal combustion by-products in road beds and surfaces, automotive brake shoes and body panels, patio bricks, sewer tiles and flower pots.<p>

<h3>DCCA WORKING TO REDUCE COAL-GENERATED AIR POLLUTANTS</h3>

<em>by Gary Philo, DCCA Office of Coal Development and Marketing</em><p>

DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing (OCDM) is actively working to help encourage the development and use of new technologies that reduce hazardous emissions from burning Illinois coal.  As part of that effort, the OCDM recently held a workshop on sulfur dioxide and air toxics control, bringing together representatives from many of the state's electric power generating companies with those from state government and the air pollution control industry to discuss the role of advanced scrubber technologies.  <p>

Illinois coal has a high sulfur content, which has caused the state to lose market share in recent years as many coal-burning companies turned to low-sulfur western coal.  OCDM is working to encourage development and use of technologies that can  make Illinois coal environmentally safe to use.  It also is seeking out new international markets that can utilize these technologies to safely burn Illinois coal.<p>
  
The workshop, held in Springfield, particularly focused on various technologies that can help companies meet sweeping emission limitations on sulfur dioxide that will become effective in the year 2000.  Participants also looked at control strategies for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants that may face future regulation.  <p>

Representatives from Central Illinois Public Service Company, Springfield City Water, Light and Power, Illinois Power Company, the Environmental Element Corporation, the Illinois Clean Coal Institute, and OCDM participated in the workshop.<p>

<h3>Small Businesses Drive the Illinois Economy</h3>

<h4>By Roberta Janis and Joe Weiss, DCCA Small Business Division</h4>

Small business is the real muscle of the Illinois economy.  Recent data shows that 85  percent of the new jobs in Illinois were created by small businesses, and nearly 4.4 million Illinois workers depend on small business for their livelihood.<p> 

To achieve business success, today's small business owners have to wear many hats -- that of a banker to secure financing, a marketing expert to reach potential clientele, an accountant to file a myriad of tax returns, and the list goes on.<p>

Fortunately for Illinois' 617,000 small business owners, assistance is readily available. Whether shopping for a marketplace, investigating financial sources or trying to make sense of tax requirements, DCCA's Small Business Division can help.  <p>

The Small Business Division includes 40 Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs), 13 Procurement Technical Assistance Centers, five International Trade Centers, two NAFTA Opportunity Centers, 20 Incubators, an Office of Minority Business Development, an Office of Women's Business Development, an Office of Small Business Environmental Assistance and the First-Stop Business Information Center.<p>

SBDCs counsel, conduct research, and train business people in a wide variety of business topics.  They provide comprehensive information services and access to experts in many fields.  Centers develop and maintain partnerships among community organizations and local, state and federal agencies, providing a focal point for broad networks of public and private resources at the community level.  These partnership programs and activities serve small business and contribute significantly to the economic growth in Illinois.<p>

An example is the new Super 8 Motel in Greenville, Illinois.  Although they had been involved in other successful business ventures, 32-year-old Vicki Ellsworth and her associates turned to the SBDC at Kaskaskia College in Centralia for help in opening the new motel.  The SBDC not only helped develop a business plan and compiled three- and five-year projections, but also helped compile a financial package that included an $800,000 loan guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and $150,000 from the Illinois Development Finance Authority (IDFA).  After only a few months of operation, the Greenville Super 8 has already exceeded its projections.<p>

Vern Carlsen is another example.  Carlsen worked for 25 years at a Chicago area industrial company, working his way up to corporate vice president.  After the company was sold in 1988, he worked as a salesman for a few years, then became a manager and contract administrator for a Rockford firm.  In that job, he discovered that, although many companies were interested in doing business with the government, they did not want to deal with the paperwork involved.  Carlsen started Sales Assistance Service in 1993 to fill this void.  Sales Assistance Service used the services of the Procurement Technical Assistance Center at Rock Valley College in Rockford, particularly the automated bid service and the specification library.  The company also has begun to use Electronic Data Interchange to receive bids daily.  It is now a successful business that continues to expand. <p> 

Over the past decade, DCCA's Small Business Division has compiled impressive statistics.  To find out if the Small Business Division can help you, call 800/252-2923 (TDD:  800/785-6055.)<p>

<h3>From the Director</h3>

<h4>What is Economic Development?</h4>

DCCA's new mission statement says that DCCA is the "lead state agency responsible for improving the competitiveness of Illinois in the global economy resulting in prosperous, growing industries, rising real incomes and high quality jobs."<p>

But the agency's programs and services encompass a wide range of activities -- tourism, help for local governments, workforce training programs, assistance to low-income people, technology assistance, site and building location assistance, small business assistance, and many more.  How do all these programs fit the definition of economic development?<p>

Think like a mayor.  As mayor, you are vitally interested in the future of your community.  You want it to be a great place for families to live and visit, with prosperous businesses, plentiful jobs, convenient services and a healthy environment.  <p>

You're interested in infrastructure because you know that without access to safe and adequate water supplies and waste treatment, safe roads and other foundations, people and businesses will not want to live in and locate in your community.  You're interested in workforce development because you want to ensure that businesses in your community have the skilled workers they need to stay competitive in a global marketplace.  You also know that the future of your current businesses, as well as your ability to attract more businesses and jobs, depends on a continued supply of skilled workers and adequate infrastructure.<p>

You're interested in maintaining and improving the quality of life for residents in your community.  You want to ensure that low-income families have decent, energy efficient homes in which to live and the ability to pay their winter energy bills.  You want to provide services to homeless people to help them get back on their feet.  And you want to help low-income and disadvantaged people find employment opportunities and learn the skills they need to be productive employees.<p>

You know that if your community is to grow, you need to encourage existing businesses to expand and attract new businesses and jobs.  That's not just large factories -- it's also encouraging entrepreneurs to start new businesses, like the corner cafe, the dry cleaning shop and others that provide the services your citizens need.  <p>

You have a nice community.  You want others to enjoy it.  You're interested in promoting your community and its resources to tourists who will spend their dollars in your hotels and motels, restaurants and shops while enjoying the sights.<p>

If all of these things are beginning to sound familiar, it's because they are all addressed by the programs DCCA administers.  The Bureau of Community Development, for example, helps smaller Illinois communities address their infrastructure and housing needs through the Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP).  Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs and the Industrial Training Program (ITP) help train people in the skills they need to be productive employees.  Community Service Block Grant (CSBG) programs provide loans to help start businesses that provide jobs to disadvantaged workers, as well as many services to help low-income people break out of poverty.  The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) helps low-income families pay a portion of their winter energy bills, while the Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program (IHWAP) helps low-income families make their dwellings more energy-efficient.<p>  

DCCA's Business Development Bureau provides site selection and technical assistance to help attract new businesses to Illinois, as well as services to help existing businesses grow, such as export assistance.  Through the First-Stop Business Information Center and the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network, DCCA helps entrepreneurs and small business owners find answers to their questions, locate business capital, start new businesses and expand existing ones.  <p>

The Bureau of Tourism promotes Illinois and provides assistance to help local communities and regions market themselves in this fast-growing industry, and also promotes Illinois as a site for film and television production.  Coal Development and Marketing programs work to find and market new, environmentally-safe methods of using Illinois' greatest resource.  The Bureau of Energy and Recycling promotes sustainable economic development by encouraging alternative energy resource development such as ethanol; improving energy efficiency in residences, buildings and factories which also helps reduce costs; and by supporting recycling and waste reduction programs, including the expansion of markets for recycled materials.  These programs facilitate the efficient use of natural resources while helping to minimize negative impacts on the environment. <p>
 
What is economic development?  A mayor knows.  He or she knows that a community that looks to the future and addresses its needs will be a competitive community that attracts and keeps prosperous, growing industries.  Those industries will provide high quality jobs that pay the kind of rising real incomes that can fund the parks, schools, infrastructure and other public services that make others want to visit and make the community their home.  With the right help, a mayor can close the circle into a continuous cycle of development.<p>

DCCA was created in 1979 to be Illinois' lead economic development agency.  The various community, workforce and business development programs were merged under the DCCA umbrella for a reason -- because they all are essential components of our state's ability to improve its competitiveness in a global economy.  Today, more than ever, DCCA must recognize its unique ability to be the state's "one-stop" economic development agency.  Understanding that role, and the ways our various programs fit into the overall mission, is the first step toward fulfilling that mission.<p>

<h3>Illinois Ventures for Community Action Provides Crucial Resources</h3>

<h4>by Curt Farrar, DCCA Division of Economic Opportunity</h4>

More than $3.6 million in loans, 616 new jobs and the lowest loan default rate in the nation.  That's a great record, and one the people at Illinois Ventures for Community Action (IVCA) are proud of.<p>

IVCA is a private 501c(3) not-for-profit corporation located in Springfield that works with the 34 local Community Action Agencies (CAAs) in Illinois and other public and private enterprises to facilitate economic development within the state.  In particular, IVCA helps ensure that CAAs have the training and knowledge they need to develop loans to businesses that can create jobs for low-income Illinoisans -- a key component of the federally-funded Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) program, administered in Illinois by DCCA.<p>

Formed in 1985, IVCA is administered by a Board composed of representatives from 16 CAAs.  It is directed by CEO Michael Chew, a financial professional and former bank president.  Working closely with DCCA's Division of Economic Opportunities and the CAAs, IVCA helps the CAAs market their loans and loan services, provides lending consultation training and technical assistance with the lending function, and helps maintain coordination with lead lenders in the communities.  Through these services, IVCA is helping CAAs improve the quality of their loan portfolios.  IVCA also explores new sources of capital and tools for economic development activities, such as equity and ownership positions in Illinois businesses, to generate sustainable revenue streams that can be used to support anti-poverty efforts.<p>

For example, IVCA has assisted five CAAs in purchasing their own office buildings, thus enabling them to build a capital asset for the agency while improving creditability in the community through real estate ownership.  Chew considers the building acquisition program for Community Action Agencies to be one of the most important services IVCA performs, saying "The fiscal benefit of real estate ownership equates to immeasurable benefit to the community."<p>

Since its inception, IVCA has closed more than $3.6 million in loans, created 616 jobs, and has the distinctive record of never having a job default loan in its portfolio.  Its loan default ratio is 3.49 percent.  Since 1989, the loan default ratio has been less than one percent.  In fact, according to the Federal Office of Community Services, IVCA has the lowest loan default rate of any loan program it monitors.<p>

DCCA's partnership with Illinois Ventures for Community Action is one way DCCA is working to find innovative ways to strengthen local efforts and provide communities access to resources for physical and social infrastructure improvements.<p>

<h3>
Workshops Help Illinois Businesses<br>
Explore Export Opportunities
</h3>

Illinois businesses that want to explore the export marketplace or need information about expanding their exporting potential can obtain valuable assistance at a series of regional workshops scheduled over the coming months in Illinois.<p>

The DCCA-sponsored workshops are geared toward export opportunities in six of the 10 Big Emerging Markets (BEMs) -- markets identified as being particularly receptive to goods and services offered by U.S. companies.  The six markets deemed particularly receptive to Illinois-made products and services include South Africa, Korea and the Pacific Rim, China, Poland and Eastern Europe, Mexico and Latin America, and Turkey.   The workshops are made possible through a Market Development Cooperator Program grant awarded to Illinois by the U.S. Department of Commerce -- one of only eight such grants awarded this year.<p>

Illinois' network of International Trade Centers (ITCs) and NAFTA Opportunity Centers, two components of the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network (ISBDCN), will coordinate the workshops.  Each workshop will offer participants a chance to learn about the specific export opportunities in each market and experiences of companies already exporting to that country.  In addition, representatives from DCCA's International Business Division will discuss export assistance services offered in various Illinois pavilions scheduled for BEM trade shows, as well as assistance offered in locating potential agents and distributors.<p>

Upcoming workshops include a May 29 seminar at Bradley University in Peoria to discuss strategies for success in Korea and the Pacific Rim, and a May 30 seminar at the College of Du Page in Glen Ellyn focusing on International Quality Standards as they relate to markets in Poland, Korea and China.  Other future workshops will be held at Bradley and College of DuPage, as well as at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, and  NORBIC in Chicago.<p>

For further information about the workshops, contact Roberta Janis at DCCA at 312/814-7170 (TDD:  312/419-0667).<p>

<h3>DCCA Establishes Business & Industry Data Center Program</h3>

Small business people will be able to conveniently access census data and other usable information through a new service being established at DCCA.  The Business and Industry Data Center Program (BIDC), designed to enhance the BIDC program started by the U.S. Bureau of the Census in 1988, will give small business people, independent contractors and future businesses in Illinois an easy way to obtain statistical data and other sources of practical information. <p>

Statistics can be very important to small business people in planning, marketing, managing and expanding their businesses.  The BIDC program will utilize a system of five regional affiliates in Illinois to collect and provide basic information to the small business community, complete complex analyses as needed and perform regional economic analyses.  A system of three to five local affiliates in each region will deal directly with small businesses and other data users, providing basic census, economic and demographic information; data prepared by the regional affiliates or the state; and technical assistance with basic data interpretation.  The BIDC program also is affiliated with DCCA's First-Stop Business Information Center, which offers services and products designed to help new and existing businesses determine regulations applicable to their business activity and general start-up information. <p>

A few examples of BIDC assistance include information on commonly-offered  employee benefits in selected industries; listings of office furniture manufacturers; county economic profiles; trade show listings; numbers of Illinois businesses in select SIC codes that have sales of more than $1 million; city population, income and growth projections; ACT scores by school district; and numbers and sizes of warehouses in a county.<p>

For more information about the BIDC program, contact one of the BIDCs or phone Ed Taft at DCCA, 217/785-7545 (TDD:  800/785-6055).<p>

<h3>REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS KEEP COMMUNITIES GROWING</h3>
<h4>By Jay Bales, DCCA Bureau of Community Development</h4>

Over the past 14 years, DCCA has awarded $83 million in Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) grants to 177 local units of government throughout the state to help them provide low-interest loans to businesses locating or expanding within their boundaries.  Approximately $50 million of those funds are already back in circulation, helping more than 1,600 businesses obtain the capital they need to start or expand operations in the communities.  And that's just the beginning.  As those loans are repaid, their dollars also will be used for future business opportunities.<p>

It's all thanks to Revolving Loan Funds, administered by local communities, that are capitalized with moneys repaid by businesses that received the original loans funded through CDAP economic development component grants.<p>

Here's how it works:  DCCA receives Community Development Block Grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  The funds are used to provide a variety of grants to units of local government in communities with populations under 50,000 that are not located within one of the seven urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD.  CDAP grants range from public facilities grants, that help small communities meet their water and sewer needs, to economic development grants, that help communities attract and retain businesses and their jobs.<p>

When DCCA awards a CDAP economic development grant to a community, the community may use the funds to make infrastructure improvements needed by a business, such as extending water and sewer lines or access roads.  Or it may choose to use the grant funds to provide a low-interest loan to the business.  If a loan is made, the community creates a locally-administered Revolving Loan Fund, which is capitalized by the loan repayment funds.  These Revolving Loan Funds, or RLFs, provide a valuable source of business capital for future business development.<p>

There are many RLF success stories across the state.  For example, the City of Saint Elmo received a $375,000 CDAP economic development grant in 1982.  Since then, the city has made 33 loans totaling $601,811 with a minimal amount of defaults.  The City of Lacon has received two CDAP grants in the amount of $174,180.  From the "recaptured" funds it has made 20 loans totaling $184,172.68.  These "second generation" loans have resulted in 120 jobs being created or retained!<p>

A local government does not have to receive a large CDAP grant to have an effective RLF.  The City of Athens received a $40,000 CDAP grant in 1985.  In the decade since, the city has made six loans totaling $78,300 -- nearly twice the amount of the original CDAP grant.<p>

While most RLFs do not make large loans, their contributions often are an integral part of a business' overall financing package, leveraging larger amounts of private sector dollars.  In particular, CDAP RLF dollars can be an important source of "gap financing" for small, rural businesses.<p>

For more information on CDAP RLFs, or to learn which communities have an active RLF, contact Jay Bales at 217/785-6181 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).<p>

<h3>FROM THE DIRECTOR.....</h3>

A few weeks ago, Gov. Jim Edgar recommended a $774.6 million budget for DCCA for fiscal year 1997.  I'd like to tell you a little about that budget request and what it means for DCCA's customers.<p>

First, it's important to note that the bulk of our budget request -- $600.4 million -- is federal funds.  Those funds are essential to the training of our workers, the infrastructure of our communities, and the well-being of our citizens.  We're asking for $237.2 million for JTPA for next year as we continue to open new One-Stop Career Centers, and $376.7 million for community development programs like CDAP, LIHEAP, IHWAP and CSBG that help build our infrastructure, attract and retain businesses, and help improve the quality of life for low-income citizens.<p>

We're also asking for $40.2 million in state general revenue funds.   This includes $15 million for the Industrial Training Program (ITP) -- a $2.75 million increase that would enable DCCA to help upgrade the skills of nearly 5,000 more workers from 350 additional Illinois companies.<p>

We're looking at $39.2 million in funds for our business development programs.  Illinois has been very successful in recent years in attracting and retaining businesses and their jobs -- Motorola and McDonald's, for example, have announced projects that will create thousands of new Illinois jobs over the coming years.  But the fact is, Illinois is competing against other states every time a business looks to locate or expand.  We need to have the tools to win that competition.   This budget will enable DCCA to enhance its working relationships with local economic developers and improve our ability to respond to business inquiries.<p>

Our export potential is great.  We're asking for $3.5 million to promote exporting of Illinois' goods and services in the global marketplace.  Illinois is a leader in technology development.  We're asking for an additional $200,000 to help us continue our efforts to transfer these technologies to the workplace to help our businesses expand and modernize to meet the global challenge.<p>

Tourism, one of the fastest-growing industries, will continue to prosper under the $33.4 million budget we've outlined.  These funds will enable us to continue our successful tourism advertising campaign, "Illinois -- A Million Miles from Monday," as well as grant programs to help our communities promote tourism opportunities.<p>

We're working to promote the efficient and environmentally-safe use of Illinois' energy resources, and have allocated $13.6 million to that end.  Another $17.8 million is earmarked for projects designed to utilize and develop new markets for one of Illinois' greatest resources -- coal.<p>

Over the coming weeks, the General Assembly will be considering the Governor's budget request.  It is my hope that you will take a few moments to consider the importance of DCCA's programs and services to your businesses, jobs and communities.  We welcome your support as we work to secure the resources we need to make Illinois the best place to live, work and do business.<p>

<h3>FIRST-STOP MAKES GOVERNMENT ACCESSIBLE TO BUSINESS</h3>

Illinois has a new and exciting service to help entrepreneurs and business owners access the state regulatory and assistance information they need to achieve success.  It's DCCA's First-Stop Business Information Center, working to improve Illinois' business climate by making it easier for entrepreneurs to comply with state business requirements.<p>

First-Stop, established in 1994 under the Business Assistance and Regulatory Reform Act, includes a number of services and products designed to meet the needs of new and existing businesses.  For example, First-Stop offers the Directory of Business Requirements and Assistance Programs to help new and existing businesses determine the regulations and services applicable to their business activity.  The Directory is a comprehensive resource with nearly 500 profiles from more than 40 state agencies that document virtually every business license, permit, certificate and registration required by the State of Illinois, as well as the various state assistance programs available to help businesses. <p>

First-Stop also offers Starting a Business In Illinois, a comprehensive handbook for those looking to start and do business in Illinois.  The handbook includes general local, state and federal business requirements, a feasibility checklist and a business plan outline. <p>

In the coming months, First-Stop will be improving and expanding its services. "Business Bios," which will give specific, detailed regulatory information for virtually every industry, are currently being updated and expanded.  Also in the works is a comprehensive database, which will inventory business licenses, permits, certificates and registrations required by the State of Illinois.  In addition, First-Stop, with the help of business owners, associations and state agencies, will embark on a new path to search out and identify existing state laws that are burdensome, duplicative or onerous.<p>

First-Stop's effectiveness lies not only in its ability to give start-up and regulatory information to Illinois' businesses, but also in its connections to other business assistance centers.  Local assistance for new or existing businesses is available through the Business and Industry Data Center (BIDC) and the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network (ISBDCN).  The BIDC works to enhance the ability of small business people to plan, market, manage and expand their businesses by providing them with access to statistical data and other sources of practical information. The ISBDCN seeks to increase the competitiveness, profitability and growth of Illinois businesses in a global market through Small Business Development Centers, Procurement Technical Assistance Centers, International Trade Centers, and NAFTA Opportunity Centers.<p>

First-Stop's Directory of Business Requirements and Assistance Programs and Starting a Business in Illinois are available through the World Wide Web (http://ww.accessil.com/dcca/) or the Access Illinois electronic bulletin board (217/787-6255, settings ANSI, 8, N, 1).  Clients also may receive this information free of charge by contacting the First-Stop Business Information Center directly at 800/252-2923 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).<p>

<h3>ITP HELPS SUPPLIERS IMPROVE QUALITY, PRODUCTIVITY</h3>

"We have to team in excellence to prevail."  Those were the words of Hans Becherer, Chairman and CEO of Deere & Company, commenting on the firm's latest effort to help its Illinois suppliers improve their quality and productivity, in turn helping Deere maintain and improve its own competitiveness in the global economy.<p>

A driving force behind this partnership is Illinois' Industrial Training Program (ITP), administered by the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).  Gov. Jim Edgar recently participated in ceremonies awarding a $574,709 ITP grant to Deere to assist the company in providing training to 4,065 workers from 136 Illinois Deere suppliers.<p>

In its early days, ITP provided state-funded grants to manufacturers like Deere to help them train new employees and upgrade the skills of current workers.  But it became increasingly apparent that a training void existed for small and medium-sized manufacturers.  Thanks to changes in the program enacted in 1992, ITP now provides grants to trade organizations, company consortia, and community colleges, as well as original equipment manufacturers that use the funds to offer training opportunities to workers from their Illinois suppliers.  Deere, for example, has received more than $2.2 million in ITP funds since fiscal year 1993, which it has used to help train nearly 14,000 workers from its Illinois supplier companies.<p>

The program has been a great success.  Everett "Bud" Pierce, President of McLaughlin Body Company in Moline, a Deere supplier that has participated in the training program since 1993, said, "Training is more important than at any time in our careers.  As suppliers, we need to reduce costs and improve productivity.   The fact that we as suppliers can find training that enables us to better service our customers makes the program very valuable."<p>

Jerry Norquist, Manager of Safety and Training for Rockford Products Corp. of Rockford, another Deere supplier, agreed.  "Feedback we're receiving from our customers throughout their quality audits confirms that progress is definitely being made in that direction.  Our quality costs and delivery measures are showing significant improvement trends.  We're gaining market shares.  The education and training made available to our workforce through this program is a major contributor to our organizational development."<p>

ITP grants provide up to 50 percent of the cost of training efforts.  The remaining costs are leveraged with private investment.  Deere provides five categories of training to its suppliers:  supply management, financial; operations improvements; skilled-based; and employee development.<p>

Diana Bump, Education and Training Facilitator, from Reliable Power Products, Franklin Park, said ITP training provided through Deere allowed her company to maximize its training dollars and include more employees.  "During our first year of involvement with this training program, 141 employees participated in 26 different classes.  Benefits of the program that have already been realized and measured are improved customer satisfaction, with shipment compliance improving from 91.4 percent to 97.2 percent.  Job instruction time has been reduced by one-third.  Computer efficiency has improved by 30 percent as a result of the computer skills class, with stress levels being reduced about 70 percent.  In one product area, cycle time has been reduced by 30 percent and our work in process inventories have been reduced by 50 percent overall."<p>

Gov. Edgar said ITP is an important part of the state's effort to ensure job opportunities for its people by helping Illinois businesses improve their competitiveness in the global marketplace.  "It's particularly crucial that we assist small and medium-sized businesses, because that's where most of the job growth will be as we move into the 21st Century.  It's critical to Deere that they have businesses that supply them with the highest quality work products, and important to us in Illinois that our small and medium-sized businesses are able to improve their productivity.  These training dollars will help these suppliers do business with other international companies around the world."<p>

Becherer commended the Governor and the state for having the foresight and the wisdom to stand behind the Industrial Training Program.  "When there is something like this program that provides both an incentive for us and our suppliers to work together on programs to enhance capabilities of suppliers, it provides another competitive edge that is needed in the very competitive markets in which we operate today worldwide."<p>

<h3>
"CROSSING INTERNATIONAL BORDERS" CONFERENCE<br> 
FEATURES TIPS ON EFFECTIVE EXPORTING
</h3>

Exporters and companies interested in exploring the global marketplace can get valuable tips to help them achieve success at this year's "Crossing International Borders" Conference, to be held at the Chicago Hilton and Towers on May 16.<p>

The conference is co-sponsored by DCCA's International Business Division and Arthur Andersen.  Registration is $95 per person through May 9 or $125 per person following that date.  For conference information or registration, contact Arthur Andersen at 312/507-9664 or Mary Anne Brown-Rogerio at DCCA at 312/814-2325 (TDD 312/419-0667).<p>

<h3>SCRAP TIRES PROMOTE RECYCLING; PROVIDE SAFER PLAYGROUNDS</h3>

Every year, more than 12 million old tires are scrapped in Illinois, creating a breeding site for disease-carrying mosquitoes, providing a potential fire hazard with the possibility for dense fumes of toxic smoke, and filling up valuable landfill space.  DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recycling is working to encourage recycling of those old tires in ways that can end the hazards while providing useful products.<p>

One very successful effort is a program that utilizes chips made from recycled scrap tires as a loose playground cover.  The tire chips provide a safer playground surface  because their rubber content has a shock-absorbing quality.  They also help keep maintenance costs down.  Tire chips allow for fast drainage, last for years without rotting or decaying, plus they retard weed growth, reduce dust and mud, are clean and non-toxic, do not produce leachate, and do not attract animals or insects.<p> 

This year, the Used Tire Recovery Program provided $260,000 in grants to 106 public and private schools, day care facilities and park districts to help them purchase the scrap tire playground surfacing material.  Grants of up to $3,600 were provided, with grant recipients required to match at least 40 percent.  Grant funds are generated by a state surcharge on the retail purchase of new automotive tires in Illinois.  The funded projects will use more than six million pounds of scrap tire chips, which equates to recycling more than 300,000 automotive tires.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS TOURISM GOES ON-LINE</h3>

Wouldn't it be convenient if you could instantly access information on almost any Illinois tourism destination?  Wouldn't it be ideal to browse through this information any time of the day or night, any day of the week, from the comfort of your home? <p> 

Well, it's possible.  Thanks to the Internet and your computer, potential Illinois travelers can get the information they need conveniently and quickly.<p>

DCCA's Illinois Bureau of Tourism, working closely with Foote, Cone and Belding advertising agency, has developed a new site on the World Wide Web that can help consumers learn about events, sites and activities, lodging, restaurants, sports, weather forecasts, what's on tap at theaters and museums, and just about anything else needed to plan a weekend getaway or a complete vacation.<p>

The tourism database is user-friendly and can be reached from two locations.  At the heart of the new site, accessible by clicking on the Illinois Tourism button on DCCA's home page (http://www.accessil.com/dcca/) or clicking directly to the Illinois Tourism homepage (http://www.enjoyillinois.com), is the Trip Planner.  It includes detailed trip planning information on food, shopping, golf, lodging, special events, outdoor recreation, packaged discounts, etc.  The information in this section is created through tourism's Illinois Travel Counseling System's toll-free hotline database (1-800-2-CONNECT).  The data will frequently be downloaded into the website, ensuring detailed, current travel information.<p>

There's also a What's New section to inform users of upcoming content; Inside Insights, providing first-hand suggestions from real people who have explored and traveled in Illinois; Maps, which includes maps of Illinois regions, biking and hiking trails and special interest maps; Front Lines, with up-to-the-minute data on weather, sports and theater; and a sophisticated Search Engine to easily sort through it all.<p>

No longer will potential travelers have to make separate calls to get information on golf courses and hotels, Cubs schedules, or whatever other activities they might choose.  One visit to the Illinois Tourism website will connect these travelers with all of the answers, enabling them to customize their vacation plans in Illinois.<p>

Future plans also call for development of special contests, meetings and convention information, and the opportunity to purchase Illinois merchandise through tourism's retail outlet, Illinois Marketplace, located at Chicago's Navy Pier.<p>

Obviously, offering these benefits through the Internet is a great convenience to travelers.  But it also is an important tool for the state.  In addition to bringing consumers closer to the information they need to travel in Illinois, the Internet helps Illinois develop a relationship with consumers and generate a customer database by gathering E-mail addresses.<p>

Tourism is big business in Illinois.  In 1994, travelers spent nearly $16 billion in Illinois, contributing more than $995 million in state and local taxes, $1.7 billion in federal taxes, and generating more than 241,000 jobs with a payroll of $4.8 billion.  The Internet can help make travel in Illinois even more convenient and accessible, and help this important industry continue to grow.<p>

<h3>ITP GRANT HELPS KEEP QUALITY AS "JOB ONE"</h3>

Nearly 3,000 workers at Ford Motor Company's Chicago Assembly plant and its Illinois supplier firms will learn new skills to help them be more productive employees, thanks to an $800,000 Industrial Training Program grant announced by Gov. Jim Edgar during a January visit to the plant.<p>

The grant, the latest in a series of ITP awards to Ford since Fiscal Year 1989,  highlights the important relationship between DCCA and Illinois companies in providing the training needed to keep Illinois worker skills among the best in the world.   ITP grants are an investment in Illinois workers that can help tip the scales in favor of Illinois when companies make location, expansion or modernization decisions.<p>

Ford, for example, has been manufacturing automobiles in Chicago since 1914, and started production at the Torrence Avenue facility in 1924.  Over the years, the plant has been expanded and modernized, currently producing the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable automobiles.  The Chicago Assembly plant supplies vehicles throughout the U.S. and exports vehicles to 17 countries.<p>

A commitment to quality has always been foremost.  In July 1995, Ford awarded the Chicago Assembly Plant its Ford Q1 (Quality 1) designation.  That commitment, coupled with exacting export requirements demanded by established international quality standards, makes it necessary for Ford to continuously provide training programs to upgrade the skills and knowledge of its workers.<p>

Using its latest ITP grant, Ford will work with equipment suppliers, Ford personnel, and local schools and universities to develop and conduct training activities.  Included in the training is problem solving, continuous improvement methods, statistical process control, communications techniques and leadership skills.  Preventive maintenance systems, quality operating systems, computer skills, technical equipment courses and online production operations training are also part of the total training plan.  A heavy emphasis will be placed on process improvement and international quality measurements, such as ISO 9002.<p>

In its quest to ensure that "Quality is Job One," Ford also is inviting many of its Illinois supplier companies to participate in the training program.  Those companies include the Ford Chicago Stamping Plant in Chicago Heights; Certified Tool of Elk Grove Village; ELCO Industries, Inc. of Rockford, ITW Deltar Insert Molded Products in Elk Grove Village; Littlefuse, Inc. in Des Plaines; and MacLean-Fogg Company of Mundelein.<p>

This supplier training is a relatively new aspect of ITP.  In its early years, the program was restricted to Illinois manufacturers to assist with training and retraining costs.  In 1992, the program was expanded to include multi-company and intermediary organizations -- community colleges, original equipment manufacturers like Ford providing training to workers from their Illinois supplier network, business and industry associations, labor organizations, and strategic business partnerships -- among those eligible for grant funding.  This new emphasis enables today's ITP to reach out to a broader segment of the Illinois business community, particularly small and medium-sized companies with similar training needs.<p>

Since its inception in Fiscal Year 1979, the Industrial Training Program has provided nearly $168.7 million to help train more than 287,000 Illinois workers.  Entirely funded through state General Revenue Funds, the grants reimburse companies or organizations up to 50 percent of the cost of training efforts.  By providing grants to multi-company and intermediary organizations, ITP funds are training more workers than ever before while lowering per-worker training costs.<p>

In speaking of the Ford grant, Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior advisor for economic development, provided insight into the overall importance of ITP to the continued strength of the Illinois business community.  "The Edgar Administration is committed to investing in a highly-trained workforce," Kustra said.  "Production of the redesigned Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable vehicles at the Chicago Assembly Plant, and so many key pieces at the Chicago Stamping Plant, required the installation of significant new technology.  Stringent export standards also contribute to Ford's need to consistently upgrade the skills of its own employees and those of its suppliers.  I am pleased we can assist Ford in helping workers meet this challenge." <p>

<h3>TOP 10 TIPS FOR WRITING SUCCESSFUL CDAP APPLICATIONS</h3>

The Public Facilities component of DCCA's Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) is one of the most important tools to help smaller Illinois communities address infrastructure needs that pose potential threats to public health and safety.  Public Facilities grants are just one component of CDAP, a federally-funded program administered by DCCA's Bureau of Community Development, that provides grants to local units of government in communities with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven large urban counties that receive funds directly from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  But since CDAP Public Facilities grants are awarded on a competitive basis, it is crucial that communities submit the best possible application.  DCCA staffers often participate in workshops and seminars to help grantwriters refine their skills.  The following is a Top 10 List of their tips to help communities prepare more competitive applications:<p>

1.  Give your grantwriter sufficient time to prepare your CDAP application.  CDAP is a federally-funded program with complex requirements.  Make sure your grantwriter has enough time to thoroughly research and document the information in the application.<p>

2.  Know what you're sending.  Many communities hire grantwriters to prepare their applications, but ultimately the local government submitting the application is responsible for its contents and completeness.  For example, if other leverage is part of the project, be sure that leverage is in place before seeking the CDAP grant.  If it is not, your application will not be favorably reviewed.<p>

3.  At least 51 percent of the benefit from CDAP Public Facilities projects must be provided to low- and moderate-income (LMI) people.  Make sure the LMI documentation matches the actual project benefit area.  For example, if only a particular neighborhood of a community will be served by a project, income surveys or census data should only reflect that area, not the entire community.<p>

4.  Write a complete project summary narrative.  If you are proposing to extend water mains to serve a rural area, for example, include specific information about the condition of the private wells that are inadequately serving the area.  Survey the residents of the area -- are 20 of the 25 currently trucking in water or purchasing bottled water?  Include information about the age of an old city system that needs to be replaced.  How many breaks has it experienced in the past two years?  Does your community need a new water tower?  If so, include information about average daily water use or low water pressure and its effects on residents.<p>  

5.  Include a Project Location Map.  It doesn't have to be blueprint quality; it just needs to illustrate the entire project area and show the proposed improvements.<p>

6.  Document the existing threat to public health and safety.  Include "internal" reports, such as repair bills, citizen complaint records or letters, water quality test results, numbers of boil orders, data on breaks, engineering reports, as well as "external" documents, such as historical correspondence from the IEPA, or letters from the health department referencing test results and inspection results of the targeted area.<p> 

7.  Demonstrate financial need.  Why does your community need a grant?  What is your financial indebtedness?  Do you have bonding capacity?  What are current user rates for water and sewer services; could they be raised?  You must submit a copy of your most recent government audit with your CDAP application.  Be sure that if you have incurred additional debt since that audit was prepared, you inform us of that debt. (DCCA's Office of Local Government Services can conduct a financial analysis to help communities determine whether they need CDAP assistance.)<p>

8.  Demonstrate community effort.  What efforts has your community made to address the problem on its own?  Have you continually made repairs to an antiquated water treatment facility?  Have you exhausted local resources making sewer main repairs?  Have you contacted other funding sources, such as RECDS (FmHA), the Rural Bond Bank, the IEPA or local financial institutions?  If you have, and you've been turned down for help, indicate that in your application.  This tells us that you have taken the initiative and CDAP may be your only option.<p>

9.  Document project readiness.  CDAP guidelines now state that project readiness is a "project threshold."  In other words, if your application does not demonstrate that the proposed project is complete, appropriate and achievable, we may not review it further.  Be sure you review all of the project readiness guidelines and address them in your narrative:  a Preliminary Engineering Report that breaks down the project and its costs in detail; properly executed Agreements and Assurances, such as intergovernmental cooperation agreements; Firm Financial Commitments -- according to new CDAP guidelines, a minimum of 25 percent leverage must be "firmly" committed and documented according to the guidelines in the CDAP application; and Site Control, such as a signed commitment from a property owner for an easement or parcel of land and copies of any permits needed.<p>

10.  Document past CDAP performance, informing us of your timely and efficient completion of any past CDAP projects.  If your community experienced problems completing a past project on time, document circumstances beyond your control which might have delayed the project.<p> 

Every year, DCCA receives applications requesting nearly two times more in CDAP Public Facilities grants than funds available.  A complete, detailed application can increase your community's chances of success.  For further information, contact the CDAP staff at 217/785-6142 (TDD users call 800/785-6055.)<p>

<h3>DCCA, REGIONAL PARTNERS, REPRESENT ILLINOIS AT SAE '96</h3>
<h4>by GeorgeAnn Madison, DCCA Bureau of Business Development</h4>
	
This year's Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Exposition, held last month in Detroit, celebrated an important milestone:  the 100th Year Anniversary of the automotive industry.   Illinois, among the nation's leading automotive industry locations, was well-represented at the show through a booth manned by DCCA's local economic development partners and sponsored by DCCA's  Regional Economic Development Partnership Program (REDPP).<p>

REDPP provides funds that enable local and regional economic development professionals to attend various in-state and out-of-state trade shows to promote their communities and Illinois.  SAE '96 was one example of the kinds of expositions that are targeted for REDPP funding -- expositions that reach top prospects, both national and international, from Illinois' most important industries.<p>

Recognized worldwide as the leading exposition supporting a network of the automotive industry's top executives, engineers and company representatives, the SAE International Exposition is the oldest assembly of high-level industry personnel and suppliers and holds the honor of being the industry's largest and most prestigious automotive event.  Each year this event draws 850-plus supplier exhibits and includes more than 100 companies from outside North America showing their wares to an audience of more than 40,000 engineering professionals including 3,200 from overseas.<p>

A highlight of the Illinois booth was a Mitsubishi Eclipse convertible donated for the exhibit by Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing of America, Inc., Normal.   The flashy auto helped attract attendees to the Illinois booth, where they were able to meet one-on-one with economic development personnel.  The contacts are important for both sides -- they enable industry professionals to learn about Illinois and offer Illinois economic developers an excellent opportunity to develop a list of qualified industry contacts and meet with industry decision-makers.<p>

SAE '96 also showcased another feature of REDPP.  The program enables participants to use portions of their funding for pre-show promotional efforts.  Illinois' exhibit, for example, was featured in a pre-show issue of Automotive Engineering (an organized pre-show promotional manual), as well as the Exhibitor's Manual (an on-site show directory).  These advertising efforts also had a two-pronged benefit -- they encouraged exhibitors to visit the Illinois booth, while providing Illinois exhibitors with access to a mailing list of all registered attendees at the SAE'96 Expo for future contact.<p>

DCCA and its local and regional partners will follow through on the leads they received at the SAE '96 Expo by mailing letters to contacts, providing an overview of Illinois' resources and attributes.   It's just one example of ways DCCA is working with local economic developers to attract and retain key industries and their jobs.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS TO HOST AFFORDABLE COMFORT CONFERENCE</h3>
<h4>by Henry Kurth, Bureau of Energy and Recycling</h4>

DCCA's  Bureau of Energy and Recycling, in cooperation with Affordable Comfort, Inc., are leading sponsors of the 10th Annual Affordable Comfort Conference, coming up March 17 through March 22 at the Palmer House Hotel in Chicago.<p>

The conference is designed to bolster the skills and knowledge of people who work on solutions to energy and housing problems, including problems faced by low-income households.  It features information on unique and cutting-edge technologies to help architects, builders, developers and other housing officials improve the energy efficiency of new and existing housing stock.<p>

The six-day conference will feature workshops, half- and full-day short courses, an energy exhibit area, participant-initiated sessions, special evening technical sessions, and an architect's forum.  Fourteen different technical tracks are featured, including Resource Efficient Construction, HVAC Systems, Marketing Comfort and Efficiency, and Energy Efficient Mortgages.  In addition, 90 different sessions conducted by some of the world's leading energy professionals will enable participants to choose workshops that meet their specific needs.  The Conference also will feature short courses with hands-on and in-field training, and an energy exhibit by more than 40 energy product, service, and equipment vendors.<p>

This is the first year that the Affordable Comfort Conference has been held in Illinois.  Chicago was chosen following a review of prospective sites by the Affordable Comfort Board, which selected the proposal submitted by the Bureau of Energy and Recycling with support from Gov. Jim Edgar.  The 1997 conference also will be held in Chicago.<p>

For more information or a conference brochure, contact Maureen Davlin or Chrissie Garrison of DCCA's Bureau of Energy and Recyclinvg at 217/785-2800 (TDD users call 217/785-0211).<p>

<h3>ENERGY ASSISTANCE HOTLINE CAN BE A LIFELINE</h3>
<h4>by Curt Farrar, DCCA Division of Economic Opportunity</h4>

To some, handling more than 40,000 calls annually on DCCA's Energy Assistance Hotline would seem a tedious job.  But to the staff of the  Division of Economic Opportunity, particularly Support Services staffers, Esther Reed, John Ray, and Jan Stehlin, it's an important and rewarding service.<p>

The Energy Assistance Hotline is an information and referral source for those individuals seeking assistance with their heating bills, home weatherization, and other emergency services offered through the Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance, Low-Income Home Energy Assistance, and Community Services Block Grant Programs.<p>

Established in 1979 near the same time as DCCA's creation, the Hotline started as two phones with headsets installed in a separate room at the Department's offices. Then as now, staffers took calls from individuals wanting to know what the energy assistance and weatherization programs were all about, program eligibility requirements, and information on where they could apply.<p>

Although some people call to express complaints, Reed says, "The rewards come when you can help people such as Mr. Jenkins who writes, "My blood level is monitored weekly being on blood thinner. I get cold. I am 60 years old...Right leg amputee up to hip...I am wheelchair bound. Please help." <p>

Besides answering questions about DCCA's programs, Hotline staffers also retain a listing of other agencies' toll-free numbers, including those of Public Aid, Mental Health, Aging, and the Department of Children and Family Services.  Well-established communication channels also are maintained with the state's electric and gas utilities, including Commonwealth Edison, People's Gas, CILCO, and Illinois Power.<p>

Reed is proud of the work she and other DCCA staffers do.  "We're a small operation with only one phone line, but we probably touch every segment of the state's social services network.  We are a lifeline for a lot of needy people across the state."<p>

The Energy Assistance Hotline number is 800/252-8643 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).<p>

<center>###</center>


Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra recently convened a "Coal Strategy Group" of leaders from the Illinois Coal Association, United Mine Workers of America and state agencies, including DCCA.  The group will discuss ways to improve the economic viability of Illinois coal thus ensuring a positive impact on local communities.<p>

<H3>NEW AND EXPANDING BUSINESSES CHOOSING ILLINOIS</H3>

More and more, Illinois is the location of choice for new and expanding
businesses.  Over the past few months, Gov. Jim Edgar has announced several
impressive projects that will create hundreds of new jobs for Illinois
workers.  Among the companies choosing to expand in Illinois are Motorola
and U.S. Robotics -- high technology companies that are contributing to
Illinois' emergence as the "silicon prairie."<P>
     
Motorola recently chose Elgin for the worldwide headquarters of its
Messaging, Information and Media Sector (MIMS).  The $40 million plant is
expected to create 1,500 jobs.  At the official ceremonies announcing the
project, the Governor said, "Illinois is becoming known as the Silicon
Prairie because we deliver on our promise to provide the well-trained
workforce, infrastructure improvements and excellent transportation system
these companies require."<P>

MIMS is a world leader in the manufacture of cutting-edge communications
products associated with pagers and wireless communications.  The
headquarters will be built on a 130-acre parcel near I-90 in Elgin.  It is
slated for completion in 1997.<P>

U.S. Robotics is one of the world's leading suppliers of products and
systems that provide access to information.  The company designs,
manufacturers, markets and supports remote access servers, enterprise
communications systems, desktop/mobile client products and modems.  Gov. Edgar recently participated in
dedication ceremonies for the company's new $30 million manufacturing and
operations facility in Morton Grove, and announced that U.S. Robotics will
continue its investment in Illinois through expanding its Mt. Prospect
facility.<P>

The new Morton Grove plant employs more than 1,400 workers.  Constructed on
a 23-acre site, the 302,000 square-foot plant received a High Impact
Business designation from DCCA, enabling the company to realize an
estimated $1.3 million in business incentives, including an investment tax
credit and an exemption from state utility taxes.  DCCA also provided
$500,000 in job training assistance through the Industrial Training Program
(ITP).  The $40 million Mt. Prospect expansion, expected to create 1,500
jobs, also received a High Impact Business designation from DCCA, which
will provide an estimated $2.1 million in business incentives, as well as
commitment from DCCA to provide training assistance to workers.<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, the Governor's senior economic development adviser,
said, "As the world-wide demand for information access devices continued to
escalate, we will work with U.S. Robotics and other high technology firms
to ensure that Illinois is a place where these companies can thrive."<P>

Illinois is not only the choice for high-technology industries; it also is
attracting investment from global leaders like McDonald's Corporation,
which is undertaking one of the largest business retention and expansion
projects in the state's history.<P>

McDonald's, which operates 17,400 restaurants in more than 86 nations, will
expand its Oak Brook headquarters, adding as many as 7,000 new jobs over
the next 20 years to the 3,000 jobs currently at the facility.  Mike
Quinlan, McDonald's Chairman and CEO, said," With its excellent business
climate and emphasis on infrastructure improvements, Illinois provides us
with a strong foundation from which we can maximize our Oak Brook home
office support to our global food service business.  We appreciate state
and local government officials working together to support our investment
in Illinois."<P>

Three other recent announcements also solidified Illinois' strength as the
choice for business locations and expansions.<P>Menard, Inc. operates more than 100 retail stores in nine states, including
more than 30 stores in Illinois.  DCCA staff worked closely with company
officials for several months to settle on a location for a new distribution
facility to serve the company's needs.  That search ultimately led to
Plano, where the area's infrastructure (close proximity to rail, three
major interstates and an airport) made it an ideal location for a $20
million distribution center that will serve up to 80 Menard's Home
Improvement stores throughout the Midwest.   The new facility, which will
be completed in two phases, is expected to employ at least 300 people.
GE Lighting, a long-time corporate resident of Mattoon, announced plans in
December to invest $100 million in new production lines at the company's
lamp manufacturing plant.  The modernization project, which will be
assisted through $650,000 in Industrial Training Program (ITP) funds
provided by DCCA, is expected to create 50 new jobs during the next four
years.  An additional 150 jobs will be upgraded and 400 jobs will be
retained at the Mattoon plant, which will produce some of the company's
most sophisticated lighting products.<P>

And Moline's downtown area will benefit with John Deere Health Care's
announcement that it will undertake a $38 million development project,
including a 100,000 square-foot building to house John Deere Health Care's
corporate headquarters, a 15,000 square-foot John Deere Visitor Pavilion
and a new Community Transportation Center.  Plans also call for a new
first-class hotel to accommodate overnight visitors to the area.  Three-
hundred current John Deere Health Care employees and 100 new employees will
work in the new headquarters.  The Pavilion will feature displays and
historic exhibits and is expected to draw up to 400,000 visitors annually.
The Transportation Center will serve as an intercity bus transfer center
and staging area for bus tour groups.  The downtown development project is
being undertaken with more than $1 million in state assistance, including a
$600,000 loan to the City of Moline through DCCA's public infrastructure
program, up to $300,000 in job training funds to assist John Deere Health
Care with worker training, and a $100,000 tourism attraction program grant.
The Illinois Department of Transportation is also expected to provide
infrastructure assistance to help accommodate increased demand for parking
and increased traffic flow on the Arsenal Island Bridge.<P>

<H3>BRAZILIAN TRADE MISSION HIGHLIGHTS ETHANOL USE</H3>

As the nation's leading producer and consumer of ethanol, Illinois has a
vested interest in the development of ethanol-fueled vehicles for use both
here and abroad.  In keeping with that goal, Norm Marek of DCCA's Bureau of
Energy and Recycling recently participated in a Brazilian trade mission
designed to further efforts to develop and utilize more ethanol-fueled
vehicles in the U.S. and other nations.<P>

Marek joined Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, Nebraska Gov. Benjamin Nelson
and 15 others, including representatives from two Illinois corporations
that are leading ethanol suppliers, on the six-day Brazilian trade mission.
Participants toured a giant sugar and alcohol production facility at Barra
Bonito and inspected new ethanol/gasahol/flexible fuel vehicles at the
General Motors do Brasil factory at Campanis.  They also attended a
conference on Brazil's experience using ethanol as a transportation fuel.<P>

"Brazil sees a great future for ethanol, especially with known petroleum
reserves dwindling," Marek said.  "Many of their thoughts echoed the
thoughts of those in the Governors' Ethanol Coalition."<P>

A highlight of the trade mission was the announcement by Gov. Thompson that
a cooperative work agreement has been reached between the Governors'
Ethanol Coalition and the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil on the worldwide
promotion of ethanol.<P>

Marek plans to regularly correspond with his Brazilian counterparts to
share information about current ethanol projects underway in Illinois and
keep up with new developments in Brazil.  "I was particularly impressed by
the discussions with the GM-Brazil engineers.  They're currently working on
a compressed natural gas (CNG)/ethanol flexible fuel vehicle.  This could
be an ideal project for Illinois, as it would help to bridge the gap
between ethanol and CNG factions."<P>

<H3>DCCA ANNOUNCES TENTATIVE 1996 CDAP DEADLINES</H3>

DCCA's Bureau of Community Development has set tentative deadlines for
communities to apply for the 1996 round of grants available through the
popular Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP).<P>

CDAP is a federally-funded block grant program that provides funds to units
of local government, such as cities, villages, townships and counties, that
have  populations of 50,000 or less and are not located within one of the
seven urban counties (Cook, Lake, DuPage, Will, McHenry, Madison and St.
Clair) that receive funds directly from Washington.  Grants are available
for a wide range of projects that benefit low- and moderate-income people,
such as economic development projects that help create new jobs, public
facilities projects that address threats to public health and safety, and
housing rehabilitation.<P>

1996 programs and application deadlines include:<P>

<EM> Economic Development</EM> - Grant funds up to $500,000 are available.  Local
governments may use the funds to loan to a business locating or expanding
in the community to pay for machinery and equipment, working capital, or
building construction and renovation.  As loans are repaid, funds are
deposited into a locally-administered revolving loan fund to be used for
future economic development projects in the community.  Economic
Development grants may also be used to fund infrastructure improvements
directly related to the location or expansion of a business in a community.
These grants are awarded on an as-needed basis throughout the year.<P>

<EM> Planning Assistance</EM> - Local governments may seek grants up to $25,000 to
fund planning activities for future public facilities improvements,
including studies, analyses, data gathering, identification of
implementation actions and preparation of specific plans.  Applications are
judged on a competitive basis and are due on April 16, 1996.  A total of
$500,000 has been allocated for the 1996 round.<P>

<EM> Removal of Architectural Barriers</EM> - Grants up to $150,000 are available to
help local governments remove architectural barriers that restrict those
with disabilities from accessing publicly-owned buildings.  Applications
are judged on a competitive basis and are due on May 6, 1996.  A total of
$1 million is available in 1996.<P>

<EM> Public Facilities Construction/Design Engineering</EM> - Local governments may
compete for grants up to $50,000 for design engineering and up to $400,000
for public facilities construction projects needed to address threats to
public health and safety, such as inadequate water systems or unsafe sewage
treatment facilities.  In 1996, $1 million has been allocated for Design
Engineering grants and $20,860,570 has been earmarked for Public Facilities
Construction grants.  The deadline to apply is July 30, 1996.<P>

<EM> Housing Rehabilitation</EM> - To help ensure that safe, decent housing is
available for low- and moderate-income citizens, local governments may
compete for Housing Rehabilitation grants.  The grants, up to $400,000, are
used to upgrade and expand housing stock in the community.  Applications
are due on October 15, 1996.  A total of $7 million has been allocated for
this component.<P>

<EM> Emergency Public Facilities</EM> - Grants of up to $100,000 are available to
assist local governments when emergencies strike.  Grant funds may be used
to undertake projects that improve public infrastructure and eliminate
threats to public health and safety.  As emergencies may strike at any
time, grants are available on an as-needed basis.  DCCA has allocated $1
million for these grants during 1996.<P>
     
DCCA is also undertaking a three-year transition effort toward a goal of
starting the CDAP Program Year on January 1 of each calendar year.  This
effort is designed to enable DCCA to more expeditiously obligate and expend
CDAP funds.  Program years will be as follows:<P>

Program Year 1995 - June 1, 1995 to March 31, 1996<BR>
Program Year 1996 - April 1, 1996 to December 31, 1996<BR>
Program Year 1997 - January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1997<BR>

To ease problems associated with compressing Program Year 1996 and the
early start of Program Year 1997, DCCA will use its unfunded, eligible
Program Year 1996 Public Facilities applications as the projects to be
funded under Program Year 1997.  This means local governments that
submitted Program Year 1996 Public Facilities applications will not have to
re-submit them in Program Year 1997.<P>

Local governments may contact DCCA to receive CDAP application materials
and guidelines.  Contact Kay Wallwork at DCCA, 620 E. Adams, Springfield,
IL  62701, phone 217/785-7546 (TDD users call 800/785-6055).  For further

<HR>
<H3>MACLEAN, VER KUILEN NAMED TO KEY POSTS</H3>

Two DCCA veterans have recently been appointed to management positions in
the agency.  Ron Ver Kuilen, whose 15 years at DCCA have included service
as a field scout and manager of the Film Production Unit, has been named
Director of the Illinois Film Office.  Margaret MacLean, who joined DCCA's
International Business Division in 1991 and served as an international
marketing specialist and export promotion officer, has assumed the post of
Division Manager.<P>

As Film Office Director, Ver Kuilen will oversee the state's efforts to
market locations, talent, labor and production expertise to the national
and international film industry.  It's a big job -- since the film office's
inception in 1975, 523 productions have filmed in Illinois contributing
more than $700 million direct cash to the state's economy.<P>

Ver Kuilen has already served as project coordinator for more than 200
productions, including "Home Alone,"  "Field of Dreams," and Groundhog
Day."  But his work is not all glamorous Hollywood lunches and escorting
movie stars.  Most of it involves working with labor, government, business
and community leaders to ensure that doors open for filmmakers, such as
convincing building superintendents to leave the lights on at the Wrigley
Building for a special nighttime shot.  Ver Kuilen has also worked nights,
weekends and even Christmas Day to help filmmakers achieve the effects they
want.<P>

A native of Milwaukee, Ver Kuilen holds bachelor's and master's degrees
from  Northeastern Illinois University.  He is a member of the Association
of Film Commissioners International, manager of his softball team, and was
named 1994's "Facilitator of the Year" by Screen Magazine.<P>

Margaret MacLean's background serves her well as Managing Director of the
International Business Division.  A graduate of Dartmouth College, MacLean
has studied at the Chinese University of Hong Kong through a program
sponsored by Yale University, and at Scripps College in Claremont, CA.  She
also completed a year in Tokyo studying the Japanese language.  She is
conversant in Japanese, Chinese and French.<P>

MacLean comes to her post after five years with the Division, where she
advised Illinois manufacturers on export strategies for Asian markets,
researched and analyzed trade issues, developed and maintained contacts and
relations with government and business officials in the U.S. and Asia,
provided training for small business exporting under NAFTA, orchestrated
official visits for foreign dignitaries, and coordinated trade shows and
trade missions overseas.<P>

As Managing Director, she oversees operations of the state's six foreign
offices, and manages a staff of international trade professionals
headquartered in Chicago and Springfield.  Under her direction, the
Division also is administering a $450,000 grant awarded through the federal
government's Market Development Cooperator Program.  As one of only three
states to receive the grant, Illinois is using its funds to provide direct
financial assistance to enable Illinois companies to participate in trade
missions and trade shows overseas.<P>

<HR>
<H3>DCCA'S "ON THE WEB"</H3>

Internet users "surfing" on the World Wide Web can now access information
about DCCA's programs and services!<P>

Located at http://www.accessil.com/dcca/, or through the State Agencies
pick on the State of Illinois home page (http://www. state.il.us.), DCCA's
home page is designed to give Internet users quick, easy access to program
summaries; fact sheets detailing important statistics and information about
Illinois; community profiles; legislation affecting small businesses; and
calendars detailing program deadlines, workshops and other important
information.  In addition, users can access the First-Stop Business
Information Center of Illinois, a new DCCA service that offers valuable
assistance to start-up and small businesses.  First-Stop provides
businesses and individuals with access to information and referral
assistance to guide them through the permitting, licensing and regulatory
processes.  First-Stop also can link them to other available resources that
can help them comply with government regulations and enhance their
competitiveness.<P>

Over the coming months, DCCA will be making other additions and
improvements to its Web site.  One of the most exciting is the anticipated
February debut of a new Illinois Tourism pick specifically designed to help
users plan travel in Illinois.<P>

DCCA also continues to make information available through the Access
Illinois bulletin board system.  Anyone with a PC, modem and communications
software can utilize Access Illinois by calling 217/787-6255, settings
ANSI, 8, N, 1.  The only charge to bulletin board users is for the cost of
the telephone call.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>1995 Annual Report: Overview</FONT>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<HR>

<p>
Fiscal Year 1995 was a year of new beginnings for the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs. <p> 

On January 10, 1995, Gov. Jim Edgar signaled his commitment to advancing economic development in Illinois by appointing Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra as his senior advisor on economic development and giving him responsibility to oversee DCCA's future direction.  In making the appointment, Edgar said, "To ensure the future prosperity of Illinois, state government needs a coordinated, effective and well-managed system of economic development programs.  Bob Kustra is uniquely qualified to lead such a coordinated approach."  The executive order specified that the Director of DCCA reports directly to the Lieutenant Governor and remains ultimately responsible to the Governor.  The order also created the Economic Development Coordinating Council, which includes the heads of more than a dozen state agencies, boards and commissions that impact economic development.  Kustra was named Chairman of the Council by the Governor.<p>

In accepting the new responsibilities, Kustra said, "Illinois, obviously, has what it takes to create and retain jobs.  That's one reason we have more Illinoisans in jobs today than at any point in history.  Yet, we face pressures from other regions of the country and global competition.  We must be ready to take advantage of all opportunities, protect our investment and plan for the future."<p>

A week later, on January 17, 1995, Gov. Edgar named Dennis R. Whetstone as DCCA Director, replacing Jan M. Grayson, who resigned to pursue opportunities in the private sector.<p>

Whetstone, who had served for two years as an Assistant to the Governor for Planning, returned to DCCA where he had honed his skills in economic development for more than 18 years.  Before joining the Governor's staff, Whetstone had served as Executive Deputy Director at DCCA, supervising and coordinating the functions of the Department's bureaus of Program Administration, Marketing, Small Business Assistance, Tourism and Operations.  He also had served as Deputy Director for the Bureau of Program Administration and as manager of Job Training Programs for that bureau.<p>

Gov. Edgar cited Whetstone's expertise in workforce preparation, in particular, when announcing his choice.  "As part of our efforts to retool and re-energize the state's economic development efforts, we have recognized it is crucial Illinois continues to offer highly skilled, strongly motivated workers who have helped make us an economic giant in the nation's heartland."  Kustra added, "Dennis knows the needs of the private sector and shares our goal of making Illinois an even better place to do business.  With his help, we'll make certain that DCCA responds swiftly to opportunities to create and retain jobs in Illinois."<p>

In May, the leadership team expanded with the appointment of Levi Moore as DCCA's Assistant Director.  Moore, who had earlier worked in DCCA's Business Development Bureau, returned to DCCA following two years as a senior associate in the Chicago office of Korn/Ferry International.<p>
  
With these new leaders at the helm, DCCA moved aggressively forward to further Illinois' leadership in the field of economic development.  Through its Industry Development Division, in Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA successfully worked with local economic development officials to offer assistance to companies seeking to locate or expand their facilities in Illinois.  Among companies announcing plans to locate, expand, modernize or renovate their facilities were DeMert & Dougherty, Inc.; Motorola; Independence Tube Corp.; MacLean-Fogg Company; Maytag Corporation; Knapheide Manufacturing Co.; National Steel Corporation; C. J. Vitner Company; U.S. Robotics, Inc.; Cotter & Co.; and IBP, Inc.<p>

DCCA's Small Business Development Center staff counseled 9,348 companies and helped to provide management training to more than 10,000 people.  This assistance helped businesses to create 534 new jobs, retain more than 1,700 jobs, start 379 new businesses, expand 219 businesses, and obtain more than $52 million in business financing.  The Procurement Technical Assistance Centers helped Illinois firms secure more than $164 million in government contracts, while more than 1,700 small businesses received exporting assistance through the International Trade Centers and NAFTA Opportunity Centers.<p>

DCCA continued with the development of the First-Stop Business Information Center of Illinois, a statewide program designed to make it easier for entrepreneurs and business people to learn about and comply with state requirements.<p>  

The Office of Women's Business Development, created in Fiscal Year 1994, established a firm foundation during Fiscal Year 1995, working to promote greater understanding of the women's business community by helping women entrepreneurs tackle the wide range of challenges they confront, as well as providing administrative support to the Illinois Women's Business Ownership Council.<p>

The Loan Administration Division continued its important work consolidating DCCA's business loan programs, thus lessening confusion for loan applicants.  In Fiscal Year 1995, the Division analyzed more than 100 applications totaling $36.8 million.  The Division also continued to administer the Participation Loan Program, funding 13 loans totaling $2.9 million, which leveraged approximately $15.3 million in private investment, and enabled businesses to create or retain nearly 1,500 jobs.<p>

DCCA expanded its efforts to make information readily available on the "Information Highway" through Access Illinois, a 24-hour on-line information bulletin board service that links government agencies with trade associations and business organizations.  As one of the charter subscribers to Access Illinois, DCCA provides interested people with access to agency publications, newsletters, program descriptions and other information.  During Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA also began working with Access Illinois toward development of a Department "home page" on the Internet.<p>

DCCA also continued to fine-tune its efforts to help Illinois businesses achieve success in the global marketplace.  Through the International Business Division, DCCA provided assistance to 27 Illinois exhibitors at foreign trade shows; provided international marketing assistance to 600 Illinois companies; represented 534 companies at catalog shows; and co-sponsored more than 55 export development seminars, conferences or workshops. <p> 

Fiscal Year 1995 saw DCCA working closely with the business and labor communities to promote positive labor-management relations in Illinois.  In addition to providing 11 labor-management grants totaling $287,800 to support cooperative labor-management programs in the state, DCCA also worked with the Illinois Labor-Management Cooperation Committee to promote and encourage adoption of cooperative workplace programs.  A special "Labor-Management Partners:  On the Road to High Performance" award was developed to highlight and recognize Illinois employer organizations that demonstrate positive labor-management relations and cooperative work strategies.<p>  

DCCA continued its efforts to assist Illinois businesses in finding and implementing new technologies and modern business practices that help them remain competitive.  After leading the successful effort to secure a $1.4 million grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, DCCA's Office of Policy Development, Planning and Research (PDPR) administered the contract until staff could be hired.  PDPR staff also developed and distributed Requests for Proposals for funding under the Technology Challenge Grant Program, resulting in the funding of 10 regional manufacturing extension centers.  These centers, the core of the state's Coalition for Manufacturing Performance through Technology (COMPETE) initiative, will play a crucial role in fostering future research and technology transfer.<p>

Fiscal Year 1995 saw DCCA take concrete steps toward an ambitious effort to change the way Illinois delivers job training services to its workers and businesses.  Working closely with the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES), DCCA awarded more than $1.1 million in grants to develop 16 regional "one stop" career centers designed to consolidate employment and training services under one roof, thus easing the path to employment for unemployed and economically-
disadvantaged Illinoisans.  The joint effort, for which planning began in 1991, is the foundation of an even more impressive network of one-stop centers which will eventually blanket the entire state.<p>

Meanwhile, DCCA's staff continued working with a network of local administering agencies to ensure that job training services were available to those needing them.  Under Title III of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), 21,200 dislocated workers received job training assistance.  JTPA's Title IIA programs, which address the needs of economically disadvantaged adults, served 15,010 individuals statewide; an additional 1,237 older adults were served through the JTPA Title IIA Set-Aside Program for older workers.  Title IIC programs served 10,957 economically disadvantaged youths.  DCCA also provided a $408,889 grant to continue planning of a comprehensive Education to Careers system for Illinois.<p>

DCCA staffers continued their work with businesses, colleges and universities, and intermediary organizations to provide training to help Illinois workers keep their skills consistent with changing technologies and business processes.  Through the Industrial Training Program (ITP), DCCA funded 58 projects that benefited 1,321 companies and 38,652 trainees.<p>

Smaller Illinois communities often need assistance to meet the housing, infrastructure and economic development needs of their citizens.  In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA provided nearly $6 million through the federally-funded Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) to assist with 14 economic development projects.  An additional $41.2 million in supplemental CDAP funds were allocated to assist local governments in their continuing efforts to repair damages inflicted by the Great Flood of 1993.<p>

DCCA staffers also worked closely with their counterparts from the Illinois Department of Public Aid to successfully help local communities compile application proposals for the federally-funded Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community programs.  During Fiscal Year 1995, the City of Chicago was designated as an Empowerment Zone and the cities of Springfield and East St. Louis received designation as Enterprise Communities.<p>

Local government officials also relied on DCCA to help them learn more about ways to effectively utilize their resources.  Through its Office of Local Government Management Services, DCCA conducted or participated in 51 training sessions, assisting more than 3,100 elected and appointed government officials.  The office also responded to more than 1,100 telephone calls from local officials, distributed more than 10,500 publications and conducted 82 direct technical assistance projects.  The Office of Local Government Initiatives, established in Fiscal Year 1994, worked with 19 communities designated to participate in the Competitive Communities Initiative (CCI), a new effort designed to help communities enhance their competitiveness for business retention, expansion and attraction.  CCI received special recognition when a study team sent to Illinois by the Governor of Pennsylvania recommended CCI as a program that should be established in the Keystone State.<p>

Low-income Illinoisans received DCCA assistance to help them overcome many of the difficulties they face in everyday life.  In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA helped 201,582 households through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps pay a portion of the cost of winter energy bills.  In addition, the Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program (IHWAP) assisted 6,992 households.  The Community Services Block Grant Program (CSBG), which includes the CSBG Loan Program, a scholarship program and an emergency community services program to help the homeless, assisted 322,932 Illinoisans.<p>

Tourism, one of the state's fastest-growing industries, continued to thrive in Illinois during Fiscal Year 1995.  Domestic and international tourism revenues reached a record $15.9 billion during Calendar Year 1994 -- a 6.3 percent increase over the previous year.  Tourism contributed $995 million in local and state taxes, and supported 241,500 jobs in the state with a payroll of $4.8 billion.  In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA's Illinois Bureau of Tourism took the marketing of Illinois tourism to a new level, conducting an integrated marketing program designed to identify and reach the state's most likely tourism customers.  A new advertising campaign promoting the theme "Illinois:  A Million Miles from Monday" was launched to position Illinois as the ideal weekend getaway destination.  Advertising and public relations strategies also promoted the Bureau's new toll-free information number, 1-800-2CONNECT, which connects consumers to Illinois' state-of-the-art Illinois Travel Counseling System, enabling consumers to speak with a trained travel counselor.<p> 

DCCA also was affected by the reorganization of the state's natural resource agencies into one "super-agency."  The breakup of the Illinois Department of Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) sent three major responsibilities -- energy conservation and alternative energy, recycling, and coal development and marketing -- to DCCA.  Although these programs did not become a part of the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs until Fiscal Year 1996, their statistical and programmatic information for Fiscal Year 1995 is included in this report.<p> 

The foundations laid in Fiscal Year 1995 will continue to pay dividends as DCCA and the State of Illinois move confidently forward into Fiscal Year 1996 and beyond.<p>

<FONT SIZE=+3>1995 Annual Report: Director's Message</FONT>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<hr>
<p>
When I returned to DCCA in Fiscal 1995, I returned with a clear agenda.  One of my first goals was to do everything I could to again enhance the visibility and credibility of the agency, both within state government and in the eyes of our constituents and customers.<p>  

DCCA was created in 1979 to coordinate and run services and programs in an integrated way so as to best serve the needs of businesses, local governments and the recipients of human services programs.  In recent years, the agency lost some of that focus by trying to do too many things without a sufficient resource base.<p>  

It's time to get back to the basics.<p>  

Illinois and DCCA have many opportunities.  But, in the past, many of those opportunities have been overshadowed by unnecessary bureaucracy, unneeded paperwork, cumbersome procedures and processes, and onerous rules and regulations.  Although some of this is necessary to ensure the public's trust and our accountability, I challenged the DCCA staff to start thinking of ways to streamline and improve processes and procedures to achieve efficiencies, both internally and externally.<p>

DCCA today has begun the process of "market-testing" its programs to ensure that they are demand-driven and truly responsive to the needs of customers.  We are working closer than ever to forge new partnerships with major business and local government organizations and serve as an outspoken advocate for our mutual constituents.<p>  

We're working to build the foundations that can lead to prosperous industries, rising real incomes and more quality jobs for our workers.  That's economic development and that's what we do.<p>

On the cover of this Annual Report you will see DCCA's Mission Statement.  Although the language in this Mission Statement was finalized in Fiscal Year 1996, its seeds were planted in Fiscal Year 1995.<p>  

I pledge to you our continued dedication to this mission.<p>

In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA's Bureau of Business Development continued its efforts to position Illinois as the location of choice for businesses looking to locate or expand, and to help smaller businesses achieve success.<p>

Late in the fiscal year, DCCA began work toward launching a Fiscal Year 1996 marketing effort built around the theme, "Illinois -- a great place for business keeps getting better."  The marketing effort included a special supplement to Area Development magazine, planning for a special advertising supplement in Business Week magazine, and advertising in magazines and Midwest newspapers, including Crain's Chicago Business, the Chicago Tribune, and the Wall Street Journal.  It was designed to highlight the Fiscal Year 1995 passage of tort reform legislation that made Illinois a more attractive location.  The reforms, enacted by the General Assembly and signed by Gov. Jim Edgar, abolished the antiquated Structural Work Act that was duplicative of workers' compensation.  They also abolished the doctrine of joint and several liability and reformed product liability litigation, capped punitive damages, limited non-economic damages and made other significant changes to underline Illinois' image as a business-friendly state.<p>

<h3>Division of Industry Development</h3>

DCCA's Division of Industry Development is the agency's central source of economic development information and assistance for businesses and local economic development organizations.

</ul>


<a name="Small Business"><hr></a>
<h3>Small Business Division</h3>

DCCA's Small Business Division, a part of the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network (ISBDCN), provides focused assistance to small and medium-sized Illinois businesses.  Through the ISBDCN, which functions in partnership with the U.S. Small Business Administration, companies receive technical and management assistance to help them achieve success.<p>

Among services of the Small Business Division are:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li> Regulatory Flexibility Program, which reviews proposed rules affecting small businesses, including in-depth analyses into their impact on Illinois small businesses.<p>
<li> Illinois Business Energy and Environmental Technology Program, which provides information and referral assistance to firms looking to improve their profitability through efficiencies in their energy systems, as well as by reducing wastes in their production processes.  During Fiscal Year 1995, a clearinghouse of information was created containing more than 1,000 sources of assistance.  Information or assistance was provided to 1,100 businesses.  Program staff also co-sponsored the first Illinois Energy and Environmental Expo, slated to become an annual event.<p>
<li> Small Business Environmental Assistance Program, created in Fiscal Year 1995.  This program, federally mandated under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, provides assistance to Illinois small businesses through a toll-free help line, an Environmental Clearinghouse containing 250 documents, an Environmental Services Directory of 272 firms with environmental expertise, and sponsorship of educational seminars.  The program provided 1,053 small businesses with compliance assistance and information during Fiscal Year 1995.<p>  
</ul>


<a name="SBDC"><hr></a>
<h3>Illinois Small Business Development Center Network</h3>

The Network is comprised of 40 Small Business Development Center (SBDC) locations, including:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li> Small Business Development Centers, which provide businesses with management, marketing and financial counseling.<p>
<li> Procurement Technical Assistance Centers, which assist existing businesses in contracting with state, federal and local governments by offering general procurement counseling and other services.<p>
<li> International Trade Centers (ITCs) at five locations around the state, including two NAFTA Opportunity Centers (NOCs).  The ITCs provide business owners with professional advice and resources to prepare them to enter the global marketplace.  The NAFTA Opportunity Centers offer specialized assistance to companies entering the Mexican and Canadian marketplaces.<p>  
<li> Small Business Innovative Research Center, which provides counseling, training and technical assistance to technology-oriented entrepreneurs to enhance their ability to compete for federal research and development awards.<p>
<li> Small Business Incubators, which provide businesses in the early stages of development with shared resources to help them achieve success.<p>
</ul>


In Fiscal Year 1995, the ISBDCN counseled 9,348 companies and assisted in the management training of 10,177 individuals, resulting in the creation of 1,534 new jobs, retention of 1,721 jobs, start-up of 379 new businesses, 219 business expansions and securing of more than $52.3 million in business financing.  The 15 Procurement Technical Assistance Centers conducted 7,643 counseling sessions, helping their clients obtain 2,656 government contracts totaling $164.4 million, create 330 new jobs and retain 1,709 jobs.  The ITCs and NOCs provided individual exporting advice and training to more than 1,700 small businesses entering the export marketplace.<p>

The ISBDCN played an important role during Fiscal Year 1995 in supporting the White House Conference on Small Business, held in Washington D.C. in June 1995.  The conference, which offered small business people an opportunity to voice their concerns and ideas for improving the strength of the nation's small business climate, was attended by a 67-member delegation from Illinois, which included 44 delegates elected at Illinois conferences held in August 1994 and April 1995, as well as 23 delegates appointed by Gov. Edgar and members of the Illinois Congressional Delegation.<p>

Another major effort undertaken by the ISBDCN in Fiscal Year 1995 was a partnership with the QVC television shopping network.  Working with QVC's national campaign to showcase products from each of the 50 states, the ISBDCN and DCCA's Illinois Bureau of Tourism organized a statewide competition to identify local and regional products to be featured on a special QVC program focusing on Illinois.  Nearly 500 Illinois vendors took part in the competition that resulted in selection of 20 products and five alternates to be featured on the nationally-televised program.<p>   


<a name="Women"><hr></a>
<h3>Office of Women's Business Development</h3>

The Office of Women's Business Development sponsors and implements a wide range of programs for women business owners active in domestic and international markets.  Staffed by the Illinois Women's Business Advocate and the Women's Business Liaison, the office promotes greater understanding of the women's business community, with special emphasis on minority women's business issues and development of a comprehensive database on women business owners.  The Office works with individual companies, corporations and professional associations to help women entrepreneurs tackle the wide range of challenges they may encounter in their businesses.  The Office serves as a conduit to business resources throughout the state, providing information, referral and procurement assistance for women business owners in Illinois.  It also provides administrative support to the Illinois Women's Business Ownership Council.<p>


<a name="Minority"><hr></a>
<h3>Office of Minority Business Development</h3>

The Office of Minority Business Development works to enhance the impact of minority business entrepreneurs by promoting greater understanding of business issues affecting minority businesses.  The Office is staffed by two minority business advocates, including a bilingual liaison to the Hispanic business community.  These advocates work closely with local minority business councils, as well as through a statewide mentoring program implemented through the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network.<p>


<a name="First Stop"><hr></a>
<h3>First-Stop Business Information Center of Illinois</h3>

Development of the ambitious First-Stop Business Information Center of Illinois continued in Fiscal Year 1995.  The Center is being designed as a statewide program to enhance the state's business climate by making it easier for Illinois businesses to deal with state requirements.  The Center will provide businesses with easy access to the information and services they require to be more competitive, including information on permitting, licensing and regulatory procedures, as well as links to other resources.  Besides providing access to trained information specialists, the Center will provide information through hard-copy booklets, computerized services on the Access Illinois bulletin board and the World Wide Web, and a toll-free telephone service.<p>  


<a name="AI"><hr></a>
<h3>Access Illinois</h3>

During Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA continued its efforts to make its products and services more accessible through communications technology.  As a charter subscriber to the Access Illinois computerized bulletin board, DCCA made its information available to any consumer with a telephone, computer, communications software and a modem.  Among services available on-line:  loan applications, calendars of events, international trade leads, general information on programs and services, a database of Illinois community profiles, and the ability to download or order hard-copies of many DCCA publications.  Access Illinois also includes a number of issue-related forums that allow the exchange of ideas, as well as electronic mail access to the Internet.  DCCA also began working with Access Illinois during Fiscal Year 1995 toward the Fiscal Year 1996 launch of an agency Home Page on the World Wide Web.<p>


<a name="Industrial"><hr></a>
<h3>Industrial Services Division</h3>

The Industrial Services Division assists Illinois businesses by performing on-site safety and health consultations that help firms identify and correct health and safety hazards in the workplace.  In Fiscal Year 1995, the Division completed more than 735 consultations, responded to 4,700 calls for technical assistance, and trained more than 2,700 employers and employees on workplace safety and health.<p>  

In conjunction with the Office of the Governor and the private sector, the Industrial Services Division worked during Fiscal Year 1995 to help coordinate efforts of Project Safe Illinois, an outreach program directed toward the Illinois business community. The goal of Project Safe is to make employers aware of the benefits of workplace safety and health.  Plans were begun to establish a strategy for a 1996 Safety and Health Conference that will offer exhibits and training workshops of interest to the businesses of Illinois.<p>

The Division also has expanded its education and training section to reach out to additional industries with information on safety and health management, confined space entry, chemical exposure, ergonomics, machinery guarding, blood-borne pathogens, tuberculosis and many other related subjects of concern to Illinois industries.<p>  

The Division will continue to provide information and assistance on new regulations and workplace hazards to those industries that request, primarily concentrating on the Illinois small business community.<p>


<a name="Loan"><hr></a>
<h3>Loan Administration Division</h3>

DCCA's Loan Administration Division consolidates all agency business loan programs in one place, lessening confusion for loan applicants.  Division staffers also provide fiscal analyses for many of DCCA's grant programs.  During Fiscal Year 1995, the Division analyzed 105 applications totaling $36.8 million.  Included among the applications were 16 Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) applications totaling $9.5 million, seven Business Development Public Infrastructure applications totaling $3.1 million, 61 applications for assistance through the Industrial Training Program (ITP) totaling $19.75 million, and 19 applications for assistance through the Small Business Development Program/Participation Loan Program totaling $4.26 million.<p>

Primarily, the Division focuses its efforts on management of the Participation Loan Program that provides assistance to Illinois small businesses through participation in loans made through financial intermediaries.  During Fiscal Year 1995, 13 Participation Loans were funded totaling $2.9 million.  The projects resulted in the creation and retention of more than 1,458 jobs and stimulated private sector investment of approximately $15.3 million.<p>

The Division also administers the Community Development Corporation Program through establishing bank-driven Community Development Corporations (CDCs).  These CDCs enable DCCA to provide matching-grant funding to help finance the establishment of initial lending pools.  DCCA is committed to the continued establishment of CDCs and makes financial assistance available to them through participation in their loans to qualified local businesses when that funding demonstrates a positive impact on the competitiveness of the firms and the number of jobs they create.  In Fiscal Year 1995, four new CDCs were formed with DCCA's assistance, bringing the total number of CDCs operating in Illinois to 39.  DCCA made 10 grants to CDCs totaling $583,000.  CDCs capitalized by DCCA financed 16 projects utilizing $294,000 in DCCA funds.  These loans stimulated private sector investment of approximately $8.2 million and resulted in the creation of 311 jobs and retention of 169 jobs. <p> 

During Fiscal Year 1995, the Division initiated the Contractor Bond Guaranty Program designed to assist small and disadvantaged Illinois contractors and subcontractors to obtain bid, payment and performance bonds through surety companies.  DCCA entered into a financial intermediary agreement with the First Illinois Development Credit Corporation to administer the program.  By the end of the fiscal year, the program was up and running with two contractors having successfully secured contracts totaling $740,000 that were guaranteed by $267,000 in DCCA funds.<p>


<a name="International"><hr></a>
<h3>International Business Division</h3>

DCCA's International Business Division (IBD) helps Illinois firms develop their export capabilities and assists foreign companies in expanding or locating in the state.  The IBD focuses its efforts on exploring and expanding opportunities for Illinois businesses in foreign markets, thus increasing the opportunities for their success in an increasingly global economy.<p>

DCCA's IBD provides assistance to Illinois exporters through a three-tiered export infrastructure that includes local, state and overseas resources.  Among those:<p>

<dl><dd>
 Five International Trade Centers (ITCs) located throughout the state that assist Illinois businesses in their efforts to achieve success in the export marketplace.  These centers, located at the College of DuPage in Glen Ellyn, Bradley University in Peoria, NORBIC in Chicago, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, provide one-on-one counseling to potential Illinois exporters and are a component of the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network.  The Centers at NORBIC and Bradley University are also NAFTA Opportunity Centers that specialize in assisting Illinois businesses to achieve success in the Canadian and Mexican marketplaces.<p>

 The IBD's Chicago headquarters, staffed by trade specialists with international expertise in regional markets, provides assistance to companies with specific needs related to doing business in Europe, the Far East, Canada and Latin America.  Regional marketing specialists in Chicago also coordinate a number of activities and programs to assist Illinois exporters, including international trade shows and missions, catalog shows, a trade lead program, and the Illinois Export Alliance.<p>

 International resources, including six foreign trade offices located in Brussels, Belgium; Hong Kong; Tokyo, Japan; Warsaw, Poland; Budapest, Hungary; and Mexico City, Mexico.  These offices assist Illinois companies in identifying and securing in-country business partners, distribution channels and market intelligence.  The foreign trade offices also assist foreign investors and buyers seeking Illinois products and services or site locations in Illinois.<p>
</dd></dl>

During Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA's International Business Division:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li> Assisted 27 Illinois exhibitors at foreign trade shows, generating $500,000 in immediate sales with projected 12-month increased sales of more than $9.3 million.<p>
<li> Provided international marketing assistance to 600 Illinois companies.<p>
<li> Represented 534 companies at catalog shows, identifying more than 5,272 foreign trade leads for Illinois companies.<p>
<li> Co-sponsored more than 55 export development seminars, conferences or workshops attended by more than 4,500 participants.<p>
</ul>


In Calendar Year 1994, Illinois exports grew from $21.9 billion to $26.4 billion.  Illinois' export growth rate of 20.2 percent between 1993 and 1994 was six times greater than the national export growth rate of 10.2 percent, and moved the state up to fifth place in direct exports, marking the second consecutive year the state's ranking has improved.<p>

Illinois' top six trading partners in 1994 and the dollar value of those exports:<p>

<dl><dd>
 Canada  - $6.3 billion<br>
 Japan   - $2.2 billion<br>
 Mexico  - $2.0 billion<br>
 United Kingdom - $1.3 billion<br>
 Germany - $1.3 billion<br>
 China   - $1.0 billion<p>
</dd></dl>

In Calendar Year 1994, Illinois' leading export categories and their dollar value included:<p>

<dl><dd>
 Industrial Machinery/Computer Equipment - $7.2 billion<br>
 Electric Machinery - $5.1 billion<br>
 Chemical Products - $3.7 billion<br>
 Transportation Equipment - $1.7 billion<br>
 Food Products - $1.3 billion<br>
 Agricultural Products - $1.2 billion<br>
 Instruments - $993 million<p>
</dd></dl>

The importance of the IBD's efforts is best illustrated by a look at the importance of exporting to the Illinois economy.  It is estimated that more than 668,000 Illinoisans are employed in jobs sustained by direct or indirect exports, with 248,000 Illinois workers employed by foreign-owned companies with locations in the state.  One in four manufacturing jobs and one in eight jobs in Illinois are dependent upon exports.  Additionally, every dollar of Illinois exports generates $.04 in state tax revenue.<p>

<h3>Job Training Partnership Act</h3>

Through the federally-funded Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), jobless and disadvantaged Illinois workers are provided with retraining, readjustment and supportive services designed to provide them with opportunities to become productive members of society.  JTPA programs assist workers dislocated from their jobs, and help economically-disadvantaged youths and adults, older workers and others who face barriers to employment.<p>

As the state agency administering the JTPA programs in Illinois, DCCA works closely with a network of local administering agencies to operate a comprehensive system of services to respond to the changing work force development environment.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA continued its partnership with the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES) to develop new ways to deliver services more effectively.  In addition, the partnership expanded to include the Illinois Department of Public Aid and the Illinois Community College Board.  A primary component of that strategy is development of a network of One-Stop Career Centers (OSCCs) throughout the state, in which employment and training services will be consolidated under one roof.  These centers will allow clients to file for unemployment compensation benefits, register with the Job Service, and access JTPA-funded training and a variety of other services to help the individual enter or re-enter the labor force.  They also will provide business seeking qualified workers with streamlined services, and prepare specific training plans that tailor training, education and work force preparation programs to meet the needs of area employers.<p>  

In September 1994, Gov. Jim Edgar participated in ceremonies announcing more than $1.1 million in planning grants to develop 16 One-Stop Career Centers in Illinois.  By March 1995, when Director Dennis Whetstone participated in grand opening ceremonies at the Decatur Employment and Training Center, that number had grown to $1.7 million in planning grants, with projections for 40 regional OSCCs throughout the state.  In the later months of Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA submitted its application to the U. S. Department of Labor (USDOL) to fund a three-year project to speed up implementation of the network.  (In early Fiscal Year 1996, DCCA received word that the USDOL had selected Illinois as one of seven states chosen to implement the Network.  Illinois received a grant of nearly $6.7 million to fund activities during the first year of the three-year project, with a total of $16.7 million available over the three year period.  With the federal assistance, Illinois now plans to establish 55 full-service centers and 93 satellite centers around the state.)<p>

DCCA continued to serve as an active member of the state's Education-to-Careers Steering Committee during Fiscal Year 1995.  The Steering Committee membership was expanded to include not only representatives from state government, but also local educators at the secondary and postsecondary levels, business partners, and organized labor.  The Steering Committee is under the leadership of the office of Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, with a private sector facilitator.<p>

The Committee is coordinating the organization of local Education-to-Careers partnerships around community college boundaries.  It developed a marketing notebook that will be distributed to local partnerships, and members of the Steering Committee participated in numerous conferences and workshops on school-to-work initiatives.  The Committee is finalizing learner and system goals for the local partnerships to consider during their planning period.  Minimum planning grants will be issued to each partnership when it is appropriately constituted and an application is received.  The work of the Steering Committee will be summarized in a report and forwarded to the Human Resource Investment Council for subsequent action.<p>  

The Illinois Job Training Coordinating Council (IJTCC), a 50-member advisory body to the Governor and General Assembly on workforce preparation and development issues, continued a project to develop a long-term agenda for workforce preparation activities in Illinois.  The IJTCC has focused its efforts on assessing Illinois' future occupational needs and prospects, defining goals, establishing criteria and identifying and fostering the required information flows for policy coordination.  DCCA managed the project during Fiscal Year 1995.<p>  

For Fiscal Year 1995 Illinois received $46,291,769 to fund JTPA Title III programs.  These funds enabled DCCA to provide job training assistance to 23,339 dislocated workers.  Out of 9,731 dislocated workers terminated from the program, 7,350 re-entered the labor force at an average wage of $10.19 per hour after receiving Title III assistance.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, $25,205,560 was made available under JTPA Title IIC, the Year-Round Youth Program, to support programs and services for economically disadvantaged and at-risk young people ages 14 to 21.  Of these program participants, 2,701 became employed.<p>

DCCA continued its efforts to help economically disadvantaged adults.  In Fiscal Year 1995, JTPA Title IIA programs served 15,010 participants statewide.  An additional 1,237 older individuals were served through the JTPA Title IIA Set-Aside Program for this population.  Of the 8,929 adults who finished the Title IIA program, 4,946 entered employment with an average wage at placement of $7.50 per hour.  Underlining the importance of the program, 4,166 of Title IIA participants were public assistance recipients; out of 3,081 terminating from the program, 1,456 entered employment.<p>


<a name="Industrial Training"><hr></a>
<h3>Industrial Training Program</h3>

The state-funded Industrial Training Program (ITP) is recognized as a vital component of DCCA's overall effort to ensure that Illinois companies are competitive in a global economy and that the skills of Illinois' workforce remain among the highest in the world.  A skilled work force enables companies to respond to the productivity, cost and quality requirements demanded by its customers.<p>

In Fiscal Year 1995, ITP training funds were an integral component of many of the Industry Development projects outlined in this report, including DeMert & Dougherty, Motorola, SMF, Simonton Building Products, Knapheide Manufacturing Company, Honeywell's Micro Switch Division and Cotter & Company.  In addition, ITP training funds were used to assist with many previously-announced retention, expansion and location projects, including 3M Company, American Steel Foundries, General Tire, Kraft General Foods, Magnet, Nabisco, tesa tuck and Tootsie Roll.  As a result of these projects and others, ITP grants assisted with the training of 1,854 new employees and the retraining and/or skill upgrading of 9,384 existing workers.<p>

Since Fiscal Year 1992, DCCA has worked to develop partnerships with intermediary organizations to encourage the implementation and expansion of multi-company training projects.  These intermediary organizations include statewide business and industry organizations, original equipment manufacturers sponsoring training for employees of their Illinois-based supplier network companies, labor organizations, community colleges and universities.  These programs have proven to be especially beneficial to small and medium-sized companies which often do not have the internal resources -- financial, personnel, expertise and/or technology -- to cost-effectively provide these training programs individually for their employees.<p>  

In Fiscal Year 1995, ITP grants were awarded to the following intermediary organizations:  the Illinois Manufacturers' Association, Management Association of Illinois, Illinois State Chamber of Commerce, Chemical Industry Council of Illinois, Deere & Company, Elgin Community College, Ford Motor Company, Highland Community College, Illinois Cast Metals Association, Society of Plastics Industry, South Suburban Community College, and Valley Industrial Association.  As a result of these grants, 243 new employees and 21,085 existing employees representing 1,278 Illinois companies benefited from training programs.  The type of training conducted varied considerably among the various organizations, ranging from specific technical training, to computerization, to total quality management systems and process reengineering.  There has been an increasing emphasis on training programs related to international and industry quality standards, especially ISO 9000 and QS 9000.<p>

ITP grants also are awarded to individual companies conducting retraining and/or skill upgrading programs for their employees, often in conjunction with the introduction of new equipment or technologies in the workplace.  In Fiscal Year 1995, 21 companies were awarded ITP grants to assist with their training programs benefiting 551 new employees and 5,535 existing employees.<p>

In summary, the $15 million ITP appropriation was used to fund 58 projects benefiting 1,321 companies and 38,652 trainees at an average cost of $310 per trainee.<p>  


<a name="Labor Management"><hr></a>
<h3>Labor-Management Cooperation Program</h3>

The Illinois Labor-Management Cooperation Program promotes positive relations between labor and management and encourages implementation of cooperative labor-management programs at the workplace, industry, regional and state levels.  Numerous studies have found that cooperative work practices have a positive impact on labor relations, productivity and company performance.  Implementation of innovative workplace strategies can contribute significantly to bottom-line profits and improved working conditions.  Based on that concept, increasing such programming in Illinois workplaces would improve labor-management relations and the overall business climate of the state.<p>

The Illinois Labor-Management Cooperation Committee during Fiscal Year 1995 continued efforts to evaluate and enhance the effectiveness of local labor-management committees supported by the Labor-Management Grant Program and to utilize available resources to increase the level of cooperative management programming in Illinois.  During the process, the State Committee found strong support from labor and management for the state's role in developing programs to improve Illinois' labor-management climate.  Steps were taken to expand and strengthen Illinois' local labor-management committee network, increase the visibility of the State Committee and raise awareness about the many benefits derived from cooperative workplace programs.  In its 1995 Report to the Governor and Members of the General Assembly, the State Committee detailed a number of program accomplishments and made recommendations to further enhance Illinois' labor-management climate. <p> 

In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA's Labor-Management Grant Program provided grants totaling $287,800 to support 11 local labor-management councils statewide.  Programs provided by the local councils included educational conferences and workshops, special labor-management recognition and awards events, information dissemination services, specialized training to establish and maintain cooperative workplace initiatives, and various activities to improve communication between labor and management in the communities. <p> 

During Fiscal Year 1995, the State Committee initiated a special award program, Labor-Management Partners:  On the Road to High Performance.  The awards, which recognize labor and management for their efforts to work together toward outstanding workplace performance, were presented to Quaker Oats Company's Danville operations and the American Federation of Grain Millers Local 347; Black Hawk College and the American Federation of Teachers/Illinois Federation of Teachers AFL-CIO Local 1836 in Moline; Keystone Steel & Wire Company and the Independent Steel Workers Alliance in Bartonville; and Shapiro Developmental Center and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 29 in Kankakee.  Winners, who were evaluated using criteria for a High Performance Workplace developed by the U.S. Department of Labor Office of the American Workplace, were recognized with plaques during the statewide Labor-Management Conference held in March 1995.<p>


<a name="Technology">
</a><hr>
<h3>Illinois Technology Grant Program</h3>

Access to technology and modern business practices is one of the major foundations supporting economic growth and business competitiveness.  DCCA's Technology Program focuses on efforts to help businesses become more competitive through technology. <p> 
In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA continued to coordinate Illinois' business modernization efforts with the assistance of a number of Illinois partner organizations.  DCCA utilized a $1.4 million Technology Reinvestment Project grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, in addition to funds from the Illinois Technology Challenge Grant Program to support the state's Coalition for Manufacturing Performance through Technology (COMPETE) initiative.  The mission of COMPETE, an initiative announced by Gov. Jim Edgar in 1994, is to improve the competitiveness of small and mid-sized Illinois manufacturing firms through a statewide network of Manufacturing Extension Centers (MECs) and other support organizations.<p>

Through local MECs and other partners, the state enables firms to directly receive technology advancement and modernization services that they need to increase their productivity and compete on a national and international level.  The regional MECs are staffed with engineers and professionals with practical experience in the manufacturing workplace.  These specialists work with companies to make confidential recommendations for improvements.  With access to a wide array of industry experts and the resources of universities, community colleges and private consultants, the MEC staffers can help companies implement improvement plans and projects they need to enhance their competitiveness.  During Fiscal Year 1995, the network of MECs provided numerous services to Illinois manufacturers, including:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li> 1,055 initial field visits.<p>
<li> 768 firms enrolled for services.<p>
<li> 192 manufacturing assessments and performance benchmarks.<p>
<li> 93 formal service bids.<p>
<li> 100 engineering and technical consulting projects.<p>
</ul>

In directing the Fiscal Year 1995 Technology Challenge Grant Program, DCCA was assisted by The Illinois Coalition and the Governor's Science Advisory Committee.<p>


<a name="CDAP"><hr></a>
<h3>Community Development Assistance Program</h3>

The federally-funded Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) is designed to help smaller Illinois communities meet their housing, infrastructure and economic development needs.  The program, funded through a block grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), provides grants to local units of government in communities with populations of 50,000 or less that are not located within one of the seven urban counties that receive funds directly from HUD.<p>  

During Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA awarded $5.9 million in grants to assist with 14 CDAP economic development projects.  Public facilities projects -- engineering and construction projects associated with improvements to water and sewer systems -- were undertaken in 121 communities with the assistance of $25 million in CDAP grants.  Four emergency public facilities projects were funded with $436,825 in CDAP assistance, and 24 communities shared in $500,000 in CDAP planning grants to help them prepare plans for needed public facilities projects.  Thirty-seven communities were awarded $7 million in CDAP public housing grants to help local homeowners bring their dwellings up to code requirements.  DCCA also provided $4 million in CDAP grants to assist local units of government in removing barriers that limit accessibility to community buildings and services by those with disabilities.<p>

In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA also received $41.2 million in CDAP Supplemental Flood Program assistance to continue to help local governments recover from the devastating effects of the Great Flood of 1993.  These funds, combined with other federal and state funds, have helped communities to develop flood recovery plans, acquire properties located in the floodplain, elevate homes and repair needed infrastructure.<p>  

The Community Development Assistance Program continues to be a chief source of assistance to ensure that the citizens of smaller Illinois communities have safe public water and sewer systems, quality housing stock and the infrastructure necessary to attract and retain businesses and their jobs.<p>   


<a name="Enterprise Zones"><hr></a>
<h3>Enterprise Zones</h3>

Enterprise Zones are designated areas in communities and regions throughout the state that offer a mix of state and local tax incentives, regulatory relief and enhanced government services that make the areas more attractive to businesses and residents.  Illinois currently has certified 91 Enterprise Zones.  In Fiscal Year 1995, companies located within the zones invested more than $1.5 billion.  The investments are projected to create more than 8,000 jobs.<p>


<a name="Public Infrastructure Programs"><hr></a>
<h3>Business Development Public Infrastructure Program</h3>

The Business Development Public Infrastructure Program provides low-interest loans or grants to local governments to make improvements to public infrastructure on behalf of business expansion or retention projects.  The projects must demonstrate job creation and retention potential.  Funds may be used for a variety of public infrastructure improvements, such as access roads, extending water and sewer lines, and water and sewage treatment facilities.  In Fiscal Year 1995, $1.3 million was provided to three communities to fund infrastructure improvements associated with projects expected to create and retain more than 700 jobs.<p>


<a name="Affordable Financing"><hr></a>
<h3>Affordable Financing of Public Infrastructure Program - Small Project Loan Component</h3>

This program brings together DCCA, the Illinois Rural Bond Bank, the Illinois Development Finance Authority, and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency to provide financial assistance to or on behalf of local governments, public entities, medical facilities and public health clinics for the purpose of making affordable the financing of infrastructure needed to ensure public health and safety and economic development.  The program's Small Project Loan Component can provide up to $100,000 for a maximum of 10 years at an attractive interest rate.  Funds may be used for acquisition, construction and improvements of public facilities and associated equipment.<p>  


<a name="Local Initiatives"><hr></a>
<h3>Office of Local Initiatives</h3>

The Office of Local Initiatives often is the first point of contact for local officials seeking DCCA assistance.  Serving as the outreach arm for DCCA's Bureau of Community Development, the office helps local community leaders find the information, resources and technical assistance they need to find solutions to local problems. <p>

The Office of Local Initiatives administers the Competitive Communities Initiative (CCI), a program designed to serve as a catalyst to teach communities to think and act strategically, ultimately resulting in improved competitiveness.  Based on the belief that communities are themselves in the best position to positively affect their own futures, CCI provides a format and the necessary technical assistance to complete the critical first step toward competitiveness -- a community self-assessment of the foundations of growth.<p>  

During Fiscal Year 1995, the Office of Local Initiatives worked with 19 CCI communities identified as being in the initial stages of development to help them undertake self-assessments and take steps to become more competitive.<p>  

The Office of Local Initiatives also oversees the mandates review process required by the General Assembly.<p>  
 

<a name="Local Govt Management"><hr></a>
<h3>Office of Local Government Management Services</h3>

The Office of Local Government Management Services provides assistance to local governments by providing training to local officials on financial issues, responding to questions about the duties of local officials, and providing direct one-on-one technical assistance on matters of particular importance to local government officials.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, the Office conducted or participated in 51 training sessions, meeting the training needs of more than 3,100 elected and appointed local government officials.  The training sessions are designed to address a broad range of financial management issues facing local governments, such as  revenue sources, property taxes, preparing and maintaining a balanced budget, statutory duties of local officials and ways local governments can plan and finance needed improvements to infrastructure.  Training sessions were conducted by DCCA staffers, as well as by DCCA staffers working with partners from the Illinois Municipal League, the Illinois Municipal Clerks Association, the Illinois Municipal Treasurers Institute, the University of Illinois, Governor's State University, Western Illinois University, Eastern Illinois University, Township Officials of Illinois, the Illinois Farm Bureau, and a number of county-based local government organizations.<p>

The Office also responded to more than 1,100 telephone calls from local officials on a variety of issues, and distributed nearly 10,500 publications on topics of interest to local officials, such as revenue sources, budgeting procedures, capital improvement planning and budgeting, computer information, local purchasing, and personnel procedures.  In addition, the Office conducted 82 direct technical assistance projects for local governments to help them enhance their financial stability.  Technical assistance was provided through one-on-one direction to improve accounting systems, budget procedures, revenue projections, preparation of revenue and expenditure reports, and water user rate studies.<p>  


<a name="Housing Office"><hr></a>
<h3>Housing Office</h3>

DCCA's Housing Office administers two programs designed to help low- and moderate-income families live in decent, affordable housing.  The Rental Rehab Program provides funds to eligible units of local government to help rehabilitate privately-owned units for occupation by income-eligible families.  The federally-funded Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program provides incentives to private property owners to upgrade their properties for use by eligible renters.  In Fiscal Year 1995, $282,383 in Rental Rehab funds leveraged with $401,268 in private funds resulted in the rehabilitation of 72 units serving 200 low-income people.  Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation funds provided $1,154,600 in rental assistance to 813 people living in units supported by the funds.<p>

DCCA's Housing Office also administers the federally-funded Emergency Shelter Grant Program (ESGP), which assists homeless people to make the transition from poverty to productivity.  In Fiscal Year 1995, the ESGP served more than 50,075 homeless people.<p>  

The Housing Office also works closely with the Governor's Office and the Office of the Lieutenant Governor to administer the annual Governor's Home Town Awards Program.  The program, which promotes volunteerism in Illinois, awards road signs and plaques to communities and organizations that demonstrate outstanding volunteer efforts.  The 14th Annual Governor's Home Town Awards competition drew applications from more than 100 communities.  Awards were given to 65 communities, with Tamms receiving the Governor's Cup as the project most representative of the spirit of volunteerism.  The 1995 awards program also saw special plaques awarded to seven communities for volunteer efforts associated with re-enactments of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, which were televised on C-SPAN.<p>


<a name="Community Service Block Grant"><hr></a>
<h3>Community Services Block Grant Program</h3>

Funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Community Services Block Grant Program (CSBG) is administered in Illinois by DCCA.  Funds are awarded to the state's network of 36 Community Action Agencies (CAAs) to help low-income people achieve self-sufficiency and to provide services designed to address the causes and conditions of poverty.  These services take many forms, from scholarships, to loans to businesses that employ low-income people, to providing emergency assistance to pay for food, shelter and clothing.<p>

The CSBG Loan Program provides long-term, fixed rate financing to new and expanding Illinois businesses.  The loans link federal, state and private financing by combining low-interest CSBG loans with bank funds.  Businesses receiving CSBG loans agree to create jobs for low-income individuals.  In Fiscal Year 1995, CSBG loans made to 57 small businesses resulted in the creation of 252 jobs and generated an additional $12.38 million in leveraged private investment.<p> 

The CSBG Scholarship Program assists low-income high school, vocational school or college students who show academic promise and potential in high technology or growth fields of study.  Preference is also given to low-income and disadvantaged racial or ethnic minorities who plan to enter either a two-year or four-year college, university or vocational school in Illinois.  Created in response to CSBG's mandate that funds be used to help low-income people receive adequate education, the scholarships can support tuition costs; textbooks, supplies and fees; room and board expenses; and transportation and child care.  The CSBG scholarship program is administered by the network of Community Action Agencies, the Illinois Migrant Council and the Illinois Community Action Association.  In Fiscal Year 1995, 417 scholarships totaling $464,355 were awarded.<p>

The CSBG Emergency Community Services Homeless Program is also administered by the Community Action Agencies.  The program funds such services as emergency shelter, counseling, food, clothing, medicine, rent and educational assistance needed by the homeless.  During Fiscal Year 1995, $960,931 in CSBG Emergency Community Services Homeless Program funds were allocated to serve 5,892 clients.<p>  


<a name="Energy Asst"><hr></a>
<h3>Energy Assistance and Weatherization Programs</h3>

Economic development is more than business development.  It also means ensuring that all Illinois citizens share in the benefits of a strong economy.  Through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and the Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program (IHWAP), DCCA works to make sure that  low-income Illinoisans can live in safe, comfortable, energy-efficient homes.<p>

The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is funded through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and provides funds to help low-income people pay a portion of their winter energy costs.  Administered throughout the state by a network of Community Action Agencies or community-based organizations, the funds are provided to energy vendors on behalf of households that pay for their energy directly, as well as to households whose energy costs are included in their rent.  Emergency assistance is also available to qualified households to help restore energy services that have been cut off.  In Fiscal Year 1995, LIHEAP served 201,582 Illinois households.<p>  

The Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program (IHWAP) helps low-income Illinoisans reduce the costs of energy by helping to fund improvements such as insulation, caulking and weather-stripping, heating system repairs and retrofits.  Administered by DCCA and operated by Community Action Agencies or community-based organizations, IHWAP funds are targeted particularly toward senior citizens and people with disabilities who are often on fixed incomes and cannot afford high fuel costs nor the repairs needed to keep energy bills down.  In Fiscal Year 1995, 6,992 Illinois households were served by IHWAP assistance.<p>

<FONT SIZE=+3>1995 Annual Report: Bureau of Tourism</FONT>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<HR>
<p>

DCCA's Illinois Bureau of Tourism maximizes the state's competitive positioning as a destination for business and leisure travel by shaping public and private initiatives into an integrated marketing program that promotes the state with a unified strategy and a consistent message.  The Bureau's primary goal is to leverage travel revenues for the benefit of the travel industry, state and local government, the state economy and the citizens of Illinois.  The Bureau's marketing also produces secondary benefits in terms of Illinois' general public profile, including its desirability as a business and residential location.<p>

In Fiscal Year 1995, the Illinois Bureau of Tourism built on its past successes to take the marketing of Illinois as a tourism destination to new levels.  Strategic alliances with public and private-sector partners leveraged the Bureau's effectiveness in promoting Illinois tourism in both U.S. and international markets.<p>  

Domestic and international tourism revenues in Illinois reached a record $15.9 billion during Calendar Year 1994.  Visitors primarily spent their funds on transportation, lodging, food, entertainment, recreation and incidentals.  Calendar Year 1994 tourism revenues represented a 6.3 percent increase over the previous year, making it the tenth year in a row that Illinois tourism revenue growth has outpaced that of the U.S. as a whole.  During the same period, tourism growth for the United States was only 4.9 percent.  Illinois continued to rank fifth in domestic travel spending among the states.<p>

Growth was even stronger in terms of the number of trips taken to or within Illinois.  A total of 50.5 million domestic leisure trips represented a growth rate of 10 percent over Calendar Year 1993.  More than 1.4 million international visitors spent $1.1 billion.  Just under one million international arrivals originated overseas.  Tourism contributed $995 million in local and state taxes and generated a payroll of $4.8 billion, supporting 241,500 jobs in the state.<p>

In Fiscal Year 1995, the Bureau conducted an integrated marketing program designed to identify and reach the state's most likely tourism customers.  The advertising component positioned Illinois as the ideal weekend getaway destination, promoting the new theme, "Illinois:  A Million Miles from Monday."  Advertising and public relations strategies also heavily promoted the Bureau's new toll-free information number, 1-800-2CONNECT.  Innovative use of television and print media built recognition and momentum during the prime summer season and paved the way for a major off-season campaign targeted for FY 1996.  International marketing efforts expanded, primarily targeting Canada and selected European markets.<p>

The Bureau launched a state-of-the-art Illinois Travel Counseling System, which enables consumers for the first time to call a toll-free number and speak with a trained tourism counselor, who answers questions and sends a customized itinerary to the customer via fax, on-line computer services or mail.  The system allows unprecedented flexibility and customization thanks to a multi-million-word database of statewide tourism information that is constantly updated to reflect new and changed attractions, seasonally-related events and other new data.  Monitoring of telephone inquiry statistics enables the Bureau to adapt its marketing to up-to-the-minute consumer demand trends and respond to advertising and public relations strategies.  When the system opened it was only the second such state travel information service in the U.S.  With the system, the Illinois tourism industry -- attractions, lodgings, restaurants, museums, recreational areas, as well as cities, towns, counties and regions -- has a new and powerful means to tell its stories to those consumers who are most likely to travel.<p>

The marketing program was launched by Gov. Jim Edgar at a high-profile news conference on April 21, 1995 in Chicago.  Chicago Tribune columnist Bob Greene called the new advertising campaign "as insightful as any I've ever seen."  Coverage by major media was pivotal in spreading the word about the advertising and introducing the Travel Counseling System to the traveling public.  The Fiscal Year 1995 marketing program also included special outreach to the African-American and Hispanic communities.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, the Bureau multiplied its effectiveness by forming working partnerships with public and private tourism entities.  The Bureau provided public relations support to the Lincoln-Douglas debate reenactment series that was sponsored by the cable network C-SPAN and held live in seven Illinois towns.<p>

The Bureau expanded its partnership with the City of Chicago and the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority in supporting Illinois Market Place at Navy Pier, a unique, self-supporting shop that sells Illinois products as it promotes statewide tourism.  The Bureau also lent its expertise and personnel to two vitally important tourism meetings, the Illinois White House Conference on Travel and Tourism and the Illinois Governor's Conference on Tourism, as well as preparations for the national White House Conference on Tourism, the first-ever national forum for the tourism industry.<p>

Another Bureau innovation was the Sports Marketing Program.  During Fiscal Year 1995, the Sports Marketing team held seminars for most of the convention and visitors bureaus in Illinois, leading them through the process of creating local and regional sports commissions, evaluating potential sports events sites, bringing in sporting events, and publicizing those events.  The Bureau created a "how-to" kit that is being used by regions, cities and towns to develop their own sports marketing efforts.<p>

The Bureau also targeted prime international markets by working with Hill & Knowlton public relations offices in London, Frankfort and Ontario, and representative firms in the United Kingdom and Germany who work with tourism representatives, the Bureau and Hill & Knowlton.<p>

A Bureau-sponsored series of tourism packaging seminars held across the state for members of the travel industry helped participants learn the secrets of cooperative tourism marketing through such topics as market identification, creative packaging techniques, pricing, packaging for groups and tour operations, value-added programming and development of balanced itineraries.  The seminars led to the development of 97 vacation packages in Illinois and were culminated by publishing of Great Getaways in Illinois, which lists those vacation packages.<p>    

Other Fiscal Year 1995 Bureau publications included a new and expanded Illinois Visitors Guide 1995 and the first year-round edition of the Illinois Calendar of Events.  Illinois Tourism by the Numbers, a summary of tourism's economic impact on the state, was distributed at the Illinois Governor's Conference on Tourism in January 1995, and provided to the media and legislators.  Bureau publications were enhanced with completion of a major photo shoot that generated more than 1,000 new color images of state tourism attractions and locations.  The photo library is made available to the media as a means of encouraging more press coverage for Illinois destinations.<p>  

To enhance its mission of communicating with the state tourism industry, the Bureau created a quarterly report, Illinois Tourism News, with a new design and editorial content that keeps the Bureau's partners in touch with the latest tourism developments.  The newsletter was slated for bi-monthly publication beginning in Fiscal Year 1996.<p>  

The Illinois Bureau of Tourism also continued to administer grant programs designed to help enhance tourism opportunities around the state.  In Fiscal Year 1995, the Bureau coordinated and awarded 151 Tourism Matching Grants totaling $1,450,000.  These grants pay a portion of the costs of promotional materials designed to attract tourists to various sites and events.  The Bureau also awarded 31 Tourism Attraction Development Grants totaling $1,063,443 to help renovate and develop tourist attractions; and eight Tourism Private Sector Grants totaling $1,840,000 which were matched by private sector contributions to help attract world-class tourism opportunities to Illinois.  In addition, the Bureau awarded $8 million to 35 local tourism and convention bureaus to help them coordinate tourism efforts in their areas.<p>

The Illinois Film Office, a part of the Illinois Bureau of Tourism, provides technical assistance to film, television and commercial production companies to help them scout locations and find production and support services in Illinois.  The Office also acts as a liaison for businesses, communities, government and labor.  In Fiscal Year 1995, it was estimated that a portion or all of 26 productions generated $21 million in direct cash revenues to the state.  Based on a state General Revenue Fund budget of $475,000, Illinois realized a $45 return on each dollar allocated to the Illinois Film Office.<p>

DCCA's Bureau of Administration is responsible for the agency's fiscal and
operational functions.  The Division of Fiscal Management includes the
Accounting Office, the Expenditure Planning and Control Office and the
Budget Office.  The Division of Agency Services includes the Office of
Human Resources, the Office of Management Operations and the Office of
Information Resource Management (OIRM).  The Deputy Director of
Administration is also responsible for the activities of the Financial
Commitment Committee, maintaining its master files, meeting minutes and
other paperwork.<p>

<h3>Division of Fiscal Management</h3>

The Division of Fiscal Management is responsible for DCCA's financial and
budgetary operations.  The Division's three offices include the Budget
Office, the Expenditure Planning and Control Office, and the Accounting
Office.  These offices provide vital links in serving the needs of DCCA's
bureaus and programs.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, the Expenditure Planning and Control Office
developed and implemented a pilot program at DCCA that is designed to save
the state thousands of dollars in interest liabilities each year while
reducing paperwork and speeding payments to those receiving state
assistance.  The program, developed by DCCA staffers in partnership with
staffers from the Office of the Comptroller, enables DCCA to send grant
vouchers electronically to the Comptroller's Office and have the payments
electronically deposited directly into grantees' bank accounts.<p>

This action was spurred by the federal Cash Management Improvement Act
(CMIA) that requires states to minimize federal cash on deposit.  Under
CMIA guidelines, the state must pay interest from the moment the federal
funds reach it until the check is cashed and actually clears the treasury.
By reducing the time these funds are kept on deposit, the state's CMIA
liability is reduced.  In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA realized related savings
of $15,340 by using the pilot electronic vouchering program for grants
subject to CMIA.  DCCA estimates a related savings of more than $150,000 in
Fiscal Year 1996.<p>

Another plus for the new electronic deposit process is an improvement in
the timeframe for processing cash payments.  It enables grantees to receive
funds in about one week as opposed to the three weeks averaged under the
prior manual system.  The success of the pilot program has led DCCA to
expand the process to all programs administered by the Department.  DCCA
staffers also are providing assistance to other state agencies interested
in adopting the process.<p>

In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA's Budget Office was successful in its efforts to
help obtain increased levels of funding for the agency's Tourism,
International Business, Weatherization and Industrial Services programs for
Fiscal Year 1996.  The Budget Office also played a key role in preparing
for the July 1, 1995 transfer to DCCA of the duties and responsibilities of
the Department of Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) Offices of Energy
Conservation and Alternative Energy, and Coal Marketing and Development,
brought about through Executive Order Number Two.  Through the legislative
appropriation process, the Office of Recycling and Waste Management also
transferred from ENR to DCCA.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, electronic cost reporting and payment request
submissions became reality for DCCA subgrant administrators participating
in the pilot Grant Reporting System program.  The efforts were coordinated
by DCCA's Accounting Office.  The test was successfully completed and
support equipment was installed to enable dial-in communications via local
personal computers.  DCCA expects to begin expanding the system to other
subgrantee sites and to extend utilization to additional DCCA programs late
in Fiscal Year 1996.<p>


<a name="Agency Services"><hr></a>
<h3>Division of Agency Services</h3>

<a name="Human Resources"><br></a>
<h4>Office of Human Resources</h4>

During Fiscal Year 1995, the Office of Human Resources processed more than
650 transactions for agency employees.  Office staff reviewed more than 165
files to ensure compliance with the Rutan decision in agency hiring
practices.  The files were found to be in good order when pre-audited by
staff from the Illinois Department of Central Management Services.  The
Office also was involved in ensuring a smooth transition for staffers of
the former Illinois Department of Energy and Natural Resources who became
DCCA employees as a result of the agency consolidation ordered by Gov.
Edgar.<p>

Ongoing services provided by the Office of Human Resources during Fiscal
Year 1995 included announcements of training available to employees,
assistance with insurance and payroll concerns, and services provided to
citizens of Illinois and surrounding states regarding employment
opportunities with the State of Illinois.<p>

<a name="Management Operations"><br></a>
<h4>Office of Management Operations</h4>

The Office of Management Operations provides support to DCCA, including
facility management, printing and graphic services, publication management
and distribution, the Illinois Business Hotline, property control,
purchasing and mail/messenger services.<p>

In Fiscal Year 1995, Management Operations facilitated the upgrading of
several agency motor pool vehicles, thus ensuring access to safe,
reasonably-priced transportation for DCCA personnel operating in the field.
The Office processed 3,197 purchase requisitions for DCCA's goods and
negotiated and maintained more than 50 service and maintenance agreements.
Mail and messenger services processed in excess of 400,000 pieces of mail
and completed more than 2,821 special deliveries in and around Springfield.<p>

Management Operations also upgraded its in-house printing plant.  The new
equipment will enable the printshop to meet the growing demand for
professionally prepared brochures and publications that support the
agency's programs and projects.  The Graphics Unit processed more than 435
work orders including complete in-house development and production of
program reports and the agency's Annual Report.  The in-house printing
plant produced nearly nine million impressions in response to 663 work
orders.  The unit also prepared more than 11 customized presentation
booklets for use in response to inquiries from various businesses and
industries.<p>

The Information and Distribution Center handled more than 180 work orders
involving more than 340,000 pieces of material for distribution.  Although
approximately 90,000 pieces were handled by in-house staff, handling
250,000 pieces as bulk mail through a contract mail house saved thousands
of dollars in postage.  The Information and Distribution Center provided
more than 10,000 labels and listings to partners from outside the agency,
responded to more than 15,000 school children from around the world who
requested information on Illinois, and prepared and mailed more than 3,600
general tourism packets in response to written requests.<p>

The warehouse rebuilt shelving and restructured record storage allowing for
more effective utilization of space.<p>

<a name="Information Resource Management"><br></a>
<h4>Office of Information Resource Management</h4>

In Fiscal Year 1995, DCCA entered the world of E-mail and automation via
the Local Area Network (LAN) arena.  Implementation of the LAN-based
environment began early in Fiscal 1994 and, by the conclusion of Fiscal
Year 1995, approximately half of DCCA's staff were part of the new
environment.<p>

DCCA's shift during Fiscal Year 1995 into technological high gear has led
to consideration of the productivity gains possible from utilizing office
suite packages, the Internet, and Geographical Information Systems (GIS),
enhanced communications and information exchange, geographical presentation
of information and to transient computing and communications.<p>

During the fiscal year, OIRM completed projects providing computer support
for Fiscal Management systems, provided the general computer support for
the CMS host mainframe system, including IHWAP and LIHEAP energy systems,
and was involved in the planning of JTPA system changes.<p>

OIRM continues to focus on:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li> providing an improved level of responsiveness and technical support for
the DCCA LAN and CMS host-based environments.<p>
<li> providing timely development and maintenance of the computer systems and
applications.<p>
<li> providing recommendations for future products, projects and directions for
DCCA.<p>
</ul>


The solid foundation has now been built that should allow for continued
technological growth, with plans underway to complete the LAN
implementation and move forward to LAN-based applications and systems.<p>

<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<HR>
<p>

DCCA's Division of Policy Development, Planning and Research (PDPR) operates within the Director's Office to identify issues, barriers and opportunities facing the state's economic development efforts; analyze the various alternatives available to address these issues; and assess the results of DCCA's programs and activities.  These services help agency staffers to make informed decisions and assess the future implications of agency decisions, policies and strategies.<p>

Among PDPR's functions:<p>

<ul type=square>
<li> Research, which helps develop and maintain DCCA's information base and conducts various analyses to apply this information to issues faced by DCCA and the state.<p>
<li> Policy Analysis, analyzing programs and policies that impact Illinois economic development.<p>
<li> Planning and Assessment, providing an integrated system of agency management, including implementation of goals, program objectives, operational strategies and evaluation of progress.<p>
<li> Program Development, identifying possible strategies and courses of action to best pursue an opportunity or overcome a barrier.<p>
</ul>

During Fiscal Year 1995, PDPR staff continued many of the efforts begun in Fiscal Year 1994, including flood relief, community development and technology development.  PDPR maintained DCCA's presence in the state's ongoing efforts to help communities and citizens recover from the devastation of the Great Flood of 1993.  PDPR prepared a publication, Proposal Writing:  The Basic Steps in Planning and Writing a Successful Grant Application, and distributed more than 3,000 copies to DCCA constituents.  Staffers also helped prepare an application to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service for a grant to augment the state's Labor-Management program, and developed and distributed the Request for Proposals for Fiscal Year 1995 and Fiscal Year 1996 funding for the Technology Challenge Grant Program.  PDPR conducted best-of-practice analyses on department budget initiative topics, including multi-company networks, local government training, place marketing, brownfields, and tax credit incentives.  PDPR also promulgated rulemakings in nine program areas which were formally adopted through the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules process.<p>

PDPR completed development of the Illinois Industry Analysis System and began preliminary testing of the system.  This system is designed to allow economic development officials to answer commonly asked questions about their most important industries, their largest employers, the types of businesses moving into their regions, the name of the CEO of a local company, etc.  The system also is organized to improve targeting of specific firms for business retention or attraction.  It is based upon Dun & Bradstreet's profile of establishments with a minimum of 10 employees that ever operated within Illinois between 1987 and the present.  Target release of the system is planned for calendar year 1996.<p>

PDPR also provided support to many boards and task forces, serving as DCCA's primary representatives to The Illinois Coalition, a public/private partnership pursuing a coherent, coordinated strategy of economic development through technology; the Illinois Coalition Technology and Jobs Agenda, a blue-ribbon committee charged with laying out a strategic plan to position the state's economy to grow through use of technology; and an interagency task force that wrote administrative rules to implement the Interagency Wetland Policy Act and administers the development of an Illinois Wetlands Comprehensive Strategy.<p>
 
PDPR in Fiscal Year 1995 began work to develop benchmarks to compare Illinois' economic development with other states' efforts.  This was a recommendation of the Illinois Economic Development Board, chaired by Samuel K. Skinner.  In January 1995, Skinner and his 21-member board completed their year-long study of the state's climate for job creation and retention, presenting their report to Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra.  The report made 17 recommendations to help the state refine policies and programs to help businesses grow and prosper, thus providing jobs and improving overall quality of life.<p>

PDPR continued to provide valuable economic information and statistics through the quarterly Illinois Economic Summary and the monthly Illinois Economic Bulletin.  The publications were also made available on-line through the Access Illinois bulletin board system.<p>

<FONT SIZE=+3>1995 Annual Report: Coal Development & Marketing *</FONT>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
<HR>

<p>

DCCA's Office of Coal Development and Marketing (OCDM) supports the research, development, demonstration and commercial application of technologies that offer environmentally safe and economically competitive ways to use Illinois coal for energy generation.  OCDM accomplishes these goals by funding basic and applied research on the characteristics of high-sulfur coal, financing the development and demonstration of advanced technologies for clean coal combustion, and promoting coal awareness and education to the citizens of Illinois.<p>

<a name="Coal Research"><hr></a>
<h3>Coal Research</h3>

Illinois administers the largest state-sponsored coal research program in the United States.  The Coal Research Program, administered by OCDM, and under the technical oversight of the Illinois Clean Coal Institute, is considered to be in the forefront of state coal research programs, nationally and internationally.  In Fiscal Year 1995, OCDM awarded $2,762,947 in state funds and $1,000,000 in federal funds for the completion of 44 coal research projects.<p>

Building on recent research findings, Gov. Jim Edgar signed Senate Bill 327 (Public Act 89-93) into law allowing the beneficial use of coal combustion by-products.  As more clean coal technologies become operational, more potentially useful by-products are generated.  This Act builds on state efforts to remove unnecessary barriers to the use of Illinois coal by providing numerous alternatives for by-product utilization.<p>


<a name="Coal Development"><hr></a>
<h3>Coal Development</h3>

The Coal Development Program provides funds to advance promising new coal research technologies through the proof-of-concept stage to the commercial demonstration stage.  Development processes include technology maturation, technology transfer and related studies.  Priorities for the Development Program are established by tracking key market issues and projecting how technology can take advantage of these issues to increase new markets for Illinois coal.<p>

In Fiscal Year 1995, OCDM awarded $864,655 in state funds for the completion of four development projects.  One project examined the technical and economic feasibility of wheeling electricity from Illinois to neighboring states.  Another provided for a test burn of Illinois coal in an pressurized fluidized bed boiler pilot plant in Finland, paving the way for future demonstration of this technology in Illinois.<p>  


<a name="Coal Demonstration"><hr></a>
<h3>Coal Demonstration</h3>

The State of Illinois has committed nearly $139 million from the Coal and Energy Development Bond Fund for 18 projects over the past 13 years.  To date, this program has attracted $191 million in additional funds from the U.S. Department of Energy and $462 million in public and private investments.  Each of these projects provides near- and long-term benefits to the State of Illinois that include economic growth, cleaner air and energy conservation.<p>

One such significant clean coal technology project is the City of Rochelle micronized coal project.  Coal is micronized by pulverizing it to the consistency of talcum powder.  Micronized coal burned with micronized limestone at Rochelle effectively reduced sulfur emissions by 50 percent and NOx by 40 percent.  The $18 million clean coal technology project was partially funded by a $3.6 million grant from OCDM.<p>

Although coal micronization technology has been used on a smaller scale in the past, the Rochelle demonstration marks its first application as a fuel source for electrical generation by a utility.  Selection of this technology by the U.S. Department of Energy as an outreach project for the Krakow, Poland Clean Fossil Fuels and Energy Efficiency Program advances this technology into the next step of commercialization and paves the way for Illinois to participate in an expanding export market for coal and clean coal technologies.<p>


<a name="Coal Awareness & Education"><hr></a>
<h3>Coal Awareness and Education</h3>

Coal education continued to be a priority for OCDM in Fiscal Year 1995 with the development of an educational activity book, Coal is Cool, for kindergarten through fourth-grade students.  This book and Illinois Coal, the newly-revised guide for teachers in fifth through eighth grades, are now available to educators throughout the state and nation.<p>

OCDM held the annual Energy and the Environment "Words and Pictures About Illinois Coal" art and essay calendar contest to raise coal awareness in schools and homes.  More than 650 fifth- and sixth-grade students throughout the state participated.  Winning pictures and essays were included in 7,000 calendars and posters distributed throughout the state.<p>

As a part of state coal education efforts, Gov. Edgar proclaimed the month of October as "Coal Awareness Month."  Throughout October, OCDM sponsored coal awareness activities that included day-long educational events in Springfield and DuQuoin, distribution of tray liners with coal facts and word puzzles at Wendy's restaurants in central Illinois, and numerous radio and television interviews on the importance of the coal industry to the Illinois economy.<p>

In its everyday activities throughout the year, OCDM responded to numerous requests for information on the Illinois coal industry, coal consumption and uses, and a wide range of miscellaneous energy topics.  To aid in these requests, OCDM maintains databases on the characteristics of Illinois coal, coal production and consumption, industry contacts and many other aspects of the coal industry.<p>


<a name="Coal Development Board"><hr></a>
<h3>Illinois Coal Development Board</h3>

OCDM worked to fulfill many of the legislative mandates of the Illinois Coal Development Board during Fiscal Year 1995.  The Board, appointed by the Governor, reviewed and approved all coal research, development and demonstration projects, and provided oversight of the Coal Technology Development Assistance Fund and Coal and Energy Development Bond Fund.<p>

OCDM prepared and distributed the Illinois Coal Development Board's annual report, Outlook for the Illinois Coal Industry.  Delivered to Gov. Edgar, members of the General Assembly and interested citizens, the report identified strategies to preserve existing markets, develop new markets and uses for high-sulfur coal and to minimize the adverse impact of national environmental policies on the Illinois coal industry and its workers.<p>

<h3>OFFICE OF RECYCLING AND WASTE REDUCTION</h3>


<a name="Materials Recycling"><br></a>
<h4>Materials Recycling Unit</h4>

The goal of the Materials Recycling Unit is to increase the quantity of materials recycled in Illinois and to establish self-sufficiency in the recycling industry.  Since its inception in 1987, the Materials Recycling Unit and Recycling Grants Program have awarded more than $12 million in recycling collection and processing grants to more than 300 applicants.  These grants have leveraged well over $50 million in matching investments.<p>

More than $1 million in state funds were awarded to 22 grant applicants in Fiscal Year 1995.  Funded projects included:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li> A $100,000 grant to help Laidlaw Waste Systems in Rockford develop a modern primary processing recycling facility to service more than 400,000 citizens.  Grant funds are being used to purchase a high-technology baler.  This facility will incorporate state-of-the-art technology, including co-mingled sort lines and a pneumatic baler feed stream to convey sorted plastics and metals to densification equipment.  Five different material streams will be processed at the facility.<p>
<li> A $50,000 grant to the U.S. Postal Service to implement a commercial collection recycling project in its Northern Illinois district.  This project will collect materials from approximately 200 U.S. Post Offices in Northern Illinois.  It is projected that 56 tons will be diverted from landfills each day.<p>
<li> A $44,000 grant to the City of Mattoon to implement a city-wide drop-off project.  Funds were used for the purchase of compartmentalized collection containers and educational materials.  The project features three controlled drop-off sites for the citizens of Mattoon and the surrounding areas.  The City contributed more than $86,000 in matching funds.<p>
</ul>


<a name="Market Development"><br></a>
<h4>Market Development</h4>

The Recycling Market Development Program encourages private-sector investment in the development, manufacture and marketing of products containing recycled materials.  Through this program, more than $1 million in grants and loans were awarded during Fiscal Year 1995, matched by more than $4.5 million in private investment.<p>

Projects funded in Fiscal Year 1995 included:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li> A $90,000 grant to the J. M. Hoffman Company of Joliet.  The grant will help purchase specialized equipment to be used to re-mill salvageable lumber from industrial and commercial buildings being demolished.  The company remanufactures the lumber into high quality decorative paneling and flooring for residential and commercial construction.<p>
<li> Five new projects totaling $130,365 were funded under a legislatively-mandated market development program promoting the use of recycled materials by businesses located in economically depressed areas.  Future Generations in Taylor Springs, Molten Glass in Chicago, Laser Smart in Mt. Carmel, Innovative Components in Arlington Heights, and The Chicago Lighthouse for the Blind were the companies that received grants in Fiscal Year 1995.<p>
<li> The Container Recycling Alliance in Chicago received a $150,000 grant to assist with the purchase of specialized sorting equipment that will be able to optically separate container glass by color.  This new technology, believed to be the first of its type to be used in Illinois, will help eliminate the problem of mixed color broken glass.  The color-sorted glass will be easier to use in the remanufacture of glass containers.<p>
</ul>


<a name="ICAP"><br></a>
<h4>Illinois College Assistance Program (ICAP)</h4>

This program provides Illinois public colleges with technical and financial assistance to support waste education and recycling activities. <p> 

In Fiscal Year 1995, ICAP provided $104,000 to various colleges for planning and implementation grants.  Approximately $1.45 million has been earmarked for grants to these institutions to implement waste reduction plans during Fiscal Year 1996 and Fiscal Year 1997.<p>


<a name="Used Tire Recovery"><br></a>
<h4>Used Tire Recovery</h4>

The Used Tire Recovery Program provides financial assistance to units of government and private industry to identify innovative and cost-effective alternatives to stockpiling and/or landfilling scrap tires.  Grants and loans totaling more than $2.2 million were awarded in Fiscal Year 1995 to projects reusing, processing and recycling discarded tires into new products, such as retreaded and remanufactured tires, tire chip playground material, rubber-modified asphalt and tire-derived fuel.  These funds leveraged an additional $2.39 million for project costs.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, the program:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li> Awarded a $457,380 grant to Illinois Power Company to assist in the purchase and installation of tire-derived fuel handling and metering equipment, as well as slag cleaning equipment.  Waste Recovery - Illinois will be providing Illinois Power with 60,000 tons of tire-derived fuel per year, or the equivalent of 7.5 million passenger tire equivalents.  Waste Recovery - Illinois received a $500,000 grant from the Used Tire Recovery Program in Fiscal Year 1994 for tire-derived fuel processing equipment.<p>
<li> Provided a $500,000 grant to Pace-Mat, Inc. of Genoa to assist in the purchase and installation of crumb rubber processing equipment and recycled tire-derived rubber mat production equipment.  Products that will eventually be produced include anti-fatigue mats, gymnasium mats, anti-corrosive liners, highway culvert liners, animal mats, floor protection mats, and noise reduction flooring.  At full production, an estimated 665,000 passenger tire equivalents will be used annually.<p>
<li> Awarded a $210,000 grant to Achievor Tire, L.P. of Chicago to expand the existing manufacturer of used tires.  Remanufacturing differs from normal retreading in that new rubber is placed not only on the tread portion, but the shoulder and sidewall as well.  The tire casing is then put in a mold similar to how a new tire is produced.  The funds provided assisted in the purchase of new molds and sidewall plates for tire sizes that Achievor could not produce.  With the tire industry constantly producing new tire sizes and creating a demand for replacement tires, Achievor must buy new molds to remain competitive.  Achievor Tire has predicted that as many as 500,000 remanufactured tires could be produced over a five-year period by the equipment that was purchased with this grant.<p>
</ul>

<a name="Solid Waste Management"><br></a>
<h4>Solid Waste Management Research</h4>

The Solid Waste Management Research Program provides the foundation for future developments and improvements in solid waste management.  Funded research projects not only extend to the basic scientific, engineering, economic and sociological information available to planners, but also provide training and education for today's graduate students who will become tomorrow's solid waste experts.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, the University of Illinois Institute for Environmental Studies received a $400,000 grant to continue its competitive solid waste research grants.  This program offers two grant rounds annually.  Research programs may span the entire spectrum of solid waste management from reducing the environmental impact of landfilling and incineration, to expanding the uses of recycled materials, to understanding the public response to waste reduction education.<p>

The research program also provides funding for the Illinois State Geological Survey's (ISGS) landfill siting assistance program.  The Fiscal Year 1995 grant of $188,897 will allow ISGS to use its experts in Illinois Geology and computer Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to assist counties in locating geologically-capable sites for landfills.<p>

The Solid Waste Management Research Program provided a $127,342 grant to the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health to publish a technical newsletter intended to transfer information and research results to the government and industry planners who can put it to use.  An in-depth report on the conflicts and compatibilities of recycling and incineration is currently in preparation.<p>  

<a name="Tech Demonstration"><br></a>
<h4>Technology Demonstration</h4>

The Technology and Practices Demonstration Program supports the development and application of technologies and practices that minimize the land disposal of solid waste.  During Fiscal Year 1995, approximately $735,000 was awarded, which was matched by more than $1.1 million in private investment.<p>

Among projects awarded were:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li> A $150,000 grant to Eaglebrook Products, Inc. for the purchase of a twin extruder system to determine effective methods of compounding mixtures of high-melt, post-consumer, non-bottle plastic packaging waste with softwood fibers.  The intended end-market uses for the composite products include, but are not limited to, door and window substrata, millwork, agricultural and playground equipment, transportation equipment, and industrial flooring.<p>
<li> A $149,991 grant to Brookfield Zoo for the demonstration of an enclosed, aerated static pile composting system to control odor in the composting of animal wastes and bedding.<p>
<li> A $99,000 grant to the City of Streator for testing of "glasphalt" as an alternative aggregate for use as a durable road material.<p>
</ul>

<a name="School Education"><br></a>
<h4>School Education Program</h4>

The School Education Program provides financial and technical assistance to Illinois schools to implement recycling and waste reduction activities in the schools.<p>

The 1995-96 School Grant program awarded more than $220,000 to 20 projects involving 531 Illinois schools with approximately 250,000 students.  The grant money is used to purchase collection containers, implement source reduction activities, provide teachers and classroom training, and for trips and assemblies for the students to learn about the "3Rs" -- Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.  Vermi composting for classrooms at the elementary level was the most popular source reduction activity during the year.  Nearly 200 composting bins were purchased with funds from the grant, and several schools received grants to purchase reusable cafeteria dishes and serviceware, as well as slates for individual use, thus reducing waste at their schools.  In addition, grantees will spend a minimum of $22,000 toward the purchase of products with recycled content.<p>

The School Education Program also develops educational materials for teachers to help them address the 3Rs, provides teacher training on the 3Rs at various locations around the state, and publishes a quarterly newsletter.<p>

A program offered to all public and private Illinois schools is the Earth Flag program.  To earn an Earth Flag, schools must:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li> Recycle white paper.<br>
<li> Provide teacher training on the 3Rs.<br>
<li> Implement one schoolwide source reduction activity.<br>
<li> Implement at least one schoolwide reuse activity.<br>
<li> Instruct at least one grade level or science class or ecology club on the 3Rs.<br>
</ul>

More than 350 schools have registered to receive an Earth Flag.<p>

<h3>OFFICE OF ENERGY CONSERVATION AND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY</h3>

During Fiscal Year 1995, the Office of Energy Conservation and Alternative Energy continued to promote the efficient and economic use of Illinois' energy resources.  The Office tests and demonstrates energy technologies, identifies innovative means of financing energy efficiency improvements, and uses a variety of educational programs to transfer these cost effective technologies and information to both the private and public sectors of the Illinois economy.<p>


<h4><a name="Affordable Housing">Affordable Housing Programs</a></h4>

The Office has conducted a number of programs designed to demonstrate the vital role of energy efficiency in the design, construction or rehabilitation of affordable housing units.  During Fiscal Year 1995, in cooperation with not-for-profit developers, the Office provided grants and technical assistance for the energy efficient rehab of 53 multi-unit structures with more than 1,000 dwelling units.  The grants upgraded this low-and moderate-income housing to ensure that it is truly affordable by producing savings averaging 60 percent and lowering annual utility bills to under $200. <p>

The Office also demonstrated energy efficient building technologies in newly constructed homes.  More than 200 new homes were designed and constructed in cooperation with the City of Chicago under the "New Homes for Chicago Program."  These homes were developed and marketed to moderate income families in the city.  The energy efficiency improvements dramatically lowered annual utility costs, which greatly enhances the affordability of the homes.<p>

In cooperation with the Illinois Department of Public Aid, the Office provided grants and technical assistance to homeless shelter providers.  Grants of up to $20,000 per shelter were given to enable shelter providers to reduce their utility costs by up to 40 percent and utilize the savings for supplementing budgets to provide actual services to the homeless.<p>

During Fiscal Year 1995, the Office also disseminated information and efficiency technology demonstrated by the Affordable Housing projects to the homebuilding industry and other housing providers through seminars, conferences and housing-related workshops.  For example, a major homebuilding conference was held in the Greater Chicago area in February 1995, and the Office will sponsor the nation's largest weatherization conference, the "Affordable Housing Conference," in March 1996.<p>


<h4><a name="Ethanol Programs">Ethanol Programs</a></h4>

The Office of Energy Conservation and Alternative Energy worked with Illinois agricultural organizations during Fiscal Year 1995 to actively promote and expand the use of ethanol as a clean burning, renewable transportation fuel.  Illinois leads the nation in the annual production of ethanol, and ranks first or second in the production of corn each year.<p>

The Office manages numerous ethanol test and demonstration projects designed to encourage economic growth in industrial manufacturing and rural communities.  The agency also sponsors the research and development of new and innovative technologies to help reduce ethanol production costs.  A few milestones during Fiscal Year 1995:<p>
<ul type=square>
<li> The state continued to promote E-85 flexible-fuel vehicles by purchasing 71 1995 Ford Taurus sedans for use in the state fleet.  These vehicles were manufactured at Ford's south Chicago assembly plant.  Illinois operates the largest E-85 fleet in the nation.<p>
<li>  The number of state E-85 refueling facilities in Illinois was expanded and plans were completed for the first public E-85 refueling facility at Dwight.<p>
<li> Plans were announced for the state to begin testing three of the first flexible fuel E-85 Chevrolet S-10 pickup trucks for General Motors Corporation.  GM has announced that, beginning in 1997, all Chevrolet S-10 and GMC Sonoma trucks equipped with the 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine will be flexible fuel vehicles optimized for ethanol fuel.<p>
<li> Office staff laid plans for the organization and sponsorship of the Ethanol Exposition at the 1995 Illinois State Fair.<p>
</ul>


<h4><a name="Assist to Agriculture">Assistance to Agriculture</a></h4>

Through the Office of Energy Conservation and Alternative Energy, direct energy conservation, energy management, environment and renewable resource information was provided to more than 17,000 Illinois farmers and agricultural professionals through a series of 140 conferences, seminars and meetings.
Staffers worked closely with the Illinois Cooperative Extension Service and more than 30 Illinois farm organizations and groups to provide Illinois farmers with sound environmental practices and proven, practical methods of reducing energy costs on the farm.<p>

The Office also provides incentives to farmers to conduct on-farm sustainable agriculture research to demonstrate methods to maintain farm profits while reducing the environmental impact of conventional farming practices.<p>


<h4><a name="Energy Wise Homes">Energy Wise Homes of Illinois</a></h4>

The Office of Energy Conservation and Alternative Energy promotes a residential energy rating system called "Energy Wise Homes of Illinois."  The ratings help builders and homeowners understand the overall energy costs associated with a home.  Letting people know where their energy dollars are being spent helps them make financial decisions concerning energy products during new construction or in retrofitting their homes.  The rating is an essential tool when applying for energy efficient mortgages.<p>


<h4><a name="Energy Performance">Energy Performance Contracting</a></h4>

The Office of Energy Conservation and Alternative Energy promotes energy performance contracting for larger institutional or industrial energy users.  Performance contracting is an innovative arrangement for financing and installing energy improvement projects where the savings generated are guaranteed to amortize the project over the life of the agreement.<p>  

During Fiscal Year 1995, the office staff initiated a $20 million investment in energy efficiency capital improvements in state facilities.  Gov. Edgar's Energy Efficiency Pilot Initiative demonstrated the cost effectiveness of utilizing energy performance contracts in state buildings.  The pilot program utilized private certificates of participation to finance the projects, which will produce energy savings of more than $21 million annually in seven state agency and university facilities.<p>  

In addition, staffers continued to provide technical assistance and information transfer to other units of federal, state and local government, as well as school districts which are interested in exploring energy performance contracting arrangements.<p>


<h4><a name="Energy Efficiency">Energy Efficiency in State Buildings</a></h4>

Operators of state facilities were provided energy engineering assistance and ongoing energy efficiency training during Fiscal Year 1995.  These efforts resulted in documented savings of $6 million in operation and maintenance costs at 38 participating facilities.<p>

<H3>DCCA to provide census data to small businesses</H3>

<H4>By Ed Taft</H4>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) is establishing a new Business and Industry Data Center (BIDC) Program to provide census data and other usable information to small businesses. Started in 1988 by the U.S. Census Bureau as an extension of its existing State Data Center Program, the BIDC Program will meet the growing need by decision makers for effective use of economic statistics. The Census Bureau intends to use the BIDC Program as a means to increase the public's awareness of economic and demographic data and to make wider use of this data.<P>

DCCA will help meet this need by providing small businesses, independent contractors and future businesses in Illinois convenient access to statistical data and other sources of practical information. Our goal is to enhance the ability of small businesses to plan, market, manage and expand their businesses in Illinois and throughout the world. The BIDC will create a system of regional and local affiliates capable of providing basic information to the small business community, besides completing complex analysis as needed and performing regional economic analyses.<P>

Five Regional Affiliates (RA) will be responsible for collecting and disseminating information to both the end users of the data and to the local affiliates. The RA also will provide a regional economic analysis on a regular basis, furnish expertise in one or more data bases and provide assistance to local affiliates and data users as needed. <P>

Within each region three to five Local Affiliates will be created. Local Affiliates will be responsible for dealing directly with small businesses and other data users; will provide basic census economic and demographic information and other data prepared by the Regional Affiliates or the state; and will offer technical assistance in basic data interpretation. As of press time, centers have been selected and negotiations are proceeding.<P>

The Regional Affiliate will respond to requests that involve more complex analysis or interpretation. For more information on BIDC or to contact your Regional/Local Affiliate, call 217/785-7545.<P>

Ed Taft is the program coordinator of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs' Business and Industry Data Center.<P>

<H3>Dividends:  another success story</H3>

<H4>By Boyd Palmer</H4>

When co-owners Terry Havens and Charles Ross Lohr needed an infusion of capital for their fledgling product development company, Phoenix Paper Products Inc. based in Lostant, Illinois, the Illinois Valley Community College Small Business Development Center (IVCC SBDC) came through by facilitating additional avenues for financial opportunity in the form of private and public financing. And that, the partners agree, made all the difference for success.<P>

The SBDC provides an option for small businesses such as Phoenix Paper Products to access resources that will allow for it to adjust to our rapidly changing economy. Through the management and technical assistance of the SBDC a company can find a way to make their business run more efficiently.<P>

The birth of this venture occurred as a result of the merger of engineering skills of both Haven and Lohr who met by chance while serving on the Wenona city council. An engineer who attended the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, Haven was most recently a partner in C&H Construction Co., a millwright and general contracting company specializing in bulk handling of equipment and facilities. Lohr, who formerly worked for an area company, developed and fabricated machinery, along with methods of introducing shredded newspaper into compression chamber systems using no hydrocarbons or any other source of lubricators which might harm the ecosystem. As a result, both individuals have been recognized in their respective fields by obtaining patents on ideas relating to their environmental concerns.<P>

Consequently Phoenix Paper Products has developed and is in the process of marketing a unique line of environmentally friendly products made specifically from post-consumer newsprint. Currently a majority of the company's future output will be directed and marketed as a substitute for sphagnum peat moss which at the moment is a non-renewable resource imported from the Canadian wetlands. It is expected in time to increase in price as a result of environmental overcultivation. Other disadvantages concerning the use of peat moss are that it's cumbersome to handle, may contain harmful microbes and mining is weather dependent.<P>

Designated product markets for the company include mushroom casings, peat moss replacement for horticulture purpose and cat litter which will be used as both commercial and industrial absorbents.<P>

Thanks to collaboration of the SBDC, First Midwest Bank and the Upper Illinois River Valley Community Development Corporation, the Phoenix Paper Products group have shown with promising results that entrepreneurs can and will effectively utilize the many workable resources provided to Illinois business.<P>

"Organizations such as the Small Business Development Center, staffed with knowledgeable personnel, are critical to the survival and growth of small business," Haven said.<P>

Boyd Palmer is the director of the Small Business Development Center at Illinois Valley Community College in Oglesby.<P>

<H3>10 Reasons for Small Business Failures</H3>

<EM>Editor's Note: Portions of this article recently appeared in the Springfield Business Journal.</EM>

<H4>By Freida L. Schreck</H4>

Wanting your own business is part of the American dream that can rapidly turn into an American nightmare when the business fails.<P>

Statistics on business failure are staggering. Some numbers suggest that three out of five businesses fail in the first year. Numbers are important to statisticians. However small business owners aren't as concerned with numbers as they are with reasons. They want to know why business failure rates are so high as well as what can be done to avoid becoming a statistic. I don't have all the answers to the question but I can share with you ten of the most common problems encountered by directors of the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network.<P>

<H4>1. Lack of a business plan</H4>
The primary reason for failure is lack of a business plan. Builders don't start construction without a plan, nor do most people take a vacation without determining a destination, time frame, how much money they are going to need and travel arrangements. A business is going to take a large amount of an owner's time and money, and thus should be given more consideration than a trip to the grocery store.<P>

<H4>2. Lack of market research</H4>
Marketing is a much misunderstood part of a business plan. Conducting market research will assist in determining whether the need for a product or service is perceived or real. Just because family and friends think we have a great idea of a great product does not mean that our potential customer base will too. A marketing survey is the tool that can help an owner understand who the client is and what their needs really are.<P>

<H4>3. Underestimating competition</H4>
Competition is not necessarily bad; it can be healthy for business, some people say that there is "no one out there with anything like mine." Further research usually leads them to the realization that they do not understand what competition means or who the competition is. How can knowing the competition help you be successful? Searching out strengths and weaknesses, pricing, location, product line and customer service policies can provide the information needed to produce your marketing strategy.<P>

<H4>4. Lack of insurance</H4>
It is not uncommon for a business to start on a shoestring. If a line item in the projected budget can be eliminated or postponed it will be. One such line item is insurance. What happens to a business if there is fire, flood or some other disaster? The owner may have the knowledge and skills to continue but how can they replace equipment, furniture, office supplies and computer equipment? Was the cash flow strong enough to allow for a cash reserve? Are there existing loans that would make it difficult to obtain another? If the business is destroyed how much will be lost because of the interruption? A competent insurance agency tailor coverage to meet the needs of a business at a reasonable cost.<P>

<H4>5. Lack of customer service</H4>
We have all heard "the customer is always right." There may be times when we disagree; However customer service is an important key to success. Someone related an incident to me that confirmed my belief that if you can't treat customers with politeness you will lose them. A man came into a small shop to purchase items in excess of $150. When he approached the cash register, he explained that he didn't have the odd pennies necessary and the owner if she would take the even amount. The owner responded, "If you don't have the money, put something back." He did - all of it. I'm sure the story didn't end when the man left the shop. You can be assured that he told all of his friends how rude the owner of the shop was and encouraged them not to shop there. The shop closed within six months of opening.<P>

<H4>6. Lack of experience and knowledge of the industry</H4>
A person may be a great cook and want to start a restaurant but have no idea what it takes to operate one. They don't address some basic concerns such as how much food needs to be prepared each day, what is the cost of food items, how to prepare food items so that the items on an order are ready at the same time, how much to budget for expenses and how much money is needed to start. When giving loans the U.S. Small Business Administration requires three years of experience in the industry. If the owner doesn't meet this requirement, a qualified manager must be hired.<P>

<H4>7. Lack of operating capital</H4>
I can't count the number of times people have told me, "I think I only need $2,000 to start." They try to start on a shoestring and don't realize that lack of capital is the single most common death trap for start-ups. What does adequate operating capital consist of? There are several theories:
Figure start-up costs, then double them.<P>
Start-up costs plus six months protected expenses.<P>
Start-up costs plus one year's projected expenses.<P>

These theories are all adequate but finding out how much capital is needed takes research and planning. Completion of a list of start-up costs is a starting point but must have a projected monthly cash flow statement to accompany it. The monthly cash flow will assist in recognizing what your break even point is and what your monthly expenses may be.<P>

<H4>8. Lack of proper site/location</H4>
"Location - location - location." This statement is often referred to in text books covering business plan development as the most important factor in success or failure of a business. There are many times to consider before selecting the proper site. Consider traffic counts, other business failures in the same location, area demographics and cost of utilities and rental space. Just because it's cheap doesn't make it the ideal spot for a business.<P>

<H4>9. Changes in government regulations</H4>
With today's concerns about the environment and other issues, some businesses are caught in the crossfire because they didn't expect to be mandated to make major modification to meet changing rules and regulations. The modifications can cause severe financial strain.<P>

<H4>10. Lack of fear of failure</H4>
Healthy fear of failure can be a good trait for a small business owner to have. Entrepreneurs are supposed to be "risk takers" but that doesn't mean that they need to think that they are immune to failure. Be cautious and realize that even Fortune 500 companies have failed.<P>

<H3>BALMER ELECTED ISBDA CHAIR </H3>

<H4>By Mark Petrilli</H4>

Montrey Balmer, director of the Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) at Moraine Valley Community College in Palos Hills, was recently chosen as chairperson of the Illinois Small Business Development Association (ISBDA) at the organization's annual meeting in Peoria.<P>

ISBDA is a statewide association organized to support and promote the services provided by the programs that make up the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network (ISBDCN) and other not-for-profit organizations which provide small business assistance. Balmer has served on the coordinating council for ISBDA and is also one of the founding members of the association. <P>

"Montrey is one of the most dedicated and committed members we have," said outgoing ISBDA chair, Denise Mikulski, director of the Small Business Development Center at Joliet Junior College. "She is a pleasure to work with and is largely responsible for the success of our meetings," referring to Balmer's work at organizing the agenda and coordinating the training for the ISBDA spring and fall meetings.<P>

Since becoming director of the Moraine Valley PTAC in 1989, Balmer has counseled over 500 businesses seeking government contracts, assisting them is securing over $40 million in contract awards. Assistance provided to these firms has ranged from general procurement counseling and training to detailed one-on-one counseling in such areas as government marketing, bid preparation, contract administration and electronic data interchange (EDI). <P>

In addition to ISBDA, Balmer has actively participated in many other professional organizations including the National Contract Management Association, the American Defense Preparedness Association and the Association of Government Marketing Assistance Specialists (AGMAS). In 1991 she was recognized by AGMAS as a Certified Contracting Assistance Specialist.<P>

Realizing the importance of keeping up with developments in her field, Balmer has extensive continuing training and education in government procurement in areas such as the federal acquisition process, contract management and electronic commerce.<P>

"Montrey is always willing to support and share information with the other centers," said Lois VanMeter, statewide manager of the Illinois Procurement Technical Assistance Center program. "She is one of the most efficient, effective and capable directors in the state if not the country."<P>

Balmer's unselfishness has not gone unrecognized by her peers. She is a recipient of the Outstanding Communications Award and has been honored as Outstanding Director for her work in the PTAC program.<P>

During her term as chairperson of ISBDA Balmer wants to continue to develop the association's spring and fall meetings as excellent opportunities for the members of the ISBDCN to come together and share information and experiences.<P>

"We also need to continue providing high quality training programs which effectively meet the needs of our membership," Balmer said.<P>

Another area which Balmer would like to emphasize during the coming year is increasing the awareness of the services available through ISBDCN. She wants to continue working closely with the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs to increase the access of the Network by the business community and continue developing the ISBDCN as a vital part of the agency's strategy to serve small businesses in Illinois.<P>

Balmer also believes that ISBDA should take a more pro-active role in keeping legislative and community leaders informed about ISBDCN and its benefits to small business.<P>

For more information about ISBDA and the PTAC delivery system, contact Montrey Balmer at 708/974-5469; TDD Relay, 800/526-0844.<P>

<H3>Edgar expands environmental amnesty</H3>

Governor Jim Edgar announced he is expanding a successful initiative to bring businesses into compliance with environmental laws by encouraging them to cooperate with state regulators.<P>

"Through our innovative 'Clean Break' program, we are protecting both the environment and bottom line by stressing cooperation as a very effective alternative to confrontation," Edgar said.<P>

"In less than a year, we have demonstrated through a pilot program in Winnebago and Boone counties that we can achieve positive results by offering amnesty from heavy fines to those small businesses that truly want to be good citizens," Edgar said.<P>

More than 60 businesses have agreed to come into compliance with environmental laws since Edgar launched "Clean Break" in April 1995. By taking advantage of the program, they spared themselves more than $600,000 in potential penalties for violating environmental regulations.<P>

The expansion announced by Edgar will cover about 4,000 printing operations and 15,000 automobile maintenance businesses statewide. Those businesses are faced for the first time with clean-air permitting requirements, and associations representing them have expressed an interest in participating in the "Clean Break" program.<P>

Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra, Edgar's senior adviser on economic development, said, "Through this initiative, we have brought common sense back into the regulatory process. It's good for the environment and it's good for employers because it saves them from high legal fees and protracted bureaucratic battles."<P>

The amnesty program allows businesses with no more than 200 employees to anonymously learn from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) what steps must be taken to comply with environmental regulations. After a preliminary assessment, the small businesses may enter into an agreement that establishes a schedule for them to reach compliance and provides them with amnesty from enforcement action. The IEPA also provides the technical assistance needed for the firms to fulfill their commitment. <P>

Dennis Whetstone, director of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) said, "We were delighted to play a role in a project of such sweeping significance and one that is so important to the business community." <P>

To participate in the Clean Break project, any eligible small business may contact IEPA's Small Business Office at 217/524-2743; TDD, 217/782-9143 or DCCA's Small Business Environmental Assistance Helpline at 800/252-3998; TDD, 800/785-6055.<P>


<H3>EPA limits underground tank liability</H3>

Henry and Gladys Johnson own a small gas station. When the Johnsons decided to upgrade their three underground storage tanks with corrosion protection and spill and overfill prevention to meet U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements, they wanted to get started well in advance of the 1998 deadline. The Johnsons believed that making the upgrades now could prevent leaks later and help them avoid paying possibly higher costs during the 1998 rush. They decided to apply for a loan to begin work on the upgrades right away, and they turned to their local bank.<P>

Armed with their recent tax returns, the Johnsons met with the loan officer of the bank. At the end of their meeting, however, the Johnsons left disappointed. The loan officer "regretted" that the bank could not loan the Johnsons the money they needed. He explained that the Johnsons would need to use the gas station itself as collateral for the loan and, by doing that, the bank could eventually become an "owner" of the station. What if the Johnsons were unable to repay the loan and the tanks should happen to leak? The bank would foreclose on their gas station. The bank would be held responsible for any cleanup costs that might result. Since the bank could not afford that liability -- the so-called "lender liability" -- it would not make the loan.<P>

To help station owners like the Johnsons and to relieve some of the pressure that banks and other lending institutions feel to avoid any risk of liability, EPA has published a new regulation. The new lender liability rule limits the liability of banks and other lenders who hold security interests in property on which petroleum underground storage tanks (USTs) are located. <P>

"We hope that with this rule in place, banks will be more willing to make money available to UST owners and operators who need it to make improvements to their tanks in order to meet environmental regulations," says Lisa Lund, Acting Director of EPA's Office of Underground Storage Tanks. <P>

According to Lund, EPA is particularly concerned about the ability of small UST owners and operators -- the "Mom & Pop" businesses -- to meet the federal UST upgrading and replacement requirements. In the past, lenders have been extremely reluctant to make loans to small businesses such as gas stations for fear of becoming liable for cleanup costs in situations where the business goes bankrupt and the lender takes possession of the property through foreclosure.<P>

Until now, lenders have been very uncertain about the extent of their liability for UST-related problems. Subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) contains a "security interest exemption" that explicitly exempts lenders from liability for clean up of releases from petroleum USTs. However, many lenders don't know about this exemption, and many others don't know exactly what it covers. <P>

More confusion has resulted from court cases regarding Superfund lender liability. In 1994, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated (annulled) EPA's Superfund lender liability rule, which attempted to clarify the security interest exemption in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). The court's decision and EPA's Superfund rule were limited to actions taken under CERCLA. Because it involves actions taken under RCRA, the UST lender liability rule is not affected. However confusion on the part of the public between the two lender liability rules is understandable.<P>

Under the UST lender liability rule, a bank or other lender that issues a loan on an UST or on a property on which the UST is located where the lender holds the property as collateral does not have to meet the federal UST requirements either before or after foreclosure, if the lender meets the following conditions:<P>
Does not engage in petroleum production, refining and marketing<BR>
Does not manage or operate the UST<BR>
Does not store petroleum in the UST after foreclosure<BR>

The rule lists certain actions, including foreclosure, that lenders can take to manage and protect their collateral and still not be held responsible for meeting the federal UST regulations under RCRA Subtitle I. For example, a lender can perform environmental inspections or audits, arrange for cleanup of leaking tanks or close USTs temporarily or permanently without incurring liability under the federal regulations.<P>

In addition, lenders will be able to regularly monitor or investigate the borrower's collateral, business condition and financial health; require that the property be maintained in an environmentally sound manner; and advise the borrower to clean up the property if it is contaminated.<P>

Under this new rule, a lender can foreclose on and sell its UST collateral without incurring Subtitle I liability if there is a current operator at the site who can be held liable for compliance. Otherwise, the lender must empty the UST(s) within 60 days after foreclosure and either temporarily or permanently close the UST(s).<P>

The rule also describes activities that the lender cannot undertake without becoming responsible for UST cleanup costs. For example, a lender who chooses to operate its USTs is not eligible for the regulatory exemption. The lender could be required to clean up any contamination if the tank leaked and may be responsible for meeting the UST technical standards and financial responsibility requirements of Subtitle I.<P>

For additional information on the UST lender liability rule or for a copy of the Federal Register notice, contact EPA's RCRA/Superfund Hotline at 800/424-9346 or the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs' Small Business Environmental Assistance Program at 800/252-3998; TDD, 800/785-6055.<P>


<H3>Regulations Hurt Small Businesses More Than Others</H3>

Despite progress to reduce regulatory burdens on small businesses, the costs of regulation, paperwork and tax compliance continue to fall disproportionately on small firms with fewer than 500 employees, according to a new study prepared by the U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA) Office of Advocacy.<P>

The study, "The Changing Burden of Regulation, Paperwork and Tax Compliance on Small Business," reveals among its major findings that the small business regulatory burden is 1.5 times that of large businesses.<P>

"Small businesses bear 63 percent of the total regulatory burden while accounting for approximately 50 percent of employment and sales," according to Jere W. Glover, the SBA's chief counsel for advocacy. "What becomes obvious from analyzing this study is that small businesses -- the very engine powering the American economy today -- are being unfairly burdened by regulations."<P>

Glover said that the heavier regulatory load carried by small business acts as a drag on a powerful economic engine. "If the economy is going to put the pedal to the metal, so to speak, then something more must be done to release the brake that regulation is imposing on small business."<P>

The study also shows that such an inequitable allocation of regulatory costs is not good public policy and that, to help remedy this, public policymakers need to strengthen the Regulatory Flexibility Act to provide for judicial review for small firms.<P>

The Office of Advocacy research analyzes a number of other studies, especially one by Thomas Hopkins of the Rochester Institute of Technology that attempts to determine the total cost of regulation and to allocate those costs to business and industry by size. The Advocacy study takes the total cost of regulation, allocates it by size and industry and compares the cost per employee in large businesses with the cost per employee in small businesses.<P>

Advocacy's chief counsel presented some of the key findings of the study:<P>

In the Hopkins study, the average cost of regulation per employee in firms with fewer than 20 employees is $5,532; in firms with 20-499 employees, $5,298; and $2,979 in firms with more than 500 employees.<P>
According to the Hopkins study, such disparities mean that the regulatory cost per employee for the smallest firms is 1.86 times than for the largest companies.<P>
While small businesses account for approximately 50 percent of employment as well as about 50 percent of gross domestic product, small firm entrepreneurs bear 63 percent of the regulatory burden on all businesses.<P>
Of these regulatory burdens, the most significant to small firms are tax-and payroll-related paperwork. This paperwork burden is especially regressive in that it falls much more heavily on the small business person.<P>

The results of the Advocacy study were released this past fall at a joint hearing of the U.S. Senate and House Small Business Committees.<P>



<H3>New program helps Illinois manufacturers COMPETE</H3>

Coalition for Manufacturing Performance through Technology (COMPETE) is Illinois' effort to build a statewide system of Manufacturing Extension Centers (MEC). The mission of MECs is to assist small and mid-sized manufacturers with manufacturing technology advancement and modernization services to the point of continuous improvement of business practices within the firm.<P>

A network of geographically-based MECs and specialized centers deliver manufacturing and modernization services such as performance benchmarking, modernization assessments, and engineering and technical consulting.<P>

MECs provide access to appropriate technologies, technical information and specialized technology resources in computer information systems, electronic communications, environmental compliance and pollution prevention.<P>

MECs link to other organizations providing workforce training; business marketing, and management and financial packaging.<P>

Companies can benefit from services through increased sales, reduced expenses, and productivity and quality improvements.<P>

The regional MECs are staffed with engineers and professionals who have practical experience in the manufacturing workplace. These specialists work with a company to make confidential recommendations for improvements. They have access to a wide range of industry experts and the resources of universities, community colleges and private consultants to implement the work plans and improvement projects which the company determines are needed.<P>

MECs are partially funded through the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, as part of the Illinois Technology Challenge Grant program and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.<P>

<H3>Governor's Export Awards</H3>

<H4>By Patty Makropoulos</H4>

Acknowledging exports as a vital component of the Illinois economy is an
important factor for continued economic growth. The Governor's Export
Awards were created by legislation to recognize and encourage small and
medium-sized Illinois exporters and organizations that work to promote
export awareness for Illinois products and to highlight the significance of
Illinois in the world marketplace.<P>

Exports are an essential element to Illinois' economic base. In 1994
Illinois exports grew to $26.4 billion representing a 20.2 percent growth
over the previous year. Illinois ranks fifth in the nation among the top
ten exporting states marking the second consecutive year that Illinois has
improved its export ranking. One in eight jobs in Illinois is dependent
upon exports; in the manufacturing sector one in four jobs is a direct
result of exports.<P>

Currently in its third year the awards program is administered by the
Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) as part of the
agency's overall strategy to promote business expansion into global
markets. In 1994 small and midsize enterprises were responsible for more
than one-third of total merchandise exports. These companies play a crucial
role in driving the next generation of U.S. jobs. Companies that are
competing to overcome the "export gap" should apply for this prestigious
award.<P>

Businesses and organizations are recognized for outstanding achievement in
global competition in the following three categories:<P>

1. New to Export - honoring companies that have successfully exported
Illinois products for one to five years<P>
2. Continuing Exporting Excellence - honoring companies that have
successfully exported for more than five years<P>
3. Export Awareness and Development - honoring not-for-profit organizations
involved in the promotion of Illinois exporting and raising export
awareness.<P>

Representatives from DCCA, the Illinois Department of Agriculture, and
Illinois-based trade organizations and firms experienced in international
business comprise the Governor's Export Award Review Committee.<P>

Applications are judged on a total of factors: export sales as a percentage
of total company sales, growth of export sales, number of employees
involved in export sales and distinct factors indicating progressive
international marketing strategies. Deadline for application is March 29.<P>

The Governor's Export Awards will be presented at the Crossing
International Borders Annual Conference on May 16 at the Chicago Hilton and
Towers. The event is sponsored by DCCA's International Business Division
and Arthur Andersen.<P>

<H3>Environmental Business No Nova</H3>

<H4>By Mark Enstrom</H4>

In November of 1992, at the Illinois Energy Conference in Chicago, I had
the pleasure of meeting Soyini Walton, an energy and environmental
consultant just starting out in her own new business. She had the
educational background, technical expertise, work experience, the desire to
be a success in her future enterprise -- and lots of questions. Where could
she get assistance for marketing, planning, financing and help with the
many other issues and problems she would face? I encouraged her to contact
the Women's Business Development Center (WBDC) in Chicago for assistance.
She made that call. Today, with help from the WBDC, Asset Environmental
Services is a successful, growing business with four employees. In 1995,
one of her personal goals was accomplished as she was presented the "Rising
Star Entrepreneur Award" at the Entrepreneurial Women's Conference in
Chicago.<P>

This story is far from over. You see, a rising star is constantly in
motion, moving higher and faster as time goes by. Congratulations Asset
Environmental Services!<P>

Here is Walton's acceptance speech:<P>

"A rising star - Rises up on the horizon - Reaches it zenith and "glows"
brightly ------and then, it can fall from the horizon and FLASH out of
sight just as quickly as it rose OR...It can settle in among the rest of
the stars and remain a part of the starscape for years and years. I choose
to do the latter, to be one of the stars of the business community for
years to come. In choosing to be a successful business owner, I am learning
one thing: That success is a state of mind. One of my biggest challenges is
to maintain the "success" attitude on a daily basis. And as hard as I work
my business, I work just as hard to achieve the balance so necessary to
maintain a positive state of mine. Yes, success does mean making lots of
money but it also means personal satisfaction, economic stability,
community involvement and being able to offer other people a job.<P>

Success is setting goals and achieving them. When Carol Dougal, Co-director
of the WBDC, ceremoniously handed me a check for $3,500 two years ago, as
one of the first recipients of the microloan program, I said to Carol, "My
goal is to achieve the Rising Star Award," and Carol said to me in her very
direct and challenging way "Oh Honey - I want you to go for the
Entrepreneur of the Year Award" -- encouraging me to set higher goals.<P>

So I stand here today, the proud recipient of the Rising Star Award even
though I have not hit that one million dollars in revenues which I was
convinced was a requirement. And now Carol, I'm ready to work on the next
goal.<P>

As I continue on this journey, this rise up above the horizon, I invite you
to watch me as I grow my energy and environmental engineering business. For
those of you who are my clients, I pledge to help you grow or sustain your
business. And I appreciate the opportunity to serve you. For those of you
who are my mentors, please continue to work with me and to share your
insight and information.<P>

I thank (WBDC Co-director) Hedy Ratner and Carol for working against the
odds to bring the WBDC into being and for maintaining it as an excellent
resource center.<P>

I want to thank my Mama and Daddy, Doris and Russell Ricks, my husband,
Chaga, and my brothers and sisters and extended family. Thanks to all of
you for your support."<P>

DCCA conducts impact analysis of proposed rules and regulations affecting the small business community and recommends ways of "tiering" or eliminating certain rules if deemed overly burdensome for small businesses.

<p>Use our <strong>Word Search</strong> feature to find information about a specific subject.<p>

Enter a word or words below and press 'Excite Search'.  All First Stop government profile types,  agency, business requirements and assistance, will be scanned for your selected words.  You will be given a list of all documents in the First Stop database that match your selection. You can view each document by selecting it from the list returned.

<center><h3>TIPS for using the WORD SEARCH function</h3></center>

Be careful spelling the word(s) you enter!  It will search for exactly what 
you specify.<p>  

The search is not case sensitive.  For example, if you type 'INCOME', the 
system will return a list of documents that have 'INCOME', 'Income' or 
'income'.<p>

The system will return a list of documents that have ALL of the words that 
you enter.  Thus, if you enter INCOME TAX, you will get a list of all 
information profiles that have BOTH 'INCOME' and 'TAX'.  They need not be 
together in a document but only profiles containing BOTH (all) words will 
be selected for you.<p>  

The search function uses the entire word, as entered, in selecting 
'matching' documents.  It does not return documents containing `partial' 
word matches.  For example, if you input 'ENVIRONMENT' for your search, you 
will not get documents that may only contain the word 'ENVIRONMENTAL' or 
vice versa.<p>  

Start by using single words rather than combinations.  You are basically 
'guessing' what words may be used in a document that covers the subject 
matter you need.  After you get a list of documents with one word relating 
to your subject, try limiting the number of matching documents by adding 
another word.  For example, if you start with 'ENVIRONMENTAL', you may get 
a long list of documents.  You can then do another search using 
'ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS' to reduce the list to only those documents more 
closely relating to your desired subject.<p>  

If you don't find what you need on your first selection, try another word 
or words that would logically have the same or similar meaning.  Using 
search functions can be an art.  Don't be discouraged when you don't 
initially find something that you request.<p> 

<em>Note: </em> The quotation marks in the examples above are for clarity only.  
Don't use them when you input your word selections.<p>

  Yes, the CTC is still around.  A little leaner and not necessarily firing
on all cylinders, but still functional.  I ve lost track of which continuing resolution (CR) we re being funded under - I think it s number 5 or 6.  What ever the case, we are pleased to be here and proud to serve.  This year s Federal budget process has certainly kept us focussed on the here and now. CRs that last one to six weeks tend to do that to you.  Program planning, even within the current fiscal year, has become an abstract concept. <P>

  TO PRINT OR NOT TO PRINT?  That s really not a question, because we really don t have a choice.  I hope you are enjoying this electronic version of the CTC NEWS. If not, I hope it will grow on you.  Printing of newsletters is out during the CRs, and maybe forever, depending on what the final budget numbers look like.  So, check the CTCHOME PAGE on the World-Wide Web or the CTC BBS on the Technology Transfer Network periodically for the latest copy of the NEWS.  New editions are scheduled quarterly (January, April, July and October).<P>

  PROJECT IDEAS?  The CTC still offers technical and engineering assistance
projects (i.e., projects requested by staff at state and local agencies and
funded, all or in part, by the CTC).  Times are lean but some funding may
still be available for critical projects.  Don t procrastinate!  Don t let
the budget situation stop you from thinking ahead.  Be an optimist!  Get
your request in now!!!  If more money becomes available, the CTC will have
to put funds on appropriate contracts in June 1996!<P>

  WHAT S IN A NAME?  Well, we think our name should reflect what we do and
the organizations that support us.  Our name, CTC, may be changing to the
CP2TC - Control and Pollution Prevention Technology Center.  The CTC has
traditionally looked at both add-on controls and pollution prevention
measures in assisting you, and it s time that the CTC got full recognition
for what it does. Also, one of the CTC s prime sponsors has reorganized.
The Air and Energy Engineering Research Laboratory,   Office of Research and Development (ORD) is now the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Division (APPCD) of the National Risk Management Research Laboratory, ORD.  This change significantly strengthens and expands the CTC s ability to provide pollution prevention assistance.  So what do you think of CP2TC?  It s not chiseled in granite yet, but could be soon. If you have a better option, please let us know by BBS message, FAX or E-MAIL (see page 7).<P>

  HAVE YOU TRIED THE CTC HOME PAGE?  The CTC now has a HOME PAGE on the
World-Wide Web.  You can access the CTC from the OAQPS HOME PAGE.  Our
address is <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/ctc.html">http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/ctc.html</a>.  This initial CTC HOME
PAGE is kind of basic.  We will upgrade this page in July, shortly after
TTN-2000 becomes operational. TTN-2000 will give the Technology Transfer
Network (TTN) a fully operational World-Wide Web site.  As a result, all
of the CTC BBS functions now available on the TTN BBS will be available
on the World-Wide Web through TTN-2000. Check out the July edition of the
CTC NEWS for an update on CTC HOME PAGE improvements and TTN- 2000.<P>

  You can also access the Centro de Informacin sobre Contaminacin de Aire
(CICA) HOME PAGE from the CTC s HOME PAGE.  CICA is the CTC sponsored
program to help resolve air pollution problems along the U.S.-Mexico border. <P>

The direct address for CICA is <a href="http//www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/cica.html">http//www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/cica.html</a>.<P>

  Enjoy the NEWS! <P>

                         Novocaine for Number Crunchers</H3>
                                        
                                        
                                By Bill Vatavuk<BR>
                                ISEG/AQSSD/OAQPS<P>

  Anyone familiar with the OAQPS Control Cost Manual (Manual) knows that
air pollution control costs depend upon a variety of emission stream, control device, and financial parameters.  Often this dependency is quite complex.1  For that reason, it is cumbersome and time-consuming if not downright painful to make these sizing and costing calculations by hand, especially if costs are needed for a range of input parameters (e.g., waste gas flowrate). <P>

  To enable the thousands of Manual users to make these calculations more
efficiently, we developed 20 spreadsheet programs, collectively named "CO$T-AIR," to cover twelve control devices and one category of auxiliary equipment (ductwork).  Because the spreadsheets allow for the escalation of equipment costs, they bridge the gap between the Manual and the VAPCCI (Vatavuk Air Pollution Control Cost Indexes), the latter being documented in a recent EPA report.2  The CO$T-AIR rograms are written in Lotus 1-2-3  (version 2.0). Each program outputs itemized total capital investment and total annual costs for a given set of input parameters.  The devices and auxiliary for which we wrote spreadsheets are listed in the table (See page 2), alongside the Lotus  file names and the Manual chapters that correspond to them. <P>

  In each of these file names, "TCI" denotes "total capital investment,"
while "WK1" is simply the Lotus  version 2.0 file extension.  Those file
names containing "2" are second versions of the spreadsheets in question.
The character "-L" signifies that the spreadsheet is for "large" units i.e., those devices whose sizes exceed the upper limits of the cost correlations. As the list indicates, we wrote "large" spreadsheets for thermal and catalytic incinerators, regenerative thermal oxidizers, flares, mechanical collectors, and wet impingement scrubbers.<P>

  Finally, for the refrigeration systems, "-C" and "-P" denote the spreadsheets for "custom" and "packaged" units, respectively.<P>

  Most of the programs were based on design and cost data and procedures in
the OAQPS Control Cost Manual (Fourth Edition, 1990) and its supplements.
The exceptions were the programs for mechanical collectors, venturi scrubbers, and wet impingement scrubbers.  Spreadsheets for these three devices were based on information in the book Estimating Costs of Air Pollution Control (ECAPC).5<P>

                             <STRONG>Spreadsheet Components</STRONG><P>

    Although there are significant differences among the various spreadsheets, some components are common to all.  First, each spreadsheet consists of six sections: (1)"Cost Base Date"/"VAPCCI," (2) "Input Parameters," (3) "Design Parameters," (4) "Capital Costs," (5) "Annual Cost Inputs," and (6) "Annual Costs". In the first section, the "Cost Base Date" is the date corresponding to the equipment costs ("base costs") in the Manual or ECAPC.  This date ranges from third quarter 1986 (fabric filters) to second quarter 1993 (ductwork).<P>

  Next, the "VAPCCI" is used by the spreadsheet to escalate the equipment
costs from the base date to the quarter and year selected by the user.6
Eleven VAPCCI have been developed, one for each of the control devices listed above.7  (The sole exceptions are the "venturi scrubbers" and "wet impingement scrubbers" categories, which have been combined into one index: "wet scrubbers".)  Each spreadsheet is written so that once the user inputs the latest VAPCCI available, the total capital investment cost and capital
cost-dependent annual costs will automatically be escalated.<P>

  The second section, "Input Parameters," contains technical data that, in
nearly all cases, must be entered by the user. Because these input parameters vary so much according to control device designs and applications, there are no "default" values for them.  Input parameters include standard stream parameters  (e.g., waste gas volumetric flowrate) and data specific to a device (e.g., gas absorber packing parameters).  The spreadsheet needs these data to compute the design parameters, the costs, or both.<P>

  The "Design Parameters" section lists data (such as ESP collecting area)
that are primarily calculated by the spreadsheet based on the input
parameters.  The "Capital Costs" section displays the control device total
equipment cost (itemized), the purchased equipment cost, and the total
capital investment (TCI). Two values are given for the total equipment cost. The first corresponds to the base date of the costs (e.g., second quarter 1987); the second, to the VAPCCI escalation date.<P>

  The fifth section, "Annual Cost Inputs," lists nearly all of the parameters needed for the program to calculate the various annual costs.  These include the "operating factor" (the hours per year the control device operates), operating and maintenance labor rates, utility prices, the interest rate, and the control system life.  As with the "Input Parameters" section, the user must provide all of these inputs.  Nevertheless, typical values for the parameters are given in the Manual chapter covering the device in question. <P>

  Given in dollars/year, the "Annual Costs" are listed in the last section of the program.   These are itemized according to: (1) direct annual costs
(operating, maintenance, and supervisory labor; maintenance materials;
utilities; operating materials (e.g., caustic soda); replacement parts; and
waste treatment/disposal), (2) indirect annual costs (overhead; capital
recovery; and taxes, insurance, and administrative charges), and (3) recovery credits (if any).<P>

        <STRONG>Obtaining the Spreadsheets</STRONG><P>

  The CO$T-AIR spreadsheets are installed on the OAQPS TTN, where it is
posted on both the Control Technology Center (CTC) and the Clean Air Act
Amendments (CAAA) bulletin board systems.  Because the spreadsheets are
written in Lotus  (version 2.0), they are in a format that is importable to
later versions of Lotus , as well as to such programs as Excel  and
Quatro-Pro .  Accompanying the spreadsheets is an Introduction (in WordPerfect 5.1), which provides background on the programs, describing their general and specific features.  Those with questions or comments about CO$T-AIR should contact William M. Vatavuk, at (919)-541-5309 (fax: 919/541-0839).  Readers desiring copies of the OAQPS Control Cost Manual should phone the Control Technology Center at (919)-541-0800.<P>

2  Escalation Indexes for Air Pollution Control Costs (EPA-452/R-95-006,
October 1995).  Both the report and quarterly VAPCCI updates are posted on
the OAQPS Technology Transfer Network ("Clean Air Act Amendments" and
"Control Technology Center" bulletin boards).<P>

                             CONDENSERS IN HAP-PRO</H3>
                                        
                                 Lyndon S. Cox<BR>
                         Senior Environmental Employee<P>

  There are two types of condensers: the surface type and the contact type.
The Control Cost Manual (CCM) and HAP-PRO (type 1) calculate only the surface type. HAP-PRO defines a type 2 unit as one in which the area of the heat exchanger is defined, not calculated.<P>

  In a contact condenser (not addressed in either CCM or HAP-PRO) a
refrigeration unit chills volatile organic compounds (VOCs), similar to those being removed. Chilled VOCs are sprayed into the emission stream to condense the vapors.  Again, the CCM and HAP-PRO do not address this type of condenser.<P>

  The CCM and HAP-PRO do address the surface type of condenser, also known as the shell-and-tube type. This type of condenser has the emission stream
directed into a shell.  Within the shell, there are tubes which are maintained at a low enough temperature to reduce the vapor pressure of the VOCs. Condensation of VOC vapor reduces the concentration.  The emission stream is then exhausted.  Part of the design data is the level of VOC which is acceptable in the exhaust.<P>

  The refrigeration system must be capable of handling the heat load given up by the VOCs as heat of condensation. And, if there is too much moisture in the air, the ice on the tubes can impair heat transfer, and the condenser will have a lower control efficiency than calculated. Therefore, in emission streams that are known to have a high moisture content, a precooler is necessary.  The precooler operates at about 35 F to condense most of the water.<P>

  The input data for the design of this refrigeration unit is in Table 1:
HAP-PRO erroneously calls for the specific heat of the coolant to be in
Btu/hr-ft2- F; it should be in Btu/lb- F. However, as long as the correct
numerical value is given, it will compute properly.<P>

  The air is considered to be noncondensible, which is true at these
temperatures. Since the partial pressure of the VOC can be raised by either
compression or cooling, it is a given in the calculations that the condenser operates at atmospheric pressure.  We must calculate the temperature at which condensation occurs.<P>

  First we use the equation:<P>

HAP-PRO uses the less obvious, but equivalent, calculation: where<BR><blockquote>
  RE = Removal Efficiency<BR>
  HAPe = HAP concentration in the emission stream, ppm<BR>
  delta Hcon =   enthalpy change of condensed VOC<BR>
  delta Huncon= enthalpy change of uncondensed VOC<P>
</blockquote>
  This assumes that at the outlet the gas stream is at equilibrium with the VOC condensate.  <P>

  In the CCM, this leads to the equation :<P>
<pre>
        Tcon  =  (B  -C)
                  ---------
            A-log[(base 10)^P]voc
</pre>
  Now we know the temperatures we must obtain.  The heat load is then equal to:    <P>

     Hload = delta Hcon + delta Huncon + delta Hnoncon<P>

where:<P>

     delta Hcon = Mvoc,con[(delta Hvoc+Cp,voc)(Tin-Tcon)]<P>

     Mvoc,con = Mvoc,in - Mvoc,out<P>

     Mvoc,out = Mvoc,in (1-n)<P>

     delta Huncon = (Mvoc,out)(Cp,voc)(Tin-Tcon)<P>

     delta Hnoncon = [(60Qin/392) - Mvoc,in](Cp,air)(Tin-Tcon)<P>

HAP-PRO computes the number of moles in the inlet stream: <P>
<pre>
     HAPem = ((Qe)(HAPe*10)^-6)(60)
             ----------------------
                      392
</pre>
  Then the number of moles in the outlet stream:<P>
<pre>
     HAPom = (HAPem)[1 - RE]
                    --------
                      100
</pre>
  Then the number of moles condensed is:<P>

     HAPcon = HAPem - HAPom<P>

  Then HAP-PRO computes the heat load just as the CCM does it, but
erroneously uses the Cp,air instead of the Cp,voc in computation of the
enthalpy change in the uncondensed VOC.  This minor error was not previously discovered because it is negligible.<P>

  Next, the CCM addresses the heat exchanger or condenser.  The Chemical
Engineers Handbook gives values of 20 to 60 Btu/hr-ft2- F for examples of
brine cooled tubes condensing VOC.  The CCM uses a conservative heat transfer estimate of U = 20 Btu/hr-ft2- F.  HAP-PRO uses this as the default value, but allows other values to be entered.<P>

  The coolant is brine, which must be chilled to about 15  F below the
condensation temperature.  The temperature of the brine will rise to 25  F
above the condensation temperature in a properly sized counterflow heat
exchanger.  These values must be used in the following equations.<P>

  The condenser then becomes defined by:<P>

     Acon = Hload/U delta Tlm<P>

The coolant flow rate is given by:<P>

     Wcool = Hload/Cp,cool(Tcool,out-Tcool,in)<P>

And the refrigeration capacity is defined as:<P>
     R = Hload/12,000  tons<P>

  The flaws that have been detected will be corrected.<P>

<H3 align=center>NEW LANDFILL AIR EMISSIONS MODEL </H3>

By Bob Blaszczak,<BR>
CTC/OAQPS<P>

     The Landfill Air Emission Model is now available on the CTC BBS and HOME PAGE.  It provides an automated estimation tool for quantifying emissions from municipal waste landfills. The model estimates emissions of methane, carbon dioxide, nonmethane organic compounds, and toxic air pollutants. Information on the assumptions used in the model can be found in the background information document (NTIS # PB91-197061) written to support the Municipal Landfill New Stationary Performance Standards (NSPS), 40CFR60 Subpart WWW, and Guidelines for Control of Existing Sources, 40CFR60 Subpart CC, and in the public docket, Docket A-88-09.  This article contains information on the beta release versions of the Landfill Air Emissions Estimation Model for DOS (Version 2.0) and Microsoft Windows (Version 1.0).<P>

     The Landfill Air Emissions Model is regarded as a screening tool.  It
can be used with site-specific data, or it can be used with two different
sets of default values.  The CAA (Clean Air Act) default values reflect the
expected maximum emissions and generally would be used only for determining
the applicability of the landfill regulations and guidelines.  To estimate
actual emissions in the absence of site-specific data, a second set of default values (the AP-42 defaults) is provided in the model.  The AP-42 default values are based on emission factors from the EPA s Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors, Fifth Edition, AP-42 (EPA 1995).  The AP-42
default values provide emission estimates that should reflect typical landfill emissions and are the values suggested for use in developing estimates for state inventories.<P>
     An IBM-compatible personal computer with at least one floppy disk drive and 4 megabytes of memory is recommended for this program.  The Windows version requires Windows 3.1 or better.  The DOS version requires DOS 2.0 or better.  All software components of the models for this beta release are fully functional.   As of this writing, the AP-42 values have been revised and are available for public comment.  The beta version of this software includes the revised AP-42 suggested defaults. Once the AP-42 revisions are published as final, the defaults in these models will be revised to reflect any changes.<P>

     The CTC BBS and HOME PAGE have versions of the Landfill Air Emissions
Estimation Model for DOS and Windows.  Each model is provided in a separate
self-expanding ZIP file (LAND_DOS.EXE for the DOS version and LAND_WIN.EXE
for the Windows version).  Just download the appropriate version and put it
in its own directory. To extract the files, either double-click on the file
name in the Windows File Manager or type the file name in DOS and hit enter. (NOTE: All software components for each version should be located in the same directory prior to execution.)<P>

     For the DOS MODEL, go to the directory that contains the expanded files and type LANDFILL. to execute the model.   (SPECIAL NOTE:  Hercules graphics card users should execute the MSHERC.COM program prior to running the model. This component is required to view graphical output with these cards).<P>

     For the WINDOWS MODEL, use the FILE-RUN selections from the File Manager menu to execute the LANDWIN.EXE file to start the model.  (Additional Note: This program will make a modification to your WIN.INI file to save setup information about the model.)<P>

     More details about the design and use of both the DOS and Windows versions of the landfill model are provided in the "User s Manual, Landfill Air Emissions Model."  This manual is also available on the CTC BBS and HOME PAGE.<P>

                             <H3 align=center>What s New on the RBLC</H3>
                               By Jo Ann Kerrick<BR>
                                     VGYAN<P>

  Information in the RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse (RBLC) is updated nearly
every month as users submit new control technology determinations to the data base.  In addition to this information, the RBLC support staff continues to make changes to keep the system current.  If you haven t been on the RBLC BBS lately, check the TTN now for the updates described below.<P>
 
New RBLC Data Fields in Standalone Editor<BR>

  As you may have noticed, we recently changed the RBLC data base structure
by removing extraneous dates at the facility level and adding new fields for notes about compliance verification at the process level.  In addition, the cost fields at the pollutant level were expanded to accommodate larger
numbers.  In September we released a new version of the RBLC standalone editor designed to be compatible with these changes.<P>
  The standalone editor is an alternative to online entry of new control
technology information.  You can input new determinations locally on your PC and then transfer the data to the RBLC system administrator for inclusion in the online data base. While we were changing the system to be compatible with the new data base, we made some more changes to simplify the editor.  We removed the edit menu and moved its functions to the facility list screen. Now you can make all updates to your determinations, including adding new ones, from a single screen.  Another new option at the facility list screen lets you delete all of your old determinations and start with a blank data base.  (You would use this option after you have sent your data to the RBLC). We hope these changes make the system easier and quicker to use.  If you are responsible for submitting your agency s determinations, you might want to try the standalone editor.  All the files you need and installation instructions can be downloaded from the RBLC BBS.<P>

Ranking Reports Updated<BR>

  The RBLC ranking report compares pollutant emissions for a single process
type and one pollutant.  Typically you perform a search for the target
information, and then download your results using the ranking report format. Based on standard emission limits for each applicable determination, the report presents statistics based on these limits and then reports them in rank order listing from most to least stringent.<P>

  Because the RBLC Ranking report can be a valuable reference for users
making RACT, BACT, or LAER determinations, the RBLC staff has generated
ranking reports for specific process type and pollutant combinations.  The
reports are available for downloading to your PC without doing a query.  In
October all of these reports were updated to reflect the latest information
in the then current RBLC data base.  If you want quick access to ranking
information, look for these reports in the Download section of the RBLC BBS.<P>

Regulation Data Base Updated<BR>

  When it became available in late 1994, the regulation data base contained
summaries of New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission
Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) rules then in effect.
Subsequently, we expanded the data base to include entries for Maximum
Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards.  As of November 1995, the
data base contained 105 rules, with 21 of them updated to reflect rules
proposed or promulgated in 1995.  Starting in 1996, we plan to add summaries of Control Technology Guidance (CTG) documents.  If you need summary information about current federal rules, the regulation data base is a good place to start.<P>

Help Rearranged for Process Type Codes<BR>

  The RBLC uses numeric codes to group processes by category, such as
combustion, surface coating, mineral processing, etc.  In fact, searching for the appropriate process type code can  be the quickest way to get the control technology information you need.  Performing these searches with the menu-driven search just became a little easier.  You still choose a major category from a two-page display of 2-digit process type codes from 10 to 99. Now, however, the system displays the list of available detail codes in alphabetical order by the process ame, rather than in numeric order.  You can quickly scan the list for the process you want and find the appropriate code for it.  We hope this improvement makes the RBLC easier to use.<P>

                       Office of Technical Assistance/SBAP<p>

The Massachusetts Printers Partnership (MP2) is a joint project involving:<P>

   Printers, consultants and vendors to the printing industry<BR>
   Printing Industries of New England (PINE)<BR>
   Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)<BR>
   OTA s Small Business Assistance Program (OTA/SBAP)<BR>
   EPA - New England Environmental Assistance Team (NEEAT) .<BR>
   Screen and Graphic Imaging Association.<P>

  The pilot program began last spring with a series of meetings involving
printers and agency personnel, at which the group identified both environmental concerns in the printing industry and a set of environmental criteria which would indicate that best environmental management practices were being followed.<P>
  MP2 allows printers to come into compliance with the new protocols simply, inexpensively and in multi-media fashion.  It imposes some additional requirements, both in photo wastewater discharge and in air emissions, which will assure industry-wide emissions reductions based on pollution prevention (P2).  Program elements follow:<P>

  Aggressive outreach, including the development of a "plain language workbook" or printers, which will detail compliance requirements to which printers are subject and closely coordinated program materials which will lead the individual printing plant manager in a step-by-step self-certification process. OTA is hosting a series of six half-day workshops and clinics at convenient sites across the state, jointly funded by DEP, EPA-New England and OTA.<P>

  Regulatory Reform, the Partnership enrollment will replace virtually all
environmental permits typically required of small and midsize printers and a six month enforcement moratorium to allow Partnership members to come into compliance.<P>

  Pre and post-program sampling to determine level of improved environmental performance, according to established measures of success and a carefully selected statistical sample.  EPA has placed a high priority on demonstration projects which validate the concept of improving environmental performance by creating incentives for voluntary compliance.  There was resistance to the concept of beginning a cooperative program with inspections, but this was deemed essential to establish a baseline.  Fifty inspections were agreed upon and conducted under enforcement discretion, there would be no penalty except in extreme situations.<P>

  Strong public relations efforts, involving key state officials and
representatives of the printing industry, working with statewide media to
tout the program and encourage consumers to atronize printers who display
the MP2 logo.<P>

  The 1996 "State Small Business Ombudsman and Small Business Assistance
Program Conference," co-sponsored by the Office of Air Quality Planning and
Standards (OAQPS) Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) and EPA s Small
Business Ombudsman s Office, was held February 28 - March 1, 1996, in San
Diego, California. This annual event provides an opportunity for the State
programs to share information with each other, and with EPA.  The conference attracted 150 attendees, representing 44 States and 2 territories; quite a good turn-out in this era of downsizing and budget cuts.<P>

  This year, planning of the conference "content" was carried out primarily
by a group of State program representatives.  The first day was devoted to
industry sector presentations (printing, metal finishing, automotive service, and painting & coatings), with  many of the speakers representing trade associations or actual small businesses.  The second day had 16 different breakout sessions related to more operational issues of the State programs (policy and process), with the vast majority of speakers from within the State programs themselves.  This combination of planning and presentation by the target audience proved to be amazingly successful; we literally had more volunteers to chair sessions or make presentations than we could use. The response to "learning from your peers" was very enthusiastic.<P>

  OAQPS had a small, but visible, presence.  In addition to serving as the
Conference Co-Organizer, I introduced several recent OAQPS small business
assistance accomplishments, including the new SBAP BBS on the OAQPS Technology Transfer Network (TTN), as well as the SBAP Home Page on the World Wide Web. Janyce Riess lead an excellent discussion on the series of small business satellite seminars put on by OAQPS s Education and Outreach Group (EOG) in cooperation with the University of Tennessee.  In fact, the session that Janyce participated in was one of the most popular in the whole conference.<P>

  Organizing a national meeting can be an extremely time consuming and
frustrating experience.  The rewards, however, can be very satisfying.  Some comments we received on the evaluation forms include:<P>

-"Great meeting"<BR>
-"This was my first meeting and Ienjoyed every aspect"<BR>
-"I learned a lot and I am very grateful for this experience"<BR>
-"We plan on using OAQPS resources much more"<BR>
-"Annual conference should be considered as part of training for all States".<P>

Somehow, in the end, it all seems worth while!<P>

<h3>CCI News</h3>
<em>By Jeff Markland</em><p>

Comments from those in attendance indicate that the Competitive Communities Conference held April 3 and 4 in Springfield was a tremendous success.  Attended by mayors; city, county and township officials; economic development practitioners; service providers and local leaders interested in economic development issues, the conference explored the global, national and statewide issues and resources that effect development at the local level. <p> 

Dennis R. Whetstone, Director of the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), kicked off the conference by sharing with the audience his vision of what economic development is, what it isn't and what needs to be done to make the State of Illinois even more competitive.<p>

Whetstone struck an accord with those in attendance when he said, "Economic development is not synonymous with business development.  Economic development is a much broader continuum of services and activities that have to take place, that if it works, results in economic development."  He went on to define economic development with a formula for success "CD + BD x L = ED" (Community Development + Business Development x Leadership = Economic Development.)<p>

Explaining that in years past DCCA had narrowly defined it's purpose as primarily a business development agency that, by chance, also administered millions of dollars of federal grant and loan funds, Whetstone said, "Today we know to be successful a community needs to do both community and business development, and provide knowledgeable, energetic and professional leadership at the local level."<p>

Five different panels comprised of individuals with varying perspectives discussed  development polices, issues, and practices that are critical to achieving competitiveness in today's market place. <p>

The conference featured panel members from across the nation who came to Springfield to share their perspectives, knowledge and experience with conference attendees.  John Sidor of the Council of State Community Development Agencies; Daphne Clones of the Corporation For Enterprise Development; Don Walls, Walls and  Associates; Martha Lawson, National Associ- ation of Development Organizations; Thomas J. Johnson, Grant Thornton; and Don Tusher, Kelly-Springfield, are just a few of the panel members that brought their years of experience and practical know-how to share with those in attendance.<p>

During his keynote address, Lt. Gov. Bob Kustra stressed the importance of developing our infrastructure, financial resources, technologies, business climate and quality of life.  "By strengthening these foundations we will retain the businesses we currently host, encourage them to expand, and even attract new businesses to within our borders -- bringing new, high quality jobs with them."<p>

One of the five discussion panels, "The Local Experience," showcased the CCI communities of Cairo, Charleston, Oregon and Seneca.  Local leaders from these communities shared the problems  as well as the accomplishments they experienced during their first year as CCI communities. <p>
 
Ron Colson of Oregon said his community used the "dogsled model" -- "We had a lot of people interested but we didn't have a common harness to get us all pulling together in the same direction--CCI gave us that harness."  According to Carolyn Mayberry, "Cairo has been studied to death.  CCI forced us to sit down around the same table and agree on where we wanted to go.  We are now focused and working together."  Charleston Mayor Dan Cougill encouraged communities to get the nay-sayers involved. "You will be surprised at the help you get and the converts that become positive influences within your community," he said.<p>

If there was a common theme expressed throughout the conference by panel members and audience particapants alike, it was the need for accurate, responsive and timely information.  Don Tusher, Plant Manager for Kelly-Springfield, said, "Today we are giving information to our unions that five years ago we didn't give to our managers...if they have the same information we do, they will come to the same conclusions."  The CCI conference was a great opportunity for all of DCCA's development partners to share and exchange information.  We hope that next year you will be able to join us.<p>

<h3>MORE ABOUT LAND</h3>
<em>By Rich Funderburk</em><p>

This article addresses what I consider to be the most important ingredient of a local business development program:  land.  If you don't have land, you simply don't have a program.  Your community will be eliminated from any business attraction competition without receiving a visit.<p>  

A piece of land, or "site," is the physical place you have where a business or industry can locate.  A large portion of the evaluation process that a business undertakes will be spent dealing with the physical location -- that piece of land it will acquire and build its facility on.  There are many factors that are taken into consideration when building a new facility on a piece of land that is not completely developed.  <p>

The competitiveness of the site depends on how ready the site is and how well it fits the needs of the prospect.  For example, many sites get eliminated because they just do not have the proper physical characteristics to fit the project.<p>

If your community is going to have a long-term economic development program (covering a period of 15  to 20 years,) then control of land should be a part of that program.  A plan needs to be developed in steps that your community can afford.  Here are the four stages of a site development plan:<p>

The first step is to identify what land in your community is really available for sale.  (Just because you think a piece of land is available or would make a nice site, doesn't mean it is.)  The property owners need to be identified and asked if they are willing to sell and at what price.  <p>

Second, your organization or community can take an option on the property.  That way, if you have the opportunity to negotiate with a prospect, you will have control over what can and cannot be accomplished on the property.  <p>

Third, your community can purchase a piece of land that you control for future development.  I offer a note of caution here.  Before taking title to any property -- especially if it's to be purchased by the city -- make sure it is environmentally clean and there is no remediation that has to be completed (and paid for) after you take over  the property.<p>

Fourth, once you control a piece of property, you should develop a plan for complete development of the site over a long period of time.  This plan will address factors such as infrastructure improvements, roads, sewer, water, rail extensions, etc.  on the land.<p>

Every time you complete one of these steps your community becomes more marketable as a new business location because you are eliminating the unknowns in the process and providing tangibles upon which business decisions can be made.<p>

DCCA has a program called the Select Site program.  It's a very good guide to all of the factors that are evaluated about a site.  And even if you have sites that you don't think will meet all of the guidelines of the Select Site program, it's still a good guide to evaluate what you have.<p>

Developing land is expensive and time consuming.  But it is very important that you take the time to seek counsel from people who can give you advice and help you plan the process so that you make good decisions.  There are many people out there that are willing to help you, if you'll only ask.<p>

Remember, O.I.L. (organization, information, land):  they are the fundamental parts to a local business development program.  If you have these three components, your local economic development effort will have a better chance of success.  Businesses locate in communities; you need to show businesses that you want them and that your community has what they need to locate and grow.<p>

<h3>BUSINESS LOOK FOR INFORMATION<br>
<em>by: Rich Funderburk</em></h3>

For the last few issues, we've been talking about things businesses look for when choosing locations.  It is important for you to understand what drives the information needs of businesses looking for new locations or places to expand.<p>

Long before anyone ever makes contact with a community, the business will develop a needs assessment and develop information criteria to help them make a decision on whether to move, expand, or simply expand into a different labor force or market area.  That need will vary greatly depending on what the project is and the company or person using that information.<p>

For example, a business that employs 100 people will want more labor information than one that employs 10.  An insurance company will need a different kind of work force and have different information needs than a company that is going to put in a standing operation.  Each kind of business has its own needs and its own evaluation criteria.<p>

These information needs have increased by a huge percentage in the last 25 years.  Much of that increase is due to the increase in government regulations such as zoning.  EPA and OSHA to name a few.  As community leaders, this means you need to collect more information for your database, and develop rapport with agencies that create databases, regulate or administer the regulations that control these businesses.  In some cases, you might need to hire a consultant to help you.

But before you hire anyone, your community organization should understand the need for and the use of this information.  Let me stress again, the information has to be factual and up-to-date because if it's not, it's not tangible and therefore cannot be evaluated.<p>

There is also evidence that the time cycle for these evaluations is shrinking.  Businesses are making decisions quickly.  This means that the demand for information will increase and the time companies allow you to provide that information will be reduced. Having current accurate information readily available will put you in a better position to compete and not be eliminated.<p>

You will never be able to answer every question asked of you on the spot.  But you need to demonstrate that you have the ability to provide good factual information with quick turnaround.<p>

No matter what kind of business your community wants to attract, information is essential.  Start working today to develop that information base.<p>

<h3>PEACE CORPS FELLOWS, COMMUNITIES WORKING WELL TOGETHER<br>
<em>by: Tom Lawton</em></h3>

Under a unique program, seven Peace Corps Fellows from Western Illinois University (WIU) and Illinois State University (ISU) are tackling community development projects in Illinois small towns.  The fellows are Peace Corps volunteers who have returned from earlier assignments and now are serving 11 month assignments in small towns as part of the requirements to earn master's degrees for WIU or ISU.<p>

An example is Scott Johnson.  Johnson is working with the Carthage Industrial Development Corporation (CIDC) in pursuit of six goals, including bringing industry to town, developing housing and building a stronger membership base.<p>

"The Peace Corps Fellows program has been a big spark plug for our community," said Jerry Bartel of CIDC.  "Our economic and social development bases were fragmented and Scott has helped us pull them together."<p>

Another participant is Todd Crabtree.  Crabtree is working in Cumberland County through the Cumberland County Development Corporation (CCDC)/  Some of the county goals that he has been working toward include implementing an educational foundation, an ambassadors group, and a speakers bureau.  Other goals include tourism, business retention, and historic preservation. <p>

"Todd helps us make our plans happen.  He has made a lot of good connection for us and he has fit into our community really well," remarked Carol Jo Fritz form CCDC.<p>

Other 1994 Peace Corps Fellows from WIU and ISU are stationed in Cairo, Murphysboro, Grundy County and Ford County.  Lacon, Washburn and Wenona are jointly hosting a Fellow.  Both Cairo and Murphysboro are involved in the Competitive Communities Initiative.<p>

The next class of Peace Corps Fellows will be available to work in communities beginning in June 1996.  If your community is interested in hosting a Fellow, please contact John Gruidl, Illinois Institute for Rural Affairs, at Western Illinois University, phone 800/526-9943 or 309/298-2984.<p>

<h3>FOUNDATION OF THE MONTH<br>
<em>by: Jeff Markland</em></h3>

<h4>THE FOUNDATIONS FOR GROWTH</h4>
<ul type=square>
<li>Pro-competitive policies affecting local business climate
<li>A skilled and adaptive workforce.
<li>Access to capital for business growth and expansion.
<li>Good basic and advanced infrastructure.
<li>Access to technology and business modernization resources.
<li>The social infrastructure necessary for a high quality of life.
</ul>

Years ago it was common knowledge that three factors determined the desirability of property: Location, location and location.  Cheap taxes and land were the main focuses during the site selection process.  But things changed.  Soon, communities and states found themselves in bidding wars, each trying to outdo the other with costly incentives to attract businesses.<p>

Today, to some degree, technology and transportation have changed that.  Companies are looking for more than just low taxes - the overall tax structure, tax burden and expenditure policies share equal importance.<p>

Companies look to get "bang for the buck".  Taxes should not be out of line with the benefits received.  Taxes spent effectively can actually reduce operating costs; for example, good schools reduce the need for remedial training.<p>

Stability and predictability are also of importance.  Uncertainty about taxes can undermine confidence in community leadership.<p>

You want to be sure that your taxes are in line with other communities in your market area.  But you also need to make sure that businesses know how those tax dollars are spent.  A quality business will understand that appropriate expenditures are important to preserving and improving quality of life in a community.<p>

<h3>
O.N.E. TO WRITE ACTION PLAN<br>
<em>by: Don Falls</em>
</h3>
The Organization of the Northeast (O.N.E.), the neighborhood group that is sponsoring participation in CCI by Chicago's Edgewater and Uptown areas, has completed work on its self-assessment and is now working toward developing a written action plan for the two neighborhoods.<p>

O.N.E. faces some unique challenges.  These neighborhoods are among the most culturally, economically and ethnically diverse communities in our state.  Home to people with Chicago's highest and lowest incomes, the housing stock includes lakefront townhouses and condos, rehabilitated apartments, assisted housing, boarding houses, and many ethnic, religious and racial groups.  The neighborhoods provide a social and cultural mix only found in one of the great cities of the world.<p>

O.N.E. is particularly well-suited for CCI work because it is already very familiar with the issues involved in community competitiveness.  Formed almost 25 years ago with the purpose of identifying areas of mutual concern in the Uptown and Edgewater neighborhoods, each year O.N.E. completes a self-assessment that identifies the needs, issues and concerns of the neighborhoods. This information is then prioritized into an action agenda.<p>

This year, O.N.E. conducted 45 house meetings in the various areas.  Participants included youths, seniors, owners, renters and people of various economic levels.  Because the size and diversity of the area makes communicating very difficult, meetings were conducted in five different languages.<p>

O.N.E. also conducts an annual convention where the members review and discuss information and priorities.<p>

This year's convention identified the following priorities: leadership training and outreach; child care; safety, anti- drug and community policing; opportunities for youths; improved education at all levels; job training; housing; immigration issues, voter registration and citizenship campaigns.<p>

With this phase of the self-assessment complete, CCI staff will assist O.N.E.'s Jobs & Economic Development Team to develop the written action plan for the two neighborhoods.  The plan will detail the actions to be completed, who will be responsible for the projects and what resources will be needed to complete the various goals.<p>

<h3>
THE DETAILS OF ORGANIZATION<br>
<em>by: Rich Funderburk</em>
</h3>

In the last issue, I talked with you about O.I.L. - Organization, Information, and Land.  I'd like to revisit two of these subjects - organization and information - in more detail.<p>

As I said before, there are many types of local organizations. They can all work if the right people are involved, if they take the time to learn the economic development process, and if they develop a clear understanding or plan of what they want to accomplish.  Then they need to set some realistic goals and a timeframe in which to achieve these goals.  I don't mean pie-in-the-sky ideas, but things that are within the ability of your organization and your community.<p>

Many community organizations have failed through the years because they were put together by people with visions of grandeur, what I call the "hero syndrome".  They're people with good intention, but who are misdirected and uninformed.<p>

Every organization needs a good leader.  Choose one who can bring all of a community's resources to focus on a common goal and, when successful give credit to all those who made it happen.  Remember, in today's world, and the economic development business in particular, no one person can make it happen.  It takes lots of people, not only from your community, but from outside the community, to make real economic growth happen.<p>

I want to stress again that the longevity of you organization's leaders is very important.  If you look around the state, or any other state as far as that goes, you'll find that in successful organizations people have been involved for as many as 10, 20 and even 30 years in their local economic development program. Don't involve people just because they are popular.  If they're popular, and they're hard worker at helping the community, that's different.<p>

I'm a strong believer that most local organization are underfunded.  A community needs to invest more than just its time if it wants to compete for growth in today's world. <p>

Funding is something that's been done in many different ways (and something we can talk about in a later column).  But no matter what path you choose for your community, be realistic in its goals, be patient, stay dedicated, there's much to learn.  Economic development is a very complex process, with many different interests.  And don't be afraid to ask for help.  No one knows for sure you're not going to re-invent the wheel in this business.  If you need help ask for it, and don't ask us too late.<p>

<h3>NEW COMMUNITIES ANNOUNCED</h3>

Gov. Jim Edgar recently announced that 10 new participants have been chosen for the Competitive Communities Initiative (CCI).  "The goal of the CCI is to help participants lay the groundwork for economic success," the Governor said.  "The communities selected to pilot this program during the past year have given it excellent reviews.  I am pleased to see additional communities make commitment to their future."<p>

The communities chosen from this round of applications are Benton, Crystal Lake, East Moline, Grafton, Greenville, Henry, Milford, Warren County, Sparta and Yorkville.<p>

Last year, during the first selection process, CCI only selected communities assessed as being in the initial stages of development for participation in the program.  This new round of communities has demonstrated various degrees of preparedness.  "We learned a lot from working with our first round selections," said Jeff Markland of the CCI staff.  "I fully expect the program to gain strength and value as we and our communities progress."<p>

The Department of Commerce and Community Affairs Office of Local Initiatives (OLI) is responsible for administration of the CCI program.  OLI is presently working with 29 communities throughout Illinois ranging in size from a few hundred to over 150,000 people.<p>

<h3>
CCI ON THE MOVE<br>
<em>by: Jane Robert</em>
</h3>

"CCI On the Move" is the name given to the Oregon, Illinois CCI program by its 22-member steering committee.  And there's no question it's true!<p>

With the dynamic leadership of the Steering Committee, directed by Donna Mann of the Cooperative Extension Service, subcommittee members have gone to work in the past year and are making great strides to improve their community.  Through their efforts, the "New Look for Oregon" campaign was held last June which included community clean-up work as well as adding flowers to the downtown area.  For the holidays, twinkling lights are now glowing downtown.<p>

Future plans that have already been approved include funding for period lighting on the Route 64 bridge scheduled to be constructed next  year, and development of a not-for-profit 501(C)3 Finance Committee 3 whose responsibility consists of coordination and fundraising activities for all CCI projects.  City support includes the Oregon City Council's commitment to finance one-half of the holiday lighting program and some of the administrative funds for CCI activities.  Local service organizations and individuals have financed the other half of the holiday lights.<p>

Lynn Kilker, Chairman of CCI, said, "This is only the beginning of our work in Oregon.  We are excited and CCI is working here!"<p>

<hr>
<h3>
FOUNDATION OF THE MONTH<br>
<em>by: Jeff Markland</em>
</h3>In the early years of development waterways, railroads, highways and air service determined market areas.<p>

The new "transportation system" is "ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS MODERNIZATION RESOURCES".  It is as critical to today's competitive community as any other.  Three kinds of resources comprise this foundation.<p>

Current generation (or "off the shelf") product and process technologies including the latest equipment, applications and materials.<p>

Easy access to expertise on business modernization techniques, and third is access to applied research and development of product or process technologies as well as knowledge of innovation at both the local and global level.<p>

Improving this foundation requires close working relationships with the local business community, telephone companies, utilities, technology users and the local communities.  An up-to-date communications system is critical to your communities economic growth.<p>

<h3>JOB  HOLDERS  AT  RECORD  LEVEL</h3>

Employment in Illinois topped 5,840,000 during October to reach an all-time high.  The Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES) reported that during the month the number of unemployed dropped nearly 8,900 while total employment grew by 20,210.  IDES added that total employment crossed the 5.8 million mark for the first time in January and remained above that level every month since, as job expansion held steady.<p>

Personal income growth held relatively stable in the second quarter with a 5.4 percent annualized increase.  The quarterly change compares to a 5.8 percent rise in the first quarter.  It was reported by the U.S. Department of Commerce that the leading growth in Illinois during the period occurred in the volatile farm income, which was up 29.9 percent over the previous quarter.  It was followed by finance, insurance and real estate with 3.2 percent and services at 1.9 percent quarterly growth.<p>

A report titled Export Markets for Illinois Coal indicated that the state's international shipments of coal increased 10-fold during 1995 to a record 2.7 million tons.  The study noted that the principal importers were Morocco, Germany, the United Kingdom and Denmark.  The report was released by Lieutenant Governor Bob Kustra who forecasts that Illinois' annual coal exports could realistically increase by another 3 to 5 million tons in the next decade.<p>

The Illinois Association of Realtors reported that the statewide median price of an existing home rose to $128,400 in the third quarter.  This was $4,300 above the cost of a year ago for a 3.5 percent increase during the period.  Prices in the Chicago metropolitan area also trended upward to $155,400 during the quarter, rising at a slightly higher 4.2 percent rate over the past 12 months.  Statewide, the 26,170 homes sold during the quarter was 417 units below the number purchased in the third quarter of last year as mortgage rates had risen a half point during this time.<p>

A November publication by the Illinois Economic and Fiscal Commission (IEFC) related that some softening has occurred in consumer spending, exports and manufacturing in the state.  They add that building permits and first-time unemployment insurance claims suggest less vigorous growth.  The IEFC's analysis foresees modest but stable growth in the months ahead. <p>

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth decreased to 102.3 in November from 102.7 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that the state index mirrors national economic trends.  They note that the steady but slow growth suggests moderate expansion in the second half of 1996 and into 1997.<p>

<hr>
<h3>AVERAGE  ANNUAL  PAY  BY  INDUSTRY</h3>

The average annual pay of $30,099 in Illinois was 8.1 percent above the national rate of $27,845 in 1995.  Both the state and national averages rose 3.4 percent last year with Illinois maintaining its eighth place ranking among the states.<p>

Among the industry classifications, mining retained its top pay position despite a modest 1.7 percent increase last year.  Finance, insurance and real estate also maintained its second position, with the assistance of the largest annual gain of 6.7 percent.  The smallest payroll increase was in government where the average pay rose 1.4 percent in 1995.<p> 

<hr>
<h3>ILLINOIS  HIGHLIGHTS</h3>

Seven Illinois firms made Forbes magazine's 1996 roster of the 200 Best Small Companies in America.  Their area of concentration was in health care, electronics, telecommunications and energy.<p>  

INC. magazine's recent annual top-500 list of America's fastest-growing companies included 20 firms that are headquartered in the state.<p>

There were five Illinois companies listed on Fortune magazine's 1996 ranking of the fastest-growing companies.<p>

<hr>
<h3>WEFA  - NOVEMBER  U.S.  ECONOMIC  OUTLOOK - FORECAST  OVERVIEW</h3>

The WEFA Group estimates that the economic expansion will continue for at least another year.  The forecasting firm notes that growth is slowing and adds that the indicators which typically signal a recession are not doing so now.  WEFA feels that over the next six months the probability of a recession will rise as economic growth slows and the yield curve flattens.<p> 

They expect employment growth to remain moderate over the next six months, wage gains to be noninflationary and economic growth to be about 2 percent.  WEFA adds that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates in such an environment.<p>

WEFA predicts that credit expansion will continue to decelerate.  They note that monthly payments on mortgages, consumer debt and vehicle leases have reached a critical point, which reveals the average consumer to be somewhat stretched.  WEFA estimates that consumers will remain cautious, spending their income gains without increasing their debt substantially.  They expect a subdued holiday selling season.<p>

WEFA forecasts that President Clinton and Vice President Gore in their second term will focus on cutting taxes for educational expenses, revising welfare reform, cleaning up the environment, keeping the deficit down, and fixing the financing for Medicare and Social Security.  WEFA estimates that the federal government purchases of goods and services, after inflation, will decline for a couple more years before leveling off. <p>

They expect exports to grow about 6 percent over the next couple of years and import growth will continue strong.  WEFA adds that net exports are no longer expected to contribute to growth over the next few years.<p>

They expect exports to grow about 6 percent over the next couple of years and import growth will continue strong.  WEFA adds that net exports are no longer expected to contribute to growth over the next few years.<p>

They relates that housing starts fell from a 1.53 million pace in August to a 1.44 pace in September, but new home sales were at a very high 816,000 rate in September.  WEFA notes that housing starts and sales are at a very high level, but feel that residential investment will not be contributing to much economic growth.  They feel that housing starts and sales are unlikely to rise from their current lofty heights.<p>

<h3>BALANCED ECONOMIC EXPANSION</h3>

The Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES) reported recently that the state is enjoying a balanced economic expansion with job growth continuing across several major industry groups led by services (36,600), trade (27,700) and manufacturing (6,900).  IDES added that for the first time in more than two years, jobs in finance, insurance and real estate have been steadily increasing, up more than 4,000 or 1.1 percent above September 1995.<p>

New business incorporations in Illinois have risen 2.7 percent through September.  During the first nine months, there were 27,057 filings with the Secretary of State compared to 26,356 incorporations a year ago.  Despite a slowdown the past two months, new domestic filings have increased  by over 700 incorporations this year.<p>

Retail sales continued to rebound from their mid-year sluggishness as receipts in August totaled $9 billion.  This was a $315 million gain over the previous August but down $123 million from the July total.  Overall, retail sales in the state have increased 3.5 percent year-to-date. 
Consumer prices in the Chicago metropolitan area rose at a moderate 2.8 percent rate in September, matching the August rate of change.  The increase was below the comparable 3 percent national level for September.  The Chicago all-urban rate trended upward in May, with the increase in energy costs, but it has remained relatively stable over the past four months.<p>

According to the October report by F. W. Dodge, contracts for future construction in Illinois are down 3.6 percent for the year.  Their nine month total of $9 billion is below last year's pace by $335 million.  This leading economic indicator reports that nonresidential construction is down 23.1 percent for the year, while nonbuilding (infrastructure improvements) contracts are off by 3 percent.  Residential construction has partially offset the other two categories with a 16.9 percent year-to-date increase.<p>
   
The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth decreased to 102.7 in October from 103.2 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that both personal income and corporate profits were sluggish in October.  They added that the two were offset somewhat by a surge in sales tax receipts. <p>

<h3>ILLINOIS  AGRICULTURAL  EXPORTS </h3>

With a strong 32.8 percent gain last year, feed grains (which includes corn) surged ahead of soybeans as the state's top agricultural export commodity during the 1995 federal fiscal year.  Large increases of agricultural crop purchases by Korea, Egypt, China, Spain and Germany boosted international shipments last year.  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Illinois exported nearly $3.5 billion in farm products in FFY 1995 for a 13.8 percent yearly increase.<p>

Over $1.5 billion or 44.2 percent of the state's sales to foreign nations were feed grains (primarily corn).  An additional $1.2 billion in crop shipments or 35.7 percent were soybeans and soy-products.  In combination, Illinois' exports of feed grains and soybeans accounted for 80 percent of its agricultural sales and 17.1 percent of the U.S. shipments of these products.  Overall, Illinois exported 6.4 percent of the nation's agricultural goods in FFY 1995, down from the 7 percent reported the previous period. <p>

<hr>
<h3>ILLINOIS HIGHLIGHTS</h3>

Illinois ranked second nationally in both feed grains (primarily corn) and soybean exports last year.  The state placed third overall in the international shipments of agricultural products.<p>

The U.S. Department of Commerce's first ranking of metropolitan areas by the value of their export shipments placed Chicago sixth.  Sales from the metro area totaled $17.3 billion in 1994 and primarily were manufactured products.  Non-manufactured commodities represented about 8 percent of the shipments.<p>

The National Foundation for Women Business Owners reported that Illinois ranks fifth out of the 50 states in the number of women-owned firms.  Illinois also placed fifth in employment and a similar rating for sales by women-owned firms.<p>

<hr>
<h3>DRI/MCGRAW HILL -OCTOBER ECONOMIC OUTLOOK-FORECAST OVERVIEW</h3>

The forecasting firm estimates that the U.S. economy is now operating close to capacity.  DRI feels that the strong growth in the first half of the year appears to be moderating in the second half.  They add that with the unemployment rate well below most economist's measures of full employment, above-trend growth is no longer possible for any extended period.<p>

DRI relates that the recent data suggest that, with the clear exception of housing, the economy may be cooling more quickly than expected.  Their forecast of third-quarter growth has been revised downward, primarily in net exports, where the data now suggests weaker exports and stronger imports.<p>

They predict that the economy should slow to near-trend growth in the second half of 1996 and then to below-trend growth in early 1997.  DRI expects that the Federal Reserve will keep trying to fine-tune the economy.  They estimate that the Fed will hike the funds rate by year-end and raise it to 6 percent by spring.<p>

DRI notes that business investment has been the strongest contributor to the economic expansion over the last four years.  They add that except for computers and "other" office equipment, business investment slowed late last year.  DRI expects computer outlays will slow in 1997 as early signs are beginning to appear.<p>

They also note that state and local spending will be constrained by budget problems and declining federal support.  DRI adds that rising educational outlays will limit the possibilities for further tax cuts.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS'  EXPORTS  TO  MEXICO  REBOUND</h3>

Exports to Mexico have risen sharply and returned to their record 1994 level.  Through the first half of this year shipments of Illinois goods have topped $1 billion, moving Mexico back to the state's third largest export market.  The 35 percent year-to-date gain was led by the strong increase in crops and coal shipments.  Canada and Japan continue to be Illinois' top foreign markets and along with Mexico account for over one-third of the states' exports.<p>

The Illinois Department of Employment Security reported that Illinois employment remains solid with strong growth in trade and moderate expansion across other industries, including services and manufacturing.  They noted that brisk tourism activity in August pushed total employment in trade to the second-highest level on record, 1,355,000.  IDES added that the number of people filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits declined 2.1 percent from the year-ago level.<p>

Manpower Inc.'s fourth quarter 1996 Employment Outlook Survey indicated that 27 percent of the participating employers in Illinois planned to increase the size of their workforce while 8 percent anticipate a decrease.  Additionally, 61 percent expected no change.  By percentage, the DeKalb/Sycamore and Champaign area employers were the most optimistic in the state followed by the Bloomington and North Riverside areas.<p>

Retail sales have experienced some up-and-down months recently as receipts soared in May, declined in June and rebounded in July.  The $9 billion July total was the sixth largest on record, topped only by the $9.2 billion sales in May and the past three Decembers' receipts.  The weather may have aided the monthly total as the unseasonally mild summer made shopping easier.<p>

Coldwell Banker Commercial's industrial vacancy index for the Chicago area rose to 7.2 percent in the second quarter from 6.6 percent a year ago.  CB Commercial also reported that their commercial office vacancy index for the Chicago metropolitan area decreased to 14.6 percent from 15.8 percent during the same 12 month period.  The Chicago area industrial rate is below the 7.4 percent U.S. level, while the metropolitan office rate is above the national rate of 13.1 percent.<p>

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth registered 103.2 in September from 104.2 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that sales tax collections were sluggish, while corporate tax payments rose modestly and personal income tax collections were strong in September.<p>

<hr>
<h3>ILLINOIS' BUSINESS TAX COMPETITIVENESS</h3>

A study by Robert Tannenwald, Senior Economist of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston compares after-tax returns on capital investments in 22 states.  The report placed Illinois sixth for the best overall return for the five representative types of manufacturing firms selected.  The study reviews indicators of tax competitiveness which focus on the taxes that most directly affect a firm's bottom line and measures their impact on the profitability of potential business investment projects.  The analysis is not limited to taxes on corporate profits and net worth.  Property taxes and, in some cases, sales taxes and unemployment insurance taxes are also taken into account.<p>

The report finds that the business tax climate exerts only a small, highly uncertain effect on capital spending.  It adds that states may be more likely to stimulate their economy by enhancing public services valued by businesses.  It should also be noted that since the year from which the data was taken, Illinois has placed strong emphasis on reducing business costs.<p>

<hr>
<h3>Illinois Highlights</h3>

This year's list of FORTUNE magazine's "Most Admired Companies" included 11 Illinois headquartered firms in the top 100 companies.<p>

State Farm Insurance of Bloomington reports that their current employment within Illinois has reached 12,500.  Their large headquarter staff along with their network of claims offices places them 25th on the 1996 list of the Top In-State Employers.<p>


DCCA's Illinois Bureau of Tourism's award winning  "Million Miles from Monday" advertising campaign reports that telephone interest has increased 84 percent year-to-date through August.  Calls to their 1-800-2-CONNECT allow vacationers to contact travel counselors for help with their specific getaway plans. <p>   

<hr>
<h3>WEFA - SEPTEMBER - U.S. Economic Outlook - Forecast Overview</h3>

The forecasting firm expects increasingly moderate employment gains in the second half of 1996.  WEFA relates that as economic growth softens, job gains will diminish.  It's their view that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates because there are sufficient signs of economic weakness to allow the Fed to postpone any decision until the evidence of inflationary pressure is overwhelming.  They note however that the risk of the Fed raising interest rates has increased since the economy is doing fairly well and labor markets continue to tighten. <p> 

WEFA predicts that productivity growth will improve over the next year, reducing the inflationary impact of wage gains.  They add that though wage and employment gains have become more robust recently, productivity increases will compensate for the higher wage costs, keeping inflation in check.<p>

They anticipate that labor force growth will improve.  WEFA estimates that this will take some of the pressure off of the labor market, keeping wage gains only slightly above the pace of inflation.<p>

WEFA expects gasoline prices to rise by 2 to 5 cents per gallon within the next month, as the impact of the collapse of the Iraqi oil-for-humanitarian-aid program filters through to the consumer market.  They feel that this is too small of a price change to affect consumers, or the economy, significantly. <p>

They note that real consumption expenditures were down in July and likely to drag down real Gross Domestic Product growth to close to 1.5 percent.  WEFA adds that vehicle sales have fallen off pretty much as expected and this explains a great deal of the decline in consumption.<p>

WEFA forecasts that exports are expected to grow by about 7 percent to 8 percent over the next couple of years.  They report that import growth continues to be surprisingly strong and will average about 6 percent growth.<p>

<h3>FAVORABLE  LABOR  MARKET  CONDITIONS</h3>

In a recent news release, the Illinois Department of Employment Security reported that Illinois' total employment exceeded 5.8 million for the first time in January and has maintained that record; the state's unemployment level has been below 5.5 percent for 21 straight months; and Illinois has been at or below the U.S. unemployment level for nearly three years.  They added that payroll expansion over the past year was paced by gains in trade (25,950), services (31,050) and manufacturing (10,500).<p>

Initial jobless claims in the state have continued at a higher rate however. In comparative months, new filings have risen for over a year with only a June decrease. Year-to-date jobless claims are ahead of last year's pace by 30,383 filings or 7.6 percent.<p>

Exports continued their positive growth,  but the pace has moderated from the strong double-digit expansion of the past three years.  Through the first six months of this year, shipments have reached $15.4 billion for an increase of 5.9 percent.  Both manufactured and nonmanufactured goods have posted increases, with the latter recording the largest percentage gain.  The strong demand for grain products and coal has boosted international shipments of nonagriculture products to 48.7 percent above last year's first half level.<p>

According to the Illinois Association of Realtors, the 1996 second quarter statewide median sales price of an existing home rose to $127,600.  This was higher than a year ago by $8,900 or 7.5 percent.  During the quarter, the number of homes sold totaled 27,160, nearly 3,000 more than last year's second quarter.  By locale, average prices ranged from $362,800 in the Barrington area to $153,100 in the Chicago metro market and $34,300 in the Kewanee area.<p>

The number of business failures in the state rose while the amount of losses decreased during the first seven months.  Dun & Bradstreet reported that 1,235 firms in Illinois ceased operations with financial losses to creditors so far this year, compared to 1,072 during the first seven months of 1995.  The size of the liabilities dropped sharply however, declining to $317 million from $455 million last year for a for a 30.3 percent year-to-date descent.<p>

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth registered 104.2 in August from 104.9 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that both retail sales and corporate profits in Illinois were lower last month than for August a year ago in real (inflation-adjusted) terms, while personal income rose.<p>

<hr>
<h3>LARGEST  EMPLOYERS  IN  ILLINOIS</h3>

The listing of the top employers within the state was derived from a variety of sources.  Both private and public data bases were utilized with the primary information provided by the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation.  Totals were cross checked where possible with data from Crain's Chicago Business, the Chicago Tribune and the Illinois Department of Employment Security.  The employment estimates are rounded to hundreds and also reflect the total of organizations with multiple locations in Illinois.  A top 15 listing of the largest employers in each county has also been prepared.<p>
  
<hr>
<h3>DRI/McGraw Hill - August - U.S. Economic Outlook - Forecast Overview</h3>

The forecasting firm relates that housing has remained surprisingly strong, despite the rise in mortgage rates.  DRI adds that the recent drop in new home sales suggests that the higher interest rates may be beginning to bite, but sales are still above year-ago levels.  They expect sales and housing starts to drop later this year.<p>

DRI finds that business investment slowed sharply in the second quarter.  They specify that a slowdown in computer sales was a major factor but note that other categories of business investment also softened.  DRI forecasts that computer sales will bounce back later this year.<p>

They relate that employment growth slowed in July but mention that the 193,000 new jobs are still above trend.  DRI feels that the rise in the unemployment rate to 5.4 percent was a correction from the excessive June drop and brings the rate back into the range it occupied for the previous 20 months.<p>

DRI reports that inflation remains calm.  They note that the acceleration in wages is offset by the slow growth of fringe benefit costs.  DRI adds that productivity has been weak during this business cycle.<p>

They relate that export growth weakened in the second quarter, while imports continued to surge.  DRI notes that the higher dollar has had little impact on trade but could keep exports sluggish later this year.  They add that the strong import growth and widening trade gap are caused by the strength of the U.S. economy relative to our trading partners.<p>

<h3>PERSONAL INCOME AND GSP POST QUARTERLY INCREASES</h3>

First quarter personal income in Illinois rose at a 5.9 percent annualized rate for its twelfth consecutive quarterly increase.  In current dollars this was a $4.3 billion gain over the previous quarter and a $13.5 billion improvement over a year ago.  Earnings in retail trade led the advance with a 10.6 percent annualized gain followed by construction with 7.9 percent and services at 6.2 percent.<p>

In a comparable report, Illinois' first quarter Gross State Product rose at a 3.1 percent annualized rate.  The chain-weighted constant dollar increase followed a relatively flat quarter and continued the sawtooth pattern of last year.  <p>

The Illinois Department of Employment Security reported that Illinois' labor force expanded to 6,158,917 in June to reach a new high.  Employment also continued at a high level topping 5.8 million for the sixth straight month.  IDES added that the unemployment rate has remained stable in the low range of 5.1 percent to 5.3 percent, reflecting the continued strength of the Illinois economy.<p>

Retail sales topped $9.27 billion in May for the largest non-December monthly total on record.  Despite the lofty level, receipts are up a modest 3.6 percent year-to-date.  Nationally, retail sales have increased 6.8 percent during the period.<p>

Construction activity in Illinois is up slightly for the year according to F. W. Dodge's report on contracts for future construction.  Through the first six months of the year, contracts are positive by 0.9 percent.  The mainstay has been residential construction which is above last year's pace by 17.4 percent.  Nonbuilding contracts (infrastructure improvements) also were up by 2.5 percent with nonresidential construction off 18.4 percent.<p>

New business incorporations in the state declined in June after three months of growth.  Domestic filings were off by 188 from the previous June, but the 18,931 year-to-date total  is ahead of last year's pace by 772 incorporations or 4.3 percent.<p>

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth rose slightly to 104.9 in July from 104.8 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that the Illinois economy grew moderately last month, reflecting the go-slow expansion of the national economy after four years of growth.  They added that both income and corporate profits in Illinois were strong in July but noted that they were somewhat offset by weak retail sales, as measured by sales-tax collections. <p>


<hr>
<h3>ILLINOIS  EXCELS  IN  MANUFACTURING - PART II</h3>

The previous edition of the Illinois Economic Bulletin listed the 35 industrial categories in which the state was the national leader.  This issue presents the 44 classifications in which Illinois placed second in value of shipments. It is notable that the amount of commercial printing is larger than the items rated number one.  The listing is in standard industrial classification order (not shown due to the limited space).<p>


<hr>
<h3>ILLINOIS  HIGHLIGHT</h3>

The 1996 Olympic theme song "Reach" recorded by Gloria Estefan was written by Chicago song writer Diane Warren, reportedly in one day.<p>


<hr>
<h3>WEFA - JULY - U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK - FORECAST OVERVIEW</h3>

WEFA predicts that employment growth will moderate in the second half of 1996 as housing activity weakens, vehicle sales slump, exports to Europe dampen and nonresidential construction falls.<p>

They forecast that the Fed will continue to hold the funds rate at 5.25 percent for the time being.  WEFA notes that employment growth has spooked the bond market, but expect that inflation is unlikely to accelerate.  They add that as further evidence of moderate inflation unfolds and signs of slower growth appear, bond prices will rise, lowering yields of long-term bonds.<p>

WEFA anticipates that consumer price inflation will remain close to 2.5 percent per year.  They estimate that as economic growth moderates, inflationary pressures will ease keeping inflation stable.<p>

They predict that export growth will remain close to 8 percent for the rest of the year and into 1997.  WEFA anticipates that import growth will moderate, but only slightly.  They add that it now looks unlikely that exports will boom sufficiently to add much to real GDP growth in the second half of 1996 and 1997.<p>

WEFA forecasts a tough and prolonged negotiation between the unions and management in the automobile industry this summer and fall.  They feel that the probability of a strike is high.<p>

<hr>
<h3>NONFARM EMPLOYMENT SETS RECORD IN MAY</h3>

Nonagricultural jobs reached a new level in May, topping 5.7 million for the first time.  The preliminary monthly count was 96,600 above last year's May total with 43 percent of the growth occurring in services.  Business services alone added 14,400 jobs (6,900 in personnel supply) with health services expanding by 6,900.  Employment in retail trade grew by 19,500, of which 8,800 jobs were in eating and drinking places.  Manufacturing also added 11,100 jobs over the year, with government employment increasing by 9,300.<p>
        
Retail sales totaled $8.5 billion in April to set a new high for the month.  Data from the U.S. Department of Commerce indicates that March's receipts topped last year's total by $178 million.  The unusual weather pattern this year has produced a sawtooth type movement in retail sales in the state, but year-to-date receipts are above last year by 3.4 percent after sales averaged 3 percent in 1995.<p>

The U.S. Department of Commerce also recently released metropolitan area economic projections which predict that the Chicago area will have the nation's largest increase in jobs by the year 2005.  Issued by Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, the forecast estimates that the Chicago metropolitan area will add 763,00 jobs between 1993 and 2005.  They also project that the area's population will grow by 716,000 during this period to 8,328,000 residents.<p>    

CB Commercial Real Estate Group reported that their industrial vacancy index for Chicago registered 6.3 percent in the first quarter, up from 6.1 percent the previous quarter, but down from the 8 percent of a year ago.  Their commercial office vacancy index for the Chicago metropolitan area also declined to 14.8 percent from 15.2 percent in the fourth quarter as both indexes moved to within one percent of the national averages.<p>    

According to the Illinois Association of Realtors, the median sale price of an existing single family home rose 6.8 percent in the first quarter over the cost of a year ago.  The statewide average reached $120,300 with the quarterly amount for the Chicago metro area increasing to $146,500.  The association added that there was a 1.3 percent gain in the number of units sold year-to-date.  They also noted that interest rates were edging up, but related that their national office predicts that rates would begin to stabilize, resulting in strong sales in 1996.  <p>

The U.S. Bankruptcy Courts reported that filings by Illinois businesses were up 5.1 percent in the first quarter.  Their three district courts in the state posted 434 quarterly cases compared to 413 last year and 471 two years ago.  While the business filings in Illinois rose at a moderate pace, non-business cases were more pronounced.  With a change in the bankruptcy code last year, non-business filings in the state increased to 12,219 in the first quarter from 9,411 a year ago.<p>

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth registered 104.8 in June down from 105.1 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that the state's economy will continue to grow moderately without pushing up inflation.  They also related that both personal income and corporate profits in Illinois were strong in June, but they were offset by anemic sales of retail goods.<p>  

<hr>
<h3>ILLINOIS  EXCELS  IN  MANUFACTURING</h3>

From cookies and candy to construction machinery and basic nuts and bolts, the state is the national production leader in 35 industrial categories.  In Illinois, manufacturing accounts for about 19.2 percent of its Gross State Product with an estimated value of $66 billion.  Its historical strength provides an important component to the state's diverse economy.<p>

<hr>
<h3>DRI/MCGRAW-HILL - JUNE  U.S.  ECONOMIC  OUTLOOK - FORECAST  OVERVIEW</h3>

DRI/McGraw-Hill states that the 1995 economic stall has ended.  They estimate that the economy is now in a growth  mode and has already reached full employment.  DRI forecasts that inflation is edging up, and feel that the Fed needs to respond with higher interest rates.<p> 
  
They expect housing starts in the second quarter to be strong.  DRI notes that consumer confidence is high and mortgage rates are still moderate.  They think that this year could match the 1994 peak in housing starts.<p>

The forecasting firm predicts that state and local governments will remain under serious budget constraints because of lower grants in aid and increased growth of the school age population.  They anticipate mild increases in state and local spending but note that the pressure for lower taxes will restrain spending growth.<p>

DRI predicts that foreign trade is likely to improve in 1996, in part because of the recovery in the Mexican and Japanese economies.  They note that the recessions in these two countries were major factors in restraining export growth in 1995.  DRI adds  that the European economies look less robust, but also seem likely to have a better 1996 than 1995.<p>

<h3>NEW BUSINESS INCORPORATIONS SET MONTHLY RECORD</h3>

Entrepreneurial optimism abounded in April with a record setting 3,770 domestic business filings.  The large monthly total topped the previous high set in December, 1992 by 280 incorporations.  April's surge added to March's substantial filings, increasing the year-to-date total to 7.6 percent above a year ago.  In the first four months, new business incorporations have risen by 910 filings over last year's growth.<p>

Following a lackluster March, the U.S. Department of Commerce reported that residential building in the state rebounded in April.  Their numbers indicate that  housing starts rose to a near record 5,418 units authorized for construction during the month.  A relatively drier April  allowed building activity to progress more rapidly with year-to-date permit issuance above last year's level by 12.2 percent.<p> 
  
The Chicago all urban consumer price index rose 2.2 percent in April from last year's level as overall costs moderated.  The major upward push in prices occurred in energy, led by natural gas and followed by motor fuel cost increases.  Offsetting the rise were subdued medical care costs and a decline in apparel and upkeep.  Without energy costs,  the index would have risen only 1.6 percent in April.<p>

The Department of Employment Security reported that after setting a new record in January, total employment in the state remained above 5.8 million for the fourth consecutive month.  IDES added that the unemployment rate at 5.1 percent in April experienced little change since the previous month and has remained below the U.S. level for 30 straight months.<p>

Employment in manufacturing was up by 12,800 in April over the previous year with growth occurring primarily in durable goods.  Approximately 9,500 jobs were added in the production of industrial machinery with the manufacture of electronic equipment expanding by 3,300 workers.  Nationally, there has been a sharp decline in manufacturing employment over the past year.<p>

An economic forecasting firm, Regional Financial Associates, related that the Chicago-metro area trails only the San Jose and Boston areas in the number of high-tech manufacturing jobs with nearly 163,000.  RFA added that the Chicago area is enjoying steadily increasing high-tech employment led by the Motorola and U.S. Robotics (modems) expansions.<p>  

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth registered 105.1 in May from 106.1 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that evidence grows the Illinois economy is slowing to a more moderate pace after two years of rapid expansion.<p>

<h3>ILLINOISANS  INCREASE  PERSONAL INCOME IN 1995</h3>

Per capita personal income rose $1,156 last year reaching an average of $24,763 for each state resident in 1995.  The 4.9 percent increase moved the state to eighth place from ninth the previous year.  Illinois was the only state in the Midwest to appear in the top 10, with eastern states heading the listing.<p>  

Illinois also placed highly in total personal income with its $293 billion overall amount, ranking fifth among the states.  The 5.6 percent growth in 1995 was slightly below the 6 percent national increase, as farm income declined last year.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS HIGHPOINTS</h3>

  At an estimated $350 billion in 1995, Illinois' gross state product ( GSP ) is fourth among the states.  Compared to other nations' gross national products ( GNP ), Illinois' GSP is larger than all but 12 worldwide. <p> 

  Illinois placed fifth with $32.6 billion in exports last year, and its 23.6 percent annual increase was the largest among the top 10 exporting states.<p>

  Researchers at the University of Illinois recently announced that they have developed a new computer chip which runs faster, and last up to 50 times longer.  The chip making process replaces regular hydrogen with deuterium, resulting in a chip which can handle more electricity, while adding only a small amount to the cost.<p>    

<hr>
<h3>WEFA - MAY U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK - FORECAST OVERVIEW</h3>

  WEFA predicts that the economy's surprisingly strong performance will be sustained for an additional quarter.  They forecast that by the second half of the year, growth will slow to the 2 percent range.  WEFA anticipates that the Federal Reserve will respond by the end of the year with an additional reduction in the Fed Funds rate, because inflation will remain under control.<p>
    
  The forecasting firm notes that the pickup in oil and grain prices cannot create inflation without sufficiently tight labor markets. They add that the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment cost index indicates that wage inflation remains moderate.<p>

  WEFA reports that business investment in equipment will decelerate from its very fast pace since capacity is less imperative at this time.  They anticipate that investment in structures will grow modestly, as businesses build industrial plant and commercial structures in response to low vacancy rates.<p>    

  They predict that the impact of 1995's drop in mortgage rates on the housing market is over.  They add that for the rest of 1996, mortgage rates are likely to drift downward, sustaining housing starts at close to 1.4 million units.<p>

  WEFA relates that despite a poor trade performance in the first quarter, U.S. exports remain competitive.  They forecast that the recovery in Mexico and Japan will allow U.S. exports to maintain high expansion rates, even without strong growth in Europe.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS' ECONOMIC GROWTH OUTPACES THE NATIONAL RATE</h3>

The value of the goods and services produced in the state during 1995 totaled $350 billion for a $16.4 billion gain over the previous year.  In chain-weighted constant dollars the Illinois GSP rose to $325 billion for a 2.4 percent annual increase.  Last year's advance topped the 2.0 percent national GNP rate, marking the third time out of the past four years that the state's economy has exceeded the U.S. growth level.<p>   

The U.S. Department of Commerce reported that total personal income in Illinois rose 5.6 percent in 1995.  On a per capita basis, income reached $24,763 from $23,607 the previous year moving the state to eighth in the nation from ninth in 1994.  By major category, income growth was led by a 8.7 percent increase in services along with a 6.8 percent advance in transportation, communications and public utilities.  The overall growth was partially muted by a noticeable reduction in farm income last year.<p>         

The Illinois Department of Agriculture in its April 1 release estimated that the corn crop acreage will increase 14 percent this year to 11.6 million acres.  They cite the current high prices, low supply and anticipated reduction in the Government Feed Grain Program set-aside acreage to zero.  IDA estimates that soybean planting intentions are 9.75 million acres and equal to last year's record level.  They noted that the supply of all major grain in the state is presently down from the stock of a year earlier.<p>  

Exports in February increased 5.6 percent over last year for a gain of nearly $130 million.  The $2.46 billion monthly total was the sixth largest ever despite record cold weather in early February.  The shipment of nonmanufactured commodities (grain, coal, etc.) aided the growth and accounted for $43 million of the monthly increase.  Last year, overall exports exceeded the previous year by 24.5 percent with manufactured products accounting for 90.7 percent of the state's international shipments.<p> 

According to the March report by F.W. Dodge, contracts for future construction in Illinois are up 8.7 percent for the year.  Their three month total of $2,370 million for the state is comparable to the record pace of two years ago.  Nonbuilding (infrastructure improvements) contracts led the quarterly increase with a 16.8 percent gain, followed by residential with 8.3 percent growth and nonresidential building which rose 1.4 percent.<p>          

After a sluggish start in January, retail sales rebounded in February registering $7.8 billion.  The robust monthly increase was $612 million above the previous February for a 8.6 percent gain.  This boosted the year-to-date total to 5.5 percent above the first two months of a year ago continuing the upward trend of the past two years.<p>   

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth registered 106.1 in April from a revised 106.3 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that the personal income and retail sales sectors of the Illinois economy were relatively strong in April while corporate profits were down from their recent high rate of growth.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS HIGHPOINTS</h3>

  Once again Illinois cities placed high in the National Association of Home Builders fourth quarter 1995 list of affordable housing markets.  Among 192 metropolitan areas Champaign-Urbana ranked 6th, Springfield 13th, Peoria 24th, Rockford 26th and Chicago 129th.<p>

  In 1995, Illinois' 1.13 billion-bushel corn yield ranked second nationally, with its 373 million-bushel soybean crop also placing second and its 68 million bushels of winter wheat output ranked eighth. <p>

  Three Illinois events were selected by the American Bus Association for inclusion in the 1996 Top 100 Events in North America: the Oldsmobile Balloon Classic, Danville, June 7-9; Big River Rendezvous, Moline and Rock Island, October 10-13; and Splendor & Majesty, Rockford, December 6-8.<p>

<h3>DRI/McGRAW-HILL -- APRIL U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK - FORECAST OVERVIEW</h3>

  DRI/McGraw-Hill estimates that the economy is heating up.  They predict that the first quarter will be weak, and that spring and summer look stronger than previously expected.  They add that the unemployment rate, at 5.6 percent, is as low as the Federal Reserve is likely to permit, suggesting that the loosening is over for the year.  DRI projects that after a second-quarter rebound, economic growth should stabilize near its trend level of 2.1 percent.  They predict that the Fed will have to tighten by mid-1997. <p>

  The forecasting firm notes that consumer spending, led by automotive sales, has rebounded.  They anticipate that spending will be slower in 1996 than in the past two years, but will keep up with incomes and the Gross Domestic Product.<p>        

  DRI expects housing sales to drop back in response to the recent jump in mortgage rates.  They add that office and motel construction are finally rebounding, while retail and industrial space have accelerated.  They forecast that this trend will continue through 1996.<p>

  They relate that inventories were accumulated even more slowly than estimated in the fourth quarter.  DRI estimates that the level of inventory is still too high, but the General Motors strike reduced much of the excess in the first quarter.  They add that overall, inventories are expected to be less of a drag on the economy in 1996 than in 1995.<p>   

  DRI notes that inflation remains low, in large part because of the sharp slowdown in the growth of fringe benefit costs.  They expect consumer price inflation to accelerate slightly but to remain below 3 percent.<p>

<h3>RECORD RETAIL SALES IN STATE LAST YEAR</h3>

The U.S. Department of Commerce reported that retail receipts in the state exceeded $104.5 billion in 1995 to top the previous year by 4.7 percent.  A preliminary $11 billion December boosted last year's record level as the rate of growth held relatively stable throughout the year.  Sales were particularly expansive in Chicago where they increased 7.4 percent, reaching $15 billion in 1995.<p>

Despite a colder than normal winter, residential building permits in the state are off to their best start in six years.  Through February there were 4,903 construction authorizations issued compared to 4,545 permits a year ago.  The 7.9 percent year-to-date increase continues the slow upward building trend that began last summer when interest rates were reduced.  <p>

The U.S. Department of Labor reported that the Chicago All Urban Consumer Price Index for February rose a modest 1.9 percent from the rate of a year ago.  The news release indicated that medical care costs led the 12 month increase, rising a subdued 2.8 percent.  It was followed by housing expenses and transportation costs that both increased 2.6 percent.  Partially offsetting these categories was apparel and upkeep which declined 2.9 percent during the period.<p>

According to the Illinois Department of Employment Security the state posted record employment for the second consecutive month, reaching 5,829,743 in February.  IDES added that the number of people unemployed in the state dropped 15,483 over the month, from 330,359 to 314,876.  They noted that Illinois' economy demonstrated vigorous growth, adding 121,300 non-farm payroll jobs compared to February 1995 for a 2.2 percent increase.<p>       

In another labor market indicator, initial jobless claims have increased by 28,982 year-to-date.  IDES's data indicates that the upward rate of growth has tapered off and is similar to the 1993 level. During January there were 94,493 first-time filings and 64,020 initial claims in February, which is 22.4 percent above last year's rate.<p>

A recent report by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts listed 1,624 business bankruptcy cases in the state last year.  This was 127 less than the 1994 filings for a 7.3 percent decrease.  Business bankruptcies in Illinois have trended downward the past four years as the overall economy has improved.  Nonbusiness filings also were declining until last year when they increased 13.8 percent, totaling 41,147 in 1995.<p>  

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth registered 106.1 in March from 107.1 the previous month.  Its compilers reported that after a diminished economic performance in March, the Illinois economy may experience slightly slower growth.  They noted that any reading above 100 indicates future growth of the state's economy.  They added that the current reading suggests a continuation of expansion, although probably at a more moderate rate.<p>

<h3>CHICAGO METRO AREA # 1 IN 1995 NEW/EXPANDED FACILITIES</h3>

Site Selection magazine reported that "Chicago's on a tear, racking up the highest count of new facilities and expansions during 1995 than any other U.S. metro area," in their annual tally of corporate projects.  The city was described as "the runaway winner among all U.S. metros" with 265 new and expanded facilities last year.  Chicago attracted 101 new manufacturing plants in 1995 lead by the Chicago Recycling Corporation's $250 million facility.  Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Illinois also added to the growth with its new $200 million headquarters.<p>

The large Chicago metro total boosted Illinois' ranking to fifth among the states with 451 new corporate facilities and expansions last year.  It also placed fourth with 142 new manufacturing plants in the state during 1995.  The magazine noted the significance of Illinois' new tort reform measures in attracting businesses.  It also included reference to the state's skilled workforce, central location, highly developed infrastructure (world's busiest airport, etc.) and advanced information technologies.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS HIGHPOINTS</h3>
<ul type=square>
<li>O'Hare International Airport in Chicago retained its top world ranking last year by providing service to 67.2 million passengers.  Nearby Lambert Field in St. Louis with 25.7 million travelers placed second internationally for major airport growth with an increase of 10.1 percent.<p>  
<li>Several Illinois universities received a top rating by U.S. News & World Report in their annual educational institutions rankings.  Within the classification of reputation rank by academics" Northwestern University and the University of Chicago received a number one rating (tying for the highest position with several other schools) for their Graduate Schools of Business.  The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign attained top rankings for its graduate programs in Advertising, Civil Engineering and Library Science.<p>  
<li>A recent edition of Technology Industry Growth Forecaster indicated that Chicago, Oak Brook and St. Charles were among the top 30 cities nationally for telecommunications equipment and services jobs.<p>  
</ul>

<h3>WEFA - MARCH U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK - FORECAST OVERVIEW</h3>
<ul type=square>
<li>WEFA expects real Gross Domestic Product growth will pick up speed in future quarters   after a two-quarter slowdown.  They estimate that GDP growth will average a little over 2 percent per year from 1995 through 1998.  WEFA adds that most areas of the economy are   weak, with the exceptions of services, business investment and exports.<p>
<li>They project that service employment, demand and wage growth will help steady economic  gains in the future.  WEFA also expects construction employment will rise due to increases in public and nonresidential construction activity.<p>
<li>WEFA forecasts that wages in most service sectors will continue growing more rapidly than manufacturing wages.  They note that international competition will keep costs, including labor costs, down in the manufacturing sector.  WEFA feels that the rising demand for services will continue to push up wages in the services industries.<p>
<li>They predict that business investment in equipment and structures will continue growing more rapidly than the overall economy.  They anticipate equipment spending will expand at a 5 percent pace in 1996 with investments in nonresidential structures increasing about 4 percent.<p>
<li>WEFA estimates that the federal deficit will fall modestly in 1996 as government purchases are down due to the continuing resolutions and the lack of a budget agreement.  They project that government health care costs will rise at a 7 percent to 8 percent rate over the next 10 years.  WEFA also predicts that federal revenue growth will keep pace with income growth.<p>
<li>They forecast that the impact of lower mortgage rates on the housing market is mostly over.  WEFA predicts that a modest decline in mortgage rates and an improvement in employment growth in 1996 will stabilize housing starts at a 1.40 million unit annual rate.<p>
<li>WEFA expects the nation's exports to record robust gains in 1996, led by competitive sectors such as capital goods and industrial supplies.  They anticipate that net exports will add a 0.4 percentage point to the GNP growth in 1996, after subtracting a 0.1 percentage point in 1995.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS EXPORTS TOP PREVIOUS YEAR'S TOTAL</h3>

Illinois' exports continued their strong growth with over $2.6 billion in direct shipments during November.  The monthly total was the third largest on record, led by manufactured goods that posted their 12th consecutive $2 billion plus month. In just ten months the state's international shipments exceeded the 1994 total and are ahead by 26.4 percent on a year-to-date comparison. The favorable exchange rate and competitive products aided in maintaining the high level of exports. The annual growth rate of shipments from Illinois is nearly double the national rate of increase.<p>

In late February, the U.S. Department of Commerce reported that Illinois' third quarter personal income grew at a 4.8 percent annualized rate for its tenth consecutive quarterly increase.  In current dollars this was a $17.1 billion gain from a year ago and a 6.1 percent increase during this period.  Among the major industrial categories, services led the 12 month advance with an increase of 8.2 percent followed by the wholesale trade with 6.4 percent and finance, insurance and real estate at 5.2 percent.  At the other end of growth, mining posted a 1.2 percent gain as all industrial classifications registered quarterly increases.<p>

The Illinois Department of Employment Security reported that their non-farm payroll survey in January indicated a 140,000 job increase over the monthly level of a year ago. IDES added that the classifications with large gains included 20,400 in business services (which contains personnel supply), 19,000 in manufacturing (4,000 in electronics and 2,900 in fabricated metals), 18,200 in retail trade (13,000 in eating and drinking establishments), 10,800 in engineering and management, 9,900 in wholesale trade, 8,800 in health services, and 7,500 in trucking and warehousing.<p>

After a record year in 1994, contracts for future construction decreased 3.7 percent last year.  The $11.6 billion in 1995 was the state's second highest total, after the previous year's $12 billion.  Last year's amount will likely be revised slightly upward as contracts are expanded and building estimates are exceeded.  The interest rate sensitive construction industry began the year very sluggishly and improved as the rates declined.  The nonbuilding (infrastructure improvements) category dropped the most at 13 percent followed by residential with a 11.3 percent decrease.  Nonresidential construction was positive with a strong 14 percent gain as available industrial space became more in demand.<p>

The Illinois Association of Realtors reported that the median sale price of an existing single-family home in the state last year was $120,500.  This is up more than $5,000 over the 1994 price of $115,300 for a 4.5 percent increase.  Residential prices in the Chicago metropolitan area rose to $146,200 in 1995, topping the previous year by 2.1 percent.  The number of existing home sales in Illinois decreased by 1.1 percent however, after a sluggish start in the first two quarters.  Sales rebounded in the second half of 1995 as lower mortgage rates boosted purchases.<p>
  
The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth registered 107.1 in February from 106.5 the previous month.  Its compilers noted that all three components of the Index - personal income, corporate profits and retail sales - showed significant growth in February over results for February 1995.<p>

<h3>AFRICAN AMERICAN-OWNED AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES IN ILLINOIS</h3>

The U.S. Department of Commerce recently released two summary reports that provided highlights of forthcoming expanded releases titled 1992 Black-Owned Businesses and 1992 Women-Owned Businesses.  The data in both reports were collected  from a large sample of all non-farm businesses filing tax forms that showed receipts of $500 or more in 1992.   Both releases indicated that the Illinois firms were close to or exceeded the national averages as to the percentage growth in the number of firms and their sales and receipts increases.<p>

The 1992 Black-Owned Businesses release indicates that African American firms in Illinois have increased 49.6 percent since 1987 compared to a 46.4 percent rate for the nation.  During this  period, all U.S. businesses grew at a 26 percent rate and increased their revenue by 67 percent.   African American firms in Illinois improved their sales and receipts by 61.2 percent, while nationally the rate was 62.9 percent for black-owned businesses.<p>

Women-owned businesses were described in the report as being substantial and growing contributors to the nation's economy as they represent one-third of all U.S. firms.  In Illinois, their number has risen by 41.5 percent compared to a 43.1 percent gain for the nation's women-owned businesses.  Sales and receipts in particular have grown rapidly with a five year gain of 139.8 percent in Illinois and a 131 percent increase nationally.<p>

<h3>DRI/McGraw-Hill - - FEBRUARY U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK - FORECAST OVERVIEW</h3>

  DRI is projecting that the 1996 U.S. Gross Domestic Product will be near 2 percent based upon the new chain-weighted methodology.  They forecast stronger GDP growth in 1997 and 1998 and add that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut the funds rate at least two more times until the economy accelerates this summer.<p>

  They also report that consumer spending slowed sharply during the Christmas season.  DRI adds that high debt levels may be inducing consumers to pull back on spending, and the bad weather is certainly encouraging them to stay home.  They expect more caution on the part of consumers but no major retrenchment.<p>

  DRI relates that inventories jumped in the fourth quarter because of weak retail sales and high car production.  They anticipate a slow and steady destocking in 1996.<p>

  They add that residential construction has not continued its autumn rebound, despite lower mortgage rates.  DRI notes that even in parts of the country not afflicted by blizzards, home sales have been disappointing.  They expect sales to remain stable, but feel that the hoped-for rebound seems less likely.<p>

   DRI reports that nonresidential construction remains strong.  They mention that office construction has stopped declining, while retail and industrial space has accelerated.  They forecast that this trend will continue through 1996. <p>

  They also mention that federal spending will drop off, even without an overall budget agreement.  DRI expects the government will muddle through fiscal 1996 with no reconciliation bill but no further shutdowns.  They add that departments will operate on continuing resolutions until their individual budgets are passed, which will imply lower discretionary spending.<p>

  DRI relates that inflation remains low.  They note that this past year will be the fifth consecutive year of below 3 percent inflation in the consumer price index.  They add that it's the first time there has been five back-to-back years below 3 percent in 30 years.<p>

  They report that employment dropped sharply in January.  DRI feels that the decline was a fluke caused by the blizzard and the federal shutdown, which may have distorted the employment survey.<p>

<HR>
<H3>STRONG ECONOMIC YEAR FOR STATE IN 1995</H3>

Available information indicates that last year provided substantial economic growth in Illinois.  The recent federal government shutdowns have slowed the flow of data, but early reports confirm that 1995 was a prosperous year.  The following provides brief summaries of the employment gains and notes business growth in the state.<P>  

The Illinois Department of Employment Security reported that the state's 5.2 percent average unemployment rate in 1995 was the lowest in 21 years.  Additionally, its 5.7 percent seasonally adjusted December unemployment rate was lower than any of the five more populous states.  IDES also noted that the 12-month average of 5,780,000 employed persons last year was the highest number on record in Illinois.<P>
 
Illinois' exports continued their robust growth in the third quarter with nearly $8 billion in international shipments.  Electronic and electric equipment such as communication devices, generators and controls led the advance with a 45.6 percent year-to-date increase. The only  classification to decrease was oil and gas extraction with the export of these commodities to Mexico and Canada declining.  Several Asian countries posted strong growth with China (Mainland) and Korea each accounting for over $1 billion of the state's shipments.<P>

Despite sluggish November and December new business filings, the 34,495 domestic incorporations in 1995 set a record.  For the year, total filings were up by 208 for a slight 0.6 percent annual gain.  This was the smallest increase since the -0.7 percent decline in 1991 but the fourth consecutive yearly advance.   <P>

Noted regional economist Diane Swonk of First Chicago NBD Corporation reports that the five state Great Lakes region (which includes Illinois) is starting the year on a much better footing than other areas of the country.  She relates that comparatively, real wages are growing (albeit modestly); debt is less of a problem; consumers are more confident; and, homes are still appreciating.  She adds that these trends are likely to continue in 1996.<P>

According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the percent of total past due loans in Illinois was up slightly to 4.20 percent in the third quarter from 3.88 percent a year ago.  Those in foreclosure had decreased however, declining to 0.70 percent from 0.80 percent a year ago. Nationally the comparable third quarter mortgage delinquency rate was 4.38 percent.<P>

The University of Illinois Flash Index of Economic Growth registered 106.5 in January from 107 the previous month.  Its compilers noted that the decline in the Index does not indicate a significant downturn in the Illinois economy.  Rather, they add, it indicates a modest slowing of the state's growth rate, similar to what has been registered by many forecasts of the U.S. economy.<P>

<H3>1995 EMPLOYMENT IN MAJOR ILLINOIS INDUSTRIES</H3>

Restaurants and fast-food establishments continue to provide employment for a large number of workers in the state.  These eating places also added a sizeable number of jobs last year with an additional 11,100 workers.  Other large classifications with noticeable gains were help (personnel) supply services with 10,800 and elementary and secondary schools with 10,200.  The fast movers, percentage-wise, were: miscellaneous business services, gaining 15.6 percent; personnel supply with a 13.3 percent growth; and department stores which added 5.8 percent more workers.<P>   

While the number of overall jobs rose last year, several large industries posted decreases due to mergers, cost-cutting and technological advances in the marketplace.  National commercial banks and trusts employment declined by 2,500, with hospitals shedding 1,600 jobs and telephone communications reducing their payrolls by 800. <P>

<H3>ILLINOIS HIGHPOINTS</H3>

 A recent edition of The Kiplinger Washington Letter forecasts that Illinois was one of the 10 best states for job seekers.  It also cited a need for more factory workers around the Great Lakes area and noted that experienced computer experts are in demand just about everywhere. <P>

 Ameritech and Motorola have been jointly testing their Integrated Services Digital Network in Champaign County.  The system uses a modem-like device that allows public subscribers to send and receive computer data (including Internet access), video or voice messages over a standard telephone line about nine times faster than conventional modems.<P>  

 Chicago and the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs were joint recipients of a $450,000 grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Commerce to 10 entities nationwide.  The grant will fund export development assistance to small-medium size firms that vary from new-to-export to export-ready companies. <P>

<HR>
<H3>THE WEFA GROUP - JANUARY U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK - FORECAST OVERVIEW</H3>

 WEFA expects growth to be modest in the first quarter of 1996.  They predict that the longer the budget impasse continues, the more likely growth will be closer to 1 percent rather than their current forecast of about 2 percent.<P>

 They estimate that the 30-year Treasury bond will remain close to 6 percent in 1996 and the Federal Reserve will continue cutting the Fed funds rate.  They expect the funds rate to be cut from its present level of 5.5 percent to 4.75 percent by mid-year.<P> 

 WEFA anticipates that recessionary pressures will ease as the Federal Reserve lowers    short-term interest rates and output improves after the resolution of the budget impasse.  They note that their Recession Barometer tends to rise above 1.0 about 12 months prior to the onset of a downturn.  They report that it currently reads 0.85 indicating that the probability of a recession is only about 25 percent in 1996. <P>

 WEFA adds that over the past 12 presidential elections, real disposable income growth above 3 percent (WEFA forecasts 0.7 percent for 1996) has resulted in a win by the incumbent party.  They also note that a Gallup Presidential Job Approval rating above 50 percent usually results in a win by the incumbent party, unless the economy is very weak, as it was in 1960. <P>

 They expect export growth to continue to be robust in 1996 as the weak dollar and high quality of U.S. goods bolster demand for American products in foreign markets.  WEFA notes that shipments to the weak Mexican market are being offset by exports to Japan and Germany.  They also predict that import growth will slow down as U.S. growth decelerates.<P>

<a name="Introduction"><hr></a>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

In this issue of The Grant Manager we will be discussing a number of topics pertinent to administration of your CDAP grants.  Every day, our grants managers respond to questions from potential grant applicants as well as experienced grantees.  Constant communication is one of the important aspects of good grant administration.  Grantees and grant administrators should always be aware that the CDAP staff are here to assist and will make every attempt to ensure your ideas are discussed and your questions answered.<p>

Most of the information included in this issue comes from communication grants managers have had with grantees.  The Question and Answer section has been expanded to cover a variety of questions which might arise during the administration of your grant.  To some of you "veterans" a few of the questions may seem simple and unnecessary.  But to many of the new grantees even the smallest problem can be overwhelming.  We hope you find this information useful.<p>

For those of you who are receiving The Grant Manager for the first time, this newsletter is being prepared to assist grantees, administrators, consultants and others who administer CDAP grants.  This is your newsletter and we welcome your questions and comments.  We want to keep an open dialogue of information and knowledge between you and the CDAP staff.  Readers who would like to submit questions for the "Q & A" section or have topics they would like to see discussed in future articles, should submit their written topics or questions to their CDAP Grants Manager.  We will make every attempt to include your information or answer your questions in future newsletters.<p>

The Grant Manager is published twice a year by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, 620 East Adams Street, Springfield, Illinois 62701.  Telephone 217/785-6142.  Fax 217/782-1206.  TDD 800/785-6055.  Internet http://www.ilcommerce.com<p>

Topics to be covered and questions should be submitted in writing and are subject to editing.<p>

<a name="Federal Prevailing Wage Requirements"><hr></a>
<h3>FEDERAL PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS</h3>

When CDAP funds are used in whole, or in part, for construction, federal prevailing wages must be paid.  The Davis-Bacon Prevailing Wage Act requires that all laborers and mechanics employed on any federally-assisted construction project must be paid wages that are prevailing in their labor market for the corresponding classes of workers as determined by the U.S. Secretary of Labor.  Sometimes CDAP grantees confuse federal prevailing wages with Illinois prevailing wages, which are provided by the Illinois Department of Labor.  They are not the same. The only way to receive the correct wage scales for your CDAP construction project is to submit a CDAP WAGE RATE DETERMINATION REQUEST form to DCCA.  A copy of this form can be found in Chapter 2, Section 3 of the CDAP Grants Management Handbook (June 1995).  Questions regarding prevailing wages should be directed to Bill Rhodes at 217/785-6132, TDD 800/785-6055.<p>


<a name="Questions & Answers"><hr></a>
<h3>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h3>

Often you may feel there are no answers available to questions that develop in administering your grant.  The answer may not be found in the Grants Management Handbook because the question or problem is a "unique" situation that requires more definition or clarification.  This section of The Grant Manager will be devoted to questions from you, the grantees, and answers from the CDAP staff.  We will also include common concerns encountered by grants managers during their site visits.  In each newsletter we will answer your questions and share your comments with other grantees who may have experienced similar problems.<p>


<h4>ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS</h4>

Q.   What is the purpose of the Environmental Status Checklist? <p>

A.    The Environmental Status Checklist (ESC) takes the place of the former finding letters that were approximately two pages long and explained the environmental finding of your project.  In an effort to streamline the environmental process, we developed this form as a type of checklist to help administrators and local officials send the correct information with their environmental packets.  The grantee should place a checkmark next to the finding (exempt, categorically excluded, or environmental assessment) and then fill in the regulations from the Federal Register used to support the environmental finding.  Next, the grantee should look under the space provided for the regulation for a checklist of other items that should be sent in cooperation with the environmental status checklist.  This form should be signed and dated by the chief elected official AFTER the local comment period has expired if a publication was deemed necessary for the project.<p>


<h4>PUBLIC FACILITIES</h4>

Q.   If the resident occupying the household is renting, should you submit the household income of the resident living in the household or the owner of the property?<p>

A.  You should provide the renter's household income.<p>

Q.  Where can a community get funds for a fire truck?<p>

A.  The Illinois Rural Bond Bank at 217/524-2663, or Rural Development at 217/398-5412 (formerly FmHA) through the Community Loan Program, might be able to help with loan funds.<p>


<h4>ADMINISTRATION</h4>

Q.  Is increased fidelity bonding an eligible expense for CDAP funded projects?<p>

A.  Yes.  It must be charged to administrative costs.<p>


<h4>FINANCIAL CLOSE-OUT PACKAGE</h4>

Q.   When completing the "Analysis of Benefit to Low and Moderate Income Persons" page in the close-out package, should we also include the administration costs as well as the construction costs?<p>

A.   Yes.  Column "A" should identify each activity including administration.  Column "E" should identify the costs allocated for each activity including administration.  The total of all (which is the total amount of the grant) should reflect figures in Column "E".<p>


<h4>HOUSING/ADMINISTRATION</h4>

Q.   What rehabilitation standards are required under the CDAP housing grant?<p>

A.   Your application submitted for funding should have stated any local building codes which have been adopted.  If not, the Illinois State Plumbing Code, National Electrical Code (NEC) and HUD Housing Quality Standards (HQS) must be met at a minimum.  DCCA sponsored housing conferences have suggested the Council of American Building Officials (CABO) One and Two Family Dwelling Code, but this is not required.<p>

Q.   Can funds from two separate grants be used to rehabilitate a single home or housing unit (split funding)? <p>

A.  No.  All funds drawn on a grant must be expended during the grant period and prior to submittal of  the financial close-out.  Any funds not expended cannot be "carried over" to be used with another year's grant funding.  These funds must be returned to DCCA and reported as such in the financial close-out and Grantee Evaluation Report (GER).<p>


<h4>LABOR STANDARDS</h4>

Q.  How is a bona-fide self-employed contractor to be determined/documented?<p>

A.  A bona-fide self-employed contractor is a contractor who has no other employees and whose business can be documented by at least one of the following:<p>

     1)   A Federal Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (FEIN).<p>

     2)   A certificate of registration or license issued by the state.<p>

     3)   A listing in the business advertising section of the telephone directory.<p>

     4)   A business advertisement published in a newspaper of  general circulation in the area of the business' address.<p>

     5)   A legal notice of an assumed business name published in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of  the business' address.<p>

Q.  What constitutes Force Account Labor?<p>

A.   Force account labor is work performed on a project by the regular employees (mechanics and/or laborers) of a unit of local general government as a part of the employee's normal work duties.<p>

Q.   Can a private company use force account labor and not pay federal prevailing wages?<p>

A.   No.   Only a unit of  local government using force account labor does not pay federal prevailing wages.  All others must pay federal prevailing wages.<p>

Q.  When monitoring federal prevailing wages, if the contractor's computerized payrolls do not show fringe benefits, can we accept the "Statement of Compliance" form if checked (4a) where fringe benefits are paid to approved plans, funds or programs?<p>

A.  Yes.<p>

Q.  How often must employee interviews be completed?<p>

A.  The grantee must conduct employee interviews with a member of each craft at least once per month.  Interviews must be conducted to assure that the payroll information is consistent with the wage rate determination and that the employees are working in their proper job classifications.<p>

Q.  If there is no contract awarded on a project, when should the wage decision be requested?<p>

A.  If no contract is awarded on a project (for instance when the grantee acts as its own contractor), the wage decision published and in effect 10 days prior to the start of construction will apply.<p>

Q.  Does the Davis-Bacon Act Contract for Prevailing Wages remain in effect for the life of the contract?<p>

A.  Yes.  Unless substantial changes are made in the terms of the contract.<p>


<h4>FLOOD PROCESS</h4>

Q.  Is Historic Preservation field work associated with structures in the buy-out program considered an eligible grant cost?<p>

A.  Yes.  FEMA pays 90 percent and DCCA pays 10 percent out of the Demolition Line Item.<p>

Q.  Can a grantee incur costs for appraisals prior to receiving a release of funds letter?<p>

A.  Yes.  Appraisals-related activities are exempt pursuant to 24 CFR Part 58.34 (a).  The grantee may incur costs and request reimbursement for these activities prior to release of funds.  However, acquisitions of property may not occur until the grant complies with all environmental requirements of 24 CFR Part 58. <p>


<h4>EEO PROCESS</h4>

Q.   On the quarterly contract and subcontract report, should Column "B" (amount of contract) reflect only the CDAP amount of the contract?<p>

A.   Yes.  Column "B" should reflect CDAP dollars only in the contract amount.  The grant total of the contract could be reflected near the bottom of the page highlighted with an asterisk.  This form will be revised in the near future to include columns indicating the total amount of the contract and CDAP amount of the contract.<p>


Q.  If a grantee only knows the total amount of the subcontract and does not know how much is DCCA-funded, how would you calculate the amount for reporting the quarterly contract and subcontract activity report figures?<p>

A.  You would calculate the percentage at the same rate as the injection of CDAP funds in the general contract.<p>


Q.  Is it required that the above activity report be submitted to DCCA quarterly?<p>

A.  Yes.  When a contract has been awarded you are required to forward a copy of the activity report within that respective quarter.  Timeliness is important as these statistics are submitted to HUD.  Also, this activity will be monitored during future site visits.<p>


<h4>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</h4>

Q.  Should a grantee/company use the HUD Section 8 Income Guidelines from the application year of the grant for the entire grant period when verifying job creation/retention?<p>

A.  No.  A copy of the current year income guidelines to verify job creation/retention for that respective year should be requested from the grantee's grants manager. <p>

Q.  Is the grantee responsible for reviewing economic development CDAP funds that are loaned to a company?<p>

A.  Yes.  The grantee should review these expenditures prior to submission to DCCA for reimbursement/payment.  It is the grantee's responsibility to have available at the site visit all documentation from the company verifying CDAP economic development funds.  The grantee should also have available documentation of leverage funds from a company for review.<p>

Q.  What activities can funds be used for under the economic development component?<p>

A.  Generally, CDAP funds are granted to communities to be loaned to for-profit or not-for-profit private entities who must document the need for grant and/or loan assistance.  The borrower may use the funds for land acquisition, construction, reconstruction, installation or rehabilitation of commercial or industrial buildings, structures and other real property, equipment and improvements, and working capital.  Working capital is defined as inventory, employee salaries, general operation expenses and advertising/marketing.  In addition, communities may use CDAP funds for public facilities and improvements in support of economic development.  CDAP funds may not be used for debt refinancing.<p>


<a name="Public Hearing"><hr></a>
<h3>PUBLIC HEARING - PROGRAMMATIC CLOSE-OUT</h3>

As a condition of the programmatic close-out, all CDAP grants awarded after November 1992 must conduct a public hearing to review program performance and obtain citizen views regarding program activities and performance.  The Notice of Public Hearing must be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation at least seven calendar days (excluding the date of publication) prior to the public hearing.  Your documentation to DCCA should include a copy of the publication/certification, minutes of the meeting certified by the chief elected official or another authorized official, and the attendance sheet which identifies private citizens and local officials.  Once your project has been completed and all CDAP funds drawn, you can proceed with the second public hearing.  It is not necessary to wait until you receive your close-out package from DCCA to conduct the public hearing.  Grants managers will not process programmatic close-out packages unless this information is included.  If you have any questions concerning this process, please contact your grants manager.<p>


<a name="Completing GER"><hr></a>
<h3>COMPLETING GER FOR REMOVAL OF ARCHITECTURAL BARRIERS GRANTS</h3>

When completing the Grantee Evaluation Report (GER) for CDAP Removal of Architectural Barriers grants, remember to use Census PCH-5-15 tables 7 and 8 to calculate the total number of persons served (column b).  The number of low-to-moderate persons served (column c) should be the same as column b.  The percent of persons served who are LMI (column d) should be 100 percent.  Column e should be the amount of the grant.  Column f should be the same as column e.  On the page for benefit to minorities, handicapped, and female heads of households, the total number of persons served should be the same as column b on the preceding page.  Data for compiling numbers of minorities is not available.  If you need any assistance in completing this information, please contact your grants manager.<p>


<a name="CDAP Loan Pricing"><hr></a>
<h3>CDAP LOAN PRICING POLICY</h3>

Under the Community Development Assistance Program Economic Development component, DCCA can grant funds to local governments, which in turn, loan these funds to private businesses to create and retain jobs.  As part of DCCA's review of CDAP Economic Development applications, the federal regulations require the department to "price" each loan.  At the time of the award, DCCA establishes the term, interest rate and conditions for the loan.  The term and rate set by the department may differ from the rate and term requested by the applicant.<p>

DCCA has established three percent as the minimum rate for CDAP loans.  However, the interest rate established by DCCA, after completion of the financial analysis, may be higher.  Many factors are included in DCCA's pricing evaluation, including, but not limited to, profitability, cash flow and collateral coverage.<p>

CDAP Economic Development funds are a valuable and popular source of  subordinate, fixed, below-market financing.  However, it is important that, up front, businesses are told that the interest ultimately approved by DCCA may be higher than the minimum three percent.<p>


<a name="Bid Negotiations"><hr></a>
<h3>BID NEGOTIATIONS</h3>

It is not unusual for CDAP projects which involve construction to exceed the funding originally budgeted for the activities.  Since DCCA obligates 100 percent of the funds allocated for each CDAP program component, additional CDAP funds cannot be made available.  Therefore, it is extremely important upon grant award that the grantee review the Grant Award Document, Scope of Work, and Activity Budget.  If it is determined at that time that insufficient funds are budgeted for the project, the grantee should contact DCCA to modify the Scope of Work.  This should be done prior to executing and returning the Grant Award Document.<p>

Leverage funds, if available, can always be used to supplement project cost "overruns".  If local funds are not available, other sources of leverage may include:  1) The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA); 2) Rural Development; 3) Illinois Rural Bond Bank (IRBB); 4) Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA); and 5) private financial institutions (banks).<p>

Should a situation arise where the total costs are within the total budget, but a particular activity line exceeds the budgeted amount, it may be possible (through a grant modification) to allow an increase in the amount budgeted for that activity line by reducing the amount budgeted for another.<p>

Construction contracts for activities which have been advertised for bids where the bids received exceed the amount budgeted should never be awarded to any contractor unless funds are assured, or the contracting agency is ready and willing to accept any and all legal consequences.  Once bids are received, a bid cannot be negotiated.  The bids must be rejected and the proposal readvertised.  All bidders must be given an equal opportunity to bid on the project (activity) described in the bid specification.  The regulations do contain provisions stating that, under certain special circumstances and conditions, bids may be negotiated, provided those special provisions are met.<p>

If it is anticipated that the bids for a specific activity will exceed the funds allocated for that activity, it is strongly urged that the bid specifications contain provisions for deductible alternatives whenever feasible.  If properly done, it may be possible to reduce the cost of the activity without readvertising and rebidding.  This method allows all prospective bidders equal opportunity to bid on the same activity and also allows the contracting agency the opportunity to select the lowest bid, or in some cases, the lowest "combination of bids."  It also reduces the possibility of an unsuccessful bidder suggesting that a bid was negotiated.<p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

Welcome to The Grant Manager.  This is the first issue of a newsletter designed to assist Illinois communities in administering their Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) grants.  We'll be presenting articles on current issues, providing a question and answer section to discuss problems grantees face, and offering a listing of upcoming events.  The Grant Manager will be published at least twice a year.  We hope you will enjoy receiving the newsletter and that it provides you with useful information concerning the Illinois Community Development Assistance Program.<p>

This newsletter is being prepared to assist grantees, administrators, consultants and others who administer CDAP grants.  This is your newsletter and we welcome your questions and comments.

<h3>COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 1996 PROGRAM YEAR CHANGES</h3>

Several areas of the Community Development Assistance Program (CDAP) will experience significant changes beginning with the 1996 Program Year.<p>

<h4>"Accelerated" Funding Cycles</h4>

The 1996 Program Year will begin April 1, 1996 -- two months earlier than the 1995 Program Year -- and all competitive application deadlines will be "moved up" accordingly (See Table I.)  In 1997, it is proposed that the program year would begin January 1st.  Of particular note is the manner in which the Competitive Public Facilities Construction and Design Engineering components will be accelerated for the 1997 Program Year.  As in past years, Competitive Public Facilities Construction and Design Engineering (P/F & D/E) applications for 1996 will be due in July.  In late October, an initial award will be made from those applications, using '96 funds.  And, again in January 1997, a second grant award will be made from the same application "pool", using '97 funds.<p>

For the 1998 Program Year, the P/F & D/E applications will be submitted in October 1997, and grants will be announced in January of 1998.  It is proposed that subsequent years will adhere to this revised schedule of an October submission with January award.<p>

This "acceleration" of the P/F & D/E funding cycle will accomplish several things.  First, spending rates -- of major importance to the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) -- will increase.  Secondly, Illinois will benefit by moving the beginning of its CDAP Program Year to earlier in the calendar year.  Reaching that goal in this particular manner should be of benefit to eligible applicants and their grantwriters:  an extra application submission deadline will not have to be "fit into" the regular rounds; and communities that have frequently been unsuccessful in receiving CDAP grants may receive an award, because, in essence, the awards will be made "farther down the list."<p>

In addition, grantees should benefit from receiving their grant awards in January, giving them sufficient time to complete special grant conditions but not a lot of "waiting time" before construction can begin in the spring.<p>

<h4>Documentation of Threat to Health and Safety of Residents</h4>

For the first time in several years, independent verification of threat to health and safety will not be a requirement of the CDAP Public Facilities Construction and Design Engineering component.<p>

This past year, the CDAP staff have continued to work closely with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, and it has become apparent that a letter from IEPA documenting threat to health and safety has become an obsolete requirement.<p>

However, potential applicants are strongly cautioned that the removal of the independent verification requirement in no way lessens the program's emphasis on addressing severe health/safety problems.  There are many ways in which applicants can document a threat to public health and safety, using readily available resources at the local level, which include but are not limited to:<p>
<ul>
<li>     water quality test results
<li>     boil orders
<li>     repair bills
<li>     historical (most recent two years) main break data
<li>     pressure test results
<li>     engineering reports or studies
<li>     complaint letters or data
<li>     historical correspondence regarding sewer treatment plan effluent violations
</ul>

These examples of supporting documentation obviously focus on existing municipal/public systems which are in need of renovation, upgrade, and/or repair.  But what about projects involving new systems which will serve residents on private wells or septic systems?  The following suggestions are offered to strengthen your documentation of a threat to health and safety in those circumstances:<p>
<ul>
<li>      A letter from the local health department which details the problems in the specific target area is recommended.<p>
<li>      Letters or surveys from residents documenting conditions in the target area are suggested to augment the health department letter.
</ul>

Focusing on rural water extension projects, CDAP staff are very aware that private well systems are prone to two distinct problems:  quality and quantity.  In some instances, a target area may even be experiencing both water quality problems and quantity shortfalls.  Both issues are recognized as threats to health and safety under the Public Facilities Construction/Design Engineering component.  Of course, the actual rating that a project receives is dependent upon the level of severity and the extent to which it is documented in the application.<p>

<h4>Low-to-Moderate Income Hook-Ups</h4>

Beginning with the 1996 Program Year, CDAP funds must be used to hook up residential structures which are owned and occupied by eligible low-and-moderate income persons.  A "hook-up" is defined as a privately owned and maintained line on privately owned property between a service lead/connection and a residential structure.  Applicants are advised to plan ahead and include these costs, if applicable, in their CDAP application budgets.<p>

<p>Independent Financial Audits


Under the Competitive Public Facilities Construction and Design Engineering components, a unit of local government's most recent financial audit is required to be submitted along with its application.  A clarification has been added to the 1996 P/F & D/E guidebook, which explains that, when the local government is applying on behalf of a special district (i.e., water or sanitary district), that entity's financial audit should be submitted.<p>

The above areas represent changes that are of significance for the 1996 Program Year.  As always, if you have any questions regarding CDAP in general or regarding the above changes, please feel free to contact the CDAP Grants Manager for your area as shown on the map.<p>

<a name="CDAP Funded Contracts"><hr></a>
<h3>CDAP FUNDED CONTRACTS - REQUESTS FOR PAYROLL INFORMATION</h3>

Periodically, CDAP grantees receive a request for the weekly payrolls of CDAP construction projects from outside parties.  The request should be made to the grantee through the Freedom of Information Act.  HUD Handbook 1344.1 (Federal Labor Standards Compliance in Housing and Community Development Programs) states:  "Requests by Outside Parties for Payrolls.  In order to protect the personal privacy interests of employees, copies of weekly payrolls containing the individual's salary, work hours, claimed exemptions and tax status, address and social security number shall not be released to outside parties and may be withheld under Exemption 6 of the Freedom of Information Act unless any identifiers are first deleted.  When payrolls are in the possession of State or local government, then the applicable State law will govern the release of payroll information."  The grantee's legal counsel must determine what information must be disclosed.<p>  

Should you require any additional information in this regard, please contact your CDAP Grants Manager.<p>

<a name="Implementing Section 3 Report Req"><hr></a>
<h3>IMPLEMENTING SECTION 3 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</h3>

This is the first of several forms of communication to CDAP grantees to notify you of the Section 3 revisions and DCCA's plan for implementation at the beginning of the 1996 program year (April 1, 1996).  This article will give you a brief overview of the revised regulations.  More detailed instructions and reporting forms will be distributed to affected grantees later this year.<p>

Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 was created to stimulate jobs and business opportunities in areas receiving HUD assistance.  For several years, the CDAP grant agreements have contained the "Section 3 Clause," placing a number of requirements on grantees and contractors to ensure their compliance with Section 3 regulations.  On June 30, 1994, Section 3 was overhauled, which substantially strengthened it and established clear priorities for targeting opportunities among Section 3 residents and businesses.<p>

Section 3 contains thresholds wherein Section 3 regulations apply.  Grantees receiving a grant in excess of $200,000 are covered by Section 3.  Contractors who receive a contract in excess of $100,000 from grantees who receive a grant in excess of $200,000 are also covered by Section 3.  If the grantee threshold is met but the contractor threshold is not, then the Section 3 regulations apply only to the grantee.<p>

Each grantee will be responsible for:<p>
<ul>
<li>     Notifying Section 3 residents and business concerns about training, employment and contracting opportunities generated by Section 3 covered assistance.
<li>     Notifying potential contractors for covered projects of Section 3 requirements.
<li>     Incorporating the Section 3 clause in all solicitations and contracts.
<li>     Facilitating the training and employment of Section 3 residents.
<li>     Facilitating the award of contracts to Section 3 business concerns.
<li>     Obtaining the compliance of contractors and subcontractors with Section 3 requirements.
<li>     Refraining from entering into any contract with any contractor where the recipient has notice or knowledge that the contractor has been found in violation of the Section 3 regulations.
<li>     Documenting actions taken to comply with Section 3, the results of actions taken and impediments, if any.
<li>     Submitting required reports.
</ul>

One of the key points to keep in mind is the dollar threshold.  Many of the projects funded with CDAP dollars cost considerably more and funding is received from several sources.  For example, if a community is installing water lines to an unserved area and receives funding from CDAP in excess of $200,000, the entire project is covered.  The community may be receiving $200,000 from CDAP, $200,000 from RECDS and $10,000 in local funds, for a total project cost of $410,000.  Any contract let in excess of $100,000 regardless of the funding source is considered covered under Section 3.<p>

A Section 3 resident is described as a public housing resident or an individual who resides in the metropolitan area or nonmetropolitan county in which the Section 3 covered assistance is expended and who is a low-income or very low-income person.  A Section 3 business is described as a business in which 51 percent or more is owned by Section 3 residents, has permanent full-time employees at least 30 percent of whom are currently Section 3 residents or within three years of the date of first employment with the business concern were Section 3 residents, or has a commitment to subcontract in excess of 25 percent of the dollar award of all subcontracts to be awarded to such businesses described above.<p>

DCCA will require grantees to report their Section 3 covered activities.  Grantees with individual grants in excess of $200,000 will be required to report on their efforts undertaken to comply with Section 3.  Each grant is considered a "project."  Therefore, if a grantee has a $300,000 CDAP Public Facilities grant and a $400,000 CDAP Housing Rehabilitation grant, the grantee will be required to submit two reports--one for each grant.<p>

DCCA will implement the Section 3 reporting requirements with the 1996 program year.  Keep in mind, though, that CDAP grants awarded in prior program years contained the Section 3 clause.  Therefore, if the grant threshold is met, then the prior year grants are also covered.  It will not be necessary to retroactively manufacture data.  Grantees will be required to report activities for all grants meeting the Section 3 threshold for activities which occur during the reporting period.<p>

Section 3 is meant to provide economic opportunities for low and very low income persons in the areas where the HUD assistance is being expended.  We believe this to be a worthwhile program and we don't anticipate any major problems in implementing the regulations in the Illinois Community Development Assistance Program.  We also recognize that the guidelines can be confusing at times and with future communication we will attempt to make compliance as painless as possible.<p>

<a name="Questions & Answers"><hr></a>
<h3>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h3>

Often you may feel there are no answers available to questions that develop in administering your grant.  The answer may not be found in the Grants Management Handbook because the question or problem is a "unique" situation that requires more definition or clarification.  This section of The Grant Manager will be devoted to questions from you, the grantees, and answers from the CDAP staff.  We will also include common concerns encountered by Grants Managers during their site visits.  In each newsletter we will answer your questions and share your comments with other grantees who may have experienced similar problems.<p>

<h4>Planning/Design:</h4>
<ul>
Q.  After the environmental review has been met, can the grantee enter into an agreement and spend only leverage funds pending the Release of Funds letter from DCCA?<p>
A.  No.  You cannot enter into an agreement AFTER the environmental review has been met and BEFORE the date of the Release of Funds letter to the grantee.  The contract would commit CDAP dollars as well as leverage funds.  You would be committing funds not yet released.<p>
</ul>

<h4>Public Facilities:</h4>
<ul>
Q.  Can administration costs be incurred while waiting for a grant modification to include administration as a project activity?<p>

A.  No.  You cannot incur administration costs while waiting for a grant modification.  The grant modification must be approved before costs are incurred.<p>

Q.  Is income verification required for all household residents receiving hook-ups if the line item indicates 60% leverage and 40% CDAP funds?<p>

A.  No.  Income verification would be required for the 40% of households utilizing CDAP funds for the household hook-ups.<p>
</ul>

<h4>Housing/Application Process:</h4>
<ul>
Q. Does the housing fact sheet of the application pertain only to those homes that express an interest in the project if funded?<p>

A.  No.  The housing fact sheet requests information on all homes within the targeted project area.<p>

Q.  Does a survey of the entire targeted project area need to be conducted?<p>

A.  Yes.  To demonstrate project need and project benefit, the application should provide information on all homes within the targeted area.  Sample survey forms shall be submitted with the application equal to the number of homes to be rehabilitated.<p>
</ul>

<h4>Housing/Administration Process:</h4>
<ul>
Q.  Does the required 25% leverage need to be incorporated into each individual home to be rehabilitated?<p>

A.  No.  The rehabilitation line item of the grant budget shall be leveraged by 25%.  It is recommended that, if possible, each home rehabilitated have leverage funds expended as part of the project cost.<p>

Q.  Can funds be transferred from one line item to another within the grant budget?<p>

A.  Yes, with the exception of increasing the administrative or inspection line items of the budget which have a limit of 7% and 8% respectively.  Always review the Scope of Work and Budget sections of your grant agreement for accuracy before executing the agreement.<p>
</ul>

<a name="Farm Income Definition Revision"><hr></a>
<h3>FARM INCOME DEFINITION REVISION</h3>

After much consideration, the DCCA staff have determined that there is a need to redefine the method of computing farm income for CDAP program eligibility.  Page 3-5-9 of the CDAP Grants Management Handbook contains the definition of annual income which has been changed to read as follows:  "Annual Income is the gross amount of income anticipated to be received by the family during the twelve months following the effective date of examination, excluding farm income."  Previous year tax returns are acceptable as a basis for computing current income for farm households only as defined in paragraph 3 of the "Income Inclusions" section on page 3-5-9, which reads:  "3)  Farm income defined as net money income (gross receipts minus operating expenses) received from the operation of a farm by a person on their own account, as an owner, renter or sharecropper.  Operating expenses include depreciation, interest on debt as well as other normal operating expenses."<p>

<a name="Activities in a Floodplain"><hr></a>
<h3>ACTIVITIES IN A FLOODPLAIN</h3>

The Great Flood of 1993 resulted in numerous projects in floodplain areas.  If a project involves activities in a floodplain, grantees must conduct a federally mandated eight-step review procedure.<p>

Executive Order 11988--Floodplain Management Guidelines--is applicable to all grantees whose projects occur in the 100 year floodplain.  The order requires grantees to conduct an eight-step review procedure.  This is a decision-making process to consider any practicable alternatives to locating the project in the base floodplain.  Instructions for the eight-step floodplain review procedures can be found in Chapter 2, Section I, pages 2-1-18 and 19 of your CDAP Grants Management Handbook.  The eight-step process is part of the environmental review.<p>

Steps 2 and 7 of the review procedure involve notices to the public and allowing time for meaningful input.  These publications are the "Early Public Review for Construction in a Floodplain" and "Findings and Public Explanation for Construction in a Floodplain."  To satisfy special grant conditions, the grantee will publish the "early public review" notice early in the process.  A total of 15 full days, excluding day of publication, will be allowed for public comment for the early notice.  The "findings and public explanation" publication will be published once the public comment period has elapsed on the early publication.  The public comment period for this, the second publication, will be a full seven days excluding the day of publication.<p>

When the eight-step floodplain review procedure has been completed and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requirements have been satisfied the grantee can publish the Notice to the Public of No Significant Impact on the Environment and Notice to the Public for Request for Release of Funds (combined notice) or the Notice of Intent to Request a Release of Funds, whichever is appropriate.  The eight steps and publications may be forwarded to DCCA once the public comment period has elapsed for the second public notice.<p>

If you have any questions regarding this information, contact Mike Craig for all flood assistance grants, or Amy Zachary for all other CDAP grants proposing an action in a floodplain.<p>

<a name="Projects Funded with 1996 Program Funds"><hr></a>
<h3>PROJECTS FUNDED WITH 1996 PROGRAM YEAR FUNDS WILL REQUIRE HOOK-UPS</h3>

After April 1, 1996, all CDAP-funded public facilities projects funded for new or expanding water or sewer systems will require hook-ups for all qualified owner occupied low-to-moderate income households (hook-ups for rental units are not mandated, but may be done.)<p>

You should also be aware that according to HUD regulations, local governments may not impose a "special assessment" (assessing a fee or charge levied or filed as a lien against a parcel of real estate as a direct result of benefit derived from the installation of a public improvement) against properties which are owned and occupied by persons defined by the most current HUD Section 8 income guidelines for the appropriate county as being low-to-moderate income persons. The term "special assessment" does not relate to periodic water or sewer user fee charges imposed for the use of public improvements.<p>

The most common type of special assessment is a "tap-on" fee which is a one-time charge made as a condition of access to an improvement, normally a sanitary sewage collection or water distribution system.  If an entity determines that a tap-on fee will be charged, the income generated by the collection of such fees will flow into that entity, i.e. water district, community, etc.; and generally be available for project construction costs and may be used as local leverage.  Please keep in mind that tap-on fees are generally required to be paid by all households.  CDAP funds may be used to pay for the tap-on fees for owner-occupied low-to-moderate income households, or the unit of local government may elect to waive those fees.<p>

In some instances, low-to-moderate income households are required to pay a tap-on fee (reimbursable deposit)  prior to CDAP award to satisfy requirements imposed by the Rural Economic and Community Development Service.  In this case, the low-to-moderate income household or the grantee can be reimbursed with CDAP funds provided the proper documentation and income verification is made prior to disbursement of the funds (and the funds were used to assist in financing construction). <p>

In addition to budgeting for the tap-on fee, you must budget CDAP or leverage funds to pay for the hook-ups for all owner occupied low-to-moderate income households.  To prevent confusion, it's very important for the applicant to understand the terms commonly used in conjunction with a CDAP funded project.  A "service lead/connection" is a line extending the main system to the utility's right-of-way line, normally owned and maintained by the utility.  A "hook-up" is a privately owned and maintained line on privately owned property between a service lead/connection and a structure.<p>

The grantee must use CDAP funds or leverage funds to pay for the actual cost of running the private water or sewer lines up to the house for each owner occupied low-to-moderate income household.  If the cost exceeds $500 for water and $750 for sewer, the homeowner must provide the difference.  The final connection to the house is also the responsibility of the homeowner.<p>

Hook-ups are considered a direct benefit activity and, therefore, the grantee must document the income eligibility of each household receiving this assistance.  Please refer to the Direct Benefit Section of the "CDAP Grants Management Handbook"  for additional guidance on verification of income for low-to-moderate income households.<p>

<h3>ANNOUNCING UPCOMING FAIR HOUSING WORKSHOP</h3>

Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  This law also requires administration of federal programs in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing.  As recipients of CDAP grants, communities are obligated to pursue fair housing activities.  To help CDAP grant recipients achieve this goal, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA), the Illinois Department of Human Rights (DHR),  and the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) are co-sponsoring a conference on fair housing.  The conference will detail federal rules which mandate this activity and provide insight as to how communities can pursue this goal.<p>

The conference is scheduled to be held on Tuesday, April 30, 1996, from 9:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m., at the Holiday Inn in Decatur.  A brochure with more information on the conference along with registration instructions will be forwarded to you as we get closer to the date.  Should you have any questions on this conference, contact Jay Bales at DCCA at 217/785-6181.<p>

<h3>Workshops help Illinois small businesses export</h3>
<ul type=square>
<li>One in eight jobs in Illinois is dependent on exporting; one in four in the manufacturing sector. As of 1995, it is estimated that more than 625,300 Illinoisans are employed by jobs sustained by direct and indirect exports.<p>
<li>Every dollar of Illinois exports generates $.04 of state tax revenue.<p>
<li>Export related jobs are globally competitive and proving to be the key to the creation and retention of higher paying and permanent jobs in Illinois. Wages for workers in the manufacturing and service exporting sectors, where Illinois products are the most competitive, exceed the U.S. average by 24 percent.<p>
</ul>


With these figures in mind, Illinois International Trade Centers and NAFTA Opportunity Centers recently hosted a series of workshops throughout the state to help Illinois small businesses export their products to Mexico.<p>

Workshop topics included the use of agent/distributor contracts, labeling and standards, documentation requirements, tips for success. Small businesses who have already been exporting to Mexico, such as Frantz Manufacturing Company in Sterling, spoke about their successes and difficulties.<p>

The keynote speaker at the workshops was Alfonso Cortina, director of the Economist's Conference in Mexico City. At the peak of Mexico's financial crises, he organized a successful roundtable that included the Mexican president and principal ministers.<p>

Cortina said that Mexico is gradually undergoing a transformation of deregulation and private investment that will allow for even greater opportunities for U.S. exports.<p>

With a population of 88 million and a gross domestic product of $377 billion, Mexico is one of our closest and largest trading partners. In 1994, the first year after passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Illinois exports to Mexico increased by almost 38 percent to over $2 billion.<p>

Despite a decline in exports in 1995 after the peso devaluation, Illinois exports are once again on the rise. As of the first quarter of 1996, Illinois exports to Mexico rose nearly 12 percent over numbers from one year earlier.<p>

By 2003 virtually all tariffs on U.S. goods into Mexico will be zero, thus giving U.S. goods a significant competitive advantage over non-North American goods.<p>

"The only sucking sound we've heard since NAFTA passed  is American businesses drinking margaritas after their first sale to Mexico," said Ben Singer, international trade specialist with the U.S. Department of Commerce's NAFTA office.<p>

The workshops were presented as part of the Illinois Export Partnership for Big Emerging Markets and Sectors Project. Funding is provided by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs' International Business Division through the U.S. Department of Commerce's Market Development Cooperator Program. Future workshops will cover exporting to Eastern Europe and China.<p>

<h3>Mandatory electonic tax filing affects many small businesses</h3>
<h4>By Mollie Cole</h4>

<em><strong>EDITOR'S NOTE:</strong></em> Effective July 1, 1997, the Internal Revenue Service will require all businesses depositing more than $50,000 in employment taxes (based on 1995 contributions) to do so electronically.  The start date is January 1, 1999 for those who deposit more than $20,000 in 1997.  The Federal Tax Deposit Coupon will be extinct for businesses required to file electronically. The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA) is working with the Illinois Small Business 100, a group of leading small business owners across the state, to examine its impact and see if there are any ways to ease these regulatory burdens.<p>

In 1993 Congress mandated that the Internal Revenue Service use the 1994-1999 period to phase in the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS).  Businesses depositing payroll taxes at or above specified thresholds in certain years will be required to participate in EFTPS.  Once enrolled in the program, businesses shall be required to electronically file all payroll taxes each year regardless of whether or not they ever fall below the initial thresholds.  This eliminates any future use of the Federal Tax Deposit Coupon for these businesses, effective upon the start dates.  Below is the phase-in schedule:<p>

<pre>
<strong>Payroll Tax Deposits     Determination Year     EFTPS Participation
(minimum)                                       Start Date (mandated)  </strong>

$50,000                       1995                   July 1, 1997
$50,000                       1996                   January 1, 1998
$20,000                       1997                   January 1, 1999
</pre>

There are two methods to transfer the funds to the IRS.  The ACH Credit method requires the business to instruct its bank to send payment directly to the US Treasury's account at the Federal Reserve Bank.  The ACH Debit method requires the business to authorize a treasury financial agent to withdraw funds from the business' bank account and route them to the Treasury's account.  Under the credit-based method, the business is responsible for the payment until the Federal Reserve Bank credits the Treasury's account; under the debit-based method, the treasury financial agent is responsible for the payment.  Businesses must apply for enrollment in this program prior to participation.  Application must be submitted no later than two months prior to the businesses assigned start date.<p>

DCCA's Small Business Division estimates that nearly 370,000 Illinois small businesses will be impacted by this federally mandated regulation:  166,200 beginning this July, and an additional 203,000+ by January 1999, the end of the phase-in period.  A significant number (12 percent) of affected businesses are located in manufacturing and seven percent have been in business less than five years.<p>

The majority of businesses, especially those whose participation is required by this July, have already been notified by the IRS of the new policy.  Many businesses reported that they learned of EFTPS through their accountant or bank.  Our Regulatory Alert questionnaire to the Illinois Small Business 100 served as the initial notification for quite a few.<p>

Despite fairly widespread awareness of EFTPS, most businesses are unsure of how this will ultimately affect them and have numerous questions as to what types of adjustments will need to made to be in full compliance.  Many businesses expressed expectations that their local chambers of commerce, financial institutions, and DCCA will provide information and assistance through workshops and instructional materials to help them through this IRS phase-in and implementation.  DCCA's Advocacy Team recognizes this as an excellent opportunity for financial institutions, local chambers of commerce, and DCCA to reach out to the small business community and provide much needed, much sought information and assistance.<p>

Securing status as a treasury financial agent would enable financial institutions to provide their customers with a direct vehicle to utilize the debit-based method of payment.  According to the September 1996 issue of The CPA Letter, only NationsBank and First National Bank of Chicago currently have contracts with the Treasury Department to function in this capacity and can provide this service.  Further, financial institutions offering this service can work with their customers to help identify the best payment method and wade through compliance procedure. <p>

Local chambers of commerce can easily access their relationships with financial institutions and other resources to bring information and assistance to their members through existing schedules of meetings and events.<p>

DCCA's Regulatory Assistance and First Stop offices can work together to develop a technical bulletin that explains the regulations and the steps toward compliance.  DCCA's Small Business Division and Advocacy Team will continue its work through information distribution and the tracking of assistance initiatives throughout the state for resource referral.<p>

<h4>Regulatory Alert Findings</h4>

On September 26, 1996, Regulatory Alert questionnaires dealing with Electronic Filing of Federal Employment Taxes were faxed to the Illinois Small Business 100 (ISB100), with a response deadline of October 2, 1996.  Seventy-nine businesses responded.<p>

Of the 79 responding, more than 63 percent were aware of the upcoming policy. Of those who were aware, most (52 percent) had received the information from the IRS, followed by their accountants, financial institutions and trade/association publications.<p>

Forty-seven out of 79 respondents believe that compliance with EFTPS will require adjustments in bookkeeping methods and will be more costly than current methods. At this time, more than 77 percent of business owners either designate an employee to deposit federal taxes or perform the task themselves.  Over one-third of the respondents expressed concern that implementation would create improper access to company financial accounts and increases in banking service and maintenance fees.<p>

Nearly 52 percent of the respondents reported having questions about the new procedures. An equal amount determined that a technical bulletin, outlining EFTPS policy and procedure would be most useful to their business operations. Almost thirty-seven percent stated that a workshop sponsored by DCCA, a local chamber of commerce or business association/trade organization would enhance their understanding.<p>

<h4>Action Steps</h4>

The ISB100 response to the first Regulatory Alert offers several challenges to the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs.  As a state agency, our impact on a federal regulatory agency is minimal. However, there are several steps we can take to einsure that the Illinois small business community is fully aware of the impact this IRS mandate will have on their future operations.  As of this date: <p>

<ul type=square>
<li>DCCA will meet with staff at Illinois Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve Bank (Chicago District Office) to request their assistance in addressing your pressing need for current up-to-date information on their ability to electronically process federal payroll taxes.<p>
<li>An easy-to-understand technical bulletin is in development.  The technical bulletin should be available to you by November 5, 1996 on hard copy and located on the DCCA Website at www.ilcommerce.com by November 19, 1996.<p>
<li>Staff are aware of the demand for workshops on the issue of Electronic Filing of Federal Payroll Taxes.  In the next 30 days, staff  will contact appropriate chambers, business associations and trade organizations to determine the feasibility of regional co-sponsored workshops.<p>
</ul>

The Treasury Department is seeking comment on all aspects of the proposed rule, due on or before November 29, 1996, especially on how the rule changes may affect banks' participation in the electronic filing program and their relationship with their customers.<p>

If you would like a copy of the proposed rule, it can be accessed via the Internet at <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/finman">http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/finman</a>, in the 9/30/96  Federal Register (pp. 51185-51194).<p>

<h3>SBDC helps family-owned store survive</h3>
<h4>By Stephen Baise</h4>

In an attempt to bolster the financial viability of their family run business, which as of late has been plagued by disappointing earnings, Bob and Cathy Wiedenhoff explored one of their only remaining sources of help, the Small Business Development Center located at Kaskaskia Community College in Centralia.<p>

Their business, Coast to Coast Hardware, is a franchise type business located in Greenville and has been in operation since 1981. Until recently they had no reason or need for the no services provided by the approximately 40 Small Business Development Centers throughout the state. That was before a major discount competitor moved into the local market, one which had previously been serviced by downtown resident merchants such as the Wiedenhoffs.<p>

Equipped with both fortitude and determination to succeed they decided to seek the guidance and support of Wayne Robke, a professional business and finance specialist at the Small Business Development Center at Kaskaskia College. In conjunction with center director Richard McCullum, the two attempted to alleviate the fiscal dilemma faced by the family by completely analyzing their business operations.<p>

Robke helped develop an updated operation plan. In doing so, he pointed out various avenues to increase profitability by increasing gross profit and decreasing operating cost, such as inventory, labor, advertising, and other overhead expenditures.<p>

Upon further consultation with the Bradford Bank of Greenville and the Coast to Coast franchiser's chief financial officer, Robke explained in great detail the financial considerations that must be approved by all in order that the participating parties benefit from the continuation of this business.<p>

Thanks to the collaboration of the SBDC, the bank, the franchisor and the business principals, the Wiedenhoffs have demonstrated with promising results that entrepreneurs can effectively utilize the many workable resources SBDCs offer.<p>

"We wished we had called two years ago," Bob Wiedenhoff said. "The SBDC has given us the confidence that with our renewed energy and the assistance of others that we regain our past successes and fifteen years of our lives have not been in vain." <p>

<h3>Minority business conference held</h3>
<h4>By Manuel Suarez</h4>

"Minority Business: America's Competitive Advantage" was the theme of Minority Enterprise Development (MED) Week.. <p>

The conference featured a panel discussion where valuable resources and information was disseminated to about 300 participants followed by an award ceremony and reception.<p>

Co-sponsored by the Office of Minority Business Development of the Illinois Small Business Division of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency, the U.S. Small Business Administration and other economic development organizations, the conference was held at the First National Bank of Chicago.<p>

Honorary chairs for this year event were John F. Timmer, Senior Vice President, First Chicago Bank and Ronald Temple, Chancellor, City Colleges of Chicago.<p>

"This is the period when the Illinois agencies and organizations serving minority and women-owned businesses highlight the success of African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans for their contribution to Illinois's economy," said Brian Slaughter, director of the Office of Minority Business Development for Chicago's City Colleges.<p>

MED Week, which began in 1983 by proclamation of President Reagan, is observed in recognition of the contributions and achievements of the country's minority entrepreneurs. <p>

"I am glad to see so many minority businesses at this event. MED Week provides and opportunity for minority entrepreneurs to develop new business leads, increase market potentials through participation in business forums and networking opportunities," said Andrew Ramir, government consultant for Morales, Ramir and Associates.<p>

<h3>DCCA to co-host ISO 14000 conference </h3>
<h4>By Annette Lingleo</h4>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs' Small Business Environmental Assistance Program will cosponsor a conference to bring together ISO 14000 leaders in the United States for an important discussion of the business, environmental, and regulatory ramifications of the ISO 14000 standards. The conference will be held on November 19 and 20 at the James R. Thompson Center in Chicago.<p>

The ISO 14000 series of standards are voluntary international standards for the establishment of a common world wide approach to management systems that will lead to the protection of the earth's environment while spurring international trade and commerce.<p>

The discussion will focus particularly on the ISO Environmental Management Standards and what they might mean for businesses in the Midwest. It is possible that ISO 14000 may become a condition of some customer/supplier transactions, especially in Europe, Asia, and with the U.S. government. There is also a high probability that the ISO 14000 standards will become a factor in multilateral trade agreements in establishing whether governments are making an attempt to improve the environmental situation within their countries.<p>

The conference is designed to provide an open and active dialogue between speakers and the audience. For more information about the conference, contact ANSI/GETF ISO 14000 Integrated Solutions (IIS) at 703/750-6401 or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 312/886-0180.<p>

<h3>First-Stop Center expands to ease regulations</h3>
<h4>By Mark Grant</h4>

The First-Stop Business Information Center, a statewide source of regulatory help for business in Illinois, is expanding its role as an advocate for business in government. Already recognized as the first place for a business to call when navigating the maze of state required permits and regulations, First-Stop is expanding its role as a watchdog on proposed legislation and regulations which impact Illinois businesses by including the staff and functions of the Regulatory Flexibility Unit.<p> 

Businesses stated they wanted one place they could call to find out what regulations applied to them and to help them cut through the red tape they often encounter. With that mission in mind, the First-Stop Business Information Center was started one year ago within the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).<p>

In the first year, nearly 5,000 individuals have received help with questions or problems with state regulations and starting a business. Response from callers has been very complimentary to the assistance provided. As one caller put it, "I called your 800 number to seek assistance.... the First-Stop specialist was extremely helpful and courteous, and he showed genuine concern and willingness to help," while another caller, "respects and appreciates the level of service and professionalism (they) received from First-Stop."<p>

And now First-Stop is providing another level of help. With the addition of the Regulatory Flexibility Unit, which monitors proposed legislation and regulations, First-Stop helps businesses stay ahead of the regulatory curve. The objectives are to keep the business community as well informed as possible and to act as a business advocate in the legislative and regulatory arena. The Regulatory Flexibility Program, instituted in 1984 and backbone of the Unit, gives First Stop the ability to comment on proposed rules for their impact on small business and make recommendations on how rules can be tiered or even eliminated to alleviate the burden on smaller entities.<p>

Reports summarizing legislative activity are developed on a regular basis during legislative sessions and synopses of proposed rules as published in the Illinois Register every week are available to any interested parties. To receive one or both of these documents, call First-Stop toll-free at 800/252-2923 and ask to speak with Linda Brand. The same information is available on the Web at www.ilcommerce.com. Follow the First-Stop links to Proposed Regulations and Legislation. <p>

Businesses that have concerns can send comments back to First-Stop by phone, fax, letter or through the Internet. First-Stop will follow through with the appropriate legislative and rule making bodies.<p>

<h3>Awards recognize gov't contract help</h3>
<h4>By Lois Van Meter</h4>

Directors of Illinois Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTAC) were recognized for their efforts in the contracting arena at their quarterly meeting held in Bloomington. Directors are honored for their personal contribution in helping their clients secure government contracts.<p>

Those winning awards for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996 are:<p>

Doug Harlan of the University of Illinois' Cooperative Extension Service of Decatur and Dave Talbot of North Business and Industrial Council (NORBIC) of Chicago were each honored with a "million dollar baby," for their first million dollars in contract assistance.<p>

Awards were given for over a million dollars in contract assistance to John DiGiacomo, Rock Valley College, Rockford; Pat Williams, College of Lake County, Grayslake; and Susan Gorman, Illinois Central College, Peoria.<p>

Directors recognized with $5 million contract assistance awards were Tom Halfman, South Suburban College, South Holland; and Ed Van Leer, John Wood Community College, Quincy.<p>

Those receiving awards for $10 million in contract assistance were Harlan and Duffy Toler, College of DuPage, Glen Ellyn.<p>

Receiving awards for $25 million dollars of contract assistance this year are Montrey Balmer, Moraine Valley Community College, Palos Hills; and Elizabeth Scully, Women's Business Development Center, Chicago.<p>

Rich Fyke of John A Logan College of Carterville was honored for helping his client secure over $100 million dollars in government contracts. This is the single highest achievement to date for the PTAC program.<p>

Also receiving $50 million milestone awards were DiGiacomo, Balmer and Pamela See of College of Lake County.<p>

<h3>Husband-wife team helps DuPage small businesses</h3>

Like many married couples, Shannon Rielly and Duffy Toler drive each other to work. But for Rielly and Toler, the morning ride takes both of them to the same place: College of DuPage's (COD) Business and Professional Institute in Glen Ellyn.<p>

Rielly has been the director of COD's International Trade Center (ITC) for two and a half years. Toler has been director of the college's Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) for the past two years and was previously the assistant at the PTAC. They met while working together at COD and were married last year following a wedding proposal on a Washington D.C. vacation.<p>

The couple's strong ties to the state's small business program were humorously illustrated in their wedding program which contained the Illinois Small Business Development Network logo and government-mandated disclaimer language required of all government publications.<p>

Rielly's accomplishments include being named Illinois ITC Director of the Year for the past two years. Toler received $100 Million Milestone Award last year from DCCA, which recognized his efforts in helping secure government contracts for small businesses. He also was honored for reaching the $10 million mark for this fiscal year.<p>

Rielly counsels small and medium-sized businesses interested in exporting their product or service. Specifically, she works with companies to formulate international business plans tailored to their goals and resources, conducts market research to determine target markets, educates companies about export mechanics and identifies overseas contacts.<p>

Toler provides one-on-one counseling for companies interested in doing business with government agencies. He assists companies in identifying the government market for their product or service, provides research to allow companies to formulate a marketing strategy, assists in the completion of bid documents and provides contract management consultation.<p>

Toler says that their professional success "is thanks to a high level of cooperation between our centers," and, adds Rielly, "a healthy level of competition."<p>

<h3>EDGAR MEETS WITH SMALL BUSINESS LEADERS</h3>

Governor Jim Edgar was on hand as the Illinois Small Business
100 (ISB100) held its first meeting to discuss issues important
to small business owners.<p>

The ISB100, which consists of 100 entrepreneurs throughout the
state, will serve in an advocacy role for the state's 617,000
small business owners. Members were nominated by trade
associations, professional organizations, Illinois Small
Business Development Network centers, the U.S. Small Business
Administration and others.<p>

"Through the Illinois Small Business 100, my administration is
forging an even stronger relationship with small business - one
that is designed to foster a better understanding of the ongoing
issues and challenges facing this important segment of the
economy," Edgar said. "We will work together to promote business
growth and expansion in a low-tax, common sense climate that
does not choke economic growth."<p>

The group will communicate electronically via fax and the
Internet to provide nearly instant feedback to the latest issues
affecting small businesses.<p>

"Small businesses are the backbone of the state's economy,"
Edgar said. "They play vital roles as job creators, employing
millions of Illinois citizens, and they provide tremendous
opportunities for those from every corner of Illinois who have
the determination to work hard and succeed. We are seeing some
of the most dramatic growth in small businesses owned by women
and minorities."<p>

Edgar also presented the first Governor's Award for Small
Business Achievement to Turano Bakeries of Berwyn. The Turano
family started the business in the 1960s as a small Chicago
neighborhood bakery. Today Turano is a nationally known company,
servicing accounts that include fast food outlets and
supermarket chains. Edgar cited them as an example of how a
small business can grow through hard work.<p>

Turano's Berwyn facility was the site of Edgar's formal
announcement of the creation of the ISB100. Prior to the
announcement Edgar toured the facility and purchased bread from
their bakery shop.<p>

<h3>MEXICAN VISIT HELPS ILLINOIS SMALL BUSINESSES</h3>

<em>Editor's Note: </em>Rebecca Lake, International Trade Center director
at North Business and Industrial Council (NORBIC) in Chicago,
recently traveled to Mexico City to assist several Illinois
small businesses.<p>

By Rebecca Lake<p>

I heard it at a breakfast meeting over huevos rancheros and a
glass of orange juice: it is the best of times, it is the worst
of times. While I had listened to this phrase uttered many times
before, never had it described a situation so perfectly. The
conclusions I had drawn from my two week visit in Mexico about
economic and social life fit nicely into those 12 words. On a
trip sponsored by the NAFTA Opportunity Center (NOC) at NORBIC,
I had the opportunity to support Illinois trade with Mexico,
while discovering firsthand how Mexico City was dealing with the
worst of times, following 1994's peso devaluation and resulting
economic crisis.<p>

Much of my time in Mexico City was spent working at the State of
Illinois booth at Mexican Manufacturing Week `96, Mexico's
premier trade show for manufacturers. Helping represent the 11
Illinois companies that participated in the catalogue show, I
spoke with numerous distributors and potential buyers from
throughout Latin and South America. Some of these companies were
one-man operations, looking to represent anybody that will give
them a chance. Many, however, were established companies eager
to incorporate U.S. products into their lines. After just a few
discussions, it became clear that companies in Mexico and beyond
associated not just U.S., but specifically Illinois products
with quality.<p>

Another major part of my trip consisted of on-site market
research for some of the NOC's clients. I visited local retail
outlets throughout Mexico City, including the popular department
store, Sanborne's, the big grocery store chains, even Sam's
Club. Most of the stores were filled with consumers, similar to
a Saturday afternoon at a Sam's Club in Chicago. Store shelves
were stocked with everything from ice cream to Ralph Lauren
bedding, leading me to the conclusion that even though Mexicans
are feeling the pinch from a hurting economy, they are still
welcoming U.S. products into their homes and dessert menus. <p>

Unfortunately, once outside the busy stores, I again witnessed
the countless people doing whatever they could to get by.
Washing windshields for a peso (about fifteen cents) was one
popular means, performing acrobats in front of cars stopped at
stoplights, another. The image that I recall most vividly is of
men, lined up along a fence on a busy city square, holding
shabby pieces of cardboard stating the trades that they were
skilled in. They'd stand there all day if they had to, looking
for work. <p>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs'
Mexico Office served as homebase for me during my time in Mexico
City. If ever there was a group of dedicated, productive, and
giving people, it is the staff in this office. Armed with a
desk, computer, and phone, I was able to work without
interruption to gather as much information as possible to bring
back as resources for Illinois companies. Using the Mexico
office's conference rooms, I met with Mexican companies looking
to do business with Illinois. Currently, we're in the process of
matching them with potential business partners here at home. It
certainly is the best of times for Illinois companies who are
taking advantage of opportunities within this emerging market.<p>

Specifically, the Illinois companies that research was carried
out for included a Des Plaines-based processor of quality
seafood, a Chicago manufacturer of industrial and graphic arts
rollers, a Batavia-based company that manufactures financial
equipment, a manufacturer of electronic equipment in Chicago,
and a Lake Bluff-based processor of dietary supplements. <p>

Another highlight of this trip included a meeting with the
Economist Magazine's Conference Director, Alfonso Cortina. He
will serve as the keynote speaker in the NAFTA Opportunity
Center at NORBIC's upcoming seminar, "Doing Business in Mexico -
from Devaluation to Re-evaluation." A dynamic speaker with a
thorough knowledge of Mexico's economic and political life,
Cortina will analyze implications of the current and future
Mexican economy for Illinois exporters. For more information on
this informative seminar, or to register, call 312/588-5137.<p>

I'm anxious to hear if Mr. Cortina's perceptions of where his
country is and where it's going are in line with mine. In my
meeting with him, it was my impression that he sees an expanding
economy for Mexico, but like in all market economies, there are
growing pains to deal with. It seems to me that the Mexican
people are accepting these challenges, and moving on the best
way they know how.<p>

<h3>HAZARDOUS WASTE INFO AVAILABLE</h3>

By Tom Kamykowski<p>

The Illinois Hazardous Waste Research and Information Center
(HWRIC) will combine research with information collection and
analysis to provide small businesses with direct technical
assistance and educational materials on matters of waste
management and pollution prevention.<p>

Since 1986, HWRIC, a non-regulatory, non-profit agency, has been
helping industry reduce waste at the source. The Illinois Toxic
Pollution Prevention Act expanded HWRIC's mandate "to promote
toxic pollution prevention as the preferred means for achieving
compliance with environmental laws and regulations."<p>

Pollution prevention programs not only help reduce waste, but
often also reduce raw material, labor and disposal costs. These
cost savings can help Illinois' business and industry become
more competitive.<p>

For some companies, reporting of pollution prevention progress
is required under the federal Pollution Prevention Act of 1990.
Each facility required to file an annual toxic chemical release
report must include a toxic chemical source reduction and
recycling report on each chemical.<p>

HWRIC works with industry, government and academia to find
effective solutions to Illinois' waste problems, offering the
following services:<p>

<ul>
<li>Engineering solutions
<li>On-site assessments
<li>Training
<li>Case studies
<li>Waste reduction
<li>Matching funds for research
<li>Information services
<li>Environmental regulatory compliance
<li>Improved productivity, process efficiency and cost accounting
</ul>

For more information contact HWRIC's office in Champaign at
217/333-8940 or in Chicago at 312/265-2188.<p>

<h3>EVEN SMALL FIRMS CAN BID ON GOV'T CONTRACTS</h3>

This is not your normal success story. This success story does
not include the award of a multi-million dollar government
contract, or even a $100,000 contract. Instead, it is about a
small construction/roofing business that, thanks to a little
help, submitted its first bid on a government contract.<p>

Shingles Plus submitted bids for several roofing projects with
the Champaign County Housing Authority. Just by just submitting
a bid, this small business has become a success in the ever
changing world of government contracting.<p>

Shingles Plus became a client of the University of Illinois'
Cooperative Extension Service's Procurement Technical Assistance
Center (PTAC) last year. Since then, time has been spent
applying for Capital Development Board certification, securing
bonding, and filling out the numerous pieces of paper required
to bid on both state and federal government contracts. Before
Shingles Plus became a PTAC client, they had not bid on any
government contracts. "We were on the outside looking in," says
Mandy Bogdan, Shingles Plus' main company contact.<p>

The PTAC provided Shingles Plus with all of the necessary forms
to become certified with the Illinois Capital Development Board.
Shingles Plus also received assistance in finding bidding
opportunities with many local and federal government agencies in
Illinois.<p>

"The company is small and relatively new. So, I restricted their
bid match profile to Illinois only. I told them that this would
reduce the number of opportunities available. But the company
was very patient. So, when the perfect match was finally found,
they jumped on it with both feet," said Doug Harlan, PTAC
Director.<p>

Once the bidding opportunity was identified, the PTAC provided
assistance in interpreting the solicitation packet, obtaining
required forms, and general encouragement.<p>

Shingles Plus being awarded the contract is immaterial to this
success story. They have successfully entered a new market, one
in which they were not previously involved. The Housing
Authority will continue to keep them on their active contractors
list. This, coupled with the invaluable experience of bidding on
their first government contract, is bound to produce contract
awards in the near future.<p>

There are Procurement Technical Assistance Centers located
throughout Illinois. For the location nearest you call

<h3>ILLINOIS FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS OVERCOME OBSTACLES</h3>

National trends reveal that women own an increasingly large
proportion of small businesses in the United States. Currently,
women own about 30 percent of all private businesses and are
opening new businesses at twice the rate of their male
counterparts. It is estimated that at current rates of growth,
women could own 50 percent of all businesses by the first decade
of the next century. These figures reflect the hard work and
determination exhibited by women business owners during the past
decade. However, one must be cautious because these positive
national trends obscure the obstacles that continue to hinder
female entrepreneurial success, particularly in Illinois.<p>

A recent survey conducted by John Gruidl and Chris Merrett at
the Illinois Institute for Rural Affairs notes that Illinois
ranks forty-fifth out of fifty states in the proportion of women
who own their own businesses. Women who owned businesses had
higher business failure rates than their male counterparts.
Female business owners simply face more obstacles than their
male competition on the road to business success. <p>

Results from the survey of 712 business owners in downstate
Illinois revealed that female entrepreneurs start businesses
with fewer years of work experience, with less education in
business, with fewer business contacts, and with less startup
capital. Furthermore, female-run businesses tend to be in
sectors such as retail trade and consumer services that
traditionally generate lower profits than sectors dominated by
men such as manufacturing and construction.<p>

The survey also revealed that women continue to be optimistic
about business opportunities in Illinois despite the barriers
blocking their progress. This optimism can be traced in part to
innovative projects such as the mentor program run by Small
Business Development Centers. According to survey results,
business contacts and access to credit after the initial startup
phase are crucial to ongoing business success. Mentor programs
pair experienced female business owners with inexperienced
female entrepreneurs to help them sustain early successes. These
experienced female entrepreneurs can provide access to knowledge
and credit that may be otherwise unattainable.<p>

Overall, the future for businesses run by women seems to be
improving. Research shows that while a gender gap persists in
entrepreneurial success, women are narrowing that gap because of
their optimism, determination and burgeoning support networks.<p>

This research is part of a larger ongoing project conducted by
the Illinois Institute for Rural Affairs to examine the role of
women in rural economic development. Gruidl and Merrett are
currently examining female entrepreneurs in non-metropolitan
counties of Illinois and the Midwest. Early results show that
rural female entrepreneurs experience higher business failure
rates than urban females, or males in either rural or urban
counties. In other words, geographic location can compound the
barriers to female entrepreneurial success. Final results are
expected to be released this fall.<p>

<h3>ENTREPRENEURIAL CAMP HELD FOR YOUNG WOMEN</h3>

By Susan E. Nicol<p>

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs'
Office of Women's Business Development, in partnership with
DePaul University's Department of Management, successfully
brought Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago to Illinois this past summer.<p>

For over three years, Camp Entrepreneur has operated as an
award-winning residential camp at Seton Hill College in
Pennsylvania, and has provided comprehensive exposure to the
principles of business ownership to its 100+ young women
graduates. Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago was designed as a week-long
commuter day camp for young women in Cook County entering their
junior or senior year in high school interested in owning their
own businesses.<p>

During the week, the campers participated in hands-on seminars
presented by local business professionals who volunteered to
work with the students in areas such as marketing, financing,
management and effective decision making skills, business
communications and technologies, utilization of resources, and
creating a professional image.<p>

One of the week's highlights included a full day devoted to site
visits to Chicago area businesses that are owned and operated by
women. The campers benefited from the presentations and
following discussions as a diverse group of women business
owners shared their experiences, offering information and
experiences they will reflect upon for the rest of their lives.
Another highlight was the campers' development of their own
business plans, which were presented to a panel of business
experts on graduation day. Drawing upon newly acquired
inspiration, the plans reflected the cumulative knowledge and
skills gained throughout the week and true entrepreneurial
approaches. The panelists were unqualifiably impressed! <p>

Historically, young women have not been exposed to
entrepreneurship as a viable career option, nor have they been
introduced to business skills. Camp Entrepreneur-Chicago
graduated sixteen future leaders who are now positioned to
recognize their ability to run their own businesses, and are
equipped with the tools necessary to visualize their own futures
and to create their own opportunities.<p>

With rave reviews from this year's graduates, sponsors, staff,
and Chicagoland's premier media, the Office of Women's Business
Development and DePaul University are already talking about next
year.<p>

<HR><h3>
</h3>PIC/CEO CONFERENCE 

Chris Stevens, Director, The Private Industry Council of Lake County, welcomed private industry council (PIC) members and chief elected officials (CEOs) to the annual PIC/CEO Conference, The Future Is Now which was held July 19-20, 1996, at the Ambassador West Hotel. The conference was sponsored by the Illinois Employment and Training Partnership (IETP) and the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA).  IETP members are directors of local organizations which deliver quality workforce development services through the Job Training Partnership Act program.<p>

Illinois State Senator Steve Rauschenberger, District #33,  provided the opening remarks and discussed the impact and effect of the state's appropriation process and federal block grants on future employment and training programs.  Rochelle Daniels, Attorney at Law with the Broward Employment and Training Administration in Florida, was the guest speaker for the conference.  Ms. Daniels provided insight on the impact of "no new federal legislation" and the Workforce Preparation Action Plan developed by a task force of representatives of the Illinois Board of Higher Education, Illinois Community College Board, Illinois State Board of Education and Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs.  Roundtable discussions on the second day resulted in the identification of local workforce development strategies to be implemented by  PICs and CEOs.<p>

<h3>THE ENTERPRISE</h3>

Illinois now has more members of the national Enterprise than any other state. Six agencies receiving membership status this year are The Private Industry Council of Lake County; Private Industry Council of Northern Cook County; Illinois Valley Community College; KDK, Training, Employment & Business Services; City of Peoria; and Management, Training, and Consulting Corporation.<p>    

The Enterprise is a network of workforce development organizations which emphasizes high quality, customer-focused services, using successful process management techniques adapted from the private sector.  Its purpose is to promote and enhance the quality of all workforce development services for dislocated workers and to gain recognition for the quality that exists through the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) Program.  The federal JTPA program provides job seekers needed skills through education and training programs as well as assistance in obtaining employment.<p>

By meeting Enterprise standards, 15 Illinois organizations have been certified as delivering a range of services in a manner expected by the organizations' customers; achieving the outcomes expected by their customers and the system's investors; and having implemented the process management principles adopted by successful private sector organizations. In 1996, fewer than 20 percent of the organizations nationwide which are eligible to apply for Enterprise status have achieved membership, as compared to 57.7 percent of Illinois organizations attaining membership status.<p>

<h3>ILLINOIS EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING CENTER UPDATE </h3>

Progress on the establishment of Illinois Employment and Training Centers continues!<p>

A total of 44 Illinois Employment and Training Centers (IETCs) have opened across 	the state as of October 1996.
In addition to the agencies that deliver the Job Training Partnership Act program and 	the Illinois Department of Employment Security, at least 143 other organizations are 	located on-site in IETCs throughout the state; they include community colleges, the 	Departments of Public Aid and Rehabilitation Services, Green Thumb, Area Agencies 	on Aging and a wide variety of local governmental, educational, and community-based 	organizations.<p>

IETC home pages were featured at the Illinois State Fair in Springfield and DuQuoin; 
access the home page for your local IETC at  <a href="http://www.ilcommerce.com/ietc">http://www.ilcommerce.com/ietc</a>.<p>

General information cards describing services available to employers and job seekers through IETCs have been developed; copies may be attained by contactingLibby Pillsbury at 217/524-8330; local versions will soon be available.<p>

The University of Illinois at Springfield has identified approximately 100 products 	which will be made available to IETC for use in resource rooms; this activity is part of 	the federal one-stop implementation grant.<p>

<h3>MOBILE EMPLOYMENT & TRAINING PROJECT </h3>

The Department of Commerce and Community Affairs awarded grant funds to New Start, Inc. for the purpose of providing a mobile capacity to deliver employment and training services to residents of rural Illinois.  The  demonstration project uses a mobile unit to assist the Illinois Employment and Training Centers in delivering innovative and comprehensive services to the unemployed and the dislocated worker.<p> 

The Employment and Training Services Delivery Model is a satellite-based one-stop mobile that works with employment and training service agencies throughout the state to aid them in assisting individuals develop the skills necessary to find and keep a good job.  The highly flexible vehicle of staff and equipment has the capability of providing advanced re-employment services in rural areas.  Some of the services provided through the computer lab include vocational assessment, UI profiling,  and job search assistance.  <p>

The mobile is successful due to the collaboration and interfacing of several highly technical systems.  Because a two-way satellite service is used, the Employment and Training Services Delivery Model does not require a phone line or advance on-line service to access the Internet.  It also can generate its own electrical hook-up which is very helpful in rural areas.<p>

<h3>MISSED BUT FONDLY REMEMBERED</h3> 

Samuel C. Bernstein, 86, passed away May 7, 1996, at his Pompano Beach, Florida home.  During his lifetime, he was an advisor to three United States presidents, eight Illinois governors and two Chicago mayors.  He was considered the "Father of the Illinois Unemployment Compensation Act" for his role in drafting the 1937 bill that passed and revolutionized support for workers.  Also in 1937 he was appointed by Governor Henry Horner as General Counsel of the Illinois Bureau of Employment Security.  In 1942 he was appointed Commissioner of that office by Governor Dwight Green.<p>

Being active in the Interstate Conference of Employment Security Agencies and Illinois' head Employment Security official, Sam often was asked to advise the nation's Presidents from Roosevelt to Johnson.  He was an advisor to President Truman on the future role of employment service following World War II.<p>

In 1961 Mr. Bernstein was appointed Director of Labor for the State of Illinois, a position he held until 1963 when he became the Illinois Employment Security Administrator.  In 1970 Sam was selected by Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley to serve as Assistant to the Mayor for Manpower, which he continued to hold under Mayor Michael A. Bilandic until 1980.  <p>

Sam was known throughout his career to be an innovator in programs that train disadvantaged workers the skills needed to gain access to the job market.  The agencies that he directed had strict nondiscrimination policies in hiring, and, as an expert in his field, he continued to impact employment policy even after leaving public office. In 1978 he became an Adjunct Professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago.  He worked as a consultant for Kane, McKenna and Associates and Target Group, Incorporated until the time of his death.<p>

Sam is survived by his wife of 62 years, Dena (Nee) Feldman; his daughters, Bonnie Boyd and Carol Acosta; son, Victor Bernstein; six grandchildren and four great grandchildren.  He will be missed by his many friends in the workforce development field.Earl A. Pate, President and Chief Operating Officer of Management, Training and Consulting Corporation (Man-Tra-Con Corp.), passed away at his home in rural Williamson County on Friday, July 19, 1996.  He was 59 years old.<p>  

Earl's professional life began as an employee of Caterpillar Tractor Company in Aurora, Illinois.  He was the youngest individual at the company at that time to be elected president of the United Auto Workers Union, Local 145.<p>

The late Governor Otto Kerner requested that Earl join a handful of individuals to fight the war on poverty.  The honor eventually lead him to design and implement Operation Main Stream, an older workers program, and the Neighborhood Youth Corp programs.  He was named Southern State Director for the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act programs in Illinois during the 1970's and early 1980's.  With the enactment of the Job Training Partnership Act in 1982, Earl was responsible for overseeing the JTPA program for much of southern Illinois.<p>

In honor of Earl's memory, Man-Tra-Con Corporation's Board of Directors has created a scholarship fund for students pursuing a post secondary education and who are residents of Jefferson, Franklin, Williamson, Perry or Jackson counties.  The Department of Commerce and Community Affairs expresses its sympathy to Earl's wife, Virginia; daughter, Lisa (Pate) Bartlow; son, Earl A. Pate II; and other members of his family. <p>

<h3>JTPA TRAINING CALENDARS</h3>  

The July-December 1996 Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) Training Calendar announces and provides information about 16 sessions being offered during the first six months of the program year.  These sessions are designed to enhance the effectiveness and quality of services delivered through JTPA programs and other federal, state, and local employment and training programs.<p> 

This calendar presents many workshops of interest to a broader audience than individuals involved in workforce development activities.  Therefore, recognizing the benefits of interaction with the private sector, training sessions will now be marketed to private sector companies based upon availability<p>.

SUMMERWORKS has been prepared by the U. S. Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration in collaboration with the Employment Development Department of the State of California, Region IX.  It is a compendium of the 1995 Private Sector Summer Youth Jobs Initiative and School-to-Work Summer Programs, and is based on a series of interviews with private sector employers and employment and training practitioners active in youth initiatives in Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Nevada.<p>

FINAL REPORT OF THE MASS LAYOFF STATISTICS (MLS) PROGRAM is a report on the MLS Program which was administered by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the purpose of developing and maintaining statistical data related to permanent layoffs and plant closings.  An interagency agreement between the U. S. Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration and BLS provided for the establishment of a workgroup to determine l) the usefulness of the MLS Program; 2) whether any changes to the program would enhance its usefulness and, if so, to identify what those changes should be and their associated implementation cost.  The final report provides a summary of the workgroup's analysis and resulting recommendations.<p>

LITERACY LEADER FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM REPORTS is Part I in a Series, Framework for Developing Skill Standards for Workplace Literacy, by Eunice N. Askov, Ph.D., and was the research project at the National Institute for Literacy from October 1994 through September 1995.  Based on the changing business environment, the project focused on describing and defining cross-occupation workplace skills necessary for worker and business success, regardless of occupation and job tenure level, in order to work in the high performance work organizations.<p>

Training conducted by U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) staff resulted in almost 700 individuals nationwide being exposed to cost allocation strategies which support the establishment of one-stop career centers.  Barry Dale, Financial Manager, and Nick Lammers, Systems Accountant, Division of Financial and Grants Management of Region V of the USDOL Employment and Training Administration, conducted a total of eight Cost Allocation for Integrated Program Delivery Systems training sessions in Austin, Texas; Baltimore, Maryland; San Diego, California; and Chicago, Illinois.  The Sharing Resources to Provide Integrated Services technical assistance guide (TAG), developed by a work group of  federal, state and local staff,    was the basis for the curriculum.<p>

In a drive to improve customer service, many federal employment and training programs have developed a single point of entry in an integrated program setting such as employment and training centers.  Consequently, the programs serve more customer groups, provide a wider range of services and receive funds from multiple funding sources.  The centers have required existing program deliverers to work together to coordinate the delivery of services, co-locate into one facility, or consolidate operations.  The concepts and examples in the TAG illustrate how organizations may approach the allocation of costs in situations where programs with differing enabling legislation and regulations share in the funding of a local program or facility.  There is no implied requirement that these methods be used.<p>

The cost allocation TAG is in final draft and is being circulated among other federal agencies for comment.  The USDOL Office of the Inspector General supports the approach presented in the TAG.  One-stop implementation states may immediately implement this cost allocation approach for USDOL programs on a pilot basis.  If non-USDOL programs also are included in a one-stop career center, grantees should notify and request clearance from the appropriate federal agency in order to use this TAG for allocating non-USDOL costs.<p>

<h3>Illinois Employment & Training Center Update</h3>

The state continues to move toward achieving its goal of establishing 40 Illinois Employment & Training Centers (IETCs) by September 1996.  As of the end of March 1996, 34 IETCs exist in the following communities:  Woodstock, Rockford, Freeport, Sterling, Lombard, Maywood, Arlington Heights, Evanston, Chicago, Joliet, Ottawa, LaSalle, Moline, Galesburg, Quincy, Peoria, Bloomington, Pekin, Urbana, Danville, Decatur, Springfield, Jacksonville, Carlinville, Litchfield, Alton, Glen Carbon, Olney, East St. Louis, Belleville, Mt. Vernon, Carterville, Herrin, and Murphysboro.<p>

These offices provide citizens the opportunity to access an array of community services.  The primary focus of the centers is to assist individuals interested in enhancing their employment prospects.  While the services offered through the centers are locally determined, at a minimum the Job Training Partnership Act program training and services, as well as services delivered through local Illinois Department of Employment Security offices, e.g., unemployment insurance and job service, are available at all centers.  In the coming months, look forward to the opening of new centers and expended offering of services throughout Illinois.<p>

Editorial
Illinois Employment & Training Centers and Education-to-Careers
</h3>

Education-to-Careers has been defined as a "community-based education system to prepare all learners for meaningful work."  This definition acknowledges that opportunities for gaining and expressing knowledge and skills, e.g., education, take place in the whole community, not just schools and other educational institutions.  The educational process involves providing direct instruction, influencing instructional content or context, supporting learners to take advantage of the opportunities before them, evaluating the effectiveness of that learned, and enhancing theoretical instruction through direct experience.  With this broad definition in mind, it becomes easier to understand why the State of Illinois requires that the local Education-to-Careers partnership include representation from the Private Industry Council/JTPA Administration.<p>

As envisioned, the Illinois Employment & Training Centers (IETCs) will serve as clearinghouses of information that is relevant to the career preparation process of everyone.  Although this information will be "universally accessible" at the Centers themselves, the technology also will be available to create electronic linkages with other institutions and organizations participating in Education-to-Careers.  How this functions exactly must be determined by the local partners.  As another example, some of the IETCs will have facilities on-site to provide direct instruction, others will not.  Therefore, the role the Centers can play in direct instruction must be locally determined by the Education-to-Careers partnership.  As the responsibilities of various community partners emerge through Education-to-Careers planning, the results should influence  how the  IETCs operate.  As the IETCs evolve, their service delivery offerings should influence how the local Education-to-Careers system functions.<p>

It is important the  Education-to-Careers and the IETC planning and implementation taking place are viewed as complimentary initiatives.  All of the local partners involved in these efforts are trying to provide learners with the best information and opportunities they can access to have meaningful careers.  This goal will only be accomplished if the individuals involved are talking with each other and working together to maximize their resources and use each others strengths.<p>

We encourage active involvement of all of our local IETC partners in the local planning and implementation of Education-to-Careers.  The State of Illinois guarantees you a seat at the table.<p>

The ILLINOIS WORKFORCE BENCHMARK REPORT, 1995 was developed by the Illinois Job Training Coordinating Council (IJTCC), predecessor to the newly formed Human Resource Investment Council.  The Report's central focus is to respond to the need for "clearer benchmarks of the State's current position and progress toward improvement" identified by both the IJTCC and the Illinois Economic Development Board.  The Report establishes a benchmarking system to regularly assess the status of the workforce preparation system in supporting Illinois' economic competitiveness.<p>

Public/Private Ventures (P/PV) has published an executive summary of MAKING A DIFFERENCE:  AN IMPACT STUDY OF BIG BROTHERS/BIG SISTERS.  The summary is part of P/PV's eight-year investigation of a range of adult-youth relationship projects and provides scientifically reliable evidence that mentoring programs can positively affect young people.<p>

The U.S. Department of Labor has issued the EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING ADMINISTRATION FY95/PY95 CUSTOMER SATISFACTION REPORT.  The report addresses activities the Employment and Training Administration has undertaken to measure and improve services provided to its program customers and delivery system partners.<p>

The INDIVIDUAL TRAINING VOUCHER SYSTEM,  A PRACTITIONER'S IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE was developed by Onstott Powell and Associates and provides the current best practices for designing and implementing a training voucher system which results in increased customer choice in selecting both the most appropriate training program and training institution.<p>

The system will return a list of documents that have ALL of the words that 
you enter.  Thus, if you enter INCOME TAX, you will get a list of all 
information profiles that have BOTH 'INCOME' and 'TAX'.  They need not be 
together in a document but only profiles containing BOTH (all) words will 
be selected for you.<p>  

The search function uses the entire word, as entered, in selecting 
'matching' documents.  It does not return documents containing `partial' 
word matches.  For example, if you input 'ENVIRONMENT' for your search, you 
will not get documents that may only contain the word 'ENVIRONMENTAL' or 
vice versa.<p>  

Start by using single words rather than combinations.  You are basically 
'guessing' what words may be used in a document that covers the subject 
matter you need.  After you get a list of documents with one word relating 
to your subject, try limiting the number of matching documents by adding 
another word.  For example, if you start with 'ENVIRONMENTAL', you may get 
a long list of documents.  You can then do another search using 
'ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS' to reduce the list to only those documents more 
closely relating to your desired subject.<p>  

If you don't find what you need on your first selection, try another word 
or words that would logically have the same or similar meaning.  Using 
search functions can be an art.  Don't be discouraged when you don't 
initially find something that you request.<p> 

<em>Note: </em> The quotation marks in the examples above are for clarity only.  
Don't use them when you input your word selections.<p>

<H3><A NAME="History"></A>History</H3>

<P>The College Park campus of the University of Maryland has a long history
of teaching and research in Microbiology. In l885, Dr. Thomas Taylor was
&quot;lecturer in microscopy&quot;, and Professor F. Lamson-Scribner, of
the United States Department of Agriculture, presented a course on fungi.
Since these early beginnings, when the College Park institution was still
known as the Maryland Agricultural College, interest in bacteria and related
microorganisms has continued without interruption. </P>

<P>From 1885 until the founding of the Department, various courses in bacteriology
were offered on the campus. The Department of Microbiology historically
is one of the oldest departments on campus having originated in 1922 as
the Department of Bacteriology and Sanitation. It grew out of an agricultural
base with expanded course offerings by two veterinarians around l917. The
name was changed to The Department of Pathology and Bacteriology in 1929
and the first departmental Ph.D. was awarded in 1931 to William Malcolm,
who went on to become Chairman of the Board of American Cyanamid Corporation.
The faculty soon included Dr. John E. &quot;Jack&quot; Faber, who later
became Chair of the Department in 1946 and remained so until 1968. During
Dr. Faber's tenure, the Department first gained its national recognition.
Since 1968 there have been only three other permanent chairs of the Department.
</P>

<P>Dr. Sam W. Joseph was the Chair from 1981 to 1989. Dr. Frank Hetrick
was Acting Chair from 1989 until his retirement in 1992. Dr. Albert Ades,
an Associate Professor in the Department of Zoology, succeeded Dr. Hetrick
as the Acting Chair in 1992, and was made permanent chair in 1995. </P>

<P>Since 1989, there have been significant changes and improvements in
both the undergraduate and graduate programs. A new graduate program has
been approved and implemented. The numbers of students in the undergraduate
program are at an all-time high with students being turned away from many
courses for lack of space. We have recently hired faculty whose interests
reflect the change in orientation of the Department. The nucleus of a eukaryotic
contingent has been formed with the addition of a virologist and a three
immunologist. The Department is evolving to fill a niche within the college
focusing on prokaryotic biology and immunology/virology. </P>

<H3><A NAME="accompl"></A>Accomplishments</H3>

<P>The Department of Microbiology has demonstrated strength in its educational
and service activities and with the addition of several new faculty members,
the potential for increased research activity is quite large </P>

<UL>
<LI>Contract and grant funding has ranged from approximately $575,000 to
$830,000 during the period FY '89 to FY '94.</LI>

<LI>The faculty average 2.4 research publications per faculty member each
year.</LI>

<LI>We hired three new faculty members in 1993-1994.</LI>

<LI>Our graduate program has been revised.</LI>

<LI>We graduated an average of 6 Ph.D. and 3 M.S. students each year.</LI>

<LI>We teach over 1000 undergraduates each year, and the numbers are increasing.</LI>

<LI>We graduate 40-60 Microbiology majors each year.</LI>

<LI>Our faculty receives high evaluation marks for teaching and advising.
</LI>

<LI>We have approved a new departmental Honors program.</LI>

<H3>Mission of the Department: </H3>

<P>To provide training in Microbiology and its related disciplines to our
undergraduate majors integrating practical laboratory skills with theoretical
concepts,</P>

<UL>
<LI>to provide to the College and University courses that convey the discipline
of Microbiology including the fields of Virology, Immunology and Molecular
Biology, </LI>

<LI>to provide our graduate students with general training in the field
of Microbiology as well as specialized training in their area of research
interest,</LI>

<LI>to provide an environment that fosters and rewards research, teaching,
and other scholarly pursuits of our faculty and students,</LI>

<LI>to educate the larger community as to the importance of, and the benefits
derived from, the field of Microbiology,</LI>

are used in research.  These faculty interact closely with inter-campus
<a href="/grad/mocb.html">Molecular and Cell Biology Graduate Program</a>.
<p>
The <font size=+1>Neurobiology</font> group consists of faculty members who are allied
closely with the new <a href="http://www.inform.umd.edu/PNACS"> Program in Neuroscience
and Cognitive Science</a>.  Research interests among the Zoology 
neurobiologists include Sensory Physiology, Audition, Neurophysiology, Developmental 
Biology, Neuroethology, Motor Systems, Behavioral Physiology, and Neuromuscular 
Physiology.  Research involves a variety of organisms, including horseshoe crabs, 
jawless and jawed fishes, owls and small mamals. 
<p>
The <font size=+1>Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior</font> group includes faculty and
adjunct professors with primary interests in Population, Community, and Evolutionary
Ecology, Plant/Animal Interactions, Evolutionary Biology (including Functional

<h3>Program Objectives</h3>
The HHMI Undergraduate Research Fellowship Program establishes important student-mentor
relationships with the very best research faculty in the College of Life Sciences. Fellows
are exposed to the entire scope of the investigative process--from formulating questions,
hypotheses, and experiments in a grant-style proposal to conducting experiments, analyzing
data, drawing conclusions, and defending and publishing a finished product. Upon completion
of their degrees, fellows are well prepared for careers in basic and applied biomedical research
and in the health professions.

<p>

<h3>Financial Support</h3>
The program offers academic year stipends of $1,800 as well as $2,000 summer awards. Fellows
compete for supplemental grant funds of $500 to $2,000 to offset the direct costs of the
research project.  Summer fellows in residence at College Park may request a housing allowance
of $1,100.

<p>

<h3>Application Procedures</h3>
Fellowship applications are accepted each Fall and Spring semester.  Candidates are expected to
hold junior or senior standing with a competitive grade point average (minimum of 3.0) and have
completed at least one upper-level laboratory course within the College.  Candidates are also
encouraged to be members of a departmental honors program.<p>

Applications consist of grant-format project proposals, project budgets, and letters of support
from the faculty sponsor.  Applicants are evaluated by a panel of UMCP faculty.  Before
submitting a proposal, applicants are encouraged to develop and discuss their research project
with appropriate faculty investigators.

<h1>
  Biology of Small Populations:<br> 
A Research and Training Program</h1>
<h2>University of Maryland College Park and the <br>
Smithsonian Institution</h2>
<br>
<p>
  The Program on the Biology of Small Populations is a collaborative enterprise of
  several departments at the <a href=http://www.umcp.umd.edu>University of Maryland, College Park</a>, 
  and several branches of 
  the <a href=http://www.si.edu>Smithsonian Institution</a>.  It was funded as part of the National
  Science Foundation's Research Training Group Program in 1996.  The goals of the program are to carry out
  research on the biological consequences of small population sizes and to train students
  and postdoctoral scientists in this area.  The underlying rationale for the program is the
  perceived need for a "basic science" approach to the implications of small or greatly
  reduced population sizes.  Such an approach can help form and strengthen the foundation
  for applied work in conservation biology.  Given the rapid rate at which many biological
  populations are being reduced, a greater understanding of all aspects of the biology of
  small populations is urgently needed.  Faculty participants in the program come from a
  wide variety of disciplines within organismal biology, and promoting interdisciplinary
  work is one of the reasons for founding the group.

of the North South Center for Sustainable Development. The alarming 
growth in the technology and industry gap between the nations of the 
North and South and the environmental destruction which has 
accompanied unplanned economic development in the Third World now 
pose grievous threats to the global habitat. The efforts of Less 
developed nations to build human capital and assert themselves in 
the global marketplace need to go hand-in-hand with efforts to 
preserve the environment and enrich the quality of life. The North 
South Center for Sustainable Development in the College of Life 
Sciences, University of Maryland, College Park, is committed to 
efforts to improve communication and the exchange and training of 
personnel with these less developed nations. <p>

The<A HRef="bahia.html">Vera Cruz Florestal Project</A> is located 
in Southern Bahia near the coastal city of Porto Seguro, site of 
the first permanent settlement in Brazil. This area of Bahia was 
once almost totally covered by Atlantic Rain Forest. Unrestricted 
cutting of the forest and conversion to low quality pasture land 
has led to a situation where less than 5% of the original forest 
remains. The change from 1946 to 1990 is dramatically illustrated 
in the two maps (above.) University of Maryland scientists are 
collaborating with local investigators to study several interesting 
questions having to do with biodiversity and sustainable development.

 Maryland Association of Biology Teachers was founded in
1934 by a group of high school and college biology
teachers.  The first meeting was held at Western Maryland
College in the Spring of 1934, and the topic was "What's
New in Diatom Research?"  Dr. Lloyd Bertolf, Professor of
Biology, Western Maryland College served as the first
president.  A constitution was not written and adopted
until 1942 and the annual dues were seventy-five cents. 
No meetings were held during the war years of 1943, 1944,
and 1945, presumably because of gas rationing.
<p>
The goals of MABT were to:
<p>
<ul>
<li>increase and disseminate the knowledge related to the
       biological sciences,<p>
<li>study and promote new trends and methods relative to
       the teaching of biology and life sciences,<p>
<li>protect and maintain high ethics and standards of the
       teaching profession,<p> 
<li>maintain high ethics and standards of the teaching
       profession, and recognize special accomplishments in
       biology teaching.

<p>
The Spring 1997 MABT meeting will be held March 14
and 15 at College Park.  Hosted and co-sponsored by UMCP's
College of Life Sciences, the 1997 meeting will focus on
the theme of "<i><b>Connections</b></i>".  This theme refers to the
major goals and objectives of this meeting:
<p>
to establish connections:
<p>
<ul>
<li>among high school and middle school
           colleagues,<p> 
           
<li>among these teachers and their
           university counterparts,<p>
           
<li>with current ideas and innovations in
           laboratory instruction, the
           instructional resources on the Internet
           and World Wide Web, and relevant
           vendors and publishers.
</ul>
<p>

The MABT organizers recognize the importance of a
well attended, high quality forum for the exchange of
ideas.  To accomplish the stated objectives and facilitate
the formation of connections, support must be obtained
from the State, from UMCP, and from the private sector.
<p>
A future mailing will include registration forms, a
finalized program agenda, and travel and lodging
information.  Please mark your calendars and reserve 14

<title>JOINT INSTITUTE FOR FOOD SAFETY AND APPLIED NUTRITION</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h2>JOINT INSTITUTE FOR FOOD SAFETY AND APPLIED NUTRITION</h2></center>
<p>
The Joint Institute for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (JIFSAN) is 
a cooperative venture of the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
and the University of Maryland at College Park (UMCP).  The Director of 
JIFSAN is a tenured Professor at UMCP and reports to an Executive Committee 
consisting of personnel from UMCP and FDA.  JIFSAN will operate on a budget 
provided by UMCP and FDA, as well as research grant, contract, and gift 
funds.  The mission of JIFSAN is to establish and carry out cooperative 
research and education programs that are consistent with the mission of 
FDA and UMCP.  Examples include:  food safety and nutrition research programs, 
including cooperative research programs between JIFSAN and other federal, 
state and private organizations;  and the development  of educational programs, 
including academic  courses, short courses, workshops, and seminars;  and 
programs for student internships, visiting scholars, industrial research 
fellows, and executive training.
<p>
FDA is the lead United States regulatory agency responsible for assuring the 
safety of the nation's food supply.  The Center for Food Safety and Applied 
Nutrition (CFSAN) has responsibilities for research, policy, and regulation 
in food safety, nutrition, food labeling, and cosmetics.  The Center for 
Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has responsibilities for research, policy, and 
regulation of animal drugs, food additives, feed ingredients, and medical 
devices.  FDA's mission in food safety, applied nutrition, and veterinary 
medicine is to ensure that:
<p>
1.  The food supply is microbiologically, nutritionally and toxicologically 
safe and wholesome and cosmetics are safe.
<p>
2.  Food and cosmetic products are honestly, accurately and informatively labeled.
<p>
3.  Animal drugs, food additives, feed ingredients, and medical devices are 
safe and effective.
<p>
FDA carries out its mission with a staff that includes a large cadre of 
chemists, microbiologists, biologists, toxicologists, nutritionists, food 
technologists, physicians, and veterinarians.  JIFSAN will reside in a new 
$84M laboratory/office at the College Park/University of Maryland Metro site 
as well as FDA's existing state-of-the-art animal testing facilities in close 
proximity at Beltsville, MD.  Selected CFSAN scientists will have adjunct and 
research faculty positions at UMCP.  JIFSAN scientists will also participate 
in FDA regulatory policy and review functions.  The participation  of JIFSAN 
scientists in research programs related to the FDA regulatory activities and 
the consultative arrangements with other scientists that will be facilitated 
by JIFSAN will ensure the critical science-based foundation for FDA regulatory 
policy.  JIFSAN will expand FDA collaborative research networks, such as are 
underway at FDA's National Center for Food Safety and Technology.
<p>
UMCP is the most comprehensive research and educational institution of the 
national capital region, with programs in a broad spectrum of disciplines.  
UMCP programs that are particularly relevant to the FDA mission include 
nutrition, chemistry, biology, food science, microbiology, animal science, 
veterinary medicine, public policy, statistics, computer science, communications, 
and survey methodology.  In addition, the UMCP campus provides excellent research, 
library and computer infrastructure facilities to all of these programs.  JIFSAN, 
as a collaborative venture of FDA and UMCP, will enhance the availability of 
these programs and facilities for public policy purposes while expanding the 
educational research and training programs of both institutions.

<b><u><p>
Objectives</u></b>:<p>
<p>
1.	Discuss the function and regulation of the organ systems of mammalian
organisms.<p>
2.	Come to an understanding of these systems through a series of self-paced,
comprehensive laboratory exercises.<p>
3.	Enjoy ourselves and create a classroom environment conducive to
<u>active</u> learning and <u>independent</u> investigation.<p>
<b><u><p>
Prerequisites</u></b>:  Zoology 211 and Chemistry 233 (as listed in the UMCP
Undergraduate Catalog).<p>
<p>
	All students are expected to be familiar with the following topics from Zool
211.  You will have the opportunity to review some of them in laboratory.
Refer to the <b><i>optional</i></b>  exercises on <b><i>muscle structure and
function </i></b>and <b><i>neurosys</i> </b>located in the laboratory section
of this volume.<p>
-Lipids and cell membranes<p>
-Membrane permeability and transport	<b>Please note that these topics are
also</b><p>
-Osmotic pressure			<b>	all covered in unassigned sections of</b><p>
-Muscle contraction			<b>	your textbook.</b><p>
-Membrane potentials and action potentials<b><u><p>
Lecture</u></b>:	Monday, Wednesday, and Friday @ 8:00 A.M. in ZOP 1240<p>
<p>
	All lectures will be taped and copies will be available for student use in the
NonPrint Media Center, Room 4210, Hornbake Library.  Request a tape by the
course (Zoology 422) and the date of the lecture.  It usually takes two working
days to copy a lecture tape for distribution.  Twenty-two years of 422 history
have shown that students gaining an extra hour of sleep and relying on lecture
tapes do not fare well!  Use these tapes as a lecture supplement, not as a
substitute!<p>

<p>
	An examination may be returned to my staff for regrading <u>only</u> if the
total points were incorrectly totaled or if your answer can be documented by
text materials.  We will not consider answers which were misinterpreted by the
grader due to sloppy handwriting, poor organization, or incorrect terminology.
Your answers must be clear and concise the first time. A general plea for help
or a nonspecific request will not be honored.<p>
<p>
	An examination must be resubmitted to my staff by placing it in the box in the
laboratory within one week (7 days) of its return to you.  It must be
accompanied by a <b><u>TYPED</u></b> concise, brief (maximum of one (1) page)
summary of rebuttal or explanation.  Examinations written in pencil, turned in
after one week, or handed to staff member will not be considered.  Some of the
graded examinations will be photocopied before their return to discourage
academic dishonesty.<p>
<b><u><p>
Make-Up Examinations</u></b>:<p>
<p>
	Please refer to the current edition of the UMCP Undergraduate Catalog for
policies and procedures.  These regulations (<b><u>including the requirement

**************************************************************************<p>
<b><u><p>
Appointments</u></b>:<p>
<p>
	Communication is essential:  we must hear your comments, criticisms,
questions, etc.  I will make an effort to visit the laboratories.  I arrive at
the lecture hall by 7:40 AM and am eager to answer your questions.  I will
usually have up to 30 minutes after lecture to answer your questions.  Feel
free to chat during these times.  I enjoy hearing from our clients!  Your GTA
will also have time to discuss both lecture and laboratory material with you.
If the class shows sufficient interest, we are willing to schedule group
discussions/reviews.  Just ask, and you shall receive!<p>
<p>
	If the need arises, you may schedule an appointment with me by visiting Ms.
Sheron Thomas, 1212 Symons Hall, or by calling her at 405-2908.  Please note
that my teaching schedule and administrative duties preclude any "drop in"
visitors.<p>
<p>
	Dr. Know-it-all will always be available via email.  Use the VERTPHYS for

LABORATORY</b><i><p>
<p>
	Please note that the laboratory exercises require the use of animals.  I have
reduced the number of animals used by modifying procedures and introducing
computer simulations into the laboratory.  However, certain key objectives of
the course cannot be accomplished without experimental surgery.  We will adhere
to Federal guidelines and insist upon humane treatment of animals at all times.
If you have a problem with this approach for religious, ethical, or personal
reasons, please see me immediately.  This sensitive issue must be addressed by
all concerned parties.</i><p>
<p>
We will achieve the following goals in the lab:<p>
-	familiarization with some of the experimental techniques and procedures of
physiology;<p>
-	introduction to experimental design, hypothesis testing, and methods of data
collection and analysis;<p>
-	amplification and clarification of homeostatic mechanisms covered in
lecture;<p>
-	provide the opportunity for independent laboratory investigation.<p>
<p>
	You will become comfortable with the computer and other equipment and utilize
them to explore physiological concepts.  Each student will have the time and
opportunity to become familiar with the equipment and to accumulate the kind of
"hands on" experience with experimental techniques which is necessary to
understand the possibilities and limitations of experimental methods.  By
examining experimentally some of the homeostatic mechanisms considered in the
course in some depth, the student should gain significant experience in
experimental design, hypothesis testing, data collection and analysis, rather
than simply view a brief demonstration.<p>

<H3>Undergraduate Program</H3>

<P>A major in Microbiology is offered through the Biological Sciences Program.
Microbiology is a field fundamental to all of biology. Microorganisms provide
the primary steps in the food chain. The metabolic pathways and genetic
systems within bacteria have served as stepping stones for later discoveries
in other systems. Specialization in the field of microbiology encompasses
not only study of the fundamental processes of bacteria, but also the examination
of animal, plant and bacterial viruses, animal and plant defense systems
that counter infection and invasion by microorganisms. Microbiology, including
subfields of virology and immunology, continues to be at the forefront
of scientific investigation. Microbiological principles are being applied
in ecology, biotechnology, medicine, agriculture and the food industry.
The field is full of potential. Students of microbiology will find opportunities
in academia, industry, medicine, public health, biotechnology and law.</P>

<H3>Requirements for MICB Specialization</H3>

<P>Students who choose to declare a specialization in MICB should do so
by visiting the College of Life Sciences Office, 1224 Symons Hall. A Bachelors
degree at UMCP requires that students complete 120 credits. Students must
complete:</P>

CORE&nbsp;Program</A>. </P>

<H3>Advising</H3>

<P>All students in the Biological Sciences Program are required to see
an advisor each semester. Students who choose to specialize in Microbiology
will be assigned to one of our faculty for advising. General questions
regarding advising should be directed to the Coordinating Advisor, <A HREF="mailto:asmith@microb.umd.edu">Dr.
Ann Smith.</A><I> </I></P>

<H3>Research Experience and Internships</H3>

<P>Students may gain research experience in laboratories off campus with
cooperating institutions such as NIH, Walter Reed and USUHS, by registering
for MICB 388R or on campus in faculty laboratories by registering for MICB
399. These courses can be used for credit to the MICB&nbsp;major. The research
commitment is usually for one semester. Students interested in a long term
research commitment are encouraged to apply to the Microbiology Honors
Program.</P>

<H3>Honors and Awards</H3>

<P>Each year one outstanding senior, graduating in the field of Microbiology,
will be honored by faculty vote to receive the Sigma Alpha Omicron Award.
This honored student receives an individual award and their name is added
to a plaque of previous SAO&nbsp;recipients which is displayed in the Atrium
of the Microbiology Building. Sigma Alpha Omicron is a UMCP&nbsp;undergrduate
honor society for microbiologists. Students who achieve a GPAof 3.0 overall
and a 3.5 in microbiology courses after completing 11 credits in microbiology
courses, are invited to the society. Students completing the Microbiology
Honors Program are eligible for the Arne P. Hanson Award. The award is
given to the student, who by faculty vote, has had the most outstanding
honors project during that year. These awards are given yearly in the spring
at the SAO&nbsp;initiation ceremony.</P>

<H3>Student Organizations</H3>

<P>Our department houses a student chapter of the <A HREF="http://www.asmusa.org/">American
Society for Microbiology</A>. The group plans academic and social events
that would be of interest to any student interested in Microbiology or
related fields. Leave a message in the ASM mailbox (MICB Building, room
1109) and a member will contact you with more information. Sigma Alpha
Omicron, the Microbiology Honor Society, serves as a subcommittee of the
ASM student chapter.</P>

<h3> Introduction </h3><P>

The graduate program in molecular and cell biology at the <a
href="http://www.umcp.umd.edu">University of Maryland College Park (UMCP) </a> offers
study leading to the Doctor of Philosophy degree.  The program is multidisciplinary and
interdepartmental, supported by faculty from the Departments of Plant Biology,
Chemistry and Biochemistry, Entomology, Microbiology, and Zoology in the College of Life
Sciences; the Departments of Agronomy, Animal Sciences, Horticulture and Poultry Science in
the College of Agriculture; Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine; the
Center for Agricultural Biotechnology and the Center for Advanced Research in Biotechnology in
the Maryland Biotechnology Institute; and from several institutes in the National Institutes of
Health.</p> 
<p> The core requirements of the program consist of four lecture courses in molecular and cell
biology, genetics, and biochemistry and two one-semester rotations in the laboratories of the
participating faculty.  After completion of the core requirements, usually in
the first year, each student must take three semesters of advanced, second-level courses in
specialty areas and topical subjects tailored to his or her development and needs.  Students are
required to attend weekly seminars, sponsored by the program, in which outstanding
molecular/cell biologists from other institutions and this campus give presentations about their
ongoing research.<p>
The UMCP student body is composed of persons from every state and sixty other countries.   The
graduate programs at UMCP are quite vigorous.  For example, about 250 graduate students are
enrolled in the College of Life Sciences. <p>
<hp>
<h3>Finances</h3>
The program offers teaching assistantships and research assistantships to admitted
students on a competitive basis.  For 1995-96, the stipends provide $9,900-$10,770 for the
academic year (9 1/2 months) plus tuition remission and, in most cases, eligibility for health
insurance coverage.  Summer stipends are available from various sources as well.  In addition,
the program recommends outstanding applicants to the Graduate School for its fellowships. 
When supplemented with matching funds from the program, these fellowships enhance the
financial support of the awardees at a level much higher than the regular fellowships and
assistantships.<br>
<h4>Cost of Study</h4>
In 1995-96, tuition is $230 per credit hour for in-state students and $375 per credit hour for out-
of-state students.  There are additional mandatory and optional fees.
<h4>Living and Housing Costs</h4>
The Off-Campus Housing Office provides assistance to graduate students seeking
accommodations.   Average monthly rent in the area ranges from $500 to $800.  Food prices are
similar to those in other large metropolitan areas. 

<h3>Applying </h3>
All application materials should be submitted by February 1 for admission in the fall semester
and by August 1 (June 1 for international students) for admission in the spring semester.  All
applicants must submit three letters of recommendation, official college transcripts, and Graduate
Record Examinations (GRE) scores.  International applicants must also submit a Test of English
as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) score.  Applicants must have a bachelor's degree and a strong
background in physical and biological sciences.  Applicants are encouraged to visit the
University to meet with faculty and to discuss their interests and possible course of study.  Click

<b>ORGANIZATION OF THE NUCLEUS LAMINARIS AND
NUCLEUS MAGNOCELULARIS IN PARAKEETS:<br>
A Comparative Approach To Sound Localization<p>
</b></center>

<p>Different species of birds are known to have different sound
localizing ability.  These differences can be seen at the anatomical
level through comparisons of the nuclei of the auditory brainstem.
<p>The barn owl (Tyto alba) is known for it's ability to locate
sound for predatory purposes.  They use interaural time difference (ITD)
as a means to locate sound in complete darkness.  Signals from both ears
are first combined with respect to ITD in the nucleus laminaris (NL).
The NL is where the axonal afferents from the ipsilateral and
contralateral cochlear nucleus magnocellularis  (NM) interdigitate (Carr,
Konishi, 1988).  The NM afferents form a series of delay lines that
result in a map of ITDs in NL.  The neurons of the NL act as coincidence
detectors of impulses sent from the NM, maximally firing when stimulated
from both Nms simultaneously.
<p>Comparisons between the NL of barn owls and chickens which have
non-specialized auditory systems have shown differences in NL structure.
The NL of the chicken can be described as a monolayer or lamina of
neurons where ITDs are also mapped.  The barn owl however possesses a
wider more distributed NL structure.  This anatomical difference can be
correlated with the barn owl's superior ability to localize sound.
<p>Parakeets are known to have the ability to detect complex sound.
They have also shown highly tuned response to ITD (Amagai, et al. 1996).
Preliminary anatomical data has shown that the structure of the NL lies
somewhere in between of the two extremes represented by the chicken and
barn owl (Kubke, et al. 1996).   It is therefore important to investigate
the anatomy of this nucleus in the parakeet, to correlate the anatomy of
the structures with physiological studies in progress.
<p>This summer I will be processing serial sections using the
antibody against calbindin.  This antibody labels cells from the NL but
not cells from the NM.  NM cells will be visualized by staining with
neutral red or other histological stains.  Camera lucida drawings of each
section and the sound localization nuclei within each section will then
be digitized and manipulated through the use of NIH Image,  Macromedia's
Extreme 3D, and similar software in order to obtain a fluid, three
dimensional computer model of the different auditory nuclei of the
parakeet's brainstem.
<p>Upon completion of the computer model of the nuclei, the
individual cell types within the NL will be modeled in a similar fashion
to be analyzed in conjunction with the original three dimensional model
of the auditory brainstem to determine the relative position of the
different cell types within the tonotopic axis.  Later in the summer,
biotilinated dextran amine (BDA) injections will be used to label axonal
afferents from both the ipsilateral and contralateral NMs which
interdigitate in the NLs. Camera lucida and confocal microscopy images
will be obtained from these labeled axonal afferents and will be
digitized in order to perform similar three dimensional reconstructions.
The relative patterns and position in which they interdigitate in the NL
will also be correlated the NL cellular organization.
<p>This union of physiological experiments with three dimensional
anatomical models is valuable because it will be possible to correlate
physiological properties with specific anatomical characteristics.

<b>
EFFECTS OF CYANOGENIC GLUCOSIDES AND CYANIDES ON THYROID FUNCTION<P>
</b></center>

<p>Manihot esculenta, or cassava, is a pan-tropical staple crop
consumed by 300 to 500 million people daily. The plant is indigenous to
South America and has subsequently been introduced worldwide. Cassava,
known in the United States as tapioca or yuca, is a rich source of the
cyanogenic glucosides linamarin and lotaustralin. Once ingested, the
cyanide moiety is cleaved via linamarase and hydrogen cyanide is formed
and circulated throughout the bloodstream. The body converts ingested
cyanide to thiocyanate via the enzyme rhodanase.
<p>Hypothyroidism is a condition found throughout the world and is
associated with low iodine intakes. In some populations, low iodine
intakes are associated with high serum thiocyanate levels.It is believed
dietary cyanogenic glucosides are among the most significant natural
biological sources of cyanide and elevated serum thiocyanates.
Thiocyanate is also present in cigarette smoke and increased blood SCN
levels have been detected in smokers. Swine are an excellent model for
human metabolic processes and young swine are expected to show the
greatest thyroid responses to any elevations in serum thiocyanate.
<p>In many studies testing the effects of cyanogenic glucosides and
cyanides on thyroid function, the levels of these compounds used are not
relevant to normal biological intake such as that ingested by eating
foods containing cyanogenic glucosides.I wish to test the physiological
effects of biologically relevant levels of these compounds and their
resulting metabolic byproduct, thiocyanate, on several indices of
thyroid  function in an in vivo system. To accomplish this, I am using  a
sample of 24 piglets.
<p>The central hypothesis of this study is that treated animals will
express hypothyroidism relative to control animals as measured by a
selected set of response variables: thyroid stimulating hormone (or
thyrotropin), thyroxine, triodothyronine (or T3),tetraiodothyronine,
thyroxine-binding globulin, albumin, and blood serum thiocyanate levels.
The  null hypothesis is that treatments will not influence thyroid
function relative to control animals.
<p>Twenty four miniature swine (Sus domesticus) siblings,
Pittman-Moore strain (or similar variety) are to be studied. 8 animals
will be assigned to the control group and will receive a water placebo. In
addition, 8 animals will be assigned to the first treatment group and
will receive a treatment of cassava-based cyanogenic glucosides
(linimarin  and lotustralin). 8 animals will be assigned to the second
treatment group and will receive a comparable concentration of inorganic HCN.
Phenotypic  effects of the cyanogenic glucosides and inorganic cyanide
will be studied by looking for the following changes in levels (absolute
amounts) of TSH, T3, and T4 hormones, changes in the amount of
glycoproteins (for example thyroxine-binding globulin) and proteins (for
example, albumin),and changes in mitochondria size and number.Possible
genotypic effects of the cyanogenic glucosides and inorganic cyanide
will be examined by looking for changes in electrophoretic patterns of
glycoproteins and albumin.
<p>This data set should tell us more of the practical effects of
cyanogenic glucosides when given in biologically and anthropologically
relavent dosages.

<p>Bowerbirds are amoung the few avian species in which males make no
material contribution to offspring and in which female choice of males
appears especially dependent on the genetic contribution of males.  How
males court females and a criteria which females use to choose a male are
key elements in understanding the functional significance of mate
choice.  Models of sexual selection predict that females use male
displays in assessing his quality as a sire.  Studies have shown that
females mate with males that perform more aggressive (intensive) displays
because aggressiveness in display is an indication of the overall vigor
of the male that can be passed on to offspring.  However, if this is
true, the males are faced with a problem.  How do they effectively
display their genes without compromising the sense of safety in the
female; in other words, scaring her off.  Several years ago a study of the
spotted (Chlamydera maculata) and great (Chlamydera nuchalis) bowerbirds
was conducted to explore this paradox.  This study concluded that males
modulate their displays to ameliorate its threatening appearance.  This
behavior, referred to as threat reduction, is most evident in spotted
courtships.  In following the logic of threat reduction, the spotted
female positions herself facing the bower wall instead of the bower
opening as in other species such as great bowerbirds.  She then observes
the male's highly aggressive display from behind a see through wall which
offers protection to the female.
<p>In the proposed research I will study the behavior of the fawn
breasted (C. cerveniventris) and yellow breasted (C. lauterbachi)
bowerbirds.  The hypothesis I will test is, if males of these two species
modulate displays as has been observed in the two other Chlamydera
species.  I predict that court size should be correlated with the
intensity of display.  Thus species with small courts should have less
intense displays because males are near females during display.  To
compensate in showing genetic quality with reduced intensity of display,
males may court longer or display a behavior known as "head turning."
<p>I will test this hypothesis by using court measurements previously
taken in the field and the intensity of displays to construct a linear
plot that shows a proportional relationship in the four Chlamydera
species.  The intensity of display is defined as the frequency and
duration of wing flapping, head twitching, decoration throwing and
movement along the bower wall; greater frequencies of which corresponds
to greater intensity.  Frequencies will be measured by counting the
number of times a behavior is observed in the time frame of the
courtship.  Then the frequencies will be converted to rates.  Durations
will be timed with a stop watch.  The rates of each diplay will be
compared and plotted on a graph with its corresponding court size.  From
these results we may determine that a proportional relationship between
court size and intensity of display indeed exists using an analysis of
variance.  Furthermore we may observe that the conflict between
performing an aggressive display and reducing its threatening appearence
to the female is consolidated through compensating behaviors such as
head turning and longer courtships.

Project Summary:
DNA bending may be important in transcription initiation.  If the DNA is
bent, it could change protein-DNA interactions and also alter protein-
protein contacts.  The primary goal is to understand the DNA bending
patterns and properties associated with the binding of E.coli  RNA
polymerase.  The binding of RNA polymerase to a specific DNA sequence
(called the promoter), is a process that takes place when genetic
information (DNA) needs to be transcribed into RNA, which then becomes
translated into proteins that are used by the organism.   In this project, we
are interested in what happens at the stage of transcription, specifically,
the interactions between RNA polymerase and the promoter.  The goal of
the above agenda is to essentially answer the question of what is
advantageous about a particular geometry with regard to the function of the
enzyme (RNA polymerase) and the promoter in gene regulation and
transcription.  The techniques developed within this study could then be
applied to other higher-order DNA-protein complexes even with impure
mixtures. Little is still known about the exact nature of these interactions
and their kinetics. Research on this topic is not only fascinating, but also a
necessity for the advancement of knowledge about various genetic diseases
that affect many people.  With the present in vitro  studies, the results can
lead to future in vivo studies.

</center>

<p>
<b>Introduction</b><p>
The Marine-Estuarine-Environmental Sciences (MEES) Program is a graduate program leading to
M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. The mission of the MEES Program is to train graduate students in the
environmental sciences. There is a clear need for scientists with training in this area, given the
multitude of environmental problems faced by society today. The title of the program emphasizes
our strengths in marine and estuarine sciences, although the program spans environmental science
as a whole, irrespective of habitat. The interests of students in the program are diverse, but
generally center on some aspect of the interaction between biological and physical or chemical
systems. The analysis of this interaction may be anything from a study of molecular mechanisms
to an assessment of the economics of an environmental impact. To ensure that all students in the
program have some understanding of the breadth of information in the field of environmental
sciences, each student is required to have course work in a variety of areas.<p>

The MEES Program is interdisciplinary; its faculty consists of members from numerous units
within the University of Maryland System (UMS). In most cases, students within the MEES 
Program work in the laboratory of their research advisor in the department or unit to which
the advisor belongs. This may be a department of the Baltimore City or County Campus, the College
Park Campus, the Eastern Shore Campus, one of the biotechnology centers of the Maryland Biotechnology
Institute (MBI), or at laboratories of the Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies (CEES) - the
Horn Point Environmental Laboratory, the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory, or the Appalachian Environmental
Laboratory.<p>
Courses taken by MEES students are taught on all campuses of UMS and at the research laboratories.
In general, basic or fundamental courses are offered on the campuses, whereas more advanced and 
specialized courses are offered at both the campuses and research laboratories. A course taught 
anywhere within UMS is available to any graduate student registered at any campus through intercampus
enrollment.<p>
The interests of faculty and students within the MEES Program have led to six formally defined 
<a href=special.html#area>Areas of Specialization (AOSs),</a> from which a student may choose. The AOSs are:  Ecology,
Environmental Chemistry, Environmental Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Environmental
Science, Fisheries Science, and Oceanography. Each student will choose an AOS when applying,
and both admission and program requirements will depend on the AOS and the student's 
background and interests.<p>
The final section of this guide lists UMS faculty who are affiliated with the MEES Program and
indicates their research interests. Given that students will be admitted to the program <b>only</b> if a
research advisor can be identified for them, applicants are urged to contact potential advisors early
in the application process so they can determine the possibility of working with him or her.<p>
   
<b>Admission</b><p>

Applicants will be considered for admission and advising on all campuses by faculty associated 
with an appropriate Area of Specialization, based on the applicant's requests. Applicants are free to
apply to more than one AOS if so desired. Prospective students may apply through either the University
of Maryland Baltimore County Graduate School (for UMBC and UMAB), the Graduate School at College Park,
or the Graduate School at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. In general, a student who has identified
a specific member of the faculty with whom to work should apply to the campus where that faculty member
is affiliated. Addresses for obtaining application forms are given at the end of this Guide.<p>
Applicants to the MEES Program will be considered at both the M.S. and Ph.D. levels. In the event an
applicant to the Ph.D. program has only a B.A. or B.S. degree, admission may initially be to the
M.S. program with the final acceptance to the Ph.D. program contingent on successful completion of a 
probationary period and on the recommendation of the student's Research Advisory Committee. An Admissions
Committee from each Area of Specialization has been established to evaluate the applications of prospective
students based on the following criteria:<p>
<p>   
<ol>
<li> The applicant's research interests must be clearly stated and relevant to one or more of the MEES
Areas of Specialization.
<li>The academic preparation of the applicant must be consonant with stated interests and AOS requirements.
<li>The undergraduate GPA must be at least 3.0, although some students with a GPA below 3.0 may be provisionally accepted based on related research or work experience.
<li>Applicants must submit the following required documents as part of their application for graduate study in the MEES Program:
</ol>
<dl>
<dt><dd>
<ol type=a>   
<li>Graduate Record Examination Scores (Only the General Test is required, although one of the Advanced Tests is strongly recommended).
<li>Transcripts of all college-level work.
<li>A brief essay clearly defining areas of research interest and research objectives (preferably including the AOS(s) of interest). The essay should be carefully prepared, not in outline form, and will assist with identification of an academic advisor should the applicant be judged admissible.
<li>Three letters of recommendation from persons familiar with the academic work of the applicant.
</ol></dl><p>   
The initial screening of an applicant's credentials is done by the Admissions Committee of the appropriate AOS(s). Each AOS has course prerequisites (described later in this Guide); students missing several of these courses may be offered provisional acceptance. Students missing four or more prerequisites will generally not be admitted, and should plan to take some of those courses before applying again.
Receipt of the application will initiate the search for an appropriate faculty member to serve as the academic advisor for the student. No student will be admitted to the Program unless an advisor has been identified. Hence, if prior discussions have taken place between an applicant and a member of the faculty regarding the faculty member's serving as advisor to the student, that fact should be mentioned and a letter from the potential advisor should be in the student's file. The student will be matriculated on the degree-granting campus of their advisor, following formal acceptance of the applicant by the appropriate Graduate School.
<p>   
<b>Financial Assistance</b>
<p>
Each University of Maryland Campus has several MEES Graduate Teaching Assistantships. In addition, any financial aid available to graduate students on the University of Maryland campuses is available to MEES students on a competitive basis. This includes Maryland Fellowships, Graduate School Fellowships, CEES Fellowships, and Other Race Grants available through the Graduate Schools. Information on these award programs is given in the application booklet, which includes the forms necessary to apply for admission as well as financial aid application forms.
<p>
Teaching Assistantships may also be available through funds provided by academic departments. Research Assistantships are available through contracts and grants to faculty sponsored by outside agencies and through research funds allocated to specific research laboratories. The student's advisor will take particular responsibility to assist in identifying these sources of financial aid for the student.
<p>
Students frequently find part-time employment in offices and laboratories in the BaltimoreWashingtonAnnapolis area and other parts of the state. The MEES Office is often in a position to assist students in locating part-time employment.
<p>
<b>Advisors, Research Advisory Committees, and Proposals</b>
<p>
Every MEES student must have a faculty advisor upon admittance. This person will be responsible for advising on all aspects of the student's progress through the program. Any request for a change of advisor must be submitted to and be approved by the AOS committee and the MEES Director.
<p>
In certain situations, a student may want a second Academic Advisor. This might happen if, for instance, the professor most familiar with the student's work is not a graduate faculty member. In this case it is possible to set up a Co-Advisor team of two professors who jointly serve in the role of Advisor.

<h3>Introduction </h3>

<p>The graduate program in microbiology at the<a href="#virol"> </a><a href="http://www.umcp.umd.edu">University
of Maryland College Park (UMCP) </a>offers study leading to the Doctor
of Philosophy degree or the Master of Science degree. The department consists
of 14 research faculty and 2 instructors, and affords exposure to a variety
of disciplines. The core requirements of the program consist of four lecture
courses in genetics, microbial physiology, immunology and virology. Students
are required to attend weekly seminars, sponsored by teh program, in which
outstanding scientists from other institutions and this campus give presentations
about their ongoing research. Laboratory research or a rotation is initiated
immediately upon beginning the program.</p>

<p>The UMCP student body is composed of persons from every state and sixty
other countries. The graduate programs at UMCP are quite vigorous. For
example, about 250 graduate students are enrolled in the College of Life
Sciences. The central location of the UMCP campus facilitates interaction
with local government agencies such as FDA &amp; NIH, as well as with industry
in the technology corridor. </p>

<h3>Finances</h3>

<p>The program offers teaching assistantships and research assistantships
to admitted students on a competitive basis. For 1996-97, the stipends
provide $10,800-$11,200 for the academic year (9 1/2 months) plus tuition
remission and, in most cases, eligibility for health insurance coverage.
Summer stipends are available from various sources as well. In addition,
the program recommends outstanding applicants to the Graduate School for
its fellowships. When supplemented with matching funds from the program,
these fellowships enhance the financial support of the awardees at a level
much higher than the regular fellowships and assistantships. </p>

<h4>Cost of Study</h4>

<p>In 1996-97, tuition is $250 per credit hour for in-state students and
$375 per credit hour for out- of-state students. There are additional mandatory
and optional fees. </p>

<h4>Living and Housing Costs</h4>

<p>The Off-Campus Housing Office provides assistance to graduate students
seeking accommodations. Average monthly rent in the area ranges from $500
to $800. Food prices are similar to those in other large metropolitan areas.
</p>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

The graduate program in molecular and cell biology at the <a

href="http://www.umcp.umd.edu">University of Maryland College Park (UMCP) </a> offers
study leading to the Doctor of Philosophy degree.  The program is multidisciplinary and
interdepartmental, supported by faculty from the Departments of Plant Biology,
Chemistry and Biochemistry, Entomology, Microbiology, and Zoology in the College of Life
Sciences; the Departments of Agronomy, Animal Sciences, Horticulture and Poultry Science in
the College of Agriculture; Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine; the
Center for Agricultural Biotechnology and the Center for Advanced Research in Biotechnology in
the Maryland Biotechnology Institute; and from several institutes in the National Institutes of
Health.</p> 
<p> The core requirements of the program consist of four lecture courses in molecular and cell
biology, genetics, and biochemistry and two one-semester rotations in the laboratories of the
participating faculty.  After completion of the core requirements, usually in
the first year, each student must take three semesters of advanced, second-level courses in
specialty areas and topical subjects tailored to his or her development and needs.  Students are
required to attend weekly seminars, sponsored by the program, in which outstanding
molecular/cell biologists from other institutions and this campus give presentations about their
ongoing research.<p>
The UMCP student body is composed of persons from every state and sixty other countries.   The
graduate programs at UMCP are quite vigorous.  For example, about 250 graduate students are
enrolled in the College of Life Sciences. <p>
<hp>
<h3>Finances</h3>
The program offers teaching assistantships and research assistantships to admitted
students on a competitive basis.  For 1996-97, the stipends provide $10,800-$11,200 for the
academic year (9 1/2 months) plus tuition remission and, in most cases, eligibility for health
insurance coverage.  Summer stipends are available from various sources as well.  In addition,
the program recommends outstanding applicants to the Graduate School for its fellowships. 
When supplemented with matching funds from the program, these fellowships enhance the
financial support of the awardees at a level much higher than the regular fellowships and
assistantships.
<h4>Cost of Study</h4>
In 1996-97, tuition is $250 per credit hour for in-state students and $375 per credit hour for out-
of-state students.  There are additional mandatory and optional fees.
<h4>Living and Housing Costs</h4>
The Off-Campus Housing Office provides assistance to graduate students seeking
accommodations.   Average monthly rent in the area ranges from $500 to $800.  Food prices are
similar to those in other large metropolitan areas. 

<h3>Applying </h3>
All application materials should be submitted by February 1 for admission in the fall semester
and by November 1 for admission in the spring semester.  All
applicants must submit three letters of recommendation, official college transcripts, and Graduate
Record Examinations (GRE) scores.  International applicants must also submit a Test of English
as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) score and a Test of Spoken English (TSE) score.  Applicants
must have a bachelor's degree and a strong
background in physical and biological sciences.  Applicants are encouraged to visit the
University to meet with faculty and to discuss their interests and possible course of study.  Click

<title>What is it?</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h1> What is it?</h1>
<p>
  The Program on the Biology of Small Populations is a collaborative enterprise of
  several departments at the <a href=http://www.umcp.umd.edu>University of Maryland, College Park</a>, 
  and several branches of 
  the <a href=http://www.si.edu>Smithsonian Institution</a>.  It was funded as part of the National
  Science Foundation's  Research Training Group Program in 1996.  The goals of the program are to carry out
  research on the biological consequences of small population sizes and to train students
  and postdoctoral scientists in this area.  The underlying rationale for the program is the
  perceived need for a "basic science" approach to the implications of small or greatly
  reduced population sizes.  Such an approach can help form and strengthen the foundation
  for applied work in conservation biology.  Given the rapid rate at which many biological
  populations are being reduced, a greater understanding of all aspects of the biology of
  small populations is urgently needed.  Faculty participants in the program come from a
  wide variety of disciplines within organismal biology, and promoting interdisciplinary
  work is one of the reasons for founding the group.  
<p>  
   The program is supported by the faculty expertise and the wide range of laboratory
  and field facilities available from three departments at the University of Maryland at
  College Park and three nearby Smithsonian Institution facilities. The faculty includes
  researchers with field, laboratory, and theoretical expertise, and with experience in a wide
  variety of animal, plant, and microbial systems; see the following list of faculty for a brief
  description of current research interests.  The combined physical facilities include
  unparalleled facilities for managing and observing captive populations, and several state-
  of-the-art molecular laboratories.
<p>Current research projects span a wide range of organisms and approaches.  Here is a small sample of some ongoing research projects: 
<ul>
	<li>Analyses of mathematical models to determine the community-level consequencesof selectively eliminating top predators
which often have the smallest population sizes and largest habitat requirements of the species in a community.<p>
	<li>Studies of the effect of subdivision and patterning of food resources for benthic organisms in stream communities.<p>
	<li>Experimental studies of the extent of purging of deleterious genes via inbreeding in small populations.<p>
	<li>Studies of the effects of population bottlenecks on the nature and extent of variation in populations using both plants and viruses as subjects.<p>
	<li>Investigation of the interaction between the Baltimore checkerspot butterfly (currently endangered in Maryland) and its food plant for use in
reintroduction programs.<p>
      <li>Studies of the effect of social learning of foraging behaviors by golden lion tamarins for use in reintroductions.<p> 
</ul>
     The Biology of Small Populations RTG (Research Training Group) program
  includes activities at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. 
  Undergraduates take a special seminar course and carry out a research project under
  faculty supervision.  Predoctoral participants receive their degree from one of the
  participating departments at the University of Maryland.  They are required to take a
  flexible, but broad curriculum, that includes a one-semester course specifically on the
  biology of small populations.  Ph.D. candidates carry out their dissertation research under
  the direction of one or more faculty members.  Postdoctoral participants design and carry
  out independent research projects under the sponsorship of two faculty members.  The
  program includes a number of additional activities that are open to participants at all
  levels.  At least two "technical training sessions" are given each year; these are several-day-long
  courses on research techniques such as DNA sequencing or Geographic
  Information Systems.  A year-long seminar course explores a different aspect of the
  general research theme each year.  There is also a research meeting each spring with
  invited speakers and presentations by members of the program.

<title>Interested in a Post Doctoral Fellowship?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h1>Interested in a Post Doctoral Fellowship?</h1><p>
Applicants may request awards for 1 or 2 years.  The one-year awards are 
"research-only", while the 2-year awards require a 20-hour per week teaching commitment
during one semester, normally in the second year.  Individuals applying for either type 
of award are expected to take part in a weekly seminar and may be asked to participate 
in special short (3-5 day) courses to explain technical research methods (for example; 
DNA sequencing; using software for analysis of dynamical systems; geographic information
systems).  The timing and nature of the teaching commitment is somewhat flexible, but 
most awards will involve teaching laboratory or discussion sections in undergraduate 
biology courses.
<p>
A wide range of research projects will be supported under the training grant.  The main
research activities of postdoctoral fellows should involve investigation of some aspect
of the effects of population size on ecological, evolutionary, or behavioral processes.  We encourage
applications both from individuals who want to work closely with faculty members in the 
group, and from individuals with independent research projects.  The fellowships include 
a $4000 per year research allowance.  If your proposed research requires the use of 
laboratory facilities, you should communicate with the appropriate faculty member or 
with one of the co-directors of the program (Gerald Wilkinson, Peter Abrams) before 
applying, to ensure availability and access to the facilities.  Postdoctoral trainees 
can be located at any of the participating institutions/departments, depending on the 
trainee's interests.  The participating Smithsonian facilities are all within a 25-50 
minute commute from the University of Maryland at College Park, and seminars, courses 
and meetings will be held in both institutions.
<p>
In addition to the 18 faculty who are group members, there are a number of additional 
scientists at the participating institutions whose interests overlap with those of the 
group, and who can contribute to the research and training activities.  You can look at
information about their research and publications and send email from <b><a 
href=whoare.html>Who are the Faculty?</a></b>
<p>
<b>Compensation</b><br>
Trainees will receive a $25,000 stipend, health insurance, and a research allowance of 
$4000 each year.  Only U. S. citizens and permanent residents are eligible for these 
positions.  However, note that the Smithsonian Institution gives postdoctoral fellowships
 that are not restricted to U.S. nationals, and these fellowships may be used to support
work under our program, provided your sponsor in the Smithsonian is a group member.
<p>
<h2>Applications will consist of:</h2>
<p>
<ol> <li>A cover letter that states whether a one- or two- year position is being 
	requested.  The cover letter should also include the applicant's mailing address,
	 phone number(s) and email address.  It should identify the anticipated starting
	date, and should identify any requirements for lab facilities from faculty 
	members in the group. 
<p>
	<li>A curriculum vitae, including a current list of publications
<p>
	<li>A research proposal.  The proposal should be between four and six 
	single-spaced pages of text, and should include a section describing how the 
	project relates to the training grant theme of biological implications of small 
	population size. 
<p>
	<li>Three letters of recommendation. 
<p>
	<li>(if available) Copies of up to (but no more than) two representative reprints or preprints.
<p>
	<li>A graduate school transcript or a list of graduate courses taken and grades 
	received.
</ol>

Please send one copy of items (1), (4), (5) and (6), and five copies of items (2) and
(3) to BEES c/o Department of Zoology, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742. 
<p>
<b>The deadline for applications for postdoctoral positions is January 31, 1997.</b>  We
hope to announce awards by 1 March 1997. The awards must started before December 31, 1997.  
There will be another competition for postdoctoral fellowships with a 31 January, 1998 
application deadline. 
<p>
Applicants are encouraged to submit separate applications for <b><a href=http://www.si.edu/youandsi/studies/ofg/ofgintro.htm>
Smithsonian Institution Postdoctoral Fellowships</a></b>,
 which can also be used to support work within the Biology of Small Populations program.

  <h2>Graduate Training</h2>
 <p> 
  Participants in the predoctoral program must meet the general requirements of the
  department or program in which they are enrolled.  In addition, there are specific
  requirements of the training program.  In all cases, there is overlap between the
  departmental/program requirements and those of the training program, so at least some of
  the RTG requirements also satisfy departmental requirements.  The addresses of the
  department and program offices are listed below; these offices should be
  contacted for further information on departmental requirements. 
 <p> 
   <b>Core Courses:</b><br>  To obtain broad training in the fundamental principles of the related
  sub-disciplines at an advanced level, all RTG trainees are required to take a graduate
  course from each of following four categories during their first two years in the program.

<p>  
   In addition to these four courses, RTG graduate students must take a new course titled
  "Biology of Small Populations".  The aim of this course is to provide second or third year
  students with a technical and conceptual framework to understand the biology of small
  populations.  This course covers a range of topics that focus on unique aspects of small
  populations, and tools that are required to study or understand small populations.  Topics
  covered include stochastic processes, statistics of small samples, individual-based
  simulation models, and empirical problems associated with experiments on small
  populations.
<p> 
   All RTG students are also required to take a course on "Race, Gender, and Scientific
  Knowledge" currently offered in alternate years by Dr. Margaret Palmer. This course
  focuses on: (1) how women and persons of color have participated in and contributed to
  the sciences, as well as how barriers have influenced their participation; and (2) how
  gender, race, and scientific knowledge are linked.  Students are also encouraged to take a
  course, "Ethics in scientific research", currently offered annually by Dr. Arthur Popper
  (Zoology) and Dr. Robert Dooling (Psychology).  Both of these courses meet once a
  week.
<p>  
  <b>Other Available Graduate Courses and Seminars:</b><br>  A wide variety of other relevant
  courses are currently offered each year or in alternate years by Entomology, Plant
  Biology or Zoology faculty.  These include insect ecology, insect evolutionary biology,
  conservation biology, theoretical population and community ecology, concepts in
  ecology, ecology of marine communities, physiological plant ecology, plant population
  biology, population genetics, plant ecological genetics, principles of systematics,
  evolutionary theory, behavioral ecology, sociobiology and a three-semester series in
  statistics, which includes probability, experimental design, and general linear models,
  each with SAS laboratories, offered by BEES faculty in the Department of Animal
  Sciences.  In addition to lecture format courses, each department regularly offers graduate
  seminars on selected topics of interest to faculty and students.  These graduate seminars
  are frequently attended by multiple faculty and have provided an excellent forum for
  focused training on topical issues.  There is a weekly seminar in the <a href=http://www.inform.umd.edu:8080/EdRes/Colleges/LFSC/.FacultyStaff/dinouye/BEES/>
  BEES (Behavior, Evolution, Ecology, and Systematics) program</a></b>.  Additional
  seminars of related interest may be found in Maryland departmental seminar programs, 
  like those of the Entomology Department, and in the regular seminar programs at the
  National Zoo and Smithsonian Environmental Research Center. 
<p>  
   <b>Graduate Discussion Course/Annual Meeting:</b><br>  A key component of graduate training
  in the Biology of Small Populations is a new, year-long graduate discussion course that is
  organized each year by two RTG faculty from different departments, disciplines, or
  institutions.  The goal of this course is to explore some aspect of small population size
  from a multi-disciplinary perspective appropriate for the participating faculty.  Topics
  differ each year depending on the interests of the organizing faculty.  As part of the
  course, four or five noted scholars with expertise unavailable among the RTG faculty are
  invited to a three-day meeting during spring-break.  At this meeting all RTG
  undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral trainees, core faculty and visiting scholars
  present papers; and hold panel discussions to identify especially promising research areas. 
  These meetings provide an annual opportunity for all of the RTG participants to interact
  with each other as well as with visiting scholars. 
<p> 
   <b>Technical Training Sessions:</b><br> Students are eligible to enroll in any of a number of
  intense, short-term (1-7 day) technical training sessions that are offered either during the
  semester break or summer by UMCP and SI faculty or postdocs.  These training sessions
  provide hands-on experience to enable the RTG trainees to acquire technical skills
  necessary for assessing the consequences of small population sizes.  Some examples
  include application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to small population
  problems, radiotelemetry techniques, sound analysis and synthesis, microsatellite typing,
  multi-locus fingerprinting, DNA sequencing, population viability analysis, coalescent
  theory, and mathematical analysis or dynamical systems.  
<p>  
   <b>Research Internships:</b><br>  RTG predoctoral fellows are encouraged to participate in a
  	summer-long research internship at a <b><a href=http://www.si.edu/youandsi/studies/infell.htm>
	Smithsonian Institution</a></b> facility, faculty research
  	lab, or field site under the supervision of RTG faculty, preferably during their first or
  	second year. 
<p>  
   As a member institution of the <b><a href=http://www.ots.duke.edu/docs/main.htm>Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS)</a></b>, UMCP
  graduate students are eligible for priority consideration in the application process for OTS
  graduate courses offered each year in Costa Rica.
<p>  
  <b> Teaching:</b><br>  Because success in science requires effective communication, RTG
  fellows are required to spend at least three semesters during their doctoral program as
  graduate teaching assistants. 
<p>  
   <b>Program Progression:</b><br>  Just prior to their first semester in residence, each RTG trainee
  meets with three faculty who make suggestions and recommendations for any additional
  coursework.  During their second year students identify a dissertation research problem
  and form a preliminary examination committee containing five faculty, including one
  member from outside the home department.  After discussing the proposed research with
  their committee, students then are expected to collect sufficient pilot data, usually during
  the second summer in the program, to be able to defend a research proposal no later than
  the end of their fifth semester.  Most students will then spend two to three years
  conducting research prior to defending a dissertation.
<p>  
   <b>Financial Support:</b><br> Normally students admitted to the Ph.D. program will be
  guaranteed five years of financial support, including two full years of fellowship support
  from the research training grant, as long as they make satisfactory progress toward their
  degree.  Current stipends for the 9.5 months of the academic year are $10,800 for students
  who have not yet taken and passed their oral preliminary examination; and $11,200 for
  students who have passed their preliminary exam (usually taken in the fourth or fifth
  semester), and have thus officially advanced to PhD candidacy.  The RTG fellowships
  entail 12 months of support, so the amounts are $13,642 before advancement to
  candidacy and $14,147 after.  Fellowship support from the grant also includes tuition
  remission and health insurance.  Students accepted into the program may elect to defer
  part or all of their fellowship support until after their first two years, and may hold a
  teaching assistantship concurrently with the fellowship.
<p>  
   Support for the time during which a student does not have an RTG fellowship can
  come from a variety of sources: (1) teaching assistantships (3 semesters of teaching are
  required, but students are still eligible to apply for assistantships after completing this
  requirement); (2) faculty research grants, which provide support as research assistants
  over the summer or in the academic year; and (3) other fellowships from within and
  outside of the University.  All students are encouraged to apply for <b> <a href=http://flnew.nsf.gov/a10/A10Menu.htm>
  National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowships</a></b>.  Some students may be eligible to apply for other
  national fellowships, such as the <b><a href=http://fellowships.nas.edu/hhmireq.html>
  Howard Hughes Foundation Fellowship</a></b>.  The <b><a href=http://www.si.edu/youandsi/studies/ofg/ofgintro.htm> 
  Smithsonian Institution</a></b> also has predoctoral fellowships that are available on a
  competitive basis, and provide a full year of support (currently $14,500) to students
  who have advanced to PhD candidacy.  The <b><a href=http://www.inform.umd.edu:8080/EdRes/GradInfo/Fellowship>
  Graduate School at the University of Maryland</a></b> also provides 2 year fellowships on a university-wide competitive basis, and
  entering RTG students may be nominated for these.  Additional University of Maryland
  and Smithsonian Institution fellowship funds have been targeted for qualified ethnic
  minorities.  If you would like more information about fellowship opportunities, contact
  the RTG office or any of the faculty involved in the program.
<p> 
   Teaching assistantships may be held concurrently with some forms of fellowship
  support, including RTG fellowships.  Teaching assistantships include health insurance
  and tuition remission.  Although summer support is not guaranteed when the student does
  not have an RTG fellowship, in most cases, summer funds are available either from
  research grants or other programs.

  <h2>Application Procedure:<br>
 Graduate Studies in the Biology of Small
  Populations</h2>
<p>  
  At the graduate level, students who wish to pursue research on the evolution,
  ecology or behavior of small populations must apply to and matriculate in a Ph.D.
  program within a participating academic department on the College Park campus
  (presently, the departments of  <b><a href=http://www.inform.umd.edu/pbio>Plant Biology</a></b>,
  <b><a href=http://www.entm.umd.edu/welcome.htm>Entomology</a></b>, or
  <b><a href=http://www.life.umd.edu/zoology/index.html>Zoology</a></b>; in July 1997,
  Plant Biology and Zoology will be merged into a single Biology Department) or an
  intercampus degree-granting program.  The primary related intercampus program is the
  <b><a href=http://www.inform.umd.edu:8080/MEES>Marine, Estuarine, and Environmental
  Sciences (MEES) program</a></b>.  Addresses for these
  departments or programs are listed below.  Applicants who would like to discuss choice
  of a program may wish to contact one or more faculty members whose interests are
  closest to theirs.  All graduate students in research degree programs must have a major
  advisor before admission; thus it is a good idea for all applicants to communicate with
  potential advisors before submitting their application, see <b><a href=whoare.html>
  Who are the Faculty?</a></b> Students who wish to be advised by a faculty member from the Smithsonian Institution
  must also obtain a coadvisor in one of the University of Maryland departments.
<p>    
  When submitting an application to a department or program, prospective students
  should request in their cover letter that they be considered for the  Biology of Small
  Populations' program.  They should also include a statement (of not more than two pages,
  single spaced) describing their particular interests in the Biology of Small Populations. 
  For consideration by the Biology of Small Populations program, applications should be
  received by <b>January 31, 1997</b>.

<h1>Are you currently a UMD student?</h1><p>

 Part of the funds available from the research training grant on the
 Biology of Small Populations will be given to current students.  The
 following text describes the application procedures for the two types
 of fellowship (long- and short- term) that are available under the
 program.
<p> <hr align=center width=93% size=3> <p>
<h2>Application Procedures for Current UMD Students for Fellowship
Support from the Biology of Small Populations Research Training Grant</h2>
<p>
<b>1. Long-term fellowships</b>
<p>
PhD students enrolled at UMCP who have not yet advanced to candidacy
are eligible to apply for the long-term fellowships that entail 12 or
24 months of support at the normal TA/RA rate. The fellowship also
includes a tuition remission for the period of fellowship support. 
There may be flexibility in when money is received.  If awarded a
fellowship, students would then have to complete the coursework and
other requirements of the RTG program found in
<b><a href=http://www.life.umd.edu/bsprtg/doctoral.html>Interested in a Doctoral Fellowship?</a></b>
<p> 
Individuals wishing to be considered for these fellowships should submit:<p>
<ol><li>A two page essay describing how their interests fit into the research theme of
the "Biology of Small Populations"<p>
<li>Two letters of
recommendation, at least one of which must be from the research
supervisor<p>
<li>Unofficial copies of undergraduate and graduate
transcripts and GRE scores<p>
<li>If the applicant has already begun a
research project he or she should also include a 3-5 page description
of that project.</ol><p>
 Students supported by RTG fellowships may be asked to
give a presentation of their work at an annual spring meeting of the
RTG in either 1998 or 1999.
<p>
<b>The deadline for applications is January 31, 1997.</b><br>  Applications
should be sent to Kara Paintner/BEES, Department of Zoology,
University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742
<p>
<b>2. Short-term fellowships</b>
<p>
A limited number of short-term RTG fellowships will be awarded in
1997.  These are open to Ph.D. students in good standing in MEES,
Zoology, Plant Biology, or Entomology.  Short term fellowships to be
awarded in the spring of 1997 provide a stipend for either one
semester during the 1997-98 academic year or for the summer of 1997 at
normal TA/RA levels. They may also include a request for up to $1000 in supplies as justified
in the proposal(see below).<p>
The application procedure is as follows:<p>
<ol><li> Three copies of a 5 page research proposal that describes your
proposed work<p>
<li> A brief summary that describes how it is related to
the general theme of the RTG (i.e., how decreased population size
affects biological processes)<p>
<li>Two letters of recommendation, one
of which must be from your research supervisor<p>
<li>  If research expenses are requested, a 1 page budget and budget justification must
be included with the proposal. </ol><p>
Students supported by such a short-term
fellowship will be asked to give a presentation of their results at an
annual spring meeting of the RTG in either 1998 or 1999.  The Research
Training Grant should be acknowledged in any publications that result
from the supported work.
<p>
<b>The application deadline is March 1, 1997.</b><br>  Applications should be
sent to Kara Paintner/BEES, Department of Zoology, University of
Maryland, College Park, MD 20742
<p>
The maximum amount of fellowship support to any one individual under
the RTG grant is 24 months.  Thus, if you receive a 1-semester award
and subsequently apply for a long-term award, the maximum support on
the long-term award will be 2 years minus one semester.

Research Interest: <b>Molecular Evolution and Population Genetics</b><br>
 
We are pursuing experimental and theoretical studies in molecular evolution and population genetics. Our research focuses on three major areas: (i) genetic variation in natural populations of Drosophila, (ii) epistatic selection mediated by RNA secondary structure interactions, and (iii) molecular evolution of metallothionein genes in Drosophila. The first project is concerned with the detection of natural selection at the DNA level and the effects of genetic recombination and population subdivision on nucleotide sequence variation. The second project studies RNA secondary structure as a potential source of epistatic fitness interactions within genes. A mRNA secondary structure is constructed based on phylogenetic comparisons and mutation analysis. This structure is then used to analyze the evolution and population genetics of coupled ("compensatory") nucleotide substitutions. In the third project, we are reconstructing the recent history of Drosophila metallothionein genes. This work provides insights into the evolutionary significance of gene duplications and into intron evolution.

<h4>Estimating the rate of fixation of favorable mutations</h4>

Low recombination rates around a locus can cause a complete loss of heterozygosity if at this locus an advantageous mutation appears which is driven to fixation by directional selection. Such a process of fixation including loss of heterozygosity is called a  hitchhiking process.
Since the whole process takes place during a relatively short time period [t = (2 / s)ln(2N), where s is the selection coefficient] we can assume, that by measuring time in units of 2N generations the whole process lasts only a single time point. Under this assumption we talk about a hitchhiking event.
Given a sample of n genes of a region of very low recombination, we ask what is the expected time back to the occurrence of the last hitchhiking event?
To answer this question we used the coalescent approach. The time passed since the last hitchhiking event can be estimated by considering the number of segregating sites within the region in question, and so the pure genealogical coalescent process is not enough for approaching this problem - the mutational process is needed too.
The basic idea was to cut all possible coalescent trees of a sample of n alleles at the time of the hitchhiking event and to calculate the expected number of segregating sites on them. We obtained a function for the average number and variance of segregating sites dependent on time.
Example: The last hitchhiking event at the <I>vermilion</I> locus in  <I>Drosophila ananassae</I>  (sample size n = 19, theta/bp = .0075, 2 segregating sites) happened approximately .14 N generations back in the past.

<title>North South Center for Sustainable Development</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<img src=NSCSDlogo.gif alt="NSCSD Logo">
</center>
<p>
The alarming growth in the technology and industry gap between the nations 
of the North and the South has overwhelmed the Souths efforts to achieve 
social and economic progress or make significant contributions to the global 
marketplace. At the same time, the environmental destruction which has 
accompanied unplanned economic development in the Third World now poses 
grievous threats to the global habitat, with potentially devastating effects 
on the health and well-being of local populations. The efforts of less 
developed nations to build human capital and assert themselves in the 
global marketplace need to go hand-in-hand with efforts to preserve the 
environment and to enrich the quality of life.
<p>
The Administrations <i>Peace, Prosperity, and Democracy Act of 1994</i> has 
this to say about sustainable development: "Sustainable Development is 
in the long term interest of the United States because it builds the 
economic, political, environmental and social foundation for a secure 
and prosperous future. Without active United States support for sustainable 
development activities, the problems of persistent poverty, population 
growth, and environmental degradation threaten to undercut the best efforts 
of nations to build peace and prosperity."
<p>
The North South Center for Sustainable Development (<i>NSCSD</i>) in the College 
of Life Sciences, University of Maryland, College Park, is committed to 
efforts to improve communication and the exchange and training of personnel 
with these less developed nations. The University of Maryland is the ideal 
location for such a center because of its proximity to Washington D.C., the 
hub of the worlds largest brain trust of applied high-technology science and 
research institutions, global policy makers, and international conservation 
organizations.
<p>
<img align=right src=researcher.gif alt="Picture of researcher with microscope">
The purpose behind <i>NSCSD</i> is to enable experts across the range of conservation 
development and modern technology fields to efficiently and effectively 
exchange ideas and information, advance training and educational initiatives, 
respond to environmental problems, and promote economic advancement through the 
sustainable use of the earths resources. While the mission of <i>NSCSD</i> is to 
improve the human capital and address the problems of Third World countries, 
many of the projects will use models and results from similar problems here. 
The results of these efforts will also often find applications in the USA. For 
example, many of the urban growth versus environmental resources problems in 
this country are very similar, if only milder, to the problems facing less 
developed countries in the South. By way of example, <i>NSCSD</i> could address such 
diverse concerns as how to preserve the Chesapeake Bays fragile ecosystem 
without curtailing Marylands growth, how to combat the West Coasts chronic 
smog problems, or how to develop an implement improved early warning systems 
so as to reduce human harm and minimize damage from hurricane related weather. 
Clearly, the solutions to all os these national sustainable development problems 
have global applications.
<p>
<i>NSCSD</i> will have a unique focus on global human capacity building. It will:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Foster scientific collaboration between North and South;
<li>Integrate scientific disciplines;
<li>Develop new models for sustainable development;
<li>Pursue collaborative cutting-edge research;
<li>Promote self sufficiency through entrepreneurship; and 
<li>Develop training programs.
</ul><p>
The <i>NSCSD</i> has instituted several projects since it's inception in 1994 and 
will continue to expand its efforts over the coming years.

<title>Golden Lion Tamarin Conservation Project</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<img align=middle src=gltmap.gif alt="Golden Lion Tamarin Conservation Project Map Logo"><br>
</center>
<p>
<img align=right src=gltamarin.gif alt="Picture of Golden Lion Tamarin">
One of the best known rain forest conservation efforts in Brazil, 
the Golden Lion Tamarin Conservation Project (<i>gltcp</i>), is a mere two
hour drive from the city of Rio de Janeiro. The golden lion tamarin 
(<i>glt</i>), a strikingly beautiful squirrel sized primate, that exists only
in the lowland Atlantic Forest of the state of Rio de Janeiro, is 
one of the most endangered primate species on earth. All of the 
approximately 550 remaining wild individuals are found in the Po&#231o 
das Antas Federal Biological Reserve and the surrounding private 
land. The major threat to this species is habitat destruction for 
urban and resort development along the coast, and rice fields and 
cattle pasture farther inland. Less than 2% of the tamarins original 
forest habitat remains today, and all of that in small forest 
fragments. Essentially all of the diverse species native only to this 
forest are threatened with extinction.
<p>
The <i>gltcp</i> utilizes the golden lion tamarin as a flagship species to 
increase support for the conservation of what remains of this forest.
The project, which began in 1983, serves as a demonstration of the 
state-of-the-art conservation biology and organizational cooperation 
necessary to mobilize a region, and indeed the global community, to 
join forces in an effort to conserve a viable portion of one of the 
most endangered tropical forest ecosystems in the world. Faculty and 
students from the University of Maryland were instrumental in the 
founding of the project and continue to participate in all aspects of 
its conservation and research efforts. Additional partners include 
the Brazilian federal environment agency (<i>ibama</i>), the Rio state 
environmental agency, several Brazilian universities, local municipal 
governments, local non-government organizations, local landowners, 
community organizations and schools, World Wildlife Fund, zoos around 
the world, the Smithsonian Institution-National Zoological Park, 
along with many other local and international organizations.
<p>
The conservation of species such as golden lion tamarins, whose 
numbers have been so drastically reduced, requires the collaboration 
of experts from several disciplines. Each component of the project 
has clear objectives, documents its methods, and periodically 
evaluates results. Those working on the project have produced over 
130 scientific publications to date, helping to make it an 
internationally recognized model for understanding the forces that 
shape a primates behavior and probability for survival.
<p>
The components of this unique multidisciplinary approach, integrating 
scientific research and applied conservation, include:
<p>
<img src=gltamarin2.gif align=right alt="Picture of Golden Lion Tamarin">
<ul>
<li><i>Ecological studies of wild golden lion tamarins and other species</i> to 
better understand what is necessary to ensure this ecosystem has a future 
for the next 200 years and to monitor the projects success. By monitoring 
20 family groups, the research on wild <i>glt</i>s is the largest long-term field 
study on any primate in the world in terms of numbers of groups studied.
<p>
<li><i>Habitat protection and management</i> to increase the amount of forest habitat 
available. An inventory of suitable habitat outside the Reserve is now complete. 
Fire towers and a communication system are in use to protect the forest in the 
Reserve, and development of cost-effective techniques for forest restoration are 
underway.
<p>
<li><i>A community education program</i> focusing on developing support for forest 
conservation on private as well as public land. This program has documented its 
ability to effect significant changes in knowledge and attitudes of the local 
people. Furthermore, it has succeeded in making the golden lion tamarin a symbol 
for forest conservation throughout Brazil.
<p>
<li><i>Development and refinement of techniques for conservation of a viable population 
of golden lion tamarins</i>, including reintroduction of zoo-born family groups and 
translocation of wild tamarins into protected habitat. Worldwide, over 100 zoos 
participate in an international cooperative program for captive breeding of 
golden lion tamarins. The project, using techniques it developed, is reintroducing 
zoo-born family groups to their native forest habitat in Rio, thereby increasing 
the population size and genetic health of golden lion tamarins in the wild, as 
well as involving local landowners in guaranteeing the protection of the remaining 
forest on their land. Since 1984, 141 captive-born golden lion tamarins have been 
released into the wild. As a consequence of this reintroduction, approximately 
125 survive in the wild, including 25 captive-born reintroductees and about 100 
of their wild-born offspring, thus increasing the population by approximately 
23% to 575.
<p>
<li><i>Training</i> of a significant number of young Brazilian professional 
conservationists and technicians to carry on and expand conservation efforts 
in this and other areas. Several field courses are offered each year.
<p>
<li><i>Extension</i>. The <i>gltcp</i> serves as a model for conservation and research 
activities with the other three species of lion tamarins in Brazils Atlantic 
Forest. As is the case for <i>glt</i>s, the other species are highly endangered and 
found only in small forested areas surrounded by cattle pasture. Conservation 
theory and methods developed during a decade of work on <i>glt</i>s is now being 
extended to include caissara and black lion tamarins in S&#227o Paulo State and 
golden-headed lion tamarins in Bahia State.

<title>Institute for Sustainable Development - Ilha Grande Bay</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<img align=middle src=isdlogo.gif alt="Institute for Sustainable Development Logo"><br>
</center>
<p>
Ilha Grande Bay sits in the southern part of the State of Rio de 
Janeiro in Brazil and appears to be a tropical paradise. With the 
clear blue waters of the Costa Verde surrounding 365 islands it 
should be a vacation wonderland. Its ecosystem of diverse life 
forms in lagoons, salt marshes, mangroves and forests make it an 
outstanding natural laboratory.
<p>
But this paradise is being threatened. The Bay is suffering from 
over-fishing, oil spills, sewage, unregulated dumping of trash, 
deforestation and the disorganized expansion of coastal cities 
without the slightest urban or ecological planning. For example, 
the sewage from Angra dos Reis, the largest city on the Costa Verde, 
is discharged directly into the waters of the Bay, without treatment. 
On the weekends the scene is chaotic with thousands of power boats 
speeding to deserted beaches often leaving trash and waste in their 
wake. Near the beaches, jet-skis roar through fish spawning grounds.
The Bay suffers from unrestricted over fishing year round. Large 
commercial fishing boats use drag nets, keeping the large fish and 
returning the smaller ones to the sea, dead. As a result the local 
fishermen and their families, the twenty thousand people that depend 
on the waters of the Bay to survive, have little hope of sustaining 
their livelihood. For example, the sardine catch that in 1985 averaged 
240,000 fish, is currently just 20,000.
<p>
<img align=right src=bay.gif alt="Picture of Ilha Grande Bay">
It was concern about the future of Ilha Grande Bay and the 
possibilities of reintroducing life to this marine ecosystem, 
preserving the environment and repopulating the water with select 
marine species, that led to the foundation of the Institute of 
Sustainable Development of Ilha Grande Bay in 1991. <i>IED-BIG</i>, with a 
center on the island of Jipoia and a laboratory facility in Angra 
dos Reis, is a non-profit public association with educational, 
scientific, and cultural goals. <i>IED-BIG</i> is supported by local citizens 
and industry, with Petrobras (Brazilian oil company) and Furnas
(Brazilian atomic energy company), Brazilian Universities and the 
University of Maryland (usa) as major participants.
<p>
Projects conducted under the auspices of <i>IED-BIG</i> will be many and 
varied. They will span the gamut from environmental educational 
efforts with school children to environmental research on the ecology 
of the Bay, the rivers that flow into it and the surrounding forests. 
Indeed, the ecology of one of the rivers in question is the subject 
of an ongoing research project being conducted by the University of 
Maryland faculty.
<p>
Perhaps the most important project underway at <i>IED-BIG</i> is related to 
sustainable development for local residents of the Bay of Ilha Grande. 
The concept is simple. The greatest threat to Ilha Grande Bay is 
uncontrolled development and the greatest impediment to uncontrolled 
development is economic stability for the local population. If local, 
environmentally friendly industry exists for the local population, 
there will be resistance to outside developmental pressures. The 
objectives are to protect and study the ecosystem of the Bay of Ilha 
Grande, promote the socio-economic recovery of local fishing by the 
inhabitants of the region and improve the quality of life of the 
inhabitants with the participation of universities, industry, 
government and the community.
<p>
One of the critical facilities to achieving the goal of this 
project is a research lab in Angra dos Reis. Constructed by 
Petrobras, the lab provides housing facilities to visiting scientists 
working on collaborative projects in larval culture and oceanographic 
research. <img align=left src=oysters.gif alt="Picture of Oyster Aquaculture and Facilities Construction">
A hatchery on the island of Jipoia provides oyster and 
scallop spat for research projects on improving hatchery yields and 
studies to select species that are most adaptable to the conditions 
found in this region. These research projects will foster the 
development of marine aquaculture suitable to the local environment, 
and industry that has already proven to be highly successful in many 
parts of the world. At present there are a number of small aquaculture 
projects in the Bay that, with the support of the Institute, are 
developing into successful enterprises.
In brief, the waters of the Bay can return and again support the 
fishermen and provide them a guaranteed living. However it will only 
happen if there is a seamless web of research, development and 
education, a mechanism which turns basic research into an economically 
viable business opportunity for local inhabitants and an educational
program that maintains and protects this fragile ecosystem while 
providing the expertise needed by the developing environmentally 
friendly industries.

The Tropical Ecosystem Program (<i>TEP</i>) is a joint venture of 
Universidade Federal Fluminense, Universidade Estadual do 
Rio de Janeiro , Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro, 
Universidade de S&#227o Paulo and the University of Maryland. The 
purpose of the <i>TEP</i> is to promote research and education initiatives 
involving tropical rain forests. The program, through Universidade 
Federal Fluminense, provides scientists and students access to a 
research station located at Oriximina, a village in the heart of 
undisturbed Amazon jungle. Indeed, groups of UMCP faculty and 
students (graduate and undergraduate) have traveled to Oriximina 
in each of the last three summers to conduct ecological research 
projects and to learn about this sensitive ecosystem. Students 
from Brazil have also traveled to Maryland to study ecosystems 
such as the Chesapeake Bay.
<p>
<img align=right src=deer.gif alt="Picture of person holding deer">
Critical to the preservation of the biodiversity in the Amazon 
and other tropical rain forests, is an understanding of the value 
of this resource to the world community and a parallel understanding 
of the needs of the inhabitants. Only when we have developed 
strategies that will allow the use of the rain forests in a 
sustainable manner, strategies that allow the inhabitants to 
derive a living from their environment without damaging it, will 
the threat to this resource be diminished. It is the mission of the 
<i>TEP</i> to increase understanding and develop the necessary strategies 
to accomplish these goals.

<title>Vera Cruz Southern Bahia Biodiversity Project</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<img align=middle src=bahialogo.gif alt="Vera Cruz Southern Bahia Biodiversity Project Logo"><br>
</center>
<p>
The Vera Cruz Florestal project is located in Southern Bahia near the 
coastal city of Porto Seguro, site of the first permanent settlement in 
Brazil. This area of Bahia was once almost totally covered by Atlantic 
Rain Forest. Unrestricted cutting of the forest and conversion to low 
quality pasture land has led to a situation where less than 5% of the 
original forest remains. The change from 1946 to 1990 is dramatically 
illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. The local farmers now earn subsistence 
level income.
<p>
This area of Bahia is a classic case for a sustainable development 
initiative, an area in need of a model industry that will provide 
livelihood for the local inhabitants while preserving the environment, 
particularly the remaining patches of Atlantic Rain Forest.
<p>
For several years, the Vera Cruz Forestry Company has been working on 
just such a project; the development of a sustainable pulp industry. This 
region of Bahia is ideally suited to such a project. The topography 
consists of plateaus, now used as pasture land, interspersed with steep 
valleys that provide excellent drainage. The area has a rather even 
distribution of rainfall throughout the year and has high light flux 
necessary for photosynthesis. It is an ideal area for growing eucalyptus, 
a tree that can be harvested in 6 to 7 years as opposed to the 25 to 70 
years needed for typical species used in North America for pulp. Indeed, 
eucalyptus is almost 5 times as efficient as southern pine in fixing CO<sub>2</sub>, 
a significant environmental benefit.
<p>
<center>
<img src=forestcover.gif alt="Pictures showing forest coverage in 1946 and 1990">
</center>
<p>
Vera Cruz presently has 40,000 acres planted in fast growing hybrid 
eucalyptus (Figure 3) and will eventually expand to 200,000 acres. Plans 
are underway for a pulp mill with construction to start in three years. 
The mill is being designed to be environmentally neutral, with the best 
new technology (scrubbers, electrostatic precipitators, non-chlorine 
bleaching techniques, etc.) incorporated. With construction years away, 
$1,000,000 has already been spent on environmental impact studies.
<p>
As part of their land acquisition, Vera Cruz has obtained a large tract 
of original Atlantic Rain Forest, which is contiguous with a smaller 
federal reserve. Together they constitute a 13,000 acre tract which will 
be maintained as a preserve, one of the largest in Brazils Atlantic 
forest. Vera Cruz is also committed to conserving the valleys, unsuitable 
for tree farming, that have not been clear cut and still contain original 
rain forest and to reforest those valleys that have been clear cut.
<p>
This project has many positive aspects. It will provide employment 
for 10,000 people using a renewable resource, trees. At the same time, 
it will attempt to conserve and, indeed, expand a segment of the Atlantic 
Rain Forest, one of our most sensitive ecosystems.
<p>
University of Maryland scientists are involved in many aspects of this 
project (Figure 4). There are several interesting questions that fascinate 
the ecological community that can be addressed here. One of these concerns 
the minimum size patch that will support the same biodiversity as that of 
a large area. The second is whether an ecosystem that has been severely 
damaged or destroyed can be regenerated. In Bahia we have an excellent 
opportunity to address these questions since the ongoing inventory of 
the 13,000 acre patch gives us a reliable reference with which to compare 
smaller patches. One project involves developing an inventory of a small 
patch ecosystem (one or more of the uncut valleys) to assess whether it 
has the same level of biodiversity as the reference patch. Concurrently, 
we would look at similar patches that have been damaged to monitor their 
ability to regenerate.
<p>
As a result of these studies we hope to develop reliable information 
that will allow us to predict reasonable sizes for tropical forests 
that will result in the maintenance of the existing biodiversity while 
surrounding areas support sustainable development initiatives.

<title>Sustainable Development and Conservation Biology at Univ. of Maryland</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<img align=middle src=conslogo.gif alt="Graduate Training in Sustainable Development and Conservation Biology at Univ. of Maryland Logo"><br>
</center>
<p>
Conservation biology is a relatively new field of science 
which has quickly become a crisis discipline. The rapid 
growth of the human population, the destruction and fragmentation 
of natural ecosystems and the resulting threat to countless 
species of plants and animals have all created a tremendous 
need for information so that accurate assessments can take 
place regarding appropriate use of the Earths remaining 
biodiversity. The potential adverse consequences of these 
losses for human welfare are numerous, and are only slowly 
becoming appreciated. There is now a pressing need for 
fundamental changes in the roles that scientists play in 
helping understand and address these global problems.
<p>
Recognizing that solutions to these complex problems requires 
multidisciplinary training, The University of Maryland at 
College Park created a new graduate program in Sustainable 
Development and Conservation Biology (<i>CONS</i>). This program, 
initiated in 1991, currently has 30 graduate students from 
the United States and 7 from other countries. Students in 
the cons program take core courses in conservation biology, 
resource economics, public policy and multidisciplinary 
problem-solving, as well as electives from a wide array of 
disciplines. Students also fulfill an internship requirement 
in one of the Washingtons many conservation or development 
agencies and write a thesis based on science and economics 
and that results in policy recommendations.
<p>
<img align=right src=Monk.gif alt="Sketch of Monkeys">
In addition, the Department of Zoology has graduate students 
working in conservation biology with adjunct faculty members 
from the National Zoological Park, the Smithsonian Institutions 
Front Royal Conservation Research Center, the U.S. Museum of 
Natural History and the National Institutes of Health.
<p>
Thus, the University of Maryland has all the components 
necessary to provide training for graduate students in 
sustainable development and conservation biology: modern 
and diverse facilities located near Washington, D.C., relevant 
conservation and zoology courses, related graduate programs, 
as well as an internationally respected research and teaching 
faculty.

<H4>Evaluation of American Oyster Stocks for Resource Rehabilitation:  Disease Resistance and Genetics.<P>
</H4>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Right SRC="Images/dbltrayLG.jpg" WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=216>

This project seeks to identify potentially useful differences in disease
tolerance among various populations of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica,
found along the Atlantic and Gulf coast of North America.  It is being conducted
in collaboration with <A HREF="http://www.udel.edu/connie/gaffney"> Pat Gaffney</A> at the <A HREF="www.udel.edu/cms">University of Delaware</A> and  <A HREF="mailto:meritt@hpel.umd.edu">Don Meritt</A> at
the  <A HREF="http://www.cees.edu/hpel">University of Maryland Horn Point Laboratory</A>.   In 1995 we collected
broodstocks from various regions along the Atlantic and Gulf coast. In his
hatchery at Horn Point Don Meritt produced 9 populations of oysters representing
the various regions of broodstock origin including Texas and Louisiana
populations, North and South Carolina populations, Chesapeake Bay and Delaware
Bay populations.  Pat Gaffney will be performing genetic analyses on the groups
and we have deployed representative populations in low, moderate and high
salinity field sites in Chesapeake Bay.  It is our intention to determine whether
or not the oysters derived from more southern, disease-prone populations will
exhibit more tolerance to <I>Perkinsus marinus</I> infections compared to their
counterparts derived from more northern broodstocks.  Identifying differences
between groups may lead to productive breeding programs which will develop an
oyster more tolerant of <I>P. marinus</I> infection.

</H4>

<BR>


<IMG ALIGN=Right SRC="Images/aquarium_spat.jpg" WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=216>	The
Maryland Oyster Roundtable Action Plan called for the construction of
experimental oyster bars to test the feasibility of using hatchery reared seed to
'reconstruct' oyster bars which have been over-exploited or ravaged by disease
and are currently devoid of oysters.  In 1995, 5 acres of a natural oyster bar,
built up with dredged shell, was planted with approximately 2.5 million oyster
spat produced by <A HREF="mailto:meritt@hpel.umd.edu">Don Meritt</A>Don Meritt in the  <A HREF="http://www.cees.edu/hpel">Horn Point Environmental Laboratory</A> oyster
hatchery.  Using SCUBA, divers from our lab have been surveying and sampling the
planted seed to determine rates of growth, mortality and disease acquisition.  In
addition, we have deployed instruments for continuous monitoring of
benthic water quality including dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and salinity. 
From this project, we hope to better understand how water quality in the benthic
habitat affects disease acquisition and progression in oysters.  The project will
continue through at least 1997 to determine whether or not hatchery reared seed
represents a valuable asset to the oyster industry in the Chesapeake Bay region. 

Participation in this project will allow us to better understand how environmental conditions in the benthic habitat affect the physiology of the oyster.  As these oysters grow, we will begin sampling hemolymph from them to determine how blood chemistries like pH, calcium levels and related factors vary with the changing environment.  In addition, as they become infected with <I>Perkinsus marinus</I> (which is highly likely) we will continue to monitor blood chemistries to learn more about the physiological affects of the parasite on the oyster.

<IMG ALIGN=Right SRC="Images/oys2small.jpg" WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=216><P>As it's title
suggests, this project establishes a regional, cooperative selective oyster
breeding effort which hopes to produce oysters that are resistant or tolerant to
both <I>Haplosporidium nelsoni</I> (MSX) and <I>Perkinsus marinus</I> (Dermo).  Scientists from
New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia are working together to expose large
groups of oysters to these disease in the field (Maryland and Virginia portions of Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay).  Survivors of the field
exposures will be sent back to the <A HREF="www.rutgers.edu">Rutgers</A> oyster hatchery to be used for the
production of additional, hopefully more tolerant lines. <P>

Although several avenues of investigation are underway, the most active are the
purification and characterization of myeloperoxidase from the hemocytes of the
Eastern oyster,<I> Crassostrea virginica</I>.  Jennifer Wojcik, a senior majoring in
Zoology, is conducting this work.  Myeloperoxidase is an important enzyme
activated when an oyster blood cell engulfs a foreign body like a protozoan
parasite.  Myeloperoxidase produces hypochlorous acid which is extremely toxic to
most cells.<P>

<P>
<P>

In closely related work, we are using pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes to elucidate
the changes in the phagosome environment after a cell is engulfed.  In vertebrate
white blood cells (the equivalent of oyster blood cells) the pH of the phagosome
lumen is acidified very quickly to activate a number of enzymes including
myeloperoxidase.  The oyster blood cells shown here appear to have brightly
fluorescent areas within them suggesting that the phagosomes have become
acidified.  We are characterizing the typical response of molluscan cells so we can learn more about their response to parasites like <I>Perkinsus</I> which appear to alter the hemocytic response in some way so as to neutralize its cytotoxicity.<P>

<H4>Osmotic tolerance of Perkinsus marinus, the protozoan which causes Dermo
disease in eastern oysters.</H4><P>

<BR>

<IMG ALIGN=Right SRC="Images/Amy2LG.jpg" WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=216><I> Perkinsus
marinus</I> is a parasitic protozoan that infects eastern oysters eventually leading
to the oyster's death; the common name of this disease is Dermo.  Although
historically Dermo has been restricted to salinities above 15 to 20 parts per
thousand (ppt), over the last decade the disease has been detected in all
Maryland oyster bars including those at very low salinities.  Infections in
oysters living in low salinities appear to be less virulent and a higher
percentage of infected oysters reach market size before succumbing to the
disease.  However, the appearance and persistence of <I>P. marinus</I> in low salinity
regions suggests that the protozoan has the ability to tolerate low osmotic
pressure much better than<I> Haplsporidium nelsoni</I>, the parasitic protozoan that
causes MSX disease. <I> H. nelsoni</I> is not detected in oysters below 10 ppt and
infected oysters can apparently be cured of the disease by moving them into low
salinity waters.  Iinfections of <I>P. marinus</I> persist after their hosts are moived
into low salinities.<P>

<BR>


Some protozoans can tolerate changes in osmotic pressure by regulating their cell
volume.  Recent work in collaboration with <A HREF="http://www.vims.edu/fish/faculty/burreson_em">Gene Burreson's</A> 
lab at <A HREF="http://www.vims.edu">VIMS</A> has shown that <I>P.marinus</I> swells rapidly after transfer to
low osmotic medium but its cell volume quickly returns to near normal
after a few minutes.  This indicates that the protozoan possesses an effective
cell volume regulation system.  We are currently trying to characterize the
volume regulatory system in <I>Perkinsus</I> by quantifying changes in intracellular
osmolytes during osmotic stress.

<H4>Republication of The Oyster by William Keith Brooks, Professor Emeritus,
Johns Hopkins University.</H4><P>

<BR>


First in 1891, and with a second edition in 1905, William Keith Brooks lamented
the decline of the oyster population in the Maryland portion of Chesapeake
Bay:<P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>	'We have wasted our inheritance by improvidence and mismanagement
and blind confidence; but even if our beds had held their own and were to-day as
valuable as they were fifty years ago, this would be no just ground for
satisfaction, in this age of progress, to a generation which has seen all our
other resources developed and improved.'<P> </BLOCKQUOTE>


<IMG ALIGN=Right SRC="Images/frontcover.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=257>	<I>The
Oyster</I> is a popular  summary of a scientific study; a commentary on the
management of a valuable resource - the eastern oyster.  In 1882, Brooks was
appointed 'Oyster Commissioner' by the Governor of Maryland to 'examine the
oyster beds, and to advise as to their protection and improvement.'  Having
advised the Governor and the legislature that rampant overharvesting was
occurring and the immediate need for protective measures, he was disappointed to
see essentially nothing done to protect the oyster.  He wrote <I>The Oyster</I>
to better inform the layman about the animal itself and to press for better more
intelligent management of the resource.  Amazingly, many of his words and
recommendations are still relevant today.<P>



I have written an introduction to Brooks book which I hope will put his work into
the perspective of the present and allow the reader to understand just how
valuable his words were 100 years ago, and how valuable his advice remains
today.  The book is now available at most bookstores as part of the JHU Press Maryland Paperback Bookshelf.  Retail price:  $15.00.<P>

<B>Research Summary</B><BR>
<BR>


	Estuarine animals possess a unique set of cellular mechanisms which allow them to survive in the everchanging conditions typical of an estuary.  Research in my lab is focused on the comparative biochemistry and physiology of estuarine animals especially bivalves.  My students and I are conducting a wide range of laboratory and field experiments in order to learn more about bivalve growth, how bivalves respond to environmental challenges, and how external factors such as diseases affect the bivalves ability to cope with environmental stress.  Since bivalve ecophysiology is so complex, we have employed a scientifically broad, interdisciplinary approach including genetics, physiology, biochemistry, endocrinology, and pathology.  This has led to productive collaborative efforts between my laboratory and several other labs in the Middle Atlantic region.   This approach allows us to learn more about the complex relationship between both physiological acclimation at the whole organism level and molecular responses at the cellular level to environmental stresses characteristic of the estuary.<BR>

<h1>AREAS OF SPECIALIZATION</h1></a>
To provide maximum flexibility, each student will design his or her curriculum in consultation with a Research Advisory Committee, subject to approval by the appropriate AOS Committee. A student's Advisor and Research Advisory Committee would, by petition to the AOS Committee, be able to substitute other courses for specific core requirements.
Applicants without the prerequisite course work may be provisionally admitted, based on overall academic record and related practical experience. Unless granted an extension by the appropriate AOS committee, such students will be expected to successfully complete these courses during their first year of study.

<a name="oceanography"><h1>OCEANOGRAPHY</a></h1>
In the past decade, the University of Maryland System has emerged as a nationally and internationally recognized center for oceanographic research. The Horn Point Environmental Laboratory (HPEL) and the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL) of the Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies (CEES), and the Meteorology Department at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) are most active in this field, with the research of at least 25 faculty focusing on oceanography.
<p>
The current expertise in oceanography in the University of Maryland System lies in the sub-fields of <a href="#biological">Biological</a> and <a href="#physical">Physical</a> Oceanography. The expertise in biological oceanography includes water column nutrient cycling and trophic dynamics (comprising the entire pelagic food web and fishes), benthic ecology, and theoretical ecosystem analysis. The expertise in physical oceanography at HPEL is in estuarine and coastal circulation, transport, and modeling.
<p>
The expertise in physical oceanography at the Department of Meteorology at UMCP is in large scale flows and global circulation problems.Physical and biological oceanographers work closely together to understand the dynamics of estuarine, coastal, and ocean systems. It should be noted that there is also considerable strength in marine chemistry in the University of Maryland System; some courses are available in the MEES Oceanography AOS, but the Environmental Chemistry AOS currently has a more diverse listing and greater program strength in this area.
<p>
Students in this AOS have access to extensive oceanographic facilities throughout the UM System as well as the opportunity to work with some of the University's outstanding faculty in oceanography. Fundamental courses in the four major subfields of oceanography are required to provide interdisciplinary breadth, but a degree in the Oceanography AOS emphasizes the student's independent research. Students graduating from the Oceanography AOS can expect to find jobs in universities, oceanographic laboratories, government agencies, and consulting firms.

<a name="environmental_mole"><h1>ENVIRONMENTAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY/BIOTECHNOLOGY</a></h1>
Molecular approaches pervade every biological discipline,  and each MEES campus boasts distinguished, energetic faculty that emphasize molecular mechanisms of ecological interactions and dynamics. Expertise includes molecular endocrinology of fish growth, development and reproduction; methods of drug delivery; environmental stressors contributing to fish physiological dysfunction and oncogenesis; mechanisms and stressors of nitrogen fixation; molecular models of marine surface colonization; molecular cues of organism-organism interaction; and invertebrate immunity. Faculty in this area frequently study macromolecular-environmental interactions using recombinant DNA and hybridoma approaches. The Environmental Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Area of Specialization encourages interaction between campuses and is synergistic with other AOSs.
<p>  
Several campuses in the University of Maryland System have facilities specializing in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. The Center of Marine Biotechnology (COMB) of the University's Maryland Biotechnology Institute (MBI) has a newly built state-of-the-art facilities in the new Christopher Columbus Center on Baltimore's Inner Harbor. The University of Maryland's campuses at Baltimore and Baltimore County have eminent scientists in cellular and molecular biology, many with interests in the environmental sciences.

Ecology is a broad discipline encompassing both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Specific areas of study include behavioral,  community, evolutionary, marine, benthic, limnological, systematic, and physiological ecology. Variations and/or combinations of one or more of these subdisciplines are common (e.g., marine benthic community ecology as one area of study or the evolution of terrestrial communities as another). Students successfully completing this Area of Specialization could go on to academic appointments in a variety of departments (e.g., Environmental Sciences, Ecology, Biology, Zoology, Botany, etc.), or work for environmental consulting companies, as well as federal or state government agencies.
<p>   
Due to the nature of the MEES Program, heavy emphasis is placed on the student's unique research goals in this AOS. As such, core course requirements are kept to a minimum. The remainder of a student's course load is determined by that student and his or her Research Advisory Committee on the basis of the individual's research topic and previous academic experience. The University of Maryland System has a wide and diverse set of course offerings in ecology and related areas, so it should be possible for students in almost any area of ecology to create a beneficial program of study.
<p>   
The MEES Program ecology faculty believe graduate students should be well trained in the following five important areas:  1) scientific method and experimental design, 2) statistical methods and use of computers for statistics, database manipulation, and modeling, 3) ecological theory and mathematical modeling, 4) field techniques in ecology, and 5) scientific writing.
<p>

<p>   
<a name="environmental_chem"><h1>ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY</h1></a>
The objective of the Environmental Chemistry Area of Specialization (AOS) is to train research scientists to apply basic chemical principles to the study of the environmental behaviors of natural and anthropogenic chemicals. Environmental chemistry includes interdisciplinary studies of various realms such as geochemistry, transport processes, and toxicology to determine the fate and effects of chemicals in the natural environment. The Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL) in Solomons, Maryland has just built a new biochemistry research building, an ideal location for studying marine and estuarine environmental toxicology.
<p>   
As both the Masters and Ph.D. are research-oriented programs, emphasis is placed on learning and applying the scientific method, understanding statistical techniques, and developing effective scientific writing skills. Students graduating from MEES through this AOS will find professional positions in Federal, state, and local government agencies (such as EPA, FDA, NIH), private chemical and manufacturing industries, academic institutions, and consulting firms.

<p>
<a name="fisheries"><h1>FISHERIES SCIENCE</a></h1>
Fisheries Science is multidisciplinary, drawing expertise from the biological, physical, and social sciences. Fisheries scientists study populations and communities of aquatic resources, their responses to exploitation, and changes in environmental conditions, and their management. Research is quantitative and may be either basic or applied. A diversity of faculty talent exists within the University of Maryland System to provide graduate students with a strong education in ecology, biology, and management of fish and invertebrate resources.
<p>   
The multidisciplinary nature of fisheries science requires broad training in areas that may include <a href="#fish_ecology">ecology,</a> oceanography,</a><a href="#aqua"> aquaculture,</a> economics, mathematics, seafood technology, pathology and diseases, and <a href="#management">management science.</a> Students will select a curriculum, with assistance from their Research Advisory committees, to best achieve their academic and professional goals. The faculty recognizes that flexible, yet rigorous, curriculum choices are important for students in fisheries science.
<p>   
The program in fisheries offers both M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. Graduates at either level may expect to find challenging career opportunities. Most career opportunities in fisheries science are in the government and academic sectors, although in recent years private businesses, research firms and aquaculture businesses offer increasingly diverse career choices.
<p>
<h1>Subprograms</h1>
Three subprograms are available, which emphasize faculty expertise in fisheries within the University of Maryland System. Students may explicitly designate a subprogram in their course of study or may choose, with approval of the AOS, to design a more general curriculum in the area of fisheries science
<p>
<a name="fish_ecology"><h2>1.Fisheries Ecology</h2></a>
Basic studies in fish and invertebrate population biology, food webs, recruitment processes, predator-prey and competitive interactions, diseases, and effects of habitat conditions. Students in this subprogram will undertake a course of study that emphasizes interactions with related sciences such as oceanography, limnology, zoology, or other natural sciences related to the student's interests.
<p>   
<a name="management"><h2>2. Fisheries Management</h2></a>
Basic and applied studies on the effects of exploitation on fish and invertebrate populations. Assessment of resources and their potential yields. Development of models and information useful for management of living aquatic resources. Students in this subprogram will undertake a course of study that emphasizes population biology, economics of natural resources management and management science. Students with outstanding credentials in economics, mathematics, or operations research should contact one of the Fisheries AOS cochairs regarding the possibility of waiving certain pre-requisites.
   
<a name="aqua"><h2>3. Aquaculture</h2></a>
Research on the culture of aquatic organisms and the development of aquaculture systems. A broad disciplinary area that includes ecology, physiology, chemistry, genetics, seafood technology, diseases and pathology, engineering, economics and management under its auspices. Students in this subprogram will develop a course of study that emphasizes their particular interests in the aquaculture field.
<p>   
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
A Bachelor's degree in the natural sciences or other field with a strong quantitative emphasis, including
<ol>   
<li>Two semesters of Calculus
<li>Two semesters of Introductory Chemistry
<li>Two semesters of Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, or Physics
<li>Two semesters of Introductory Biology (or high placement test, high GRE Biology scores)
<li>Advanced Biology courses, such as Ecology and Ichthyology, are recommended
</ol>   
<h3>Core Courses and Other Requirements</h3>
(M.S. and Ph.D.):<br>
<p>
Five core courses will be offered and at least three must be successfully completed by all students entering the Fisheries Science AOS. The requirements may be waived if equivalent course work has been obtained elsewhere, or if the student and his or her Research Advisory committee successfully petition the AOS Committee.
<p>   
1. <b>Fisheries Science and Management</b> - covers the basic principles of aquatic productivity, fish/invertebrate population biology, harvest and conservation of resources, assessing yield potentials, and fishery management practices.
<br>
2. <b>Fisheries Ecology</b> - covers the biological processes that affect productivity, abundances, and distributions of fish and invertebrate resources. Includes life history theory, predator-prey relationships, bioenergetics, trophic ecology, and zoogeography.
<br>   
3. <b>Aquaculture</b> - covers the theory and practices of modern aquaculture of fishes and invertebrates. Includes coverage on water quality, production systems, extensive and intensive approaches, culture genetics, fish diseases, and management.
<br>   
4. <b>Economics of Fisheries Production</b> - covers the basic principles of production economics, and bioeconomic modeling, including consideration of both wild and cultured stocks. Emphasis is on the role of economic motivation in fisheries management and on the economic effects of typical management strategies.
<br>   
5. <b>Graduate Level Course in Oceanography</b> (physical, chemical or biological) <b>or Limnology</b> - covers major and minor elements, composition of seawater, seawater ionic structure and interactions, nutrient distributions, biogeochemical cycles, and the biology of marine organisms.
<blocquote>   
Students will obtain most of their academic course work from a broad array of relevant courses presently available throughout the University of Maryland System. Each student and his or her Research Advisory Committee will design a course of study to be approved by the Fisheries AOS. Curricular requirements are purposefully flexible, yet rigorous, to accommodate the diverse needs of students in fisheries science.
In addition, the following core courses are required:</blockquote>
<ol start=6>   
<li>A 400 or 600 level course from one of the other MEES AOSs (from an approved list, which can include items 2, 4, and 5)
<li>One course or seminar in Environmental Management (item 1 or 4 satisfies this requirement; any such 3-4-credit course can satisfy item 6)
<li>A course in Statistics/Biostatistics (600 level for the Ph.D., 400 level for the M.S.)
<li>Courses in Experimental Design and Analysis and in Scientific Writing are strongly recommended
<li>One graduate level seminar for each year in residence (on average).
</ol>   
<p>
<a name="environmental_science"><h1>ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE</a></h1>
This Area of Specialization provides broad training in the environmental sciences. It is clear that some students do not want to specialize to the extent the other Areas of Specialization require, but would like to gain experience and take courses in a variety of scientific, economic, and social disciplines related to the natural environment. These requirements are also very appropriate for students wishing to specialize in environmental management.
<p>   
The relevant graduate training will provide advanced courses in five distribution areas:
<p>
1. <b>Biology</b> - Courses in the biological sciences in which the emphasis is on ecology, especially at the population, community, and ecosystem levels.
<br>   
2. <b>Chemistry</b> - Courses in chemistry as applied to organisms or to the environment, with an emphasis on pollution/environmental toxicology courses.
<br>   
3. <b>Physical Sciences and Technology</b> - Courses dealing with the physical world or with the application of physical principles or technology to biological or environmental problems.
<br>   
4. <b>Management, Economics, and Policy</b> - Courses dealing with the interaction of economic, legal, political, and/or social institutions with the biological, chemical, or physical environment.
<br>   
5. <b>Statistics</b> - Courses with strong emphasis on problem solving, prediction, or modeling.
<p>   
<h2>Subprogram in Environmental Management: Science and Policy</h2>
The primary content of this option within the Environmental Science AOS will focus on developing professionals in the field of environmental management, at the M.S. and Ph.D. levels. Students successfully completing this degree will normally pursue careers in the government or private industry, especially with organizations having strong environmental interests or programs. It is also anticipated that students desiring to work in foreign countries, and foreign students, will take part in this program.
<p>      
Although the Environmental Management option will be open to students at the Master's level, students completing advanced degrees in Applied Ecology and Conservation Biology (M.S.Frostburg State University) or Sustainable Development and Conservation Biology (M.S.UMCP) as well as other graduate environmental management programs within or outside of the University of Maryland System could logically pursue a Ph.D. within this AOS. It is also expected that students with strong interests in restoration/landscape ecology or in environmental science and policy would matriculate within the Environmental Science AOS with an emphasis in environmental management.
<p>   
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
An undergraduate degree in the natural sciences or engineering
<ol>
<li>Two semesters of Calculus
<li>Two semesters of Introductory Chemistry
<li>Two semesters of Physics
<li>Two semesters of Introductory Biology (or high placement test, high GRE Biology scores)
<li>An Ecology course and other advanced Environmental Science courses are recommended
</ol>   
<h3>Core Courses and Other Requirements</h3>
(M.S. and Ph.D.):
<p>

<h1><b><i>MASTER OF SCIENCE REQUIREMENTS</i></b><p></h1>
The specific requirements for the M.S. degree in MEES are as follows:
<p>
1. <b>Course Work</b>
<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>A minimum of 30 credits with 24 credits of course work and 6 credits of graduate research. Of the 24 course credits, 12 of them must be at the 600 level or higher. Exceptions and waivers for equivalent courses taken before entry may be used to meet requirements of the student's AOS upon approval by the appropriate AOS Committee. Although graduate courses taken elsewhere may serve to fulfill requirements, only six credits from such courses may be transferred. Courses used to fulfill requirements for a previously awarded degree cannot be used for transfer credits.
<li>One seminar course (MEES 608 or equivalent) must be taken for each year in residence (on average).
<li>One approved Statistics course (400 level or higher).
<li>One graduate course representing significant interdisciplinary breadth, preferably outside the student's AOS.
<li>One course or seminar in Environmental Management (a 3-4 credit course can satisfy item d).
</ol>
<p>
2. <b>Thesis Defense</b>
<p>
An Oral Defense of the Thesis, administered according to Graduate School regulations will take place at the completion of the research project. This defense will be conducted by the Research Advisory Committee and will be administered once all other degree requirements have been fulfilled. The Thesis Defense will generally last no longer than two hours, but the time will be long enough to ensure an adequate examination. The Research Advisory Committee also approves the thesis, and it is the candidate's obligation to see that each member of the committee has at least two weeks in which to examine a copy of the thesis prior to the time of the defense. The Research Advisory Committee may conclude that the candidate has passed or failed. A student may be conditionally passed with the provision that minor changes in the thesis be made and approved by the Major Advisor. A student who fails mayat the discretion of the committee and with approval of the MEES Director and the appropriate Graduate Schoolbe permitted to stand a second defense after acting on suggestions for improvement of the thesis (collection of more data, use of different statistical analysis, rewriting of the discussion, etc.), at such time as the advisor considers appropriate. Once the thesis has been successfully defended, one copy must be supplied to the MEES Office in addition to the copies required by the Graduate School.
</ol>
</a name="masters">
<p>
<a name="philosophy">  
<h1><b><i>Doctor of Philosophy Requirements</h1></i></b>
The specific requirements for the Ph.D. degree are as follows:
<p>
1. <b>Course Work</b>
<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>The student must complete a minimum of 36 credits, with at least 24 credits of course work and 12 credits of dissertation research. Twelve credits of course work must be at the 600 level or above. 
Credits used to obtain a M.S. degree at U.M. or elsewhere cannot be transferred to the Ph.D. program. However, if a student has completed a M.S. degree, up to 16 credits of appropriate courses can be waived by petition to the AOS committee.
<li>One seminar course (MEES 608 or equivalent) is required for each year in residence (on average).
<li>One approved Statistics course (600 level or higher).
<li>One graduate course representing significant interdisciplinary breadth, preferably outside the student's AOS.
<li>One course or seminar in Environmental Management (a course can satisfy d ).
</ol>
<p> 
2. <b>Examinations</b>
<p>
Formal application for advancement to candidacy for the doctoral degree requires successful completion of both a Comprehensive Examination and an oral Defense of the Dissertation Proposal. The Comprehensive Examination must be passed before the student can defend the Dissertation Proposal.
<p>
<ol type=a>
<li><b>Comprehensive Examination</b><br>
The Research Advisory Committee is responsible for administering the comprehensive examination. Since this examination must be successfully completed before the dissertation proposal can be defended, it is in the student's best interests to take the Comprehensive Examination as early as possible in the Program. The exam must be taken by the end of the student's fifth semester. This examination is intended to determine whether the student demonstrates sufficient evidence of scholastic and intellectual ability in major and related academic areas. The examination will not be a defense of the research proposal. Areas of the examination will be chosen by the student, with approval by their Committee, from a general list formulated by the AOS Committee. One area of the examination must be chosen for interdisciplinary breadth (e.g. relating to the interdisciplinary course from the core curriculum).
The examination will include a combination of written and oral sections. The Research Advisory Committee will determine whether the student passes (a minimum of four affirmative votes is required) or fails. If failed, the examination mayat the recommendation of the Research Advisory Committeebe taken again. In this case, the examination should be repeated within 1 year, but no sooner than 6 months after the initial examination. If the examination is failed a second time, matriculation will be canceled.
The MEES Director's Office must be notified at least 2 weeks in advance of the pending examination. A report of the examination will be filed with the Director's Office following the examination.
<p>
<li><b>Dissertation Proposal Defense</b><br>
The Proposal Defense is an oral examination on the research proposal administered by the Research Advisory Committee. At least 2 weeks prior to the examination, the student must supply the committee members with a formal research proposal in which the following is detailed: background information, research progress to date (if any), specific objectives, and experimental design of the proposed research. The committee is expected to examine the student on all aspects of the proposed research to determine whether the research plan is sound and whether the student has the proper motivation, intellectual capacity and curiosity, and has or can develop the technical skills necessary to successfully pursue the Ph.D. degree. The student passes if there are at least four affirmative votes. If failed, the student must redefend the proposal within 1 year. A second failure will result in cancellation of matriculation.
The research proposal should be defended within 1 year of passing the Comprehensive Examination and at least 1 year before projected completion of the degree requirements. The Director's Office must be notified of the pending examination several weeks prior to its administration and a report of the examination must be filed with the Director's Office following the examination.
At the successful completion of this defense the student officially applies for Advancement to Candidacy for the Ph.D. degree and should submit the necessary forms to the Director of the MEES Program for transmission to the Graduate School. Students must be admitted to candidacy at least six months prior to the Defense of the Dissertation (final defense).
<p>     
Note: Students using vertebrates in field or laboratory research must submit a protocol to the Animal Care and Use Committee of the appropriate campus prior to the initiation of research.
<p>   
<li><b>Dissertation Seminar and Defense of the Dissertation Research</b><br>
A candidate for the Ph.D. degree will present a public seminar on the dissertation research during the academic year in which the degree will be awarded. Students expecting degrees at the end of the summer must be scheduled for presentation before the end of May. The seminar should, under normal circumstances, be given within five weeks in advance of the day of the oral final examination. The student and Advisor will be responsible for initiating arrangements through the MEES Office for the date and advertisement of advertisement of the seminar. The seminar will be open to faculty, students, and other interested parties.
The final oral defense of the dissertation is conducted by a committee of the graduate faculty approved by the Dean for Graduate Studies (the Research Advisory Committee plus a Dean's Representative). Nominations for membership on this committee are submitted on the designated form through the MEES Director by the student's Advisor, by the third week of the semester in which the student expects to complete all requirements, and no later than six weeks, prior to the dissertation defense.
The time and place of the examination are established by the chair of the committee. The student is responsible for distributing a complete, final copy of the dissertation to each member of the committee at least two weeks before the examination date. Announcement of the final examination will be made through the MEES Office to all members of the MEES faculty at least 2 weeks prior to the examination. All final oral examinations are open to all members of the graduate faculty, although only members of the examining committee may question the candidate. After the examination, the committee deliberates and votes in private. Two or more negative votes constitute failure. The student may be examined no more than twice.
Following successful completion of the final examination, a final copy of the dissertation must be supplied to the MEES Office, in addition to those required by the Graduate School.
</ol>
<p>   
<b>Preparation of Theses and Dissertations:</b>
<p>
As outlined in the Program objectives, students in the MEES Program are expected to have research interests which involve interactions between biological systems and physiochemical systems in the marine, estuarine, freshwater, or terrestrial environment. As an aid in focusing a student's program in such interdisciplinary research, the student, in consultation with the advisory committee, will designate an area of research specialization and prepare a thesis or dissertation reporting the results of an original investigation in that area. The thesis or dissertation will be prepared according to the rules of the Graduate School, as set forth in the Thesis and Dissertation Manual on the appropriate campus. The final oral examination for the M.S or Ph.D. degrees will constitute a defense of the thesis or dissertation.

<p>Dr. Stein's research focuses on the mechanisms by which the human pathogen,
<i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>, is able to synthesize and regulate the expression
of one of its major outer membrane antigens, lipooligosaccharide (LOS).
Students use molecular, immunological and biochemical techniques to further
our understanding of the role of LOS in gonococcal disease. Information
gleaned from these studies is directly applicable to understanding pathogenic
mechanisms. </p>

<p>Dr. Trun is a tenure track investigator in the National Cancer Institute
at the <a href="http://www.nih.gov/welcome/">National Institutes of Health
</a>in Bethesda, MD. She also holds an adjunct assistant professorship
at the University of Maryland at College Park. Dr. Trun received her Ph.D.
from Princeton University and was a Jane Coffin Childs Postdoctoral Fellow
at NCI.</p>

<p>Many cellular processes require spatial and temporal coordination of
a complex series of events. One of the most intricate of these is replication
and segregation of daughter chromosomes. Using <i>E. coli </i>as a model
system, we have been focusing on two aspects of chromosome biology: replication
of the chromosome and condensation of the DNA into a functional nucleoid.
Both projects were initiated by isolating cells that are resistant to the
diploidizing agent, camphor. By isolating camphor resistant chromosomal
mutants, we have identified a leading strand helicase that functions to
regulate the number of replication forks that can traverse the chromosome.
By isolating high copy number plasmids that confer camphor resistance,
we have identified a three gene system that functions to condense the chromosome
across actively transcribed genes. </p>

<p><i>nbrA4 </i>is a chromosomal camphor resistant mutant that contains
twice as much DNA as wild type. We have suggested that mbrA may define
a novel coupling between DNA replication and cell elongation that
functions after initiation of replication and serves to keep chromosome
number tied to growth rate. Fine structure mapping and plasmids were used
to show that <i>mbrA</i> is allelic to the previously identified <i>rep</i>
gene which encodes a f' to 3' DNA helicase (leading strand) that is
used for, but not essential for replication of the chromosome. The <i>rep
</i>deletion cannot be maintained in combination with a deletion of another
leading strand helicase, <i>uvrD</i>. Rep and UvrD can interact in vitro
and form an active DNA helicase suggesting that there are several
leading strand helicases that E.coli uses for replication under different
conditions. We are currently investigating if <i>rep</i> and <i>uvrD</i>
are coordinately regulated and under what conditions each is used. </p>

<p>To begin to understand the mechanism of action of camphor and identify
its target, we isolated high copy number plasmids that confer resistance.
One fragment of chromosomal DNA, that maps to 14.2 min., when present in
the plasmid vector, pBR322, gives this phenotype. While the plasmid confers
camphor resistance, we have determined that it does not result in diploidy.
Deletion analysis and sequencing indicates that three genes are responsible
for the phenotype, <i>cspE</i>, a cold shock gene homologue and two other
ORF's (<i>crcA</i> and <i>crcB</i>). All three genes are required in the
correct ratios to confer camphor resistance. These same three genes also
suppress a temperature sensitive defect in the chromosomal partition gene,
<i>mukB</i>.</p>

<p>All of our data on <i>crcA, cspE </i>and <i>crcB</i> led us to suspect
that the genes are affecting chromosome condensation. In a direct test
of this, we have demonstrated that, both in vivo and in vitro, camphor
does indeed cause unfolding of the chromosome and overproduction of the
three genes results in more tightly condensed nucleoids. The original work
of Burgi and Worcell on the nucleoid demonstrated that mRNA is one
of the major components holding the nucleoid together. The recent discovery
that CspE binds to the 5' end of mRNA in an active transcription complex
suggests that this condensing mechanism senses actively transcribed genes
and may condense using the mRNA. Further experiments should shed light
on this intriguing mechanism of chromosome condensation. </p>

     The research activities of Dr. Ades have focused on two areas and deal with the regulatory
processes that govern the development of eukaryotic cells.  One group of studies aims to identify
the
enzymes responsible for modulating porphyrin production and to determine how the enzymes are
regulated.  Research in the second area is examining the signalling cascades triggered by
interleukin 6 in
lymphocytes and in cells of neural origin.

Dr. Chang's research focuses on the mechanisms involved in the perseption and signal
transduction of the
plant hormone ethylene.  The research is based on the ethylene receptor gene, ETR1, which was
cloned from
the plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  ETR1 is a type of receptor not found previously in higher
eukaryotes, and it
is becoming apparent that there are several ETR1-related ethylene receptors in A. Thaliana.  Dr.

     The goal of research in Dr. Woodson's laboratory is to identify interactions that are important
for
forming the tertiary structure of self-splicing intron RNAs.  RNA molecules that have catalytic
activity are
of particular interest because their enzymatic properties suggest that they fold into globular
structures in
the same manner as protein enzymes.  Moreover, it is thought that assembly of large transcripts

requires the assistance of other RNAs or of RNA-binding proteins.  A continuing project uses
self-splicing
of the Tetrahymena intron to study RNA folding both in vitro and in vivo.  A bacterial expression

should facilitate biochemical and genetic approaches to identifying elements important for
accelerating
splicing reactions.  Future projects will also include the use of spectroscopic or other physical
methods for
tracking the folding of smaller RNAs in vitro.

system.  Two distinct classes of molecules, both members of the immunoglobulin supergene
family, are
responsible for antigen recognition.  These are antibodies, which function both as antigen
receptors on  -lymphocytes and as circulating effector molecules, and T-cell receptors, which
occur only in membrane-bound form.  The main interest of Dr. Mariuzza's laboratory is to
investigate the molecular basis of
antigen recognition by these two classes of receptor molecules through a combined protein
engineering, X-ray crystallographic, and physical chemical approach.<p>

Gene regulatory mechanisms in a broader sense constitute the major thrust of the laboratory's
interest.  One project is concerned with mechanisms of plant protection from environmental
stresses.  We have developed a soybean chalcone synthase gene family system consisting of seven
genes, one inducible by broad spectrum light as well as UV - B, another only by UV - B, yet
another by sucrose and two genes in a bidirectional promoter linkage, differing in their light
responsiveness.  The other project is concerned with the roles of unusual structural features within
the body of the genes.  In this category, we have developed two systems, one consisting of four
non-coding exons and the other of an anti-sense transcript region.

Neuroanatomy and neurobiology of avian development.<br>
     The overall goal in Dr. Kuenzel's laboratory is to document functional neuroanatomical
pathways
throughout the avian brain.  Research being conducted involves exploring mechanisms that affect
the
neural regulation of food intake and early onset of gonadal development.  Two examples of
neuromodulators being studied include neuropeptide Y (NPY) and vasoactive intestinal
polypeptide (VIP). 
Immunocytochemistry is first used to map the distribution of perikarya and fibers throughout the
chick
brain.  In situ hybridization is then applied to determine gene expression during specific periods
of
development or experimental manipulation.  Sterotaxy and tract-tracing procedures are utilized to
ascertain
which groups of neurons significantly alter feeding behavior or onset of puberty.

Molecular
genetics of floral induction.<br>
     Among the most important unanswered questions in plant biology is how the transition from
vegetative to reproductive development is mediated.  Dr. Deitzer's laboratory is currently
undertaking a
molecular genetic approach to answer this question.  He has recently obtained a number of single
gene
mutants in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.) and Arabidopsis that have
altered
responses to photoperiod.  Attempts are being made with both the barley and the pea genotypes
to isolate
and clone the genes that encode these proteins.  The ultimate goal is to identify the components
of the
phytochrome mediated transduction chain leading to floral induction and to transgenically alter
photoperiodic response types in a wide variety of plants.

responses.

Research Interests:  Animal Behavior and Chemosensory Communication
<p>
My research currently focuses on two very different topics:  the evolution of play behavior
in juvenile mammals and the role of chemical communication in controlling reproductive 
physiology.
<p>
My current play behavior research involves the playground activities of pre-school children. 
The objective of the study are to examine the predictions of a novel theory of why young 
animals play.  According to self assessment theory, play consists of a series of development
al tests designed by young individuals to assess their developing physical competence.  
Human children provide an excellent model for such a study because play behavior is very 
frequent and occurs in predictable locations (playgrounds) that contain a variety of 
obstacles suitable for testing developmental competence.
<p>
I have also been conducting a long-term investigation of chemical influences on reproduction
in female sable antelope.  This research is a collaborative effort with Dr. Steven Monfort,
Department of Reproductive Physiology, National Zoological Park.  Behavioral evidence 
suggests that flehmen, a conspicuous grimace exhibited after direct oral contact with 
conspecific urine, mediates reproductive synchrony in female sable antelope.  Our goal is to
test the relationship between urine sampling and a female's ability to alter the timing of 
her estrous cycle.  We are using fecal steroid analyses to monitor female reproductive 
physiology non-invasively and have developed methods of experimentally manipulating estrous
cyclicity.  This has allowed us to use an experimental approach to document adjustments in
estrous cycles and to isolate the effects of the social environment on attainment of 
reproductive synchrony.

<h3>POLICIES AND GRADING FOR DR. PAYNE'S AND DR. POLITIS' SECTIONS </h3>
POLICIES, TEXTS, LECTURE TIMES, EXAMS GRADING, HELP AND DISCUSSION SECTIONS
<br>Prerequisites: BIOL 105 & CHEM 103
</center>

<blockquote>
<p>All lectures will be taped and copies will be available for 
student use in the Non Print Media Center, Room 4210, Hornbake Library.  
Request a tape by the course (Zoology 211) and the date of the lecture.  
It usually takes two working days to copy a lecture tape for 
distribution.  History has shown that students relying on lecture tapes do not fare well! 
Use these tapes as a lecture supplement, not as a substitute!<p>
     Lecture notes obtained from note taking services are not produced 
by the course staff, which is hereby absolved from any responsibility for 
their accuracy.  Any error in these notes cannot be used as an argument 
for a grade change on an exam.  Naturally, whether you decide to buy 
these notes or not is totally up to you.<p>

<b>Work Missed Because of Absence:</b><br>
     Absences caused by religious observances or participation in a 
University activity at the request of University authorities may be 
excused if the TA (for laboratory matters only!) or Drs. 
Payne, Politis or Compton are notified of the conflict ahead of time.  Absences 
caused by illness may be excused if a verifiable letter from a physician 
indicating the nature of the illness and the necessity of absence is 
provided.  Refer to the Undergraduate Catalog for a complete description 
of University policy.<p>
     Students who miss a scheduled examination for any of the above 
reasons should request and will be given the opportunity to take a 
make-up examination covering the same material.  You must present a 
valid, documented excuse for missing a scheduled lecture examination.  
After contacting either Drs. Payne, Politis or Compton, presenting 
your documentation, and securing their approval, you should plan on 
taking the make-up examination at the date and  location announced in class.<p>

<b>Optional Discussion Sections:</b><br>
     Several former 211 students have graciously volunteered to 
conduct weekly 50 minute review sessions!  These sessions are OPTIONAL 
and may be taken without risk to your grade if you attend faithfully and 
make some effort to keep up with the material.  Students in these 
sessions will be graded on the basis of 750 total points (vs. 700 points; 
see below).  Simply by attending and participating, you have every chance 
of learning more and improving your grade.
Sign up forms will be available during the week of 3rd. Feb. in the 
teaching laboratory.  You will have a two week period to try out the 
session.  After signing up, you may drop out at any time during these two 
weeks by notifying Dr. Compton in writing.  If you remain in the 
discussion section, you will be graded on the basis of 750 points and 
expected to attend and participate.  Again, the only way to really mess 
this up is by not attending!<p>

<b>Examinations:</b><br>
     Three hourly examinations of 100 points and a final, two hour,
 cumulative, examination worth 200 points.  200 points total from lab work.<p>

<b>Regrade Policy:</b><br>
     You should first discuss your examination with your TA or Dr. Compton.
 This discussion must take place within one week of the return of graded 
examinations.  If your T/A or Dr. Compton deem that a regrade is likely, have them 
attach a note to the exam and then leave the exam and the note in the box 
provided in the laboratory so that Dr. Payne or Dr. Politis can endorse the change 
(or he may not). His judgement is final.<p>
 
<b>Grades:</b>
     Lecture - 71% - 500 points  ;  Laboratory - 29% - 200 points<br>
  <b>Total                700</b><br>
     Grade of<br>
               A = 620 points<br>
               B = 550 points<br>
               C = 480 points<br>
               D = 420 points<p>

     For those in Discussion Sections<br>
     (50 additional possible points = 750 total points)<br>
     Grade of<br>
               A = 665 points<br>
               B = 595 points<br>
               C = 520 points<br>
               D = 450 points

<p>This grading system is hereby agreed to by all course participants.  Thus 
there will be no competition among participants and final course grades 
will not be discussed/negotiated.  You either have the points or you 
don't!<p>

<b>Appointments:</b><br>
     Communication is essential:  we must hear your comments, 
criticisms, questions, etc.  We will make an effort to visit the 
laboratories.  We will try to be available in our offices for a few 
minutes after lecture to answer your questions.  Feel free to chat during 
these times.  Your GTA will also have time to discuss both lecture and laboratory material 
with you.  If the class shows sufficient interest, we are willing to schedule group 
discussions/reviews. <p>

     A listserve (CellNet ) will be set up on the campus e-mail 
network in order that students and course staff can communicate with one 
another.  All you will need to receive these important communications is 
an active e-mail account.  Details about the listserve are attached.  
This is NOT optional.<p>
     Directions for subscribing to cellnet and for retrieving 
information may be found below<p>

<hr width="75%">
<b>Laboratory Attendance:</b><br>
     Please note that one laboratory exercise/demonstration requires 
the use of animals.  We have reduced the number of animals used by 
modifying procedures and introducing computer simulations into the 
laboratory.  However, certain key objectives of the course cannot be 
accomplished without utilizing animal tissues.  We will adhere to Federal 
guidelines and insist upon humane treatment of animals at all times.  If 
you have a problem with this approach for religious, ethical, or personal 
reasons, please see a course coordinator immediately.  This sensitive 
issue must be addressed by all concerned parties.<p>

<b>Laboratory Attendance:</b><br>
     Attendance in the lab is mandatory; absences will be penalized by 
deducting 50% of the points from the laboratory assignment that was 
conducted during the missed lab period and additional points from the 
discretionary GTA-assigned points.  If you miss a lab due to an excused 
absence, you must attend another lab during that same week.  See your TA 
to have your excuse approved and to obtain permission <p>
to attend another laboratory during that same week.  (see procedure for 
attending a different lab section below).  Students who arrive more than 
20 minutes late to lab will not be admitted to lab, their absence counted 
as an unexcused absence, and 20 points deduced accordingly.  Any student 
missing three (3) laboratories will automatically fail the course!<p>


<b>Procedure for Switching Lab Sections:</b>
<p>     A written permission slip must be completed in order to attend a 
lab section other than that for which you are registered as a result of 
an excused absence.  Permission forms are available from Mr. Carpenter. 
Students must provide a valid excuse in order to be 
permitted to attend another lab section.  If you know in advance that you 
have a valid excuse for missing lab and wish to switch to another section 
that week, please notify Mr. Carpenter and your GTA early.
A Final Note:
<p>     The entire staff is dedicated to making this course an enjoyable, 
worthwhile learning experience.  We are very concerned about providing a 
comfortable atmosphere conducive to learning.  We expect you to work 
hard, but we also realize that you will learn best by asking questions.  
You, our audience and consumers, should have input into the course and 
should demand our best efforts.  Don't be intimidated or afraid, we are 
all on your side and stand ready to assist you.  Help us to help you by 
providing questions, criticisms, praise, etc.  Have fun and get your 
money's worth.

<title>CELLNET-ZOOLOGY 211 OnLine</title>

<body bgcolor=ffffff>
<Center>
<h2>CELLNET-ZOOLOGY 211 OnLine</h2>
</Center>

<blockquote>
Your Zoology 211 Course Staff, in the never ending quest for 
ways to enhance quality of life for Zoology 211 students, now 
presents CELLNET, a listserve designed to promote 
communication between students, staff and of course 
Drs. Know-It-All.  The time is NOW to subscribe to CELLNET 
(due to budget cuts, there will be no complimentary gifts for
subscribing).  CELLNET will be used to communicate 
information about the course to subscribers, and will 
provide a way for subscribers to pose questions about 
lectures to Drs. Know-it-All.  Responses to questions 
will be sent to CELLNET, such that all subscribers 
will see the question and receive the answer (who 
could ask for anything more!).  In addition, CELLNET 
will provide a convenient way to post lecture outlines and 
handouts, important information about lab, and other 
announcements of interest.<p>

<b>HOW CAN I BE PART OF THIS ZOOLOGY 211 
INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY?</b><p>

First, you must have a campus computer WAM account.  
If you do not already have a computer alias on campus, 
DO NOT PASS GO!  Students register electronically 
(see How to Register for a WAM Account in a WAM lab).  
Instead, proceed directly to the Computer Science Center, 
Room 3326.  Bring your student ID and current registration 
card with you. An account will be created for you by one 
of the counselors.<p>
If you do not already have a WAM account, there are plenty 
of other great things on the network (other than CELLNET) - 
for example, access to the ZOOL 211 World Wide Web home 
page, library card catalog, the daily news, lists of University 
events, and much more!<p>

<b>DO I HAVE TO HAVE MY OWN COMPUTER IN ORDER 
TO BE PART OF  CELLNET?</b><p>

No.  Any member of the UMD community can get a
campus computer account.  You can go to the computer 
science center WAM lab to log into your account, and 
retrieve your CELLNET messages<p>

<b>SUBSCRIBING TO CELLNET</b><p>
Next, you must SUBSCRIBE to CELLNET.  Subscription 
is done automatically by the listserv computer, and the process 
could not be simpler.<p>

<OL>
 <li>Enter you WAM account
 using you name and password (do not try to subscribe from an 
account other than your own, or all of your CELLNET mail 
will be directed to that account).
 <li>Once into your account, you must send a mail 
message to the University's listserv computer, asking
it to subscribe you to CELLNET.  Your message should be sent to:<p>

listserv@umdd.umd.edu<p>

         Your subscribe message is simply:<p>

<code>sub cellnet your name</code><p>

         Mail this message, and you will automatically be subscribed 
to CELLNET.  "sub" tells the listserv computer that you want to 
subscribe, "cellnet" is the name of the listserv your are subscribing 
to, and your name should follow.  That's it!<p>
</ul>
<b>GETTING OLD MESSAGES FROM CELLNET</b><p>

After subscribing to CELLNET, you will get a welcome message 
that includes some important instructions, e.g., how to retrieve 
previously sent or deleted messages.  DO NOT delete this 
original message!  To get a list of previously sent CELLNET 
messages, send an email to:  listserv@umdd.umd.edu .Do not put 
a subject heading on your memo and do not put any blank lines 
at the top of it.  Your message should read:<p>

<code>index cellnet</code><p> 

You will then receive a listing of these messages.  
Instructions for retrieving them from the list are contained in 
the original messages from listserve.

<P> You will become comfortable with the computer and other equipment and utilize them to explore physiological concepts. Each student will have the time and opportunity to become familiar with the equipment and to accumulate the kind of &quot;hands on&quot; experience with experimental techniques which is necessary to understand the possibilities and limitations of experimental methods. By experimentally examining some of the homeostatic mechanisms considered in the course in some depth, the student should gain significant experience in experimental design, hypothesis testing, data collection and analysis, rather than simply view a brief demonstration.</P>

 Attendance in the lab is mandatory; absences will be penalized by deducting 50% of the points from the laboratory assignment that was conducted during the missed lab period. If you miss a lab, you must attend another lab during that same week and check in with your T.A. and the T.A. in that substituted lab section.<B> Any student missing two (2) laboratories without a valid, documented excuse will automatically fail the course!</B> Arriving more than 15 minutes late counts as a missed laboratory!</P>

<CENTER>***************************************************************
</CENTER>
<BR>
Several brief data summaries and reports are required. The data may be discussed with your peers, but when a report is designated as an '<I> individual assignment</I> ', written work is to be the result of<I> individual</I> effort. Any deviation from this policy will be considered plagiarism. However, some reports will be generated as a group effort! For these assignments, one report per team will be submitted, and each member of the team will receive the same grade. The staff will not arbitrate disputes among team members. If you are in doubt about the acceptability of a group effort, ask your GTA!

<FONT SIZE=4><B> Oral Presentations</FONT> :</B>

<P> Each laboratory team ( maximum of 3 folks/team) will prepare a concise 10 (<B> TEN only!</B> ) minute summary of any exercise conducted during the year. This presentation should include all components of a report (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion), be accompanied by a concise one paragraph Abstract distributed to all lab section members, and include visual aids. Any or all of the team members may actually speak, but all will receive the same grade (maximum = 50 points). Grades will be determined by the content, professionalism, and the quality of the actual delivery! Every member of the laboratory section will evaluate each presentation!</P>

<P> #1. See your Textbook!!</P>

<BR>
<P> #2. The Nernst Equation is :</P>
&nbsp  V<sub>m</sub> = (RT/zF) ln [Ion]<sub>side1</sub>/[Ion]<sub>side2</sub> , where<BR> 
 &nbsp     R = gas constant (8.314 joules/deg mole)<BR>
 &nbsp     T = degrees Kelvin;<BR>
 &nbsp     z = valence or charge;<BR>
 &nbsp     F = Faraday's constant (96,500 coulombs/mole)</P>

<P> At a body temperature of 37o C, and plugging in the constants and converting to log 10, the equation becomes:</P>

<P>&nbsp    Vm (in mV) = (61.5/z) log 10 [Ion] 1/[Ion] 2</P>

<P> So  E Na+  = +61.5 mV ( inside of cell positive since Na+  moves in, down [DELTA]C) E K+  = -61.5 mV,<BR>
 E Ca++  = +123 mV (did you forget to divide by z which is 2 for calcium?), E Cl-  = - 61.5 mV</P>

<BR>
<P> #&nbsp3a. increase P of sodium or calcium or decrease P of potassium or chloride</P>

<OL TYPE=a START=2>
    <LI>  increase P of potassium or chloride (if V m did not = E Cl- ) or decrease P of sodium or calcium.
</OL>

<OL TYPE=a START=3>
    <LI>  increase potassium inside or decrease it outside decrease sodium outside or increase it inside increase calcium outside or decrease it inside
</OL>

<OL TYPE=a START=4>
    <LI>  reverse of &quot;c&quot; above
</OL>

<P> (Parts of question 3 assumes that each ion is somewhat permeable and that V m does NOT = the equilibrium potential for that ion.)</P>

<BR>
<P> #4a. At threshold (depolarization caused by stimulus or signal molecule), voltage-gated sodium channels open and membrane depolarizes, opening more channels. Sodium channels inactivate (close). This, combined with the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels (caused by depolarization due to entry into cell of sodium), causes repolarization. Cell may briefly hyperpolarize due to Vm going to equilibrium potential of potassium which is more negative that Vm. You should understand why this is so!</P>

The time is NOW to subscribe to <B> MAMPHYS</B> (due to budget  cuts, there will be  no complimentary gifts  for  subscribing).<B> MAMPHYS</B> will  be  used  to  communicate information about the course to subscribers, and will provide a way for subscribers to pose questions about lectures to  Dr.  Know-it-All. Responses  to  questions  will  be  sent  to<B> MAMPHYS</B> , such that all subscribers will see the question and receive the answer (who could ask for anything more!). In addition, <B> MAMPHYS</B> will provide a convenient way to post  lecture  outlines  and  handouts, important information about  lab, and other announcements of interest.</P>

<BR><P> &#174;<B><I> HOW CAN I BE PART OF THIS ZOOLOGY 422/423 INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY?</I></B></P>

<P> First, you must have a campus computer WAM account.  If you do not already have a computer alias on campus, DO NOT PASS  GO! Students  can  register electronically (see How to Register for a WAM Account in a WAM lab).  Instead, proceed directly to the Computer Science Center, Room 3326.  Bring your student ID and current registration card with you.  An account will be created for you by one of the counselors.</P>

<P> Once you have a WAM account, notice the other great things on the network (other than <B> MAMPHYS</B> ) - for example, access  to  the  library card  catalog,  the  daily news, lists of University events, the ZOOL 422/423 WWW home page, and much more!</P>

<BR><P> &#174;<B><I> DO I HAVE TO HAVE MY OWN COMPUTER IN ORDER TO BE PART OF MAMPHYS?</I></B></P>

<P> No. Any member of the UMD community can get a campus computer account. You can go to the computer science center or WAM lab to log into your account, and retrieve your <B> MAMPHYS</B> mail.</P>

<BR><P> &#174;<B><I> SUBSCRIBING TO MAMPHYS</I></B></P>

<P> Next,  you  must<B> SUBSCRIBE</B> to <B> MAMPHYS</B> .  Subscription  is  done automatically by the listserv computer, and the process could not be simpler.</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START=1>
    <LI>  Enter your WAM account using your name and password (do not try to subscribe  from  an  account  other  than your own, or  all of your<B> MAMPHYS</B> mail will be directed to that account).
</OL>

<OL TYPE=1 START=2>
    <LI>  Once into your account, you must send a mail message to the University's listserv  computer,  asking  it  to  subscribe  you  to<B> MAMPHYS</B> .  Your message should be sent to:

<P> Mail this message, and  you  will  be  automatically  subscribed  to <B> MAMPHYS.</B> &quot;sub&quot; tells the listserv computer that you want to subscribe, &quot;MAMPHYS&quot; is the name of the listserv you are subscribing to, and <B> your name</B> should follow.  That's it!</P>

<BR><P> &#174;<B><I> GETTING OLD MESSAGES FROM MAMPHYS</I></B></P>

<P> After subscribing to <B> MAMPHYS</B> , you will get a welcome message that includes some important instructions, e.g., how to retrieve previously sent or deleted messages. DO NOT delete this original message! To get a list of previously sent<B> MAMPHYS</B> messages, send an email to: listserv@umdd.umd.edu Do ot put a subject heading on your memo and do not put any blank ilines at the top of it.

Kirby, D. A., S. V. Muse and W. Stephan. 1995.  Maintenance of pre-mRNA secondary structure by epistatic selection. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, (in press).

<BR>
<BR>
<B>Abstract</B> - Linkage disequilibrium between polymorphisms in a natural population may result from various evolutionary forces, including random genetic drift due to sampling of gametes during reproduction, restricted migration between subpopulations in a subdivided population or epistatic selection. We present here evidence suggesting that the linkage disequilibria observed at the alcohol dehydrogenase locus (<I>Adh</I>) of<I> Drosophila pseudoobscura</I> are due to epistatic selection maintaining secondary structure of precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). Based on phylogenetic-comparative analysis and a likelihood approach, we propose secondary structure models of <I>Adh</I> pre-mRNA for the regions of the adult intron and intron 2 where clustering of linkage disequilibria has been observed. Furthermore, we applied the likelihood ratio test to the phylogenetically predicted secondary structure in intron 1. In contrast to the other two structures, polymorphisms associated with the more conserved stem-loop structure of intron 1 are in low frequency and linkage disequilibria have not been observed. These findings are qualitatively consistent with a model of compensatory fitness interactions. This model assumes that mutations disrupting pairing in a secondary structural element are individually deleterious if they destabilize a functionally important structure; a second "compensatory" mutation, however, may restabilize the structure and restore fitness.

<BR>
<B>Abstract </B>- Restriction map studies had previously revealed extensive linkage disequilibria in the transcriptional unit of the <I>white</I> locus in natural <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> populations. To understand the causes of these disequilibria, we have sequenced a 4722 bp region of the <I>white</I> gene from 15 lines of <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> and one line of<I> Drosophila simulans</I>. In <I>D. melanogaster</I> we have identified an 834 bp segment, encompassing the 3' end of the intron 1 to the 3' end of the intron 2, in which the polymorphisms form distinct high frequency haplotypes. Statistical tests applied to the entire 4722 bp region do not reject neutrality. In contrast, the observed pattern within the 834 bp segment deviates significantly from the predictions of a neutral equilibrium model. We propose that the high frequency haplotypes are due to positive selection on variants within the <I>white</I> gene, including a replacement polymorphism, Arg --> Leu, within this segment.

 Molecular evolution of the 	metallothionein gene <I>Mtn</i> in the <I>melanogaster</i> species group:
 Results from <i>Drosophila ananassae</I>.
 	Genetics 138: 135-143.
<p>
	Three distinctly different alleles of the metallothionein gene Mtn have been identified in natural Drosophila melanogaster populations: Mtn.3, Mtn1, and Dp(Mtn1), where the latter designates a tandem duplication of Mtn1.  In D. simulans, only Mtn.3-type alleles have been found. It has been suggested that Mtn.3 is the ancestral allele and demonstrated that a presumed two-step transition from Mtn.3 to Mtn1 to Dp(Mtn1) is accompanied by an approximate 5-fold increase in RNA levels. We analyzed the evolutionary genetics of the Mtn locus of D. ananassae, a distant relative of D. melanogaster and D. simulans within the melanogaster species group. The Mtn gene of D. ananassae is most similar to Mtn.3: (i) it is identical with Mtn.3 at the amino acid level, but differs from Mtn1 in its terminal codon; (ii) its 3' UTR contains a characteristic extra DNA segment of about 50 bp which is present in Mtn.3, but lacking in Mtn1; (iii) duplications of Mtn were not found in a worldwide sample of 110 wild D. ananassae chromosomes. However, the intron of the Mtn gene in D. ananassae is only 69 bp long, whereas the length of the Mtn.3 and Mtn1 introns is 265 bp; and it lacks a polypyrimidine stretch upstream of the 3' splice site in contrast to the much greater pyrimidine-richness found in the Mtn.3 and Mtn1 introns. A short intron (67 bp) was also identified in a D. pseudoobscura Mtn allele, suggesting that the short intron is the ancestral form and that the transition from the short to the long intron occurred within the melanogaster species group. We discuss the significance of this observation with regard to the recently proposed classification of D. melanogaster introns into two groups: short introns 
(< 90 bp) which tend to lack polypyrimidine stretches, and longer ones which have strong 3' splice signals similar to mammalian introns. A database search revealed that this length dimorphism is an evolutionarily conserved feature of Drosophila introns; transitions from one size class to the other appear to be rare between closely related species (e.g. within the melanogaster subgroup).

J. Parsch, S. Tanda, and W. Stephan. Use of site-directed mutagenesis to study the evolution of conserved, 
non-coding sequences at the <I>Adh</I> locus of <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>.
 Poster presented July 1995 at the annual meeting of the Society for the Study of Evolution, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
<p>
Nucleotide sites in non-coding regions, such as the 3' untranslated region (UTR), are often considered neutral, because base substitutions in these sites have no effect on the amino acid sequence encoded by a gene.  Substitution patterns in the 3' UTR, however, suggest that there are some constraints on nucleotide substitutions in this region.  We used two different approaches in an attempt to identify functional significance in 3' UTR sequences.  First, we looked at a possible role of the 3' UTR in mRNA secondary structure.  We examined the long-range pairing potential of 138 <I>Drosophila</I> mRNA sequences.  This analysis revealed a strong tendency for pairing stems between the start of the protein coding region and the 3' UTR.  Second,   we tested the neutrality of several non-coding nucleotide sites in the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (<I>Adh</I>) of <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>.  Site-directed mutations were made in a region of the 3' UTR that was conserved across five species of the subgenus <i>Sophophora</I>, but was not conserved in species from the subgenera <I>Drosophila</I> and <I>Scaptodrosophila</I>.  The mutant <I>Adh</I> gene was then re-introduced into the <I>D. melanogaster</I> genome using P-element mediated germ line transformation.  Transformants were spectrophotometrically assayed for their ADH enzymatic activity and compared to transformants containing the wild type <I>Adh</I> gene.  The mutant lines showed approximately 30% less ADH activity, which suggests that non-coding nucleotide sites may play an important role in gene expression and that selection may place constraints on nucleotide substitutions at these sites.

J. Parsch, S. Tanda, and W. Stephan. The Role of the 3' Untranslated Region in Gene Expression. 
Poster presented October 1995 at 19th Annual Mid-Atlantic Chromosomal Elements Meeting, Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA.
<p>
Nucleotide sites in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of a gene are often considered neutral, because base substitutions at these sites do not alter the amino acid sequence encoded by the gene.  Substitution patterns in the 3' UTR, however, suggest that there are some constraints on nucleotide changes in this region.  We used two different approaches in an attempt to identify functional significance in 3' UTR sequences.  First, we looked at a possible role of the 3' UTR in mRNA secondary structure.  We examined the long-range pairing potential of 137 Drosophila  mRNA sequences.  This analysis revealed a strong tendency for pairing stems between the start of the protein coding region and the 3' UTR.  Second, we used site-directed mutagenesis to test the neutrality of several nucleotide sites within the 3' UTR of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (Adh ) of Drosophila  melanogaster.  Mutant Adh  genes were incorporated into the D. melanogaster genome using P-element mediated germ line transformation.  Transformants were spectrophotometrically assayed for their ADH enzymatic activity and compared to transformants containing the wild type Adh  gene.  The mutant lines showed a significant reduction in ADH activity relative to the wild type, which suggests that nucleotide sites in the 3' UTR may play an important role in gene expression.

J. Parsch. The Effect of Site-Directed Mutations on Gene Expression. 
Talk to be given April 1996 at GRID (Graduate Reasearch Interaction Day), University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, USA.
<p>
The goal of my research is to determine what effect, if any, single nucleotide substitutions have on gene expression.  I am particularly interested in mutations which do not alter the amino acid sequence encoded by a gene, because they are often considered to be 'neutral' mutations which have no effect on an organism.  For my experiments I have used the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, because it is well suited for genetic study and manipulation.  The two major methods used in my research are site-directed mutagenesis and P-element mediated germ-line 
transformation.  These techniques allow me to make specific mutations in a DNA sequence in vitro, then re-introduce the altered gene back into living flies.  I have used this approach to make several mutations in the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase gene (Adh), which encodes an enzyme required for the detoxification of alcohol.  Mutant flies had a significant reduction in enzymatic activity relative to normal, wild-type flies.  This suggests that the altered nucleotide sites are not neutral and may be under selective constraints that limit substitutions at these sites during the course of molecular evolution.

<h2>Research Program</h2>
I chose to study Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthesis in <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> because little
was known about this surface antigen.  When I entered the field, knowledge of this molecule was
limited to compositional analysis.  In analyzing the data, I concluded that this molecule was
significantly different from enteric LPS.  Since this molecule is a major component of the outer
membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, I thought that the chemical differences reported by others
might be related to the disease-causing capacity of the organism.  Early on, I learned that the
reason little was known about gonococcal LOS was that none of the technologies/methodologies
that were needed to unravel how the gonococcus synthesizes LOS were available.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I spent the first part of my career at Maryland developing the technologies needed to study the
genetics of LOS biosynthesis.  I attempted to understand the biochemical basis for the inability to
introduce recombinant plasmids from <em>Escherichia coli</em> into the gonococcus.  Since it was reported
that the gonococcus could make three different restriction enzymes, I thought that the presence of
these host mediated restriction/modification (RM) systems might be preventing the incorporation
of foreign DNA by the gonococcus.  In collaboration with Bob Yuan and Andrzej Piekarowicz,
we mapped out a strategy that would allow us to characterize the various RM systems of the
gonococcus.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When we began this work, few people had been successful in cloning RM systems, and little was
known about the systems present in the gonococcus.  In order to clone gonococcal RM systems
using available technologies, we needed a ready source of the restriction enzyme under study in
order to identify recombinant plasmids that encoded them.  This presented a problem because the
enzymes produced by the gonococcus were not commercially available.  We developed a novel
technology that allowed us not only to identify clones expressing the known systems, but also to
identify 12 new RM systems.  As an outgrowth of this work we received a patent for this
technology.  Several of the clones that were generated expressed novel specificities.  The
University has licensed several of these clones to various biotechnology companies.  In
characterizing the various RM systems as they relate to gonococcal biology, we were able to
show that these enzymes can prevent the gonococcus from acquiring DNA from the environment.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p> My first efforts at developing a cloning system in the gonococcus focused on trying to identify
cloned genes via complementation of well defined <em>E. coli</em> mutants.  I constructed a shuttle vector
that allowed me to clone and express genes in <em>E. coli</em>, and then introduce these cloned genes into
the gonococcus.  This shuttle vector, and subsequent constructs are the only vectors currently
used for cloning and expressing genes in the gonococcus.  In developing the methodology needed
to introduce genes into the gonococcus via conjugation and transformation, members of my
laboratory cloned and characterized most of the RM systems found in the gonococcus, made
mutants of these genes, and introduced these deletions into the chromosome of the gonococcus. 
This RM deficient strain has made genetic manipulation in the gonococcus much easier, as this
strain lacks a restriction barrier.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As a first step in identifying gonococcal genes that might be involved in LOS biosynthesis, I
designed a set of experiments that demonstrated that gonococcal genes could be expressed in <em>E.
coli</em>.  This was done by interspecific complementation of well defined<em> E. coli</em> mutants.  These
advances allowed me to conclude that one could identify certain types of genes directly in <em>E. coli</em>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After establishing the methodology needed to introduce cloned genes into the gonococcus, I
began to address the question, how does the gonococcus make LOS?  I demonstrated that LOS
biosynthetic genes could be identified via transformation.  This was not a simple task as the
transformation frequencies that I could obtain for modifying LOS expression in the gonococcus
was lower than the spontaneous antigenic variation rates seen for LOS expression.  However, the
plate transformation procedure that I devised allowed me to overcome this problem.  These
studies suggested that LOS biosynthetic genes might be found in operons.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>My initial attempts at cloning LOS biosynthetic genes were hampered by the lack of suitable
strains.  However, I was able to take advantage of strains developed by others in the field.  I
generated a gene bank from strain FA19, and isolated a clone that could complement a pyocin
resistant mutant, FA5100.  Subsequent work has shown that this gene, <em>lsi-1</em>, is a homolog of
(<em>rfaF</em>). This discovery allowed me to construct strains with a defined LOS structure.  This strain
has been used by others to begin to decipher the biological functions of LOS.  The technologies I
generated allowed me and many others in the field to clone most of the other genes involved in
the biosynthesis of this complicated macromolecule.  We have cloned all of the genes needed to
add the various sugars onto known LOS structures.  In addition, my laboratory has identified
heretofore unknown structures by isolating variants that express alternate LOS structures.  These
strains will prove to be very important in unraveling the biology of LOS in gonococcal and
meningococcal disease.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As my work on LOS biosynthesis progressed, researchers in this field changed their view of the
importance of this molecule in disease.  Early work on the biology of LOS done in the mid to late
1980's showed that this molecule was able to undergo antigenic variation.  Furthermore, others in
the field showed that these molecules are absolutely required for disease, and that the bulk of the
pathogenic response to gonococcal infections is due to damage caused/induced by LOS.  I have
recently described at the molecular level how the gonococcus regulates one type of LOS antigenic
variation.  We have developed a testable model that will demonstrate that antigenic variation in
LOS expression is required for disease.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The gonococcus is also able to simultaneously express multiple LOS structures.  The ability to
express different structures on the same cell seems to be an important intermediate in the disease
process.  I have just submitted for publication data describing how the gonococcus regulates this
simultaneous expression of  multiple LOS structures.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As I increased my knowledge of gonococcal biology, and efforts to develop a vaccine against
infections with this organism, I realized that the gonococcus was a relatively benign immunogen. 
I thought that it might be possible to develop a novel approach toward vaccine development by
incorporating foreign antigens into the gonococcus.  I have shown that it is possible to express
outer membrane proteins from <em>Borrelia burgdorferi, Streptococcus pneumoniae,</em> and
<em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> in the gonococcus and use these recombinant strains to generate
protective immune responses against challenge with the homologous organisms.  With my
colleagues at MedImmune, Inc., we have shown that recombinant Blebs expressing <em>ospA</em> from <em>B.
burgdorferi</em>, <em>pspA</em> from<em> S. pneumoniae</em>, and the P6 protein from<em> H. influenzae</em> all produce
protective immune responses. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the future, I see my research program changing to reflect advances in the field and a broadening
of my scientific interests.  I expect my current research program on gonococcal LOS biosynthesis
to expand in two ways: 1) to include studying how this process occurs in the nonpathogenic
<em>Neisseria</em>; and 2) to begin to develop animal models to study the immunology of this molecule. 
These studies will be important because the LOS structures that we see in laboratory grown
gonococci only represent a subset of what is seen <em>in vivo</em>.  We have a significant amount of data
that indicates that genetic exchange between the gonococcus and the nonpathogens occurs <em>in
vivo</em>, and if we are to truly understand the gonococcus's ability to make LOS, we need to know
what structures are possible.  If antibodies directed against LOS are to be effective in preventing
disease, we need to understand the immunology of these molecules.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I also plan to expand my research program on gonococcal RM systems to begin to ask questions
about DNA repair in the <em>Neisseria</em>.  Since methylcytosine is highly mutagenic, one would predict
that because this organisms has so many DNA methylases, the gonococcus should be
hypermutable.  However, this organism is in fact hypomutable.  This suggests that the gonococcus
must be extremely efficient in DNA repair.  Very little is known about how this organism repairs
DNA damage.  This type of study should be able to attract funding from a variety of sources.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><B> ANS Pharmacology Problems/Answers</B></H2>

<P><B><I> The following few exercises should help you to understand the effects of neurotransmitters and of the peripheral sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves on various effector organs.</I></B></P>

<HR>

<H4><B> 1. Effect of ACh on intestinal muscle:</B></H4>

<P> ACh is released from parasympathetic nerves onto the muscle cells. Thinking of the &quot;restive state&quot; example from lecture, the intestine would be active or excited. Exogenous ACh would act on muscarinic receptors (most peripheral!). Stimulation of the parasympathetic ganglia by ACh would give the same response.</P>

<HR>

<H4><B> 2. Sympathetic nerve action on the heart:</b></H4>

<P> NE released would act on beta 1 receptors (found only on the heart). Thinking of the &quot;Fight or Flight&quot; example, NE would increase heart rate and the strength of contraction.</P>

<HR>

<H4><B> 3. NE actions on blood flow to intestine:</B></H4>

<P> During &quot;Fight or Flight&quot; (remember, NE from sympathetic nerves which give us this state), we know that blood flow to this organ would be reduced as the circular muscle of the blood vessel contracts. Thus, NE must excite these muscle cells, hence <B><I> most</I></B> of the adrenergic receptors in these vessels must be alpha 1.</P>

<HR>

<H4><B> 4. ACh on Blood flow:</B></H4>

<P> A very tricky question. The only place one finds muscarinic receptors on blood vessels is in some of them supplying skeletal muscles. In this case, ACh is released from sympathetic nerves. Following our &quot;Fight or Flight&quot; scenario, we can predict that ACh will dilate these vessels. However, if we give an i.v. dose of ACh, heart rate will go down (parasympathetic action) and this may decrease blood flow in the total system.</P>

<HR>

<H4><B> 5. Some points to remember:</B></H4>

<P> - ACh is released from sympathetic nerves to sweat glands and some BVs to skeletal muscle. It will stimulate the sweat glands and dilate (relax or inhibit) the BVs</P>

<P> - The diameter of pupil of the eye is regulated by two opposing sets of muscles. Activation of the sphincter muscle of the iris by ACh (muscarinic) constricts the pupil while stimulation of the radial muscle by NE (alpha 1) opens it.</P>

<P> - Likewise the pacemaker of the heart (the SA node) is dually innervated. ACh (parasympathetic) and NE or Epi (sympathetic) have predictable actions.</P>

<P> - The adrenal medulla releases Epi and some NE into the blood during sympathetic stimulation. The gland is really a modified post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve, excited by the release of ACh from the pre- ganglionic nerve onto nicotinic receptors. This results in the excitation of the gland (i.e., post-ganglionic &quot;nerve&quot;) and the release of Epi and NE from this adrenergic structure.</P>

<H4><B> ANSWERS</B></H4>

<OL TYPE=1 START=1>
    <LI>  Ralphie's <B> BLOOD</B> volume: first, you must use the data for high MW dextran so that it stays in the circulation. Note that after injection, it takes some time for the dextran to distribute evenly throughout the circulatory system. Thus, 10mg/0.2mg/ml = 50ml of plasma. Corrected for hematocrit = 50ml x 1/(1-0.50) = 100 mls of blood.
</OL>

<OL TYPE=1 START=2>
    <LI>  Alveolar ventilation = (TV-dead space) x rate = (12 - 2 mls) x 15/min = 150 mls/min.
</OL>

<OL TYPE=1 START=3>
    <LI>  To calculate renal blood flow, use substance with highest E, i.e., substance Pz. First, E of Pz = (0.5 mg/100 ml - 0.2 mg/100) / 0.5 mg/100) = 0.6 (NO units!) Then C Pz = 0.45 mg/ml x 0.1 ml/min / 0.5 mg /100 ml = 9 ml / min (UNITS, please). Next, RPF = C/E, so 9 ml/min / 0.6 = 15 ml /min and RBF = 15 ml/min x 1/(1-hematocrit) = 30 ml/min. (Units are required at every step!)
</OL>

<OL TYPE=1 START=4>
    <LI>  GFR = C of inulin (since inulin is only filtered!). C of inulin = 0.015 mg/ml x 0.1 ml/min / 0.025 mg/100 mls = 6 ml/min. OR, since FF or E inulin = GFR/RPF, then 0.4 = GFR/ 15 ml/min, and GFR = 6 ml/min.
</OL>

<OL TYPE=1 START=5>
    <LI>  FF = GFR / RPF, so FF = 6 ml/min / 15 ml/min = 0.4 (no units!)
</OL>

<OL TYPE=1 START=6>
    <LI>  Inulin filtered per min = P inulin x GFR = 0.025 mg/100ml x 6 ml/min = 0.0015 mg/min. (note units!)
</OL>

<OL TYPE=1 START=7>
    <LI>  Water reabsorption = GFR (rate of filtrate formed) - V (rate of urine production). Thus, 6 ml/min - 0.1 ml/min = 5.9 ml of water reabsorbed per min.
</OL>

<OL TYPE=1 START=8>
    <LI>  Since C<sub>inulin</sub>&lt; C<sub>Pz</sub>, and E<sub>inulin</sub> or FF &lt; E<sub>Pz</sub>, and U<sub>Pz</sub> x V (amount of Pz in urine per minute) &gt; P<sub>Pz</sub> x GFR (amount of Pz filtered per minute), Pz must be secreted.
</OL>

<OL TYPE=1 START=9>
    <LI>  see # 8 for all three ways
</OL>

<OL TYPE=1 START=10>
    <LI>  Pz secreted/min = amount in urine/min - amount filtered/min (the difference must have been added by secretion). Thus (U x V) - (P x GFR) or (0.45 mg/ml x 0.1 ml/min) - (0.5 mg/100 ml x 6 ml/min) = 0.015 mg/min is secreted.
</OL>

<OL TYPE=1 START=11>
    <LI>  Looking at the data, we see that plasma pH is down (pH = 7.3) while plasma bicarbonate is elevated from a normal of 23 to 30 mmoles/l. This means the subject is not blowing off normal amounts of carbon dioxide (thus elevated bicarb and lower pH), so respiration must be depressed.

<HR>


<P> In 1954, W. D. M. Paton published an article in Pharmacological Reviews (volume 6, page 59) which describes the prolonged effects of the administration of hexamethonium, a potent antagonist of nicotinic receptors in the autonomic ganglia. This &quot;Hexamethonium Man&quot; article is a classic description of the consequences of losing the autonomic nervous system and should be read by every avid 422 fan.</P>

<P> You must also read a humorous description of Starling's Law of the Heart by A. C. Burton (1965). Burton's &quot;poetical summary&quot; is a classic piece of physiological wit. Please read it.</P>

<P> Finally, LSD: Its Effects on a Male Asiatic Elephant, an article (1962.<I> Science</I><B> 138</B> : 1100-1102) that describes science gone amok, is a real 'must read' piece of literature.</P>

<P> Copies of the first article is posted on the Web pages. Read it before the appropriate examination! The LSD article from <I> Science</I> and <I> Starling's Law</I>&nbsp may be obtained in your recitation session.</P>

<H2> Closed-End Funds</H2>

How would you like to buy a mutual fund at a discount, often as much
as 70 to 80 cents to the dollar? Closed-end funds (CEFs), a close
relative of the mutual funds, are often available at such steep
discounts. Though discounted, closed-end funds are anything but
inferior. Consider this:  <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG SRC="/images/misc/ball_red.gif"> The portfolio managers of many
of the CEFs are outstanding investment professionals: Martin Zweig,
John Neff, John Templeton, Mark Mobius, Mario Gabelli, Charles Royce,
and others, many of whom run top-ranked mutual funds. <P>

<IMG SRC="/images/misc/ball_red.gif"> The funds are
run by well-respected financial companies including Fidelity
Investments, Morgan Stanley, Oppenheimer, Franklin-Templeton, and
Paine Webber.  <P>

<IMG SRC="/images/misc/ball_red.gif"> CEFs are no slouches when it
comes to performance: in the bull market of 1993, 18 of the roughly
150 CEFs delivered eye-popping returns of 100% or more, often handily
beating their mutual fund counterparts.  <P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>


The ability to buy quality funds at discounts has attracted several
famous investment figures including legendary investor Warren Buffet
and Benjamin Graham. CEFs, however, despite what we have said so far,
still remain largely the realm of a few savvy individual investors.
These investors have recognized that, apart from the traditional
benefits of <A
HREF="tutorial/maj_diff.htm#diversification">diversification</A>,
<A HREF="tutorial/maj_diff.htm#pro_man">professional management</A>
and <A HREF="tutorial/maj_diff.htm#econ">economy of scale</A>,
CEFs offer the investor control over pricing and timing that mutual
funds don't.  When judiciously exercised, this control provides the
investor with <A
HREF="tutorial/maj_diff.htm#price_control">opportunities</A> to
often dramatically improve returns, sometimes with reduced risk.  <P> 

Closed-end funds cater to every style of investor: there are funds for
growth investors (the Jundt Growth Fund), value investors (Royce Value
Trust), sector investors (the Global Health Sciences Fund, the First
Financial Fund), small-cap investors (the Royce OTC Microcap Fund),
global investors (the Clemente Global Growth Fund), international
investors (the Europe Fund, the Asia Pacific Fund), single country
funds (the India Growth Fund, the Spain Fund), emerging markets' funds
(the Templeton Emerging Markets Fund, the Morgan Stanley Emerging
Markets Fund), gold funds (ASA Ltd.), and so forth. In addition, for
traders, CEFs provide exceptional opportunites to capitalize on
short-term swings in the discount relative to the long-term historical
discounts. <P>

We believe that investors who are discerning enough to invest in
closed-end funds deserve the best in terms of investment information,
and we hope you like what we have to offer.  To make this information
broadly accessible, we have deliberately opted to keep our pricing as
attractive as possible, and to offer a broad range of plans and
prices. Certainly, we believe our services are competitive both in
content and in pricing with others that offer specialized information
on closed-end funds. <P>

CEFs). The information available currently includes:

<LI> Our specialized charts on CEFs.
<LI> Our profiles for each CEF.
<LI> Our performance tables for each CEF.
<LI> Relative performance charts for CEFs.
<LI> Synopsis of recent information on price, NAV and discount for each CEF.

<H3> Advanced Service </H3>

While our basic service will suffice for most investors, a few might
want to subscribe to our advanced service which provides all the
information described in our basic service but, in addition, allows
interactive customization of the information through automated
forms. Customization will include setting parameters for charts (e.g.,
the number of weeks for moving averages of discounts, buy/sell lines,
color, size, and so forth). For example, a conservative trader might
like to set the buy line to a -10% relative discount and the sell line
to a +3% relative discount, and might want to use a 20-week moving
average of the discount.

<H3> Professional Service </H3>

Our professional service provides all the information in our advanced
service and, in addition, permits professionals (brokers, financial
advisors, newsletter writers, reporters, and so forth) to make
available limited information from our site to their clients without
violating our copyright agreement. <P>

Currently, subscribers to this service may provide information
(charts, relative performance charts, and data from synopses,
profiles, and performance tables) on at most five CEFs and, at most
five pieces of data or tables involving market sentiment indicators,
overview reports, and performance results, per issue (for newsletters)
or per day (for others).

<P> <IMG SRC="/images/misc/note.gif" ALT="Note:"> If you need to make
more information available to your clients or subscribers, and would
like to access the information through our Internet server, you may
negotiate a sublicense contract with us and our data provider,

<H3> Site Licenses </H3>

All the above services are for individual use only (the professional
service is also for use only by an individual, though the individual
may share limited information with clients). For groups, we offer site
licenses, which are attractively discounted depending on the number of
users.

<PRE>
	No. of Users		Discount Level
	
	  2  --   5		   10%
	  6  --  10		   15%
	 11  --  24		   20%
	 25  --  49		   30%
	 50  --  99		   40%

<EM>Site Licenses</EM>: 	 
<P>
	To compute the subscription fee:
<OL>
<LI>	Select the level of subscription you need (basic, advanced, professional)
<LI>	Decide if you will be paying monthly or prepaying for a year
<LI> 	Multiply the monthly or yearly rate for the service  by the number of users and 
apply the discount as determined by the above table.
</OL>

<P> For example, if you wish to obtain a site license for advanced service for
7 users, and you will be paying monthly, then your fee is determined as follows:
<OL>
<LI> Advanced Service, paying monthly is $15/user.
<LI> For seven users, the fee is $15/user * 7 users = $105.00.
<LI> From the discount table, you qualify for a 15% discount, that is, $105.00 * 0.15  = $15.75
<LI> Deducting the discount, your final fee is $105.00 - $15.75 = $89.25
