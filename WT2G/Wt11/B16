<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I>Two WMX facilities and the <A HREF="http://www.deq.state.or.us/deqhome.htm">Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ)</A>
  are  participating as a pilot project of the <A HREF="http://es.inel.gov/elp"> U.S.
EPA's Environmental Leadership Program.</A>  Ten  businesses and two federal
facilities were selected to take part in the program, designed  to encourage and
recognize innovative and effective environmental management systems.</I></P>
<P><I>To demonstrate WMX environmental management systems, ODEQ and EPA staff
have  participated in WMX training programs, inspections, self-audits and
corporate audits at two  adjacent landfills in Arlington, Oregon - the Columbia
Ridge Landfill and Recycling Center  for non-hazardous waste, and Chemical Waste
Management of the Northwest. Agency  officials have been given access to the
computer-based compliance tools described in this  section to evaluate how they
function as part of a compliance management system.</I></P>
<P><I>The facilities are also demonstrating environmental leadership beyond
compliance. For  example, Columbia Ridge is working with the Oregon Graduate
Institute on a biodiversity  project investigating how to restore native habitat
in areas of the 12,000-acre property  that are disturbed by landfill
construction. The biodiversity project is also looking at ways to  enhance the
wildlife habitat value of the property and protect a threatened plant species 
found at the site.</I></P>
<P><I>EPA is evaluating all of the pilot projects to identify the essential
elements and recognize  facility-level environmental leadership. </I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="00994d">Conserving Wetlands and
Biodiversity</FONT><BR>WMX has made a unique commitment to "no net loss of
wetlands or other biological diversity" on its properties.  No models for
pursuing such a commitment on private lands existed, so WMI and Rust developed a
systematic approach embodied in a detailed guidance manual for biodiversity
planning at Company facilities. About 50 sites were identified for preparation
of systematic inventories and plans before major new construction or expansion.
Plans have been completed for 15 sites and are under development at eight more
in the U.S. and Australia.</P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Results demonstrate the value of the WMX approach for voluntary conservation of
biological resources: the studies found opportunities to conserve, and in some
cases, restore or enhance biological resources while allowing economic activity
to proceed. At the Springhill Landfill in Northeast Florida, for example, the
biodiversity inventory identified wetlands and old-growth live oak trees as
priority resources. Facility management dedicated a conservation easement on 12
acres of the wetlands to the state of Florida. They also built a 1,000-foot
boardwalk of recycled plastic through the wetlands and natural areas and
preserved several old-growth trees.</P>
<P>
The year 1995 also marked the 10-year anniversary of a conservation agreement
protecting the threatened Bay Checkerspot Butterfly at the Kirby Canyon landfill
near San Jose, California. WMI entered into the agreement with the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service in 1986 establishing a trust fund to support habitat
restoration and monitoring. Over a 10-year period, the Stanford University
Center for Conservation Biology has studied the butterfly habitat and
populations and published 26 scientific papers on the subject. At the end of
1995, WMI voluntarily renewed  its support for the Trust fund for a period of
three years. This will allow research and monitoring activities to continue and
provide for a focus on restoring closed landfill areas as additional butterfly
habitat.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
During 1995, WMX companies in North America met their goal of &Ograve;no net
loss&Oacute; of wetlands, creating or restoring 7.7 acres of wetlands for each
acre filled. The two-year average is 2.7 to one (see Figure 12) areas are
considered  to have been protected if they were acquired for permanent
preservation of their wetlands resources. Internationally, wetlands impacts are
not currently tracked because of the lack of consistent definitions and
regulations.</P>
<P>
In 1990, WMI pledged to plant 1 million trees by the year 2000. To date, WMI
divisions working with community groups have planted or sponsored the planting
of over 811,200 trees (see Figure 13). Waste Management of Ohio received the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources Governor's TreeSource Award for its efforts
in planting nearly 125,000 trees. At the Countywide Recycling and Disposal
Facility in Boliver, Ohio, for example, more than 120 student and adult
volunteers planted 11,700 seedlings on three tracts of reclaimed strip mine
land.

the site for this and other measures to improve wildlife habitat, including
restoration of native vegetation.</TD></TR></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="00994d">Buying Recycled</FONT><BR> WMX opened or
designed three offices in 1995 featuring recycled and environmentally preferable
materials and systems. The WMI/Recycle America office in downtown Los Angeles
opened in July featuring walls made with recycled newspaper and steel, carpets
of recycled soda bottles, furniture from waste cardboard and lumber salvaged
from movie sets, a variety of recycled office supplies, non-toxic paint, and air
and water purification systems. Designers of new offices in downtown Chicago and
Washington, D.C. have followed suit and, indeed, added to the list of attractive
and functional recycled materials used. The offices serve as a demonstration to
their many visitors that construction with recycled and environmentally friendly
materials is practical and can be accomplished at a cost comparable to
conventional materials. 
</P> 
<P>
In 1995, WMX's Purchasing Department spent $113,498,000, about the same as in
1994, on goods containing recycled material, including steel in trucks and
roll-off containers, plastic in recycling and trash containers and office paper<B>
(see Table 3).  </B>

companies produce power from various unconventional fuels. Facilities in North
America, Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom generated 6 billion
kilowatt-hours of electricity (see Figure 14) and sold more than 8 million cubic
feet per day of landfill gas for heating and other purposes.
</P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="00994d">Landfill Gas to Energy</FONT></B>   WMX companies
worldwide operate 35 landfill gas-to-electricity plants - more than any other
company. In addition, four facilities in the United States process landfill gas
and sell it as a medium-Btu fuel to industries as a replacement for natural gas,
coal or oil. In Sweden, the Kovik Landfill uses its gas-to-energy plant to power
the BRINI&#170; system at the adjacent recycling facility. At the Pescantina
Landfill in Italy, landfill gas is used to run the leachate treatment plant.
Four new landfill gas plants and three expansions are planned for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Two projects begun in 1995 will help extend landfill gas utilization to smaller
facilities where it has not been  cost-effective. WMI, Rust, and Caterpillar,
WMI's landfill gas joint venture partner, joined forces to adapt a standard
reciprocating engine to run on landfill gas. The new engine, dubbed BRUTUS, uses
technologies and computer controls perfected in diesel and natural gas engines
to maximize energy production and control emissions such as nitrous oxide and
carbon monoxide, two common by-products of landfill gas combustion. Because
landfill gas naturally varies in its energy content, earlier engines have not
always been able to work at peak efficiency. The new engine, however, uses
computer technology to continually adjust the mix of air and gas, allowing the
system to wring maximum energy value from the landfill gas. A WMI process
improvement team also examined the variety of potential uses - from space
heating to electricity generation - for landfill gas, and is working with
landfills of varying sizes and ages to identify cost-effective opportunities.

<B><FONT COLOR="00994d">Trash to Energy </FONT></B>In 1995, Wheelabrator's 16
trash-to-energy plants in the United States processed 7.5 million tons of trash,
generating four billion kilowatt-hours of electricity - enough to light a city
the size of San Francisco. During 1995, Wheelabrator brought on line its newest
trash-to-energy facility in Lisbon, Connecticut, handling 500 tons per day of
trash to produce 110 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year.
Wheelabrator's Falls Township, Pennsylvania plant won the 1995 Power Plant Award
from Power Magazine for its energy-efficient design, advanced environmental
controls and incorporation of a materials recovery facility into its operation.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="2"></A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT COLOR="00994d">Small Power Production</FONT></B>  
Wheelabrator operates seven small power production facilities using a variety 
of fuels, including waste wood, waste coal, tires and landfill gas to produce
energy. The Ridge Generating Station in Polk County, Florida completed its first
full year of operation, converting more than 331,000 tons of waste wood and
tires into 200 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. Sherman Station, a
wood-burning power plant in Maine, has developed a program to reuse all of the
ash produced by the facility. Depending upon the nutrient content of the ash, it
is used by local farmers as fertilizer, added to compost or used as fill by an
adjacent lumber company. Also in 1995, Wheelabrator bought and re-started a
wood-burning power plant that had closed in Martell, California.</P> 
<P><B><FONT COLOR="00994d">
Alternative Fuels</FONT></B>   For several years, Waste Management of Argentina
has run a fleet of 65 light duty trucks on natural gas in Buenos Aires. In the
U.S., 17 vehicles ranging from collection trucks to landfill equipment are
running on natural gas or a combination of diesel and natural gas. In 1995, WMI
formed an Alternative Fuels Users Council to evaluate the Company's experience
with demonstration and pilot projects and plan further steps to use alternative
fuels in its fleet of nearly 19,000 collection vehicles and heavy equipment. In
addition to cleaner emissions, the use of natural gas fuels reduces maintenance
requirements and increases engine lifetimes. The Council is considering several
proposals to demonstrate how landfill gas captured at Company landfills can be
purified, compressed or liquefied and used as fuel.
</P>
<P>
Waste Management of the Desert in Palm Desert, California introduced Southern
California's first EPA-certified 100 percent natural gas waste collection and
recycling truck. The truck rolled out in September of 1995 was the first of 14
to be converted to natural gas with assistance from a grant from the South Coast
Air Quality Management District.
</P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="00994d">Energy-Efficient Transportation</FONT></B>  
During 1995, 91 WMI hauling divisions (about 40 percent of the total) began
implementing the STARS computer-assisted routing system for commercial
collection routes. The system helps to determine the most efficient pattern for
commercial collection, thereby cutting miles traveled, fuel consumed and air
pollution generated. By the end of 1995 the participating divisions had
eliminated 3,382 hours per week of truck operation, equivalent to about 9
percent of total hours and 68 trucks on the road. Fuel savings over the year
totaled about 157,000 gallons. At the year-end level of implementation, fuel
savings will total 500,000  gallons in 1996 and cost savings $7 million. The
savings are expected to be even greater, however, as additional divisions use
the system and additional routes are analyzed at participating divisions.</P>
<P>
In Seattle, WMI operates the nation's first containerized rail-haul system,
shipping the city's trash to WMI's Columbia Ridge Landfill in Oregon. Rail-haul
is more fuel efficient and generates significantly less air pollution than truck
transportation.
</P>
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="00994d">Buildings and Operations </FONT></B>   During 1995,
WMX completed the <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/docs/GCDOAR/GreenLights.html">&quot;Green Lights&quot;</A> retrofit of its headquarters
buildings by installing new lighting in one of the older headquarters buildings.
A more efficient, CFC-free air conditioning system was installed at the same
time. Despite a brutally hot summer, the improvements saved nearly 140,000
kilowatt-hours.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="00994d">Soil and Water Conservation</FONT></B>
<BR> WMX facilities use a variety of methods to conserve soil and water.
Landfill operations require the use of considerable amounts of soil for daily,
interim and final cover of filled areas. Daily covering of trash is a key
requirement for maintaining sanitary conditions. In several states, WMI has
worked with authorities to permit the use of &quot;alternative daily cover&quot;
- ranging from tarps to treated soil from bioremediation facilities - to
conserve clean soil. These efforts have saved more than a million cubic yards of
soil and also helped to extend the life of the landfills. 
</P>
<P>
In arid regions, water must be used in landfill operations to prevent blowing
dust that could impact local air quality. Several WMI facilities use reclaimed
water for this purpose. For example, at the Altamont Landfill in California, a
wastewater treatment plant handles runoff and leachate from the 550 acre site.
The water is treated to exacting regional water quality standards and then used
on site for dust control and landscaping.

Better Than Two</FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><B><I>Residents of Alameda County, California and Hobe Sound, Florida are
enjoying the benefits of a breakthrough in truck design that cuts the number of
collection trucks on the road by up to half.</I></B></P>
<P></P>
<P><B><I>During the 1980's and 1990's curbside recycling programs
proliferated and extended to a range of materials such as bottles, cans,
newspapers and yard waste. While these programs increased the amount of
materials recycled, they often had an unwanted side effect of requiring two or
more &quot;passes&quot; by waste collection trucks to collect the variety of
materials. For several years, WMI has worked closely with its suppliers to
develop a truck design that could pick up trash and recyclables in one pass. The
new vehicles were rolled out in 1995 and by year end, a total of 106 trucks were
in use at more than a dozen WMI divisions. The design features a divided
front-end load bin that keeps waste segregated and delivers it to two or three
compartments in the truck body. Compared to a typical design, the truck has a
larger capacity and a smaller, more energy-efficient engine, both features that
help improve operating efficiency. </I></B></P>
<P><B><I> In the California and Florida communities where yard wastes were
separately collected, use of the One Pass  Collection Service has eliminated a
third of all pick-ups, while in other communities it is expected to cut them by
half. Cutting the number of passes reduces the number of trucks on the road,
cuts emissions and fuel use, reduces the chances of accidents, and makes
recycling more convenient.</I></B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="00994d">Remediation at WMX Facilities</FONT><BR>Most
non-permitted releases for which WMX subsidiaries have some responsibility have
occurred at land disposal facilities in the United States. Virtually all of
these have occurred at older facilities acquired from other companies, or at
facilities not owned by WMX but to which WMX or its predecessors lawfully
transported waste. In general, environmental considerations in landfill location
and design were much less stringent when these facilities were developed than
they are today.</P>
<P>
At sites acquired by WMX, the Company has assumed responsibility for
investigating contamination and  implementing appropriate remedial measures. At
sites not owned by WMX, the Company either takes a lead role or works with other
responsible parties to investigate and remediate contamination.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Some of these sites are on the EPA Superfund National Priority List (NPL).
Claims have been made against  WMX subsidiaries at 105 sites on the NPL where
these subsidiaries are alleged to be potentially responsible parties (PRPs).
None of the 105 NPL facilities were originally developed by WMX. Nineteen were
acquired by WMX subsidiaries from other owners. The remaining 86 have never been
owned by WMX, but received some waste transported by a firm, the liabilities of
which are currently owned by the Company, typically as one of many waste haulers
serving an area <B>(see Figure 15). </B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
At each of the 19 WMX-owned facilities on the NPL, the Company lends its
technical expertise and works with  the government to characterize or remediate
problems. In addition, the Company has either agreed, or is seeking agreement,
with other liable parties to share the costs of remediation or is pursuing
resolution of an allocation formula. Sites subject to state &quot;Superfund&quot;
laws are treated by the Company in the same way as NPL sites. Internationally,
WMX has upgraded and cleaned up a number of acquired facilities.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
WMX net expenditures for remediation of closed sites (after recovery of costs
from other parties) are shown  in Figure 16. In 1991, the Company recorded a
charge of $296 million before tax and minority interest, to reflect its
then-current estimate of Superfund environmental remediation liabilities. The
Company continues to evaluate and provide for the costs of remediating other
sites that may pose a potential threat to public health, welfare or the
environment. It also provides for costs expected to be incurred after a facility
ceases to accept waste. At the end of 1995, WMX had accrued $762 million to
provide for environmental responsibilities, including remediation, closure and
post-closure monitoring costs. No significant judgments or settlements were
entered in 1995 with respect to private civil actions against WMX concerning
pollutants released from disposal facilities. WMX carries environmental
impairment liability insurance in amounts that meet or exceed legal
requirements.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="00994d">Management Accountability
and Employee Involvement</FONT></B>
</P>
<P>
From division presidents to the Chief Executive Officer, all managers with
environmental responsibilities have incentives for environmental performance
through compensation systems.
</P>
<P>
The WMX Executive Environmental Committee is the principal management committee
for oversight of  environmental performance and for strategic reporting to the
Chief Executive Officer of WMX. Its members include executives from each of the
operating groups and major corporate functions. During 1995, the Committee 
 approved environmental management program standards applicable to the operating
groups and established  a process and guidance for annual planning under the WMX
Environmental Policy and Principles.</P> 
<TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT"><TR><TD COLSTART="1"><IMG

<TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" COLSTART="1">Figure 16</TD></TR>            

</TABLE>
<P>
Within most of the operating groups, committees or other mechanisms have been
established to coordinate  environmental policies and programs across business
units. For example, WTI has established a President's Environmental Management
Council made up of representatives of the various business units.</P> 
<P>
Environmental considerations are inherent in decisions made by the WMX Board of
Directors. In addition, the  WMX Law and Compliance group reports to the Audit
Committee of the Board on a semi-annual basis and, for the past six years,
Arthur D. Little, Inc. has presented the results of its annual environmental
assessment to the Audit Committee. None of the Audit Committee members is a WMX
employee. The Board of Directors has reviewed and approved each annual
environmental report, including this one, since reporting began in 1990.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
Environmental performance depends upon the efforts of all employees. WMX has
instituted recognition programs  to encourage and reward employee involvement in
the environmental issues. In 1995, the Chairman's Award for Environmental
Excellence was given to a team of WMI and Rust employees who developed and are
implementing a complex plan for protecting threatened species and restoring
native habitats at the Mallard Ridge Recycling and Disposal Facility in Delavan,
Wisconsin. Many operating groups also have recognition programs for individuals
or business units.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="00994d">Environmental Management
Certification</FONT></B> 
</P>
<P>
WMX companies have pursued certification of their environmental management
systems under various country programs. Two of the three hazardous waste
management companies in The Netherlands, for example, are certified under the
Dutch Environmental Care system and the solid waste companies are preparing for
certification. Two facilities in the United Kingdom are certified under BS 7750
<A HREF="pg22.htm">(see profile)</A>. All of these programs require independent
audits of the Company's environmental management systems.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
During 1996, WMX operating groups will assess whether to seek certification for
their facilities under the  Organization for International Standardization's new
Environmental Management Standard (ISO 14001). An initial assessment was done at
the corporate level as part of the Arthur D. Little review of WMX environmental
management systems. WMI plc formed an ISO task force in 1995 to assist
facilities in seeking certification.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

companies conduct research and development on issues important to the
environmental management of their facilities, on environmentally sound methods
of managing wastes and on environmental issues significant to their customers.
Some of this research is coordinated through Rust's Clemson Technical Center
(CTC), a joint program with Clemson University. CTC projects in 1995 included
development of systems for radioactive soil decontamination and for treatment of
mixed hazardous and radioactive waste. Working with the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE), Rust has formed a partnership with the Radon Institute in Moscow
to test cold crucible vitrification on DOE wastes in the United States. Rust is
also demonstrating a technology to recover usable iron and oil from steel mill
sludge. Other WMX research and development projects in 1995 included:</P>
<UL><LI>Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc. developed the Thermex&#170; process for use
by electric utilities in managing radioactive liquids. The process reclaims
usable water and produces a concentrated solid waste that can be readily
managed. It reduces radioactive waste volumes, decreases operational exposure
and offers an alternative to dilute-and-release management of radioactive
liquids;</LI></UL>
<UL><LI> In Hong Kong, WMI plc developed a process for recovering usable fuel
from oily wastes typically discharged by ships at sea;</LI></UL>
<UL><LI> In France, WMI plc developed the Toxipole system for collecting small
quantities of hazardous wastes. The system includes bar code identification for
effective tracking; and</LI></UL>
<UL><LI>The West Edmonton Landfill in Alberta, Canada demonstrated hydraulic
fracturing of refuse to enhance leachate extraction.</LI></UL>
<P>The Company has also established the WMX Patent Society to encourage and
recognize innovative research and development efforts by employees. Twelve
employees were recognized in 1995 for 19 patents.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="1"></A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="00994d">Community Involvement</FONT>
</P>
<P>
WMX community involvement programs are guided by the Company's unique Good
Neighbor Policy that articulates its commitment to the communities in which it
operates. The policy includes a pledge to consult with host communities when
planning business activities and to provide information about facility
operations. It also commits to hiring a diverse local work force and
participating in community activities. Examples of 1995 community involvement
projects include:
</P>
<UL><LI>WMI hauling and landfill divisions worked with community leaders,
donating services to demolish and dispose of 100 &quot;crack&quot; houses in a
run-down section of Taylor, Texas;</LI></UL>
<UL><LI> One hundred volunteers from Pacific Waste Management (PWM) collected
or coordinated the collection of more than 150 tons of trash on Clean Up
Australia Day. PWM donated the services of collection trucks and drivers and
provided trash bins, including some that were floated on barges for trash
collected in waterways.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="2"></A></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="00994d">Environmental Education</FONT>
</P>
<P>
WMX companies sponsor educational programs, develop partnerships with schools
and non-profit organizations to promote environmental education, and volunteer
their expertise in environmental issues. WMX facilities also host open houses
and tours to educate community members and others interested about the
facilities and their environmental programs. During 1995, for example, nearly
100,000 people toured WMX facilities worldwide (see Table 4).
</P> 
<P>
The hundreds of thousands of people attending presentations by WMX people
include children reached by &quot;CYCLER&#168;<SUP>&#174;</SUP>&quot; a
remote-controlled robot in constant demand for school assemblies, trade shows,
science fairs, open houses and community hearings. It is estimated that since
the program began in 1991, CYCLER&reg; has performed before more than 2 million
people. In 1995, the Company published a musical compact disc of recycling songs
starring CYCLER&reg; featuring rock and roll, country/western and rap music
themes.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
In early 1996, WMX launched a five year, $250,000 Environmental Careers
Awareness Program with the United Negro College Fund. The program will provide
funds to five colleges and universities for curriculum development and
internships at WMX divisions.
</P>
<P>
Other environmental education programs included:
</P>
<UL><LI>Waste Management Argentina celebrated Earth Day '95 with a recycling
program in Rio IV, working with a municipal campaign to promote environmental
awareness. The Company installed special recycling containers and students
helped collect paper, glass and aluminum for recycling.</LI></UL>
<UL><LI> Germany held a nationwide recycling day to show what becomes of
materials collected through the &quot;Green Dot&quot; program for recycling.
Waste Management Deutschland facilities participating in the program welcomed
more than 15,000 visitors to their recycling facilities.</LI></UL>
<UL><LI> WMI plc is working with the International Chamber of Commerce and the
United Nations Environment Programme to develop Environmental Management
Training Kits for use by small- and medium-sized businesses in developing
countries. </LI></UL>
<UL><LI>WMI sponsors a program at 97 schools in the San Antonio, Texas area to
teach children about recycling by having them actively participate in recycling
milk cartons. WMI collects the cartons for recycling into printing and writing
materials.</LI></UL>
<UL><LI>In conjunction with the SOS Children's Village in Coconut Creek,
Florida, Wheelabrator designed and constructed an educational boardwalk with an
environmental theme on land adjacent to the Village.</LI></UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="00994d">Public Policy Development</FONT>

</P>
<P>
WMX promotes and supports public policy that is protective of the environment.
Company involvement in governmental policy is managed by the government affairs
programs of WMX, with staff in Washington, D.C., Oak Brook, Illinois, several
U.S. state capitals, London, Brussels and several European countries. WMX
companies also participate actively in business-environment groups that promote
sound environmental management and sustainable development, including the World
Business Council for Sustainable Development, the <A HREF="http://www.nwf.org/nwf/ccc/">National Wildlife Federation
Corporate Conservation Council</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.gemi.org">Global Environmental Management
Initiative.</A>
</P>
<P>
In Europe, WMI plc has sought to strengthen European Union standards for
landfill design and operation.  It has also participated actively in discussions
about implementation of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary
Movements of Hazardous Wastes.</P> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
In the U.S., WMX has focused on several important public policy initiatives
including reauthorization and reform  of Superfund to sustain its benefits in
cleaning up waste sites and to provide incentives for proper waste handling
while making cleanups faster, less expensive and more equitably implemented.
Another important focus was on promoting public-private partnerships to allow
mutually beneficial privatization of wastewater treatment plants and other
environmental facilities. In October, 1995 the U.S. EPA issued new emissions
standards for Municipal Waste Combustors. Wheelabrator cooperated closely with
the Agency over five years in evaluating international standards, control
technologies and emissions from existing facilities.</P>
<P>
WMX also contributed actively to EPA's development of a new enforcement policy
that encourages companies to establish and maintain comprehensive environmental
management programs. Through its participation in the pilot Environmental
Leadership Project, WMX is helping to design the final project, expected to be
proposed in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
Two WMX representatives participated as members of the National Environmental
Justice Advisory Council. The Council was convened by EPA to help EPA and other
federal agencies respond to President Clinton's Environmental Justice Executive
Order, develop strategic plans for each agency and work closely with community
activists to find practical solutions to specific incidents of environmental
inequity.
</P>
<P><A NAME="1"></A></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="00994d">Support for Environmental Organizations</FONT>
</P>
<P>
WMX works with environmental groups in a variety of ways, ranging from
cooperation on national policy development to hands-on work in the field. CWM
volunteers, for example, planted seedlings to restore a former landing strip at
the Louisiana Nature Conservancy's Little Pecan Island. 
</P>
<P>
WMX also provides financial support to environmental organizations through
several programs. WMX and its  operating groups made grants and charitable
contributions to environmental organizations totaling more than 1 million
dollars in 1995 (see Table 5). Among these gifts was a three-year pledge of
$75,000 by Wheelabrator's Bridgeport, Connecticut plant to fund a series of
interactive exhibits at the Children's Garbage Museum and Education Center of
Southwest Connecticut, housed at a regional recycling center.  <A HREF="95grants.htm"> Press here for more information on WMX environmental grants.</A></P> 
<P>
WMX matches cash gifts from employees in all operating groups on a two-to-one
basis for environmental groups (higher education institutions also receive the
two-to-one match; most other charities are eligible for a one-to-one matching
gift). The Company also contributes a cash match for employees who volunteer
their time to non-profit organizations (the ServiceMatch program).
</P>
<P>
The WMX corporate campus participates in Earth Share, a combined giving campaign
that provides employees a convenient way to donate to environmental groups.

<H2>1994 Annual Environmental Report</H2>

<HR SIZE=5>
<H3><B><CENTER>
This Report
</H3></B></CENTER>

This 1994 Annual Environmental Report honors the commitment made five
years ago by the WMX Board of Directors to describe the Company's
environmental activities, evaluate implementation of the Company's
Environmental Policy and make the findings public each year.  A report
providing additional detail is available on request.  The contents of
this report were compiled under the direction of the WMX Executive
Environmental Committee and were reviewed and approved by the Board of
Directors.

<P>

The report encompasses WMX corporate activities and operations of
subsidiaries worldwide.  We invite your comments, feedback and
questions.  Send mail to wmx@va.pubnix.com, use our
<A HREF="commnt95.htm">Web comment form</A>,
or call our toll-free number at 1-800-4WMXNEWS. To encourage your
response, we will provide a donation to Earth Share, a coalition of 43
environmental organizations, for each reply received.

<H3><B><CENTER>
Progress Reports
</H3></B></CENTER>

The report is divided into four main sections, each of which covers
the three or four principles of the Environmental Policy listed.  Each
section begins with a "progress report" summarizing major programs and
their implementation status in the WMX family of companies.  The
symbols indicating implementation status were assigned based on
information submitted by the operating groups regarding their
implementation of the Environmental Policy.  A star indicates that
substantial progress was made in 1994.  The number in parentheses
refers to the principle(s) of the WMX Environmental Policy that the
program supports.  Some programs were developed by operating groups
for their use only and some programs are simply not applicable to all
operating groups.  The absence of particular programs for a group or
limited implementation within the group should be considered with
these points in mind.  We believe that the value of providing more
specific information on programs outweighs constraints on
comparability between groups.

Craig Pond, in Barnwell, South Carolina, is one of only two remaining
undisturbed savannah-type Carolina Bays in the state and home to
several rare plant and animal species.  The pond is located on the
property of WMX's Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc. (CNSI).  In early 1995,
CNSI provided permanent protection for the pond by donating a
conservation easement on 264 acres of land to the South Carolina
Heritage Trust.  CNSI will preserve the pond in a natural state and
continue to use it for educational programs.  More than 700 students
have participated in programs at Craig Pond.

<H2>1994 Annual Environmental Report</H2>

This Report
</H3></B></CENTER>

This 1994 Annual Environmental Report honors the commitment made five
years ago by the WMX Board of Directors to describe the Company's
environmental activities, evaluate implementation of the Company's
Environmental Policy and make the findings public each year.  A report
providing additional detail is available on request.  The contents of
this report were compiled under the direction of the WMX Executive
Environmental Committee and were reviewed and approved by the Board of
Directors.

<P>

The report encompasses WMX corporate activities and operations of
subsidiaries worldwide.  We invite your comments, feedback and
questions.  Send mail to wmx@va.pubnix.com, use our
<A HREF="commnt95.htm">Web comment form</A>,
or call our toll-free number at 1-800-4WMXNEWS. To encourage your
response, we will provide a donation to Earth Share, a coalition of 43
environmental organizations, for each reply received.

<H3><B><CENTER>
Progress Reports
</H3></B></CENTER>

The report is divided into four main sections, each of which covers
the three or four principles of the Environmental Policy listed.  Each
section begins with a "progress report" summarizing major programs and
their implementation status in the WMX family of companies.  The
symbols indicating implementation status were assigned based on
information submitted by the operating groups regarding their
implementation of the Environmental Policy.  A star indicates that
substantial progress was made in 1994.  The number in parentheses
refers to the principle(s) of the WMX Environmental Policy that the
program supports.  Some programs were developed by operating groups
for their use only and some programs are simply not applicable to all
operating groups.  The absence of particular programs for a group or
limited implementation within the group should be considered with
these points in mind.  We believe that the value of providing more
specific information on programs outweighs constraints on
comparability between groups.

Craig Pond, in Barnwell, South Carolina, is one of only two remaining
undisturbed savannah-type Carolina Bays in the state and home to
several rare plant and animal species.  The pond is located on the
property of WMX's Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc. (CNSI).  In early 1995,
CNSI provided permanent protection for the pond by donating a
conservation easement on 264 acres of land to the South Carolina
Heritage Trust.  CNSI will preserve the pond in a natural state and
continue to use it for educational programs.  More than 700 students
have participated in programs at Craig Pond.

companies use several tools to assess  compliance with environmental
requirements, including daily inspections by operations personnel, annual 
facility self-audits, monthly management reviews and periodic corporate  audits.
The goal of these programs is identification of all compliance issues by the
Company -  preferably by the immediate management of the facility. Figure 2
shows that  most compliance issues in 1995 were identified by facility
management,  and the percentage of facility-identified issues has increased over

<P>Environmental monitoring measures success at preventing releases. WMX
facilities have monitoring programs tailored to their operations. In North
America, all WMI and CWM environmental monitoring   including leachates, surface
water, groundwater, stormwater and air   is coordinated through the WMX
Environmental Monitoring Laboratory (EML) in Geneva, Illinois. In 1995, EML
performed approximately 1.4 million tests on samples from 7,500 monitoring
locations at WMX facilities.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>EML was ranked the number one monitoring laboratory in the U.S.
by Analytical Standards, Inc., an independent testing organization, for the
second quarter of 1995. More than 250 of the nation's top environmental
laboratories have participated in double-blind studies administered by the
organization, which are used by the laboratories to evaluate their own
performance. EML's score of 98.59 out of 100 compared to an average for
participating laboratories of 86.71.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Because of the highly prescriptive regulations governing
hazardous waste  management services, Chemical Waste Management (CWM) also uses
standard division practices - formal  procedures that spell out exactly how
compliance- related tasks are to be done and what training is required.  </P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="00994d"><B>PACT: Corrective Action</B></FONT> WMX
developed and implemented the Compliance Action Reporting System (CARS) to
ensure that compliance issues are promptly rectified. CARS is a software tool
that tracks issues and the steps scheduled to resolve them. CARS also provides
management with information on the status of corrective and preventive actions
and helps to identify common or recurring issues. More than 850 WMX facilities
in the U.S. and Canada have tracked compliance issues in CARS. WMI plc waste
handling facilities use an analogous system to track outstanding issues. </P>
<P>Some of the key indicators tracked by CARS are the percent of issues
self-identified (Figure 2), the percent of issues resolved on schedule (Figure
4), and the number of agency actions (includes administrative complaints or
citations, administrative orders, administrative notices of violation,
administrative warning letters, civil actions and regulatory inspection issues).
Company-wide, the number of agency-identified issues declined 8 percent in 1995
compared to 1994.</P> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="00994d"><B>PACT: Training </B></FONT>
Training is a key part of WMX environmental management systems. During 1995,
nearly 70 percent of WMX operating employees received environmental training.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The WMX Leadership Development Department works with the
operating groups to identify training needs and develop and deliver courses. A
recent focus has been on providing division compliance coordinators and
front-line operations personnel with the environmental awareness training and
specific knowledge and skills needed to maintain environmental, health and
safety compliance.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P> For example, for Wheelabrator, the Leadership Development
Department developed an environmental awareness video and modified existing
courses to emphasize a broad environmental media approach to compliance. WMX
also offers &quot;Landfill University&quot; and &quot;Material Recovery Facility
University&quot;  to train managers in the wide variety of responsibilities of
managing these facilities.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="00994d"><B>Compliance Performance</B></FONT>
 The compliance indicators outlined above show generally favorable results:
audit scores are trending upwards and the percent of compliance issues
identified by facility management has increased steadily in most of the
operating groups.</P>
<P>In 1995, WMX companies paid a total of $785,612 in penalties for 29
environmental matters and three environmentally related transportation matters
(e.g., labeling of truck contents). This is less than the amount paid in 1994
and an improvement over previous years' levels (See Figure 5). Forty-five
percent of the total related to a penalty paid for alleged violations by a
company six years ago, before it was acquired by WMX.   <A HREF="pen.htm">Press here for a description of all issues giving rise to penalties of  more than $10,000. </A>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="00994d"><B>Recycling</B></FONT>  1995
was a record-breaking year in recycling. WMX companies and joint venture
partners worldwide collected, processed and sold more than eight million tons of
recyclable materials.</P>
<P>In the U.S., WMI acquired two companies   Resource Recycling Technologies,
Inc. and New England CRInc   which operate 23 material recovery facilities with
capacity to process 825,000 tons of recyclables each year. Along with new plant
construction, this brought the company's North American network of material
recovery facilities to 172 (see Figure 8). These facilities processed 3,471,000
tons of materials in 1995, 73 percent more than in 1994. Revenues from recycling
increased 72 percent. Wheelabrator's trash-to-energy plants recovered an
additional 179,000 tons of ferrous metals and its Falls Township MRF processed
about 30,000 tons of recyclables (see Figure 9).
</P>
<P>Internationally, the amount of recyclable materials handled and the number
of material recycling facilities (MRFs) operated both increased by 50 percent
during 1995 (see Figures 10 and 8). WMI handled nearly 4.5 million tons of
materials   the majority of which was paper   through its recycling marketing
partnerships for paper, glass, aluminum and steel (see Figure 11).
<BR><BR><BR></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>In December, 1995 WMI began operating four MRFs serving 750,000
households in Chicago, Illinois. WMI built the MRF's under contract to the City.</P>
<P>Recyclable materials are collected by city sanitation crews in special blue
bags along with household refuse. The  blue bag  system allowed the City to
avoid the expense of an entirely new fleet of collection trucks and work force.
The MRFs were designed to accommodate the blue bag approach and incorporate a
number of advanced features. Despite some initial skepticism about the approach,
in January 1996, the first full month of operation, 8.9 percent of incoming
waste at the processing centers was diverted from disposal. This compares
favorably to other U.S. cities and is well on the way to the 1996 goal of 14.6
percent diversion.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>In Europe and the U.S., WMX companies have developed
partnerships to recycle electronic equipment. WMI plc is working with R. Frazier
Europe and the Dutch Ministry of the Environment on a program to collect,
separate and dismantle reusable computer equipment. The first shipment of
components was sent to China in January. In the UK, WMI plc teamed with R.
Frazier Ltd. to collect, process and remanufacture redundant computers and
telecommunications equipment. Almost 90 percent of the original materials are
retained for use in other items. A similar program began in the U.S. when Sears,
a national account customer, contacted WMI with a problem - how to handle
outmoded cash registers and computer telecommunications equipment at 800 retail
outlets. Rather than offer to dispose of them, WMI teamed with R. Frazier to
develop a program to quickly pick up thousands of pieces of redundant equipment
and find buyers for the equipment or its components. The program generated
revenue for Sears rather than a cost for disposal.</P> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Composting of yard wastes, food wastes and other organic
materials continues to increase. In Sweden, for example, WMI plc expanded a
program with the supermarket chain Grona Konsum to 12 stores. At the pilot
store, recycling and composting of organic  wastes reduced the weekly number of
bags of waste going to the landfill from 70 to one.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>In Indiana, WMI's Blackfoot Recycling and Disposal Facility
operates the only commercial composting site in the state. The facility accepts
about 2,000 tons of compostable materials per month including biosolids, wood
processing and paper manufacturing wastes to produce a high-quality soil
amendment. A second compost operation uses biosolids, kiln dust and lime to
produce a compost useful for reclaiming strip mined areas. The Blackfoot
facility itself is located on land that was previously strip mined. Using the
compost product, Blackfoot managers have reclaimed 800 acres of the strip mined
area.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="00994d"><B> Treatment and Disposal</B></FONT>
 WMI plc's two facilities in Hong Kong won recognition in 1995. Enviropace Ltd.,
WMI plc's joint venture partner, won the 1995 Hong Kong Award for the Industry -
Environmental Performance. Formerly called the Governor's Award for the
Environment, it recognized environmental excellence at the Hong Kong Chemical
Waste Treatment Centre built by Enviropace to handle the hazardous wastes from
Hong Kong's 10,000 small waste generators. </P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The South East New Territories landfill construction project
received the WMX  President's Award for Technical Excellence for the quality of
its construction, the outstanding safety record of the project and its creative
approach to construction challenges. The landfill is now operational and
processes up to 13,000 tons per day of waste diverted from unlined landfills in
the area.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Two WMI landfills won the Solid Waste Association of North
America's 1995 Landfill Excellence Awards. The Venice Park Recycling and
Disposal Facility in Lennon, Michigan won the Gold Award and the Mallard Ridge
Recycling and Disposal facility in Delavan, Wisconsin won the Silver Award. The
Venice Park facility has advanced liner and cover systems, a 1.5-megawatt
landfill gas plant, and an end-use plan that provides for a wildlife nature
park, ski and toboggan slopes, a tree farm, and a greenhouse powered by landfill
gas. The Mallard Ridge facility has a unique program for restoring
environmentally sensitive habitats on its property, including prairie and
wetland areas, and protecting threatened species.</P>

<H2>Letter from the Chairman</H2>

<HR SIZE=5><CENTER><IMG SRC="../art/construction.gif"></CENTER><HR SIZE=5>
<P>
To the Reader:
<P>
On March 7, 1990, our Board of Directors adopted a comprehensive
and ambitious environmental policy for our company and all of
its operations worldwide. With the passage of five years, it now
seems appropriate to take stock of the steps we have taken to
implement our Policy and its 14 Principles.
<P>
First, we have developed programs to support specific Principles.
Under our energy Principle, for example, WMX is testing refuse
collection trucks that run on alternative fuels, including landfill
gas. We joined EPA's voluntary Green Lights program to upgrade
our lighting systems to reduce energy use and air pollution. Under
our Principle of "no net loss of wetlands or other biodiversity
on company properties," we are demonstrating a unique approach
to protecting, and frequently restoring, natural ecosystems at
waste facility properties. This WMX Annual Environmental Report
outlines programs implementing each of the Principles of the Policy
in 1994.
<P>
Second, we are integrating the Environmental Policy into key business
processes. All of our top managers with line responsibility, including
myself, are evaluated for our performance in implementing the
Policy. During 1994, each of our business units began reporting
on additional performance measures under the Policy. This report
includes, for the first time, information based on these measures,
such as a summary of our impacts on wetlands. As we continue to
refine them, we will report on additional measures in the future.
<P>
Similarly, in the compliance area, we have placed considerable
importance and resources on programs that provide our front-line
managers with the tools and incentives to prevent, detect and
correct environmental compliance issues, and that hold these managers
directly accountable for compliance. In 1995 we are expanding
these systems for compliance planning, measurement and evaluation
to include the entire environmental policy. One step in this direction
is a joint project of WMX and the Oregon Department of Environmental
Quality which was selected by the U.S. EPA as an "Environmental
Leadership Project." The project's purpose is to demonstrate
our environmental compliance and excellence programs and innovative
approaches to agency enforcement.
<P>
Third, we emphasize that implementing the environmental policy
is the responsibility of all employees. We have trained employees
and conducted awareness campaigns. In 1994, for example, I presented
the first Chairman's' Award for Environmental Excellence, an award
specifically developed to recognize outstanding employee initiatives
in upholding Policy.
<P>
These steps represent important progress, but we recognize that
more remains to be done. Successful programs must spread even
further throughout our family of companies and we must continually
reexamine and refine our approaches. We will know we have really
achieved success when we have moved from managing programs to
having our Environmental Principles the foundation for our environmental
culture. In this report, we present for the first time "progress
reports" that summarize the extent of our efforts to implement
various programs under our Environmental Policy at our corporate
offices and major subsidiaries. We think they help to show the
many outstanding programs we have developed to fulfill our pledge
and also areas where we need to place more emphasis. I hope you
find this report helpful and invite your comments on it.
<P>
Dean L. Buntrock<BR>
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer

Environmental Management and Compliance
</H3></B></CENTER>

WMX's organizational structure includes environmental experts
in all operating groups. Management has emphasized that all employees
are responsible for upholding and implementing the Company's Environmental
Policy. Incentives for managers reinforce this philosophy. The
compensation of WMX's chief executive officer and president, the
presidents of each principal operating group and all general managers
depends in part on the environmental performance of units for
which they are responsible.

<P>
WMX has developed detailed environmental policies, directives and
guidance and compliance programs built on the "Prevent, Assess,
Correct and Train" (PACT) framework discussed below. WMX's emphasis on
providing managers with sophisticated systems to prevent environmental
compliance issues is, we believe, unique among U.S. companies.

<P>
To provide an independent assessment of the Company's environmental
policies and management systems, WMX retained Arthur D. Little,
Inc. to review programs in place during 1994 at WMX and its principal
operating subsidiaries. The firm concluded:

<P>
<I><BLOCKQUOTE>
"In our opinion, WMX Technologies, Inc.'s corporate and
subsidiary environmental management systems place it among the
leaders of industry as a whole with regard to corporate environmental
management."

<P>
<B>PACT: PREVENTION</B><P>

<IMG SRC="../art/report/barfig1.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 ALT="[FIGURE 1: CMS: Total Installations]">

The cornerstone of WMX preventive compliance programs is the
Compliance Management System (CMS), installed at 534 WMX divisions,
including all WMI landfills, hauling companies and material recovery
facilities and all major CWM facilities (see Figure 1). CMS is a
personal computer software tool that translates into discrete tasks
all environmental requirements in legislation, regulations, permits or
Company policies that apply to a particular facility. CMS allows
managers to schedule tasks, assign them to facility staff and track
their completion. WMI plc uses an analogous COMPASS program, while WTI
facilities have an Obligations Management System available for their
use.

<P>
Because of the highly prescriptive regulations governing hazardous
waste management services, CWM also uses standard division practices
-- formal procedures that spell out exactly how compliance-related
tasks are to be done and what training is required.

<P>
Even more fundamental than providing compliance tools is appointing
and training front-line compliance managers. A key WMI initiative in
this area was the appointment and training of Division Compliance
Coordinators (DCCs) at all WMI divisions (in addition to environmental
experts previously assigned). More than 550 people were trained in
regulatory requirements, Company policies and the use of CMS.  Several
groups also developed DCC certification programs which include
testing.

<P>
Similarly, WMI plc assigned an environmental compliance coordinator to
each waste handling facility. Within WTI, field environmental
compliance directors were appointed for all business units, based at
facilities or regionally, depending on the scope of the operations
covered.

<IMG SRC="../art/report/barfig3.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 ALT="[FIGURE 3: Number of Environmental Audits]">

<P>
WMX uses several approaches to assess compliance with environmental
requirements. Ideally, all compliance issues should be identified and
addressed by facility management. Figure 2 shows that most compliance
issues in 1994 were identified by facility management and the
percentage of facility-identified issues has increased.

<P>
The WMX Environmental Audit Department audits WMI, CWM and Rust
operations. During 1994, the Department continued to report to the
Vice President for Law and Compliance to ensure independence from the
audited groups. The Department also reports on programs and
performance to the Audit Committee of the WMX Board of Directors,
composed of outside directors. In early 1994, the Department
established auditing standards applicable to all WMX business groups.

<P>
During 1994, the Environmental Audit Department conducted 120 audits,
while the WTI audit program did 20 audits and six legal reviews (see
Figure 3). WMI audit scores are found in table 1.  WMI plc uses its
COVER program to generate audit and inspection checklists and audit
reports. During 1994, 67 COVER audits were completed, representing 82
percent of facilities.

<P>
WMX also monitors emissions from its facilities which might impact the
environment. All land disposal facilities have well-established
groundwater monitoring programs, and water from facility monitoring
wells is evaluated periodically in the WMX Environmental Monitoring
Laboratories in Geneva, Illinois.

<B>PACT: CORRECTIVE ACTION</B><P>

<IMG SRC="../art/report/barfig4.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 ALT="[FIGURE 4: Compliance Issues--Percent Resolved on Schedule]">

WMX developed and implemented the Compliance Action Reporting System
(CARS) to ensure that compliance issues are promptly rectified.  CARS,
and the analogous COVER program of WMI plc, are software tools that
track issues and the steps scheduled to resolve them.  CARS also
provides management with information on the status of corrective and
preventive actions. More than 850 WMX facilities in the U.S. and
Canada have tracked compliance issues in CARS.  COVER is used to track
the outstanding issues at all WMI plc waste handling facilities.

<P>
Some of the key indicators tracked by CARS are the percent of issues
self-identified (Figure 2), the percent of issues resolved on schedule
(Figure 4) and the number of agency actions. For both WMI and CWM, the
number of agency actions increased in 1994, 43 percent and 20 percent,
respectively (see discussion below). For WTI and WMI plc, agency
actions decreased 61 percent and 56 percent respectively.

<A NAME="1.4">
<P>
<B>PACT: TRAINING</B><P>

Recurring issues identified by CARS and other mechanisms become the
basis for focusing the training program on areas most in need of
improvement. WMX has developed a "compliance curriculum" available to
all facilities that covers the requirements of various regulatory
programs. WMX also offers "Landfill University" and "Material Recovery
Facility University" to train managers in the wide variety of
responsibilities of managing these facilities.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<A NAME="1.5">
<P>
<B>COMPLIANCE PERFORMANCE</B><P>

The compliance indicators outlined above show generally improving
trends:

<UL>
<LI>WMI audit scores are improving, especially for hauling companies.

<P><LI>The emphasis on self-identification of compliance issues
appears to be working, with improvements in all groups and a
significant increase in CWM's rate of issue self-identification.

<P><LI>There is steady progress in the rate of issues resolved on
schedule.
</UL>

<P>
However, CWM and WMI were subject to more agency actions than in 1993,
which is reflected in a higher percentage of externally identified
issues for WMI. This appears to be based on better internal reporting
by facilities of less formal agency actions and increased inspections
by regulatory agencies.

<P>
In 1994, WMX companies paid a total of $896,815 in penalties for 65
environmental matters and 10 environmentally related transportation
matters (e.g., labeling of truck contents). This is less than was paid
in 1993 and an improvement over previous years' levels (See Figure
5). We will continue working vigorously to reduce them further. A
description of all issues giving rise to penalties of more than
$10,000 is included in the more detailed Environmental Report.

Health and Safety Programs
</H3></B></CENTER>

WMX facilities have comprehensive policies, procedures and programs to
identify and reduce health and safety risks. In addition, each
facility is required to maintain a comprehensive plan for response to
emergencies. Major initiatives in 1994 included:

<UL>
	<LI>WMI completed a comprehensive update of its Safety and
Health Program, including development of a new Safety and Health
Program Manual. Tasks identified in the manual were provided for use
in CMS.

	<P><LI>CWM continued progress in its Process Safety Management
program.


	<P><LI>WMI provided each of its facilities with videos and
training guides for "Employee Right To Know," "Smith System Defensive
Driving," and the "Keys To Safe Driving"-- the latter two programs
customized for the particular challenges of driving a refuse truck.
 

	<P><LI>WMI plc developed its Safety Management System during
1994. The system provides consistent measurements of health and safety
performance and implements the Company's safety policy.


	<P><LI>WTI developed a crisis management manual, distributed
it to all plants and provided corresponding training to regional
offices.
</UL>

<P>
Each WMX subsidiary collects and reports performance measurements
to senior management and reports safety statistics as required
to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Figures
6 and 7 indicate that performance of WMX companies has been consistently
better than industry averages and has generally improved over
the past several years.

WMX provides employees with a confidential hotline to address
workplace issues that have not been resolved by local management.
More than 1,000 calls were received on the HelpLine in 1994. Only
12 of these involved an environmental issue, and none involved
major issues or environmental releases. All callers were informed

</CENTER>

<P>
WMX companies generate wastes in the course of providing environmental
services. Most locations recycle at least some portion of wastes
generated.

<P>
Eighteen CWM facilities (including all landfills, stabilization
treatment plants and transfer facilities) reduced their rate of
hazardous waste generation by 71 percent compared to 1993 (see
Figure 8). The rate for CWM facilities companywide, including
incinerators and resource recovery facilities, was tracked beginning
in 1994. This rate was 151 pounds of hazardous waste generated
per ton of waste managed, reflecting the ash produced at hazardous
waste incinerators.

<P>
Only three WMX facilities are manufacturers required to report
under the SARA Title III Toxic Release Inventory (see Table 2).
Overall emissions from WMX facilities increased during 1993 primarily
because of increased production at the Demopolis, Alabama facility
which builds waste containers. Johnson Screens recycled 30 percent
less scrap because of lower production but also reduced hazardous
waste generation by 58 percent by switching to nonhazardous solvents
and improving management of solvent waste.

Remediation and pollution prevention projects in 1994 included:

<UL>
	<LI>Rust continues to help the federal government clean up
military and nuclear weapons facilities throughout the U.S. It is a
member of the Lockheed Idaho Technologies Company that won a contract
in 1994 to manage and operate the 890-square-mile Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory and is managing all waste management and
environmental restoration programs. Rust also carried out remedial
investigation and design projects at more than a dozen military
installations under several long-term environmental services
contracts.

	<P><LI>WMI plc completed three remediation projects at oil
refineries -- the first environmental cleanups ever undertaken in
Singapore.

	<P><LI>Through its engineering and construction business, Rust
focuses on minimizing emissions from industrial facilities. One such
example during 1994 was Rust's design of an expansion for a chemical
plant which will cut vinyl chloride emissions by more than 90 percent
while increasing production efficiency and doubling plant capacity.

Wheelabrator continues to provide services to manage water, wastewater
and biosolids in the United State.  In partnership with Compania
Mexicana de Aguas, S.A. de C.V. (CMA), Wheelabrator is managing the
Lecheria Wastewater Treatment Plant in the Metropolitan Area of Mexico
City. Rust is providing continuous engineering for the facility. The
project reclaims and treats wastewater, then markets the clean water
to industries and businesses in the Northern Area of Mexico City,
increasing the availability of potable water for domestic use.

<P>
<B>RECYCLING</B><P>
1994 was a banner year for recycling. By year-end, WMX companies
operated 165 material recovery facilities worldwide (see Figure
9). The number of recycling customers continued to climb (see
Figure 10).

<P>
WMI handled more than 4.1 million tons of materials through its
recycling marketing partnerships (see Figure 11). Its Container
Recycling Alliance broke ground for a new 100,000-ton-per-year
glass processing facility in Franklin, Massachusetts.

<P>
Some of the innovative recycling projects pursued included:

<UL>
	<LI>WMI plc and a leading Swedish supermarket chain introduced
a pilot waste sorting program which resulted in 97 percent of the
waste generated by the supermarket being recycled.<BR>


	<P><LI>WMI and the Nova Group, Inc. formed a partnership to
create the Green Hanger Program, a convenient and cost effective way
for clothing retailers to recycle plastics. The program recycles
plastic hangers, garment bags and pallet wrap, which typically account
for 25 to 40 percent of the waste stream of a clothing retailer after
cardboard recycling.

	<P><LI>In 1994, Rust provided engineering and construction
services for five paper recycling facilities -- continuing to lead the
industry.  Its experience includes designing or building facilities
providing 63 percent of the mixed office waste paper deinking capacity
in the U.S.
</UL>

<P>
Recycling also began to fulfill its promise as a way to spur economic
development. In addition to the Davis Street Station project (see
profile), WMI is developing a partnership with GRIDCORE in Long Beach
in one of California's Recycling Market Development Zones.  WMI is
providing promotion assistance and supplying a steady stream of raw
materials to GRIDCORE, which recycles paper into a strong replacement
for fiberboard or plywood. Another facility in the zone is providing a
market for plastics.

<B>TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL</B><P>
Enviropace, the chemical waste treatment plant built by a WMI plc
partnership and operated on behalf of the Hong Kong Government,
completed its first full year of operation in mid-1994. The facility
has reached its boilerplate capacity and is now processing 100,000
metric tons of waste annually from Hong Kong's 10,000 small hazardous
waste generators. Also in Hong Kong, a WMX joint venture, Green Valley
Limited, received the first shipments of waste at the South-East New
Territories Landfill in Tseung Kwan O, part of a network of new
environmental management facilities planned by the government to meet
Hong Kong's environmental infrastructure needs.

<P>
In May, Indonesia's President Soeharto officially opened the country's
first hazardous waste treatment center, designed and built by
WMI plc and owned jointly with PT. Bimantara Citra and the Indonesian
Government. The facility began receiving waste in January and
includes a secure landfill, a stabilization unit and a synthetic
fuels blending unit.

<P>
In Scotland, WMI plc officially opened the refurbished hazardous
liquid waste treatment plant at Twecher. The plant is Scotland's
first integrated facility for industrial wastes generated by the
engineering, electronics, pharmaceutical and chemical industries.

Where can you recycle a pair of Levis, an old mattress, carpet padding
and a toilet?  At WMX's Davis Street Station for Material Recycling
and Transfer (SMaRT) in Oakland, California.  Located at California's
largest transfer station, the SMaRT center offers buyback and dropoff
recycling services for an extensive and exotic list of items,
totalling more than 54,000 tons in 1994.  In addition, a Salvation
Army donation trailer at the center recovered more than 220 tons of
reusable items. The center also pioneered a service agreement with
Appliance Recycling Centers of America.  WMI's commitment to provide
thousands of used appliances allowed the company to locate a new plant
in Oakland that will employ 29 technicians when it reaches full
capacity.

<P>
With support from the Alameda County Waste Management Authority, SMaRT
is developing an education center with displays on recycling and
integrated waste management.  And, to round out the year in recycling,
SMaRT managed the demolition of one of its own buildings, a
Depression-era structure.  More than 60 percent of the material was
recycled, including 37 truckloads of concrete and masonry and 11 loads
of steel.

<IMG SRC="../art/report/barfig12.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 ALT="[FIGURE 12: Acres of Wetlands Affected 1994]">

WMX has made a unique commitment to "no net loss of wetlands or other
biodiversity" on its properties.  No models for pursuing such a
commitment on private lands existed, so WMI and Rust developed a
systematic approach embodied in a detailed guidance manual for
biodiversity planning at Company facilities.  About 50 sites were
identified for preparation of inventories and plans before major new
construction or expansion.  Plans have been completed for four WMI
sites (including 
<A HREF="conserving-work.html">Mallard Ridge</A>); another five are in
process.  Six sites are undergoing a less formal planning process.

<P>
Results demonstrate the value of the WMX approach for voluntary
conservation of biological resources: the studies found
opportunities to conserve, and in some cases, restore, biological resources while allowing economic activity to proceed.
 For example, at the Cedar Hollow Recycling and Disposal Facility
(RDF) in Owensville, Missouri, the biodiversity study found a stand of
relatively rare transitional cedar forest that would have been cleared
for landfill expansion since it was not legally protected.  Under the
biodiversity management plan, facility managers will clear a more
common forest type, excavate soil to create the shallow soil
conditions favored by the cedars and replant trees removed from the
expansion area.  The excavated soil will be used to meet the site's
need for additional soil cover in a cost-effective way.

<P>
During 1994, WMX companies met their goal of "no net loss" of
wetlands, creating or restoring 2.4 acres of wetlands for each acre
filled (see Figure 12).  At the largest wetlands project at Outer Loop
RDF in Louisville, Kentucky, construction of a landfill resulted in
the filling of 75.8 acres of wetlands.  To mitigate the fill, WMI
consultants restored 290 farmed acres of former wetlands by recreating
wetland hydrology, building three ponds and planting 140,000
bottomland hardwood trees.

<P>
Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc. (CNSI) in Barnwell, South Carolina donated
conservation easement to the South Carolina Heritage Trust program in
early 1995 to protect a 264-acre property that includes rare wetlands.
The area covered by the easement, which legally prevents present and
future owners from developing the property, includes one of only two
remaining undisturbed savannah-type Carolina Bays in the state.  CNSI
has also worked with schools throughout the state to create
educational programs using Craig Pond.  More than 700 students have
participated.
 
<P>
In 1990, WMI pledged to plant one million trees by the year 2000.  To
date, WMI divisions have planted or sponsored the planting of more
than 761,000 trees.

Buying Recycled Products
</H3></B></CENTER>

In 1994, WMX's Purchasing Department spent $114 million on goods
containing recycled material, including steel in trucks and roll-off
containers, plastic in recycling and trash containers and office
paper.  The total spent on goods containing recycled material
was less than in 1993.  However, the percent of the capital budget
for containers and vehicles (which accounts for most of the recycled
content purchases) spent on products containing recycled material
increased (see Figure 13).  More than 98 percent of the paper
purchased centrally by WMX had recycled content.

<IMG SRC="../art/report/barfig14.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 ALT="[FIGURE 14: Energy Generation]">

WMX companies produce power from various unconventional fuels.
Facilities in North America, Sweden and the United Kingdom have a
combined capacity of 990 megawatts.  In 1994, these facilities
generated 5.8 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity (see Figure 14)
and over one million Btus in gas sales.

<A NAME="3.1">
<P>
<B>LANDFILL GAS TO ENERGY</B><P>
WMX companies worldwide operate 34 landfill gas-to-energy plants
-- more than any other company.  In addition, six facilities in
the United States process landfill gas and sell it as a medium-Btu
fuel to industries as a replacement for natural gas, coal or oil.
 
<A NAME="3.2">
<P>
<B>TRASH TO ENERGY AND SMALL POWER PRODUCTION</B><P>
In 1994, Wheelabrator Environmental Systems' 15 trash-to-energy plants
in the United States processed 7.2 million tons of trash, generating
3.8 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.  During 1994, Wheelabrator
opened a new 53-megawatt plant in Falls Township, Pennsylvania.  The
facility is the first privately initiated project in the solid waste
industry to provide both full-scale recycling, through a material
recovery facility and the recovery of energy on the same site.

<P>
WMI plc runs one of the only privately operated trash-to-energy
facilities outside North America.  The facility, in Hamm, Germany,
was upgraded in 1994 to meet, and, for certain parameters, operate
well below stringent emission limits scheduled to take effect
in 1996.

<P>
Wheelabrator operates six small power facilities with a total
installed capacity of 183 megawatts.  In 1994, the Ridge Generating
Station began operations in Polk County, Florida, the first power
plant in the country fueled by wood waste, scrap tires and landfill
gas.

<A NAME="3.3">
<P>
<B>ALTERNATIVE FUELS</B><P>
Waste Management is testing alternative fuels -- including landfill
gas -- for its fleet of nearly 19,000 collection vehicles and heavy
equipment.  In Buenos Aires, 65 light-duty trucks run on natural gas,
and demonstration and pilot projects are under way involving 25
collection trucks in the United States.

<UL>
	<LI> In a truly closed loop process, WMI has contracted with
ECOGAS of Austin, Texas to build, install and operate a demonstration
plant which will produce liquid natural gas and compressed natural gas
from methane gas generated at company landfills.  This waste-derived
fuel will initially power four solid waste collection vehicles, two of
which are currently running on natural gas.

	<P><LI>Waste Management of Orange County has been awarded a grant
from the South Coast Air Quality Management District to demonstrate
the use of natural gas engines in heavy duty solid waste collection
trucks.  By July 1996, the fleet of 14 trucks serving Mission Viejo,
California will be converted to natural gas engines and to compressed
natural gas fueling systems.

<B>ENERGY-EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION</B><P>

CWM's fleet fuel economy continues to improve (see Figure 15).  WMI
developed the WMS system, which uses compact, maneuverable, collection
vehicles, exchangeable containers and long-distance "transporters" to
collect and move trash.  The system is about 40 percent more fuel
efficient than conventional equipment.  About 350 WMS units are in use
in the United States, Sweden and the Netherlands.

<P>
In Seattle, WMI operates the nation's first containerized rail-haul
system, shipping the city's trash to WMI's Columbia Ridge Landfill in
Oregon.  Rail-haul is more fuel-efficient and generates significantly
less air pollution than truck transportation.

As a partner in the U.S. EPA's Green Lights program, WMX has completed
surveys of 11 corporate and group office headquarters.  Green Lights
has been implemented at Rust's Geotech facility in Grand Junction,
Colorado, saving more than 28,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per
year.  Wheelabrator Technologies' corporate office in Hampton, New
Hampshire reduced its lighting load by more than 55 percent in 1994 by
converting to high-efficiency equipment.

<H2>Restoring Prairie During Landfill</H2>
<HR SIZE=5>

<IMG SRC="../art/report/landfill.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 ALT="[IMAGE: WMI's Mallard Ridge Recycling and Disposal Facility in Delevan, Wisconsin]">

The largest prairie restoration ever attempted in the State of
Wisconsin is under way at WMI's Mallard Ridge Recycling and Disposal
Facility in Delevan.  More than 450 acres are being restored to native
plant communities to create habitat for three threatened species.

<P>
When WMI sought to expand the landfill in 1988, studies revealed
the presence of wetlands, three state-protected reptiles  -- the
Blanding Turtle, the Queen Snake and the Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake
-- and unusual plant communities, including 166 acres of oak savannas
and three acres of calcareous fens and southern sedge meadow.


<P>
Rust consultants, working with the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources, developed an extensive Ecological Restoration
and Enhancement plan that calls for enhancing the savannas and
fens, restoring prairie species on land previously used for farming
and mining and establishing native grasses.  The plan also enhances
wetlands for turtle habitat, monitors migration patterns and provides
protection for the animals and their nesting sites during construction.

<P>
Landfill construction has proceeded without harm to the turtles and
snakes.  In fact, the restoration activities are increasing
biodiversity by improving the extent and diversity of native habitat
areas on the property.  This project won a WMX Chairman's Award for
Environmental Excellence.

Remediation at WMX Facilities
</H3></B></CENTER>

<IMG SRC="../art/report/pie16.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 ALT="[FIGURE 16: Superfund Sites Where WMX is a Potentially Responsible Party]">

Most non-permitted releases for which WMX subsidiaries have some
responsibility have occurred at land disposal facilities in the United
States. Virtually all of these have occurred at older facilities
acquired from other companies, or at facilities not owned by WMX but
to which WMX or its predecessors lawfully transported waste.  In
general, environmental considerations in landfill location and design
were much less stringent when these facilities were developed than
they are today.

<P>
At sites acquired by WMX, the Company has assumed responsibility
for investigating contamination and implementing appropriate remedial
measures. At sites not owned by WMX, the Company works with other
responsible parties to investigate and remediate contamination.

<P>
Some of these sites are on the EPA Superfund National Priority
List (NPL). Claims have been made against WMX subsidiaries at
104 sites on the NPL where these subsidiaries are alleged to be
potentially responsible parties (PRPs). None of the 104 NPL facilities
was originally developed by WMX. Nineteen were acquired by WMX
subsidiaries from other owners. The remaining 85 have never been
owned by WMX, but received some waste transported by a firm currently
owned by the Company, typically as one of many waste haulers serving
an area (see Figure 16).

<P>
<IMG SRC="../art/report/barfig17.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 ALT="[FIGURE 17: Expenditures for Remediation of Closed Sites]">

<P>
At each of the 19 WMX-owned facilities on the NPL, the Company
lends its technical expertise and works with the government to
characterize or remediate problems. In addition, the Company has
either agreed, or is seeking agreement, with other liable parties
to share the costs of remediation. Sites subject to state &quot;Superfund&quot;
laws are treated by the Company in the same way as NPL sites.
Internationally, WMX has upgraded and cleaned up a number of acquired
facilities.

<P>
WMX net expenditures for remediation of closed sites (after recovery
of costs from other parties) are shown in Figure 17. In 1991,
the Company recorded a charge of $296 million before tax and minority
interest, to reflect its then-current estimate of Superfund environmental
remediation liabilities. The Company continues to evaluate and
provide for the costs of remediating other sites that may pose
a potential threat to public health, welfare or the environment.
It also provides for costs expected to be incurred after a facility
ceases to accept waste. At the end of 1994, WMX had accrued $813
million to provide for environmental responsibilities, including
remediation and closure and post-closure monitoring costs.

<P>
No significant judgments or settlements were entered in 1994 with
respect to private civil actions against WMX concerning pollutants
released from disposal facilities. WMX carries environmental impairment
liability insurance in amounts that meet or exceed legal requirements.
<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<A NAME="2">
<P><HR>
<H3><B><CENTER>
Management Accountability and Employee Involvement
</H3></B></CENTER>

From division presidents to the Chief Executive Officer, all managers
with environmental responsibilities have incentives for environmental
performance through compensation systems.

<P>
The WMX Executive Environmental Committee is the principal management
committee for oversight of operating group environmental performance
and for strategic reporting to the Chief Executive Officer of
WMX. Its members include executives from each of the operating
groups and major corporate functions. During 1994, the Committee
adopted quantitative measures to track progress under the WMX
Environmental Policy and Principles. Within most of the operating
groups, committees or other mechanisms have been established to
coordinate environmental policies and programs across business
units. For example, WMI plc's country environmental managers meet
quarterly.

<P>
Environmental considerations are inherent in decisions made by
the WMX Board of Directors. In addition, the WMX Law and Compliance
group reports to the Audit Committee of the Board on a quarterly
basis, and for the past five years Arthur D. Little, Inc. has
presented the results of its annual environmental assessment to
the Audit Committee. None of the Audit Committee members is a
WMX employee. The Board of Directors has reviewed and approved
each annual environmental report, including this one, since reporting
began in 1990.

<P>
Environmental performance depends upon the efforts of all employees.
WMX has instituted recognition programs to encourage and reward
employee involvement in environmental issues. In 1994, the first
Chairman's Award for Environmental Excellence was given to MANLIBA
in Buenos Aires for converting a fleet of trucks to natural gas.
Many operating groups also have recognition programs for individuals
or business units.

<A NAME="3">
<P><HR>
<H3><B><CENTER>
Environmental Management Certification
</H3></B></CENTER>

WMX companies have pursued certification of their environmental
management systems under various country programs. Two of the three
hazardous waste management companies in the Netherlands, for example,
are certified under the Dutch Environmental Care system and the solid
waste companies are preparing for certification.  Operations in the
United Kingdom are preparing for certification under BS 7750. All of
these programs require independent audits of environmental management
systems.

This is the fifth WMX Annual Environmental Report.  It was prepared by
the Executive Environmental Committee and approved by the WMX Board of
Directors. A more detailed report is available on request. We welcome

<H2>Process Improvement Brings Environmental Benefits</H2>
<HR SIZE=5>

An important tool of WMX's quality program is process improvement.
Cross-functional teams are formed around key business issues with the
goal of analyzing existing processes and recommending "breakthrough"
improvements.

<P>
Several teams have examined and made recommendations about
environmental processes, including the Compliance Management System
and the environmental audit program.  Implementing the recommendations
is making these key programs more consistent, useful and efficient.
Less obvious are the environmental benefits to be gained by examining
business processes with an eye toward costs.  For example, a 1994 team
recommended changes to commercial routing procedures that could
decrease the miles driven by 20 percent -- with corresponding savings
in fuel consumption and air pollution.  Another team recommended
changes to the tire maintenance program that will improve safety and
reduce the number of tires scrapped.

<P>
A team also reviewed the Annual Environmental Report.  After talking
to many users of the report internally and externally, the team
recommended printing a streamlined report for widespread use by those
who want an overview of the Company's environmental progress, putting
the report on the Internet and preparing a more detailed report for
those wanting further information.  The more detailed report is
available primarily on disk.  This approach has cut the number of
printed pages by two-thirds.  Reproduction onto a disk can be done on
demand, eliminating the potential for excess inventory and waste.

Research and Development
</H3></B></CENTER>

WMX's research and development efforts are led by Rust's Clemson
Technical Center, a joint program with Clemson University. The
Center's projects focus on various waste management challenges,
including development of treatment methods for cleaning up military
installations contaminated with mixed radioactive and hazardous waste.
For example, the Center adapted and demonstrated a freeze purification
process for separating salts from highly radioactive waste, a
necessary step prior to final stabilization of the waste in a glassy
form.  Other projects included:

<P>
Evaluating and developing microbial mats for biological treatment of
aqueous wastes, including landfill leachate.

<P>
Installing VAC*TRAX(<B><I>sm</I></B>), a vacuum-enhanced thermal desorption
technology, at the U.S. Department of Energy's Rocky Flats Plant.

<P>
Other WMX companies carried out research and development worldwide:

<P>
WTI tested biofilters for controlling air emissions and developed an
environmentally sound system of mechanical and chemical measures to
control the growth of zebra mussels, a non-native mollusk that clogs
municipal and industrial water systems.

<P>
WMI provided grants to its operating groups to carry out research and
development on innovative technologies, including feasibility studies
at several closed landfills to examine the potential of wind power
generation.

<P>
In Italy, engineers tested a reverse osmosis system as a way to treat
hazardous wastewater and developed a cost-effective and
environmentally sound system for managing small batteries.

<P>
Rust also organizes an annual WMX technology conference that brings
together professionals from the family of companies to share
experiences with emerging technologies.

<A NAME="2">
<P><HR>
<H3><B><CENTER>
Community Involvement
</H3></B></CENTER>

During 1994, WMX developed a "Good Neighbor Policy" to
articulate its commitment to the communities in which it operates.
The policy includes a pledge to consult with host communities when
planning business activities and to provide information about facility
operations. It commits to hiring a diverse local workforce and
participating in community activities.  For example, WMI is providing
$500,000 and other corporate resources to build a new health clinic in
Chicago's South Side Altgeld Gardens neighborhood near a WMI facility.
The new clinic will allow the programs currently operated by the
Clinic in Altgeld to expand and other needed services to be
coordinated for the community.

<A NAME="3">
<P><HR>
<H3><B><CENTER>
Environmental Education
</H3></B></CENTER>

WMX facilities are popular destinations for educational tours
and field trips.  During 1994, for example, more than 69,000 people
visited WMX facilities (see table 3).  WMX facilities from California
to Australia have begun building education centers on-site to
better serve visitors.  

<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../art/report/table3.gif" HSPACE=10 ALT="[TABLE 3: Tours and Presentations 1994]">
</CENTER>

<P>
It is important to WMX, as well as to the broader community, to
develop a diverse group of young people interested in technical and
environmental careers.  For five years, WMX has supported the
Environmental Careers Organization in its programs to promote minority
student interest in the environment as a career opportunity.  WMX
employees also volunteer as school speakers, judge science and
environmental fairs, teach about recycling, work on Earth Day projects
and serve as technical consultants for environmental curriculum
development.

<P>
Our most notable ambassador to children is "Cycler," a
remote-controlled robot in constant demand for school assemblies,
trade shows, science fairs, open houses and community hearings.
Cycler uses educational tapes featuring rock and roll, country/western
and rap music themes to teach youngsters recycling in "languages"
familiar to them.  WMX companies worldwide have more than 40 Cyclers
that have reached hundreds of thousands of youngsters and robotophile
grownups.

<P>
WMX companies support many environmental education programs. 
For example, divisions throughout the U.S. sponsored more than
23,000 subscriptions to Earth Preservers, an award- winning monthly
environmental newspaper for grades four through eight.

<A NAME="4">
<P><HR>
<H3><B><CENTER>
Public Policy Development 
</H3></B></CENTER>

WMX promotes and supports public policy that is protective of the
environment.  Company involvement in governmental policy is managed by
the government affairs programs of WMX, with staff in Washington,
D.C., Oak Brook, several United States state capitals, London and
Brussels.

<P>
The European Union has had an ambitious agenda of harmonizing,
and often strengthening, regulations governing the management
of solid and hazardous wastes, including landfill standards, incineration
of hazardous waste and packaging waste.  WMI plc has participated
actively in developing these initiatives.  WMI plc also submitted
detailed public policy recommendations to the Government of Thailand
on more stringent hazardous waste regulations.

<P>
In the United States, WMX contributed to several important public
policy initiatives:

<UL>
	<LI>WMX supports reauthorization and reform of Superfund to
sustain its benefits in cleaning up waste sites and providing
incentives for proper waste handling while making cleanups faster,
less expensive and more equitably implemented.  WMX Chairman Dean
Buntrock served on the National Commission on Superfund, a broad-based
consensus group which developed a comprehensive proposal for Superfund
reform which was the basis for the Superfund Reform Act of 1994.
Although the bill did not pass in the 103rd Congress, WMX continues to
seek practical solutions to Superfund Reform with a diverse group of
stakeholders.

	<P><LI>In 1994, two WMX representatives were selected as
members of the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council
convened by EPA to help EPA and other federal agencies respond to
President Clinton's Environmental Justice Executive Order, develop
strategic plans for each agency and work closely with community
activists to find practical solutions to specific incidents of
environmental inequity.


	<P><LI>In March of 1994, the Supreme Court ruled that ash
residue from the combustion of municipal waste in trash-to-energy
plants may be subject to regulation as a hazardous waste.  WMX has
long held that ash can safely be managed in well-operated municipal
waste landfills or monofills.  WMX worked with environmental advocacy
groups, local governments and U.S. EPA to fashion an acceptable
legislative proposal, many elements of which were incorporated by EPA
in its regulatory decision on ash management announced in January
1995.
</UL>

<A NAME="5">
<P><HR>
<H3><B><CENTER>
Support for Environmental Organizations
</H3></B></CENTER>

WMX worked with environmental groups on many efforts in 1994, ranging
from cooperation on national policy development to hands-on work in
the field.

<P>
WMX also provides financial support to environmental organizations
through several programs.  WMX and its operating groups made grants
and charitable contributions to environmental organizations totalling
$1,736,650 in 1994 (see Table 4).

<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../art/report/table4.gif" HSPACE=10 ALT="[TABLE 4: Corporate Contributions ($)]">
</CENTER>

<P>
The Company matches employee cash gifts on a two-to-one basis
for environmental groups (one-to-one for other charities).  The
Company also contributes a cash match for employees who volunteer
their time to non-profit organizations (the Servicematch program).

<P>
The WMX corporate campus participates in Earth Share, a combined
giving campaign that provides employees a convenient way to donate
to environmental groups.

<IMG SRC="../art/report/students.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 ALT="[IMAGE: Students of the Annual Symposium for Environment]">

Wheelabrator and the Christa McAuliffe Planetarium and Foundation in
Concord, New Hampshire co-sponsor the Annual Symposium for Environment
and Education, an innovative nationwide student learning project that
was born out of the belief that businesses and communities should
support educators' efforts to introduce real life experiences to young
adults.

<P>
Participating groups of seventh and eighth grade students from
across the country are asked to identify a current environmental
problem facing their community or region and to evaluate and develop
long-term plans and solutions for that problem.  As part of their
research, students are encouraged to meet with business professionals,
government officials, regulators, scientists and members of environmental
groups.  Students have a full school year to identify a problem,
conduct research and come up with a solution.  At the end of the
year, Wheelabrator sponsors a visit by teachers and student representatives
from participating schools to Concord, New Hampshire, where each
team presents its problem, research and solutions to a panel of
independent judges.

<P>
One of three winners of the first Symposium in 1994 was a team
from the West Cottonwood School, Cottonwood, California, who depicted
through computer simulation the development of the City of Cottonwood
in the year 2019.

<H2>Letter from the Chairman</H2>

<HR SIZE=5><CENTER><IMG SRC="../art/construction.gif"></CENTER><HR SIZE=5>
<P>
To the Reader:
<P>
On March 7, 1990, our Board of Directors adopted a comprehensive
and ambitious environmental policy for our company and all of
its operations worldwide. With the passage of five years, it now
seems appropriate to take stock of the steps we have taken to
implement our Policy and its 14 Principles.
<P>
First, we have developed programs to support specific Principles.
Under our energy Principle, for example, WMX is testing refuse
collection trucks that run on alternative fuels, including landfill
gas. We joined EPA's voluntary Green Lights program to upgrade
our lighting systems to reduce energy use and air pollution. Under
our Principle of "no net loss of wetlands or other biodiversity
on company properties," we are demonstrating a unique approach
to protecting, and frequently restoring, natural ecosystems at
waste facility properties. This WMX Annual Environmental Report
outlines programs implementing each of the Principles of the Policy
in 1994.
<P>
Second, we are integrating the Environmental Policy into key business
processes. All of our top managers with line responsibility, including
myself, are evaluated for our performance in implementing the
Policy. During 1994, each of our business units began reporting
on additional performance measures under the Policy. This report
includes, for the first time, information based on these measures,
such as a summary of our impacts on wetlands. As we continue to
refine them, we will report on additional measures in the future.
<P>
Similarly, in the compliance area, we have placed considerable
importance and resources on programs that provide our front-line
managers with the tools and incentives to prevent, detect and
correct environmental compliance issues, and that hold these managers
directly accountable for compliance. In 1995 we are expanding
these systems for compliance planning, measurement and evaluation
to include the entire environmental policy. One step in this direction
is a joint project of WMX and the Oregon Department of Environmental
Quality which was selected by the U.S. EPA as an "Environmental
Leadership Project." The project's purpose is to demonstrate
our environmental compliance and excellence programs and innovative
approaches to agency enforcement.
<P>
Third, we emphasize that implementing the environmental policy
is the responsibility of all employees. We have trained employees
and conducted awareness campaigns. In 1994, for example, I presented
the first Chairman's' Award for Environmental Excellence, an award
specifically developed to recognize outstanding employee initiatives
in upholding Policy.
<P>
These steps represent important progress, but we recognize that
more remains to be done. Successful programs must spread even
further throughout our family of companies and we must continually
reexamine and refine our approaches. We will know we have really
achieved success when we have moved from managing programs to
having our Environmental Principles the foundation for our environmental
culture. In this report, we present for the first time "progress
reports" that summarize the extent of our efforts to implement
various programs under our Environmental Policy at our corporate
offices and major subsidiaries. We think they help to show the
many outstanding programs we have developed to fulfill our pledge
and also areas where we need to place more emphasis. I hope you
find this report helpful and invite your comments on it.
<P>
Dean L. Buntrock<BR>
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer

presidents of each principal operating group and all general managers
depends in part on the environmental performance of units for
which they are responsible.

<P>
WMX has developed detailed environmental policies, directives and
guidance and compliance programs built on the "Prevent, Assess,
Correct and Train" (PACT) framework discussed below. WMX's emphasis on
providing managers with sophisticated systems to prevent environmental
compliance issues is, we believe, unique among U.S. companies.

<P>
To provide an independent assessment of the Company's environmental
policies and management systems, WMX retained Arthur D. Little,
Inc. to review programs in place during 1994 at WMX and its principal
operating subsidiaries. The firm concluded:

<P>
<I><BLOCKQUOTE>
"In our opinion, WMX Technologies, Inc.'s corporate and

<A HREF="../art/report/barfig1.gif">
<IMG SRC="../art/report/barfig1i.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 ALT="[FIGURE 1: CMS: Total Installations]"></A>

<P>
The cornerstone of WMX preventive compliance programs is the
Compliance Management System (CMS), installed at 534 WMX divisions,
including all WMI landfills, hauling companies and material recovery
facilities and all major CWM facilities (see Figure 1). CMS is a
personal computer software tool that translates into discrete tasks
all environmental requirements in legislation, regulations, permits or
Company policies that apply to a particular facility. CMS allows
managers to schedule tasks, assign them to facility staff and track
their completion. WMI plc uses an analogous COMPASS program, while WTI
facilities have an Obligations Management System available for their
use.

<P>
Because of the highly prescriptive regulations governing hazardous
waste management services, CWM also uses standard division practices
-- formal procedures that spell out exactly how compliance-related
tasks are to be done and what training is required.

<P>
Even more fundamental than providing compliance tools is appointing
and training front-line compliance managers. A key WMI initiative in
this area was the appointment and training of Division Compliance
Coordinators (DCCs) at all WMI divisions (in addition to environmental
experts previously assigned). More than 550 people were trained in
regulatory requirements, Company policies and the use of CMS.  Several
groups also developed DCC certification programs which include
testing.

<P>
Similarly, WMI plc assigned an environmental compliance coordinator to
each waste handling facility. Within WTI, field environmental
compliance directors were appointed for all business units, based at
facilities or regionally, depending on the scope of the operations
covered.

<P>
WMX uses several approaches to assess compliance with environmental
requirements. Ideally, all compliance issues should be identified and
addressed by facility management. Figure 2 shows that most compliance
issues in 1994 were identified by facility management and the
percentage of facility-identified issues has increased.
<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>
The WMX Environmental Audit Department audits WMI, CWM and Rust
operations. During 1994, the Department continued to report to the
Vice President for Law and Compliance to ensure independence from the
audited groups. The Department also reports on programs and
performance to the Audit Committee of the WMX Board of Directors,
composed of outside directors. In early 1994, the Department
established auditing standards applicable to all WMX business groups.

<P>
During 1994, the Environmental Audit Department conducted 120 audits,
while the WTI audit program did 20 audits and six legal reviews (see
Figure 3). WMI audit scores are found in table 1.  WMI plc uses its
COVER program to generate audit and inspection checklists and audit
reports. During 1994, 67 COVER audits were completed, representing 82
percent of facilities.

<P>
WMX also monitors emissions from its facilities which might impact the
environment. All land disposal facilities have well-established
groundwater monitoring programs, and water from facility monitoring
wells is evaluated periodically in the WMX Environmental Monitoring
Laboratories in Geneva, Illinois.

<P>
WMX developed and implemented the Compliance Action Reporting System
(CARS) to ensure that compliance issues are promptly rectified.  CARS,
and the analogous COVER program of WMI plc, are software tools that
track issues and the steps scheduled to resolve them.  CARS also
provides management with information on the status of corrective and
preventive actions. More than 850 WMX facilities in the U.S. and
Canada have tracked compliance issues in CARS.  COVER is used to track
the outstanding issues at all WMI plc waste handling facilities.

<P>
Some of the key indicators tracked by CARS are the percent of issues
self-identified (Figure 2), the percent of issues resolved on schedule
(Figure 4) and the number of agency actions. For both WMI and CWM, the
number of agency actions increased in 1994, 43 percent and 20 percent,
respectively (see discussion below). For WTI and WMI plc, agency
actions decreased 61 percent and 56 percent respectively.

<B>PACT: TRAINING</B><P>

Recurring issues identified by CARS and other mechanisms become the
basis for focusing the training program on areas most in need of
improvement. WMX has developed a "compliance curriculum" available to
all facilities that covers the requirements of various regulatory
programs. WMX also offers "Landfill University" and "Material Recovery
Facility University" to train managers in the wide variety of
responsibilities of managing these facilities.

appears to be working, with improvements in all groups and a
significant increase in CWM's rate of issue self-identification.

<P><LI>There is steady progress in the rate of issues resolved on
schedule.
</UL>

<P>
However, CWM and WMI were subject to more agency actions than in 1993,
which is reflected in a higher percentage of externally identified
issues for WMI. This appears to be based on better internal reporting
by facilities of less formal agency actions and increased inspections
by regulatory agencies.

In 1994, WMX companies paid a total of $896,815 in penalties for 65
environmental matters and 10 environmentally related transportation
matters (e.g., labeling of truck contents). This is less than was paid
in 1993 and an improvement over previous years' levels (See Figure

<IMG SRC="../art/report/barfig8i.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 ALT="[FIGURE 8: CWM: Pounds of Hazardous Waste Generated Per Ton of Waste Managed]"></A>

<P>
Eighteen CWM facilities (including all landfills, stabilization
treatment plants and transfer facilities) reduced their rate of
hazardous waste generation by 71 percent compared to 1993 (see
Figure 8). The rate for CWM facilities companywide, including
incinerators and resource recovery facilities, was tracked beginning
in 1994. This rate was 151 pounds of hazardous waste generated
per ton of waste managed, reflecting the ash produced at hazardous
waste incinerators.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<P>
Only three WMX facilities are manufacturers required to report
under the SARA Title III Toxic Release Inventory (see Table 2).
Overall emissions from WMX facilities increased during 1993 primarily
because of increased production at the Demopolis, Alabama facility
which builds waste containers. Johnson Screens recycled 30 percent
less scrap because of lower production but also reduced hazardous
waste generation by 58 percent by switching to nonhazardous solvents
and improving management of solvent waste.

Where can you recycle a pair of Levis, an old mattress, carpet padding
and a toilet?  At WMX's Davis Street Station for Material Recycling
and Transfer (SMaRT) in Oakland, California.  Located at California's
largest transfer station, the SMaRT center offers buyback and dropoff
recycling services for an extensive and exotic list of items,
totalling more than 54,000 tons in 1994.  In addition, a Salvation
Army donation trailer at the center recovered more than 220 tons of
reusable items. The center also pioneered a service agreement with
Appliance Recycling Centers of America.  WMI's commitment to provide
thousands of used appliances allowed the company to locate a new plant
in Oakland that will employ 29 technicians when it reaches full
capacity.

<P>
With support from the Alameda County Waste Management Authority, SMaRT
is developing an education center with displays on recycling and
integrated waste management.  And, to round out the year in recycling,
SMaRT managed the demolition of one of its own buildings, a

Conserving Wetlands and Biodiversity
</H3></B></CENTER>

WMX has made a unique commitment to "no net loss of wetlands or other
biodiversity" on its properties.  No models for pursuing such a
commitment on private lands existed, so WMI and Rust developed a
systematic approach embodied in a detailed guidance manual for
biodiversity planning at Company facilities.  About 50 sites were
identified for preparation of inventories and plans before major new
construction or expansion.  Plans have been completed for four WMI
sites (including 
<A HREF="conserving-work.html">Mallard Ridge</A>); another five are in
process.  Six sites are undergoing a less formal planning process.

<P>
Results demonstrate the value of the WMX approach for voluntary
conservation of biological resources: the studies found
opportunities to conserve, and in some cases, restore, biological resources while allowing economic activity to proceed.
 For example, at the Cedar Hollow Recycling and Disposal Facility
(RDF) in Owensville, Missouri, the biodiversity study found a stand of
relatively rare transitional cedar forest that would have been cleared
for landfill expansion since it was not legally protected.  Under the
biodiversity management plan, facility managers will clear a more
common forest type, excavate soil to create the shallow soil
conditions favored by the cedars and replant trees removed from the
expansion area.  The excavated soil will be used to meet the site's
need for additional soil cover in a cost-effective way.

</A>

<P>
During 1994, WMX companies met their goal of "no net loss" of
wetlands, creating or restoring 2.4 acres of wetlands for each acre
filled (see Figure 12).  At the largest wetlands project at Outer Loop
RDF in Louisville, Kentucky, construction of a landfill resulted in
the filling of 75.8 acres of wetlands.  To mitigate the fill, WMI
consultants restored 290 farmed acres of former wetlands by recreating
wetland hydrology, building three ponds and planting 140,000
bottomland hardwood trees.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<P>
Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc. (CNSI) in Barnwell, South Carolina donated
conservation easement to the South Carolina Heritage Trust program in
early 1995 to protect a 264-acre property that includes rare wetlands.
The area covered by the easement, which legally prevents present and
future owners from developing the property, includes one of only two
remaining undisturbed savannah-type Carolina Bays in the state.  CNSI
has also worked with schools throughout the state to create
educational programs using Craig Pond.  More than 700 students have
participated.
 
<P>
In 1990, WMI pledged to plant one million trees by the year 2000.  To
date, WMI divisions have planted or sponsored the planting of more
than 761,000 trees.

In 1994, WMX's Purchasing Department spent $114 million on goods
containing recycled material, including steel in trucks and roll-off
containers, plastic in recycling and trash containers and office
paper.  The total spent on goods containing recycled material
was less than in 1993.  However, the percent of the capital budget
for containers and vehicles (which accounts for most of the recycled
content purchases) spent on products containing recycled material
increased (see Figure 13).  More than 98 percent of the paper
purchased centrally by WMX had recycled content.

-- more than any other company.  In addition, six facilities in
the United States process landfill gas and sell it as a medium-Btu
fuel to industries as a replacement for natural gas, coal or oil.
 
<A NAME="3.2">
<P>
<B>TRASH TO ENERGY AND SMALL POWER PRODUCTION</B><P>
In 1994, Wheelabrator Environmental Systems' 15 trash-to-energy plants
in the United States processed 7.2 million tons of trash, generating
3.8 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.  During 1994, Wheelabrator
opened a new 53-megawatt plant in Falls Township, Pennsylvania.  The
facility is the first privately initiated project in the solid waste
industry to provide both full-scale recycling, through a material
recovery facility and the recovery of energy on the same site.

<P>
WMI plc runs one of the only privately operated trash-to-energy
facilities outside North America.  The facility, in Hamm, Germany,
was upgraded in 1994 to meet, and, for certain parameters, operate
well below stringent emission limits scheduled to take effect
in 1996.

<P>
Wheelabrator operates six small power facilities with a total
installed capacity of 183 megawatts.  In 1994, the Ridge Generating
Station began operations in Polk County, Florida, the first power
plant in the country fueled by wood waste, scrap tires and landfill
gas.

<A NAME="3.3">
<P>
<B>ALTERNATIVE FUELS</B><P>
Waste Management is testing alternative fuels -- including landfill
gas -- for its fleet of nearly 19,000 collection vehicles and heavy
equipment.  In Buenos Aires, 65 light-duty trucks run on natural gas,
and demonstration and pilot projects are under way involving 25
collection trucks in the United States.

<UL>
	<LI> In a truly closed loop process, WMI has contracted with
ECOGAS of Austin, Texas to build, install and operate a demonstration
plant which will produce liquid natural gas and compressed natural gas
from methane gas generated at company landfills.  This waste-derived
fuel will initially power four solid waste collection vehicles, two of
which are currently running on natural gas.

	<P><LI>Waste Management of Orange County has been awarded a grant
from the South Coast Air Quality Management District to demonstrate
the use of natural gas engines in heavy duty solid waste collection
trucks.  By July 1996, the fleet of 14 trucks serving Mission Viejo,
California will be converted to natural gas engines and to compressed
natural gas fueling systems.

<A HREF="../art/report/barfig15.gif">
<IMG SRC="../art/report/barfig15i.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 ALT="[FIGURE 15: CWM Fleet Fuel Efficiency]"></A>

<P>
CWM's fleet fuel economy continues to improve (see Figure 15).  WMI
developed the WMS system, which uses compact, maneuverable, collection
vehicles, exchangeable containers and long-distance "transporters" to
collect and move trash.  The system is about 40 percent more fuel
efficient than conventional equipment.  About 350 WMS units are in use
in the United States, Sweden and the Netherlands.

<P>
In Seattle, WMI operates the nation's first containerized rail-haul
system, shipping the city's trash to WMI's Columbia Ridge Landfill in
Oregon.  Rail-haul is more fuel-efficient and generates significantly
less air pollution than truck transportation.

<A NAME="3.5">
<P>
<B>BUILDINGS AND OPERATIONS</B><P>
As a partner in the U.S. EPA's Green Lights program, WMX has completed
surveys of 11 corporate and group office headquarters.  Green Lights
has been implemented at Rust's Geotech facility in Grand Junction,
Colorado, saving more than 28,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per
year.  Wheelabrator Technologies' corporate office in Hampton, New
Hampshire reduced its lighting load by more than 55 percent in 1994 by
converting to high-efficiency equipment.

<H2>Restoring Prairie During Landfill</H2>
<HR SIZE=5>

<IMG SRC="../art/report/landfill.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 ALT="[IMAGE: WMI's Mallard Ridge Recycling and Disposal Facility in Delevan, Wisconsin]">

The largest prairie restoration ever attempted in the State of
Wisconsin is under way at WMI's Mallard Ridge Recycling and Disposal
Facility in Delevan.  More than 450 acres are being restored to native
plant communities to create habitat for three threatened species.

<P>
When WMI sought to expand the landfill in 1988, studies revealed
the presence of wetlands, three state-protected reptiles  -- the
Blanding Turtle, the Queen Snake and the Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake
-- and unusual plant communities, including 166 acres of oak savannas
and three acres of calcareous fens and southern sedge meadow.


<P>
Rust consultants, working with the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources, developed an extensive Ecological Restoration
and Enhancement plan that calls for enhancing the savannas and
fens, restoring prairie species on land previously used for farming
and mining and establishing native grasses.  The plan also enhances
wetlands for turtle habitat, monitors migration patterns and provides
protection for the animals and their nesting sites during construction.

<P>
Landfill construction has proceeded without harm to the turtles and
snakes.  In fact, the restoration activities are increasing
biodiversity by improving the extent and diversity of native habitat
areas on the property.  This project won a WMX Chairman's Award for
Environmental Excellence.

Remediation at WMX Facilities
</H3></B></CENTER>

Most non-permitted releases for which WMX subsidiaries have some
responsibility have occurred at land disposal facilities in the United
States. Virtually all of these have occurred at older facilities
acquired from other companies, or at facilities not owned by WMX but
to which WMX or its predecessors lawfully transported waste.  In
general, environmental considerations in landfill location and design
were much less stringent when these facilities were developed than
they are today.

<P>
At sites acquired by WMX, the Company has assumed responsibility
for investigating contamination and implementing appropriate remedial
measures. At sites not owned by WMX, the Company works with other
responsible parties to investigate and remediate contamination.

<P>
<A HREF="../art/report/pie16.gif">
<IMG SRC="../art/report/pie16i.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 ALT="[FIGURE 16: Superfund Sites Where WMX is a Potentially Responsible Party]">
</A>

<P>
Some of these sites are on the EPA Superfund National Priority
List (NPL). Claims have been made against WMX subsidiaries at
104 sites on the NPL where these subsidiaries are alleged to be
potentially responsible parties (PRPs). None of the 104 NPL facilities
was originally developed by WMX. Nineteen were acquired by WMX
subsidiaries from other owners. The remaining 85 have never been
owned by WMX, but received some waste transported by a firm currently
owned by the Company, typically as one of many waste haulers serving
an area (see Figure 16).
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<P>
At each of the 19 WMX-owned facilities on the NPL, the Company
lends its technical expertise and works with the government to
characterize or remediate problems. In addition, the Company has
either agreed, or is seeking agreement, with other liable parties
to share the costs of remediation. Sites subject to state &quot;Superfund&quot;
laws are treated by the Company in the same way as NPL sites.
Internationally, WMX has upgraded and cleaned up a number of acquired
facilities.

<P>
<A HREF="../art/report/barfig17.gif">
<IMG SRC="../art/report/barfig17i.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 ALT="[FIGURE 17: Expenditures for Remediation of Closed Sites]">
</A>

<P>
WMX net expenditures for remediation of closed sites (after recovery
of costs from other parties) are shown in Figure 17. In 1991, the
Company recorded a charge of $296 million before tax and minority
interest, to reflect its then-current estimate of Superfund
environmental remediation liabilities. The Company continues to
evaluate and provide for the costs of remediating other sites that may
pose a potential threat to public health, welfare or the environment.
It also provides for costs expected to be incurred after a facility
ceases to accept waste. At the end of 1994, WMX had accrued $813
million to provide for environmental responsibilities, including
remediation and closure and post-closure monitoring costs.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<P>
No significant judgments or settlements were entered in 1994 with
respect to private civil actions against WMX concerning pollutants
released from disposal facilities. WMX carries environmental impairment
liability insurance in amounts that meet or exceed legal requirements.

<A NAME="2">
<P><HR>
<H3><B><CENTER>
Management Accountability and Employee Involvement
</H3></B></CENTER>

From division presidents to the Chief Executive Officer, all managers
with environmental responsibilities have incentives for environmental
performance through compensation systems.

<P>
The WMX Executive Environmental Committee is the principal management
committee for oversight of operating group environmental performance
and for strategic reporting to the Chief Executive Officer of
WMX. Its members include executives from each of the operating
groups and major corporate functions. During 1994, the Committee
adopted quantitative measures to track progress under the WMX
Environmental Policy and Principles. Within most of the operating
groups, committees or other mechanisms have been established to
coordinate environmental policies and programs across business
units. For example, WMI plc's country environmental managers meet
quarterly.

<P>
Environmental considerations are inherent in decisions made by
the WMX Board of Directors. In addition, the WMX Law and Compliance
group reports to the Audit Committee of the Board on a quarterly
basis, and for the past five years Arthur D. Little, Inc. has
presented the results of its annual environmental assessment to
the Audit Committee. None of the Audit Committee members is a
WMX employee. The Board of Directors has reviewed and approved
each annual environmental report, including this one, since reporting
began in 1990.

<P>
Environmental performance depends upon the efforts of all employees.
WMX has instituted recognition programs to encourage and reward
employee involvement in environmental issues. In 1994, the first
Chairman's Award for Environmental Excellence was given to MANLIBA
in Buenos Aires for converting a fleet of trucks to natural gas.
Many operating groups also have recognition programs for individuals
or business units.

<A NAME="3">
<P><HR>
<H3><B><CENTER>
Environmental Management Certification
</H3></B></CENTER>

WMX companies have pursued certification of their environmental
management systems under various country programs. Two of the three
hazardous waste management companies in the Netherlands, for example,
are certified under the Dutch Environmental Care system and the solid
waste companies are preparing for certification.  Operations in the
United Kingdom are preparing for certification under BS 7750. All of
these programs require independent audits of environmental management
systems.

<H2>Process Improvement Brings Environmental Benefits</H2>
<HR SIZE=5>

An important tool of WMX's quality program is process improvement.
Cross-functional teams are formed around key business issues with the
goal of analyzing existing processes and recommending "breakthrough"
improvements.

<P>
Several teams have examined and made recommendations about
environmental processes, including the Compliance Management System
and the environmental audit program.  Implementing the recommendations
is making these key programs more consistent, useful and efficient.
Less obvious are the environmental benefits to be gained by examining
business processes with an eye toward costs.  For example, a 1994 team
recommended changes to commercial routing procedures that could
decrease the miles driven by 20 percent -- with corresponding savings
in fuel consumption and air pollution.  Another team recommended
changes to the tire maintenance program that will improve safety and
reduce the number of tires scrapped.

<P>
A team also reviewed the Annual Environmental Report.  After talking
to many users of the report internally and externally, the team
recommended printing a streamlined report for widespread use by those
who want an overview of the Company's environmental progress, putting
the report on the Internet and preparing a more detailed report for
those wanting further information.  The more detailed report is
available primarily on disk.  This approach has cut the number of
printed pages by two-thirds.  Reproduction onto a disk can be done on
demand, eliminating the potential for excess inventory and waste.

Research and Development
</H3></B></CENTER>

WMX's research and development efforts are led by Rust's Clemson
Technical Center, a joint program with Clemson University. The
Center's projects focus on various waste management challenges,
including development of treatment methods for cleaning up military
installations contaminated with mixed radioactive and hazardous waste.
For example, the Center adapted and demonstrated a freeze purification
process for separating salts from highly radioactive waste, a
necessary step prior to final stabilization of the waste in a glassy
form.  Other projects included:

<P>
Evaluating and developing microbial mats for biological treatment of
aqueous wastes, including landfill leachate.

<P>
Installing VAC*TRAX(<B><I>sm</I></B>), a vacuum-enhanced thermal desorption
technology, at the U.S. Department of Energy's Rocky Flats Plant.

<P>
Other WMX companies carried out research and development worldwide:

<P>
WTI tested biofilters for controlling air emissions and developed an
environmentally sound system of mechanical and chemical measures to
control the growth of zebra mussels, a non-native mollusk that clogs
municipal and industrial water systems.

<P>
WMI provided grants to its operating groups to carry out research and
development on innovative technologies, including feasibility studies
at several closed landfills to examine the potential of wind power
generation.

<P>
In Italy, engineers tested a reverse osmosis system as a way to treat
hazardous wastewater and developed a cost-effective and
environmentally sound system for managing small batteries.

<P>
Rust also organizes an annual WMX technology conference that brings
together professionals from the family of companies to share
experiences with emerging technologies.

Community Involvement
</H3></B></CENTER>

During 1994, WMX developed a "Good Neighbor Policy" to
articulate its commitment to the communities in which it operates.
The policy includes a pledge to consult with host communities when
planning business activities and to provide information about facility
operations. It commits to hiring a diverse local workforce and
participating in community activities.  For example, WMI is providing
$500,000 and other corporate resources to build a new health clinic in
Chicago's South Side Altgeld Gardens neighborhood near a WMI facility.
The new clinic will allow the programs currently operated by the
Clinic in Altgeld to expand and other needed services to be
coordinated for the community.

Environmental Education
</H3></B></CENTER>

WMX facilities are popular destinations for educational tours
and field trips.  During 1994, for example, more than 69,000 people
visited WMX facilities (see table 3).  WMX facilities from California
to Australia have begun building education centers on-site to
better serve visitors.  

<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../art/report/table3.gif" HSPACE=10 ALT="[TABLE 3: Tours and Presentations 1994]">
</CENTER>

<P>
It is important to WMX, as well as to the broader community, to
develop a diverse group of young people interested in technical and
environmental careers.  For five years, WMX has supported the
Environmental Careers Organization in its programs to promote minority
student interest in the environment as a career opportunity.  WMX
employees also volunteer as school speakers, judge science and
environmental fairs, teach about recycling, work on Earth Day projects
and serve as technical consultants for environmental curriculum
development.

<P>
Our most notable ambassador to children is "Cycler," a
remote-controlled robot in constant demand for school assemblies,
trade shows, science fairs, open houses and community hearings.
Cycler uses educational tapes featuring rock and roll, country/western
and rap music themes to teach youngsters recycling in "languages"
familiar to them.  WMX companies worldwide have more than 40 Cyclers
that have reached hundreds of thousands of youngsters and robotophile
grownups.

<P>
WMX companies support many environmental education programs. 
For example, divisions throughout the U.S. sponsored more than
23,000 subscriptions to Earth Preservers, an award- winning monthly
environmental newspaper for grades four through eight.

Public Policy Development 
</H3></B></CENTER>

WMX promotes and supports public policy that is protective of the
environment.  Company involvement in governmental policy is managed by
the government affairs programs of WMX, with staff in Washington,
D.C., Oak Brook, several United States state capitals, London and
Brussels.

<P>
The European Union has had an ambitious agenda of harmonizing,
and often strengthening, regulations governing the management
of solid and hazardous wastes, including landfill standards, incineration
of hazardous waste and packaging waste.  WMI plc has participated
actively in developing these initiatives.  WMI plc also submitted
detailed public policy recommendations to the Government of Thailand
on more stringent hazardous waste regulations.

<P>
In the United States, WMX contributed to several important public
policy initiatives:

<UL>
	<LI>WMX supports reauthorization and reform of Superfund to
sustain its benefits in cleaning up waste sites and providing
incentives for proper waste handling while making cleanups faster,
less expensive and more equitably implemented.  WMX Chairman Dean
Buntrock served on the National Commission on Superfund, a broad-based
consensus group which developed a comprehensive proposal for Superfund
reform which was the basis for the Superfund Reform Act of 1994.
Although the bill did not pass in the 103rd Congress, WMX continues to
seek practical solutions to Superfund Reform with a diverse group of
stakeholders.

	<P><LI>In 1994, two WMX representatives were selected as
members of the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council
convened by EPA to help EPA and other federal agencies respond to
President Clinton's Environmental Justice Executive Order, develop
strategic plans for each agency and work closely with community
activists to find practical solutions to specific incidents of
environmental inequity.


	<P><LI>In March of 1994, the Supreme Court ruled that ash
residue from the combustion of municipal waste in trash-to-energy
plants may be subject to regulation as a hazardous waste.  WMX has
long held that ash can safely be managed in well-operated municipal
waste landfills or monofills.  WMX worked with environmental advocacy
groups, local governments and U.S. EPA to fashion an acceptable
legislative proposal, many elements of which were incorporated by EPA
in its regulatory decision on ash management announced in January
1995.
</UL>

Support for Environmental Organizations
</H3></B></CENTER>

WMX worked with environmental groups on many efforts in 1994, ranging
from cooperation on national policy development to hands-on work in
the field.

<P>
WMX also provides financial support to environmental organizations
through several programs.  WMX and its operating groups made grants
and charitable contributions to environmental organizations totalling
$1,736,650 in 1994 (see Table 4).

<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../art/report/table4.gif" HSPACE=10 ALT="[TABLE 4: Corporate Contributions ($)]">
</CENTER>

<P>
The Company matches employee cash gifts on a two-to-one basis
for environmental groups (one-to-one for other charities).  The
Company also contributes a cash match for employees who volunteer
their time to non-profit organizations (the Servicematch program).

<P>
The WMX corporate campus participates in Earth Share, a combined
giving campaign that provides employees a convenient way to donate
to environmental groups.

<HR SIZE=5>

<IMG SRC="../art/report/students.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 ALT="[IMAGE: Students of the Annual Symposium for Environment]">

Wheelabrator and the Christa McAuliffe Planetarium and Foundation in
Concord, New Hampshire co-sponsor the Annual Symposium for Environment
and Education, an innovative nationwide student learning project that
was born out of the belief that businesses and communities should
support educators' efforts to introduce real life experiences to young
adults.

<P>
Participating groups of seventh and eighth grade students from
across the country are asked to identify a current environmental
problem facing their community or region and to evaluate and develop
long-term plans and solutions for that problem.  As part of their
research, students are encouraged to meet with business professionals,
government officials, regulators, scientists and members of environmental
groups.  Students have a full school year to identify a problem,
conduct research and come up with a solution.  At the end of the
year, Wheelabrator sponsors a visit by teachers and student representatives
from participating schools to Concord, New Hampshire, where each
team presents its problem, research and solutions to a panel of
independent judges.

<P>
One of three winners of the first Symposium in 1994 was a team
from the West Cottonwood School, Cottonwood, California, who depicted
through computer simulation the development of the City of Cottonwood
in the year 2019.

<CENTER><STRONG>WMX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.<BR>
DESCRIPTION OF PENALTIES PAID FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 1995<BR>
(More than $10,000)</STRONG></CENTER>

<P>
<STRONG>Chemical Waste Management, Inc.</STRONG><BR>
(Sauget, Illinois)  In 1993, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency commenced an action to enforce alleged violations of a 1991 consent order involving Chemical Waste Managements Inc. Trade Waste Incinerator facility in Sauget, Illinois.  The State alleged numerous violations generally relating to operating conditions required by the Order.  The Illinois Attorney General acknowledged that the alleged violations had no impact on the environment.  To resolve the matter, CWM agreed to pay $200,000 to aid in the cleanup of East St. Louis, $175,000 for the disposal of hazardous wastes from these Illinois counties, and $250,000 in penalties.

<P>
<STRONG>Rust International Inc.</STRONG><BR>
(Idaho)  Rust paid a penalty of $353,800 for alleged violations of U.S. EPA regulations promulgated pursuant to the Clean Air Act.  The alleged violations of EPAs asbestos rules related to work carried out at a pulp and paper mill in Idaho in 1989 and 1990 by a company acquired by Rust in 1991.  EPA notified Rust of the matters in November of 1992.

<P>
<STRONG>Waste Management, Inc.</STRONG><BR>
(Massachusetts)  On February 7, 1995, the Massachusetts Water Resources Agency cited Waste Management of Massachusetts, Inc. for discharging 90 gallons of septage from portable sanitation units into a waste water treatment facility in June of 1994.  The septage in question could have entered the facility lawfully had it originated from within the prescribed service area.  The driver responsible for the discharge of the septage into the public owned treatment works is no longer with the company.  Waste Management of Massachusetts, Inc. paid a penalty in the amount of $15,000 to resolve the matter,
<P>
(Pennsylvania)  GROWS Landfill and Tullytown Resource Recovery facility paid a $42,000 penalty for alleged violations of regulations pertaining to odor control.  The facilities had filed applications for expansions of gas control systems to avoid off-site odors.  Because of the restrictions imposed upon the agency by the Clean Air Act, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection did not issue these permits.  The Consent Order allowed the landfills to install temporary flares to control landfill gas, and to allow construction of power plant facilities that use landfill gas.

<P>
<STRONG>Wheelabrator Technologies, Inc.</STRONG><BR>
(Arizona)  In August of 1993, the U.S. EPA issued a notice of violation and penalty assessment to Wheelabrators Westates Carbon facility alleging several violations of interim status hazardous waste management requirements.  Wheelabrator contested these allegations and, in August of 1995, entered into an administrative settlement under which Westates Carbon agreed to pay an administrative penalty of $57,515 without admitting any of the allegations made by EPA.  The Westates Carbon facility has received EPA compliance inspections every six months since the initial allegations were made and no substantive concerns have been raised.

<center><b>PORT ISSUES</b></center>
<p>
<center><b>WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT AND FEDERAL USER CHARGES</b></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Water Resources Development Legislation</b>
<p>
For the first time since the enactment of the landmark Water 
Resources Development Act of
1986 (P.L. 99-662), Congressional efforts during 1994 to pass 
biennial legislation authorizing
water resource projects failed.  Previously, Congress was 
successful in reaching agreement in
1988, 1990 and 1992.  During the 103rd session, the House passed a 
bill (H.R. 4460) on
October 3, 1994.  However, the Senate was unable to reach a 
consensus on its version of the
bill (S.2233).  Similar efforts to enact legislation in 1995 were 
unsuccessful.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>Status of Water Resource Trust Funds</b>
<p>
The following series of tables provides the financial status of the 
two water resource trust
funds.  Table 31 presents a summary of the Harbor Maintenance Fee 
collections by source for
fiscal years 1990 through 1995.  Imports represent the largest 
source of revenue for the Harbor
Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF).  For the period shown, import fees 
averaged about 64
percent of annual collections with exports averaging 28 percent and 
domestic trade 5 percent.  
It should be noted that FY 1991 was the first year in which the 
increased tax rate (0.125
percent) for the Harbor Maintenance Fee was in effect.

<p>
Table 32 provides a summary of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund 
revenue and transfer
activity over the last 6 fiscal years.  For FY 1995, the trust fund 
received $670.5 million from
the Harbor Maintenance Fee (HMF), up 7.7 percent over FY 1994.  The 
expenditures for
dredging purposes totaled $529.3 million--up 8.6 percent--leaving 
a balance in the trust fund of
$621.1 million, an increase of $168.8 million.  Two factors have 
contributed to the 
surplus.  The lack of authorizing legislation to allow the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) to withdraw approximately $45.5 million 
annually from the fund.  
Revenue has been accumulating for NOAA since January 1, 1991.  A 
second factor is that the
actual O&M expenditures for the Corps of Engineers (Corps) has been 
less than was originally projected in 1989 when the HMF rate of 
0.125 percent was established.
<p>
Table 33 shows the projected revenues and expenditures from the 
Harbor Maintenance Trust
Fund for fiscal years 1995 to 1999.  Net revenues are projected to 
increase by 30 percent 
during this period while net expenditures are anticipated to grow 
by 11 percent.  The project
surplus is estimated to increase from $645 million in FY 1995 to 
$1.6 billion by the end of FY 1999.
<p>
Table 34 represents the FY 1995 income statement for the Inland 
Waterway Trust Fund.  The
trust fund is funded by the proceeds from a tax on fuel used in 
commercial transportation on the
inland waterways.  The fuel tax was increased to 20 cents per 
gallon in 1995, which is the
maximum tax rate called for when the tax schedule was amended by 
WDRA 86.  During     
FY 1995, the trust fund received over $103 million from the fuel 
tax and transferred nearly $95
million to the Corps for project improvements.  The balance in the 
trust fund at the end of FY 1995 was $242.1 million.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>Harbor Maintenance Fee on Exports Ruled Unconstitutional</b>
<p>
On October 25, 1995, the U.S. Court of International Trade agreed 
with shippers (United States Shoe Corp. v. U. S., 907 F. Supp. 408 
(Ct. Int'l Trade 1995)) that the harbor
maintenance fee (HMF) as applied to exports is unconstitutional. 
The trade court concluded
that the fee violated the Constitution's "Export Clause," which 
bans taxes or duties on any U.S.
exports.  The court rejected the government's argument that the HMF 
was a user charge and not a tax.  In its ruling, the court indicated 
that, to be constitutional, the main purpose of the
underlying law should be regulation and the revenue raised should
be to only to recover the 
cost of services provided.  Specifically, the ad valorem basis of 
the HMF is not a "fair
approximation" of the benefits received.  For example, large 
deep-draft bulk carriers could
benefit more but pay less than smaller vessels carrying high valued 
cargo.  Further, the fact
that the trust fund has been running a surplus was an indication 
that the HMF was imposed to
raise revenue.  On February 1, 1996, the Justice Department filed 
a notice of appeal to the
U.S. Court of International Trade.  Until the appeal process is 
completed, the HMF will continue to be collected.
<p>
If the trade court's decision is upheld on appeal, the ruling could 
result in refunds to exporters
totaling several hundred million dollars since the court decided it 
had jurisdiction to order the
reimbursement of two years of tax payments.  Another consequence of 
this decision could lead
to a challenge of the fee on imports under the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade
(GATT).  A tax or fee, which is applied to only exports or imports, 
can be considered as
discriminatory with respect to GATT.  Based on past experience, if 
the application of the HMF
were limited to just the domestic traffic, the annual HMTF revenues 
would decrease by 90 percent.
<p>
The U.S. port industry is concerned over the trade court's decision 
because of the impact it will
have on the funding mechanism for operations and maintenance 
dredging of federal navigation
channels at public ports.  The industry supported the passage of 
the Water Resources
Development Act of 1986, which created the HMF.  They opposed the 
tripling of the fee in
1990 and called for a rollback of the fee to .085 percent.  They 
also have requested expanding
the scope of Trust Fund uses to include cost shared construction of 
dredged material disposal
facilities, environmental remediation and disposal of contaminated 
sediments.  The
reauthorization of WRDA 96 as passed by both Houses, but not yet 
enacted, expands the
eligible uses from the HMTF to include cost-sharing for dredged 
material disposal facilities. 
This legislation is supported by the Administration.

<center><b>PORT ISSUES</b></center>
<p>
<center><b>INTERMODAL TRANSPORTATION ACCESS</b></center>
<p>

Intermodal transportation is critical to the United States ports 
and closely linked to our Nation's
economy, global competitiveness and national security.  Waterborne 
transportation in the
United States is inherently intermodal for the movement of freight 
and passengers from origin
to final destination.  Water transport is an important segment of 
the transportation system
whose full benefits can only be realized by linking it cost 
effectively with land-based modes of
rail, road, air, and pipeline transportation to form an integrated 
intermodal transportation
system.  A key element in this linkage continues to be efficientl 
and and waterside access to
ports and terminals which support freight movement as part of 
increasingly integrated supply
chains and distribution networks, domestically and internationally. 
The U.S. port system
handles 95 percent of the Nation's foreign trade, by volume, which 
is expected to double by the
year 2010.  MARAD continues to work with other Department of 
Transportation's (DOT)
operating administrations to ensure that intermodal port and 
terminal access issues are
appropriately addressed under the reauthorization of Intermodal 
Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) and the proposed National 
Transportation System (NTS) initiatives.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 (NHS)</b>
<p>
The importance of major intermodal marine linkages or connections 
to surface transportation
was recognized in the National Highway System Designation Act of 
1995 (Public Law 104-59),
signed by President Clinton on November 28, 1995.  The Act directed 
the Secretary, not later
than 180 days after the date of enactment, to submit for approval 
to the Committee on
Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on 
Transportation and
Infrastructure of the House of Representatives modifications to the 
NHS consisting of connections to major ports, airports, international
border crossings, public transportation and 
transit facilities, interstate bus terminals, and rail and other 
intermodal transportation facilities. 
The Act also established interim eligibility for improvements to 
proposed connections with
NHS funds if they are consistent with the criteria being used for 
identifying connections for
submission to Congress.  These interim guidelines will remain in 
effect until Congress approves
the connection modifications and additions.  
<p>
On May 24, 1996, the Secretary of Transportation forwarded to 
Congress for approval the
Department's recommendations on the NHS connections to major 
intermodal terminals.   They 
were developed in consultation with the DOT operating 
administrations, State transportation
agencies, national organizations, and public interest groups.  The 
identification process was
based on criteria with two major components, i.e., volumes or 
activity levels by terminal type
and a more subjective approach relative to the importance of the 
terminal to the State.  The
package submitted to Congress identified nearly 1,400 major 
intermodal passenger and freight
terminal connections, which included links to 240 major port 
facilities that handle 99 percent of total waterborne cargo.
<p>     
<hr>
<p>

<b>ISTEA Reauthorization Initiatives</b>
<p>
According to the National Commission on Intermodal Transportation, 
the Nation's
transportation system accounts for 16.8 percent of the Nation's 
Gross National Product (GNP)
with freight transportation accounting for 37 percent of these 
expenditures.  On average, one-sixth of an American household's 
expenditures cover transportation goods and services. 
ISTEA increased our awareness of transportation's economic 
importance and how improved
intermodal connections can increase the effectiveness of the 
transportation system.  
<p>
Growth in both the volume of freight and the size of vessels has 
been matched by increased
investment and more productive marine terminal facilities. 
However, access to many port
terminals in terms of navigation channels and road and rail links 
has not kept pace with this
growth thereby resulting in delays and increased costs.  Moreover, 
like a pipeline, our Nation's
transportation system is only as efficient as its narrowest, most 
congested point; that is often  
the landside access from the port to the closest interstate highway 
or rail yard.  No matter how
productive ports make their terminal facilities, the Nation's 
intermodal transportation system
cannot operate to maximum efficiency unless ports have adequate 
access at both water and landside.
<p>
The DOT has embarked upon a major initiative, including twelve 
forums throughout the United
States, to reauthorize ISTEA.  MARAD is participating in the 
Departmental initiative as well as
in various Departmental operating administrations' initiatives that 
focus on intermodal freight mobility issues.
<p>
MARAD recognizes the need to increase public awareness of freight 
mobility and to involve
private sector freight interests in initiatives that shape 
policies, planning, and funding at DOT
and to find innovative ways to leverage limited dollars needed to 
address critical transportation
infrastructure requirements.  In an effort to address this 
objective, MARAD organized an 
outreach program during the months of July through September 1996. 
The objective of
MARAD's outreach program was to increase communication and dialogue 
with private sector
marine freight interests and to enhance their involvement in 
Departmental legislative initiatives
including ISTEA II and the National Transportation System.  These 
meetings were designed to supplement the ongoing Departmental and 
other operating administrations' outreach efforts.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>National Transportation System</b>
<p>
The Intermodal Surface Transportation Act of 1991 (ISTEA) created 
a new requirement for
States to undertake a continuous statewide transportation planning 
process, modeled on the
metropolitan transportation planning process, by developing a 
long-range plan integrating all
modes of transportation.  At the Federal level, however, the need 
has been recognized to
develop a comparable analytical approach to national transportation 
issues, policies, and
performance looking at the national transportation network in its 
entirety as a single integrated, multimodal system.  
<p>
The DOT has embarked upon the development of a National Transportation
System (NTS) that 
will enable the Department to identify and develop policies and 
programs based on
international, national, regional and multimodal transportation 
requirements.  The NTS will
also enable DOT to anticipate future national transportation system 
requirements and identify
appropriate Federal responses thorough a new and improved ability 
to measure, forecast and
analyze how the Nation's transportation network functions and how 
it responds to external
(e.g., economic and demographic changes) and internal 
(e.g.,regulatory and program actions) pressures.

<a><center><b>SHIP OPERATIONS COOPERATIVE PROGRAM</b></center></a>
<p>
<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
     The Ship Operations Cooperative Program was established in
April 1993 with the signing of a Cooperative Agreement between
three U.S. shipping companies (ARCO Marine, Energy Transportation
Corporation, and Sea-Land Service) and two government agencies
(Maritime Administration and National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration).  Since then several new members, with full
membership and associate membership status have signed on.  
<p>     
     The purpose of the SOCP is to address and promote commercially
beneficial innovations in ship operations through the
identification, development, and application of new methods,
procedures, and technologies.
<p>
     Its overall objective is to improve the competitiveness,
productivity, efficiency, safety, and environmental responsiveness
of U.S. vessel operations.  All U.S. vessel operators are eligible
to participate in the program.  With the support of MARAD, industry
and government work together to address common challenges and to
cooperative program allows members to participate in research which
would not be economically feasible on an individual basis.  The
specific objectives of SOCP are to:
<p>     
     1.   Bring together on a continuing basis
          representatives from U.S. shipping
          organizations who are responsible for ship
          operations.
<p>     
     2.   Determine common problems and interests among
          the cooperative's members.
<p>
     3.   Make recommendations concerning cooperative
          actions which might be taken to resolve
          problems by implementing applicable technology
          or training initiatives.
<p>
     4.   Develop implementation plans for the
          performance of individual projects which are
          approved by the membership.
<p>
     5.   Make recommendations to regulatory or
          legislative agencies in the interest of
          maritime safety and the maritime industry,
          based on its collective knowledge and/or the
          results of SOCP projects.
<p>
Several projects have been completed or are currently underway that
lend themselves to these objectives.  They are:
<p>
Current Projects:
<p>
     .    <b>Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM)
          Database</b> - This program to improve the Reliability,
          Availability, and Maintainability of ship's equipment
          will develop and implement a system to collect ship's
          equipment failure/corrective maintenance data and store
          it in a central repository.  Member companies will have
          access to this data for making decisions on improving the
          reliability of their vessel's equipment to reduce vessel
          life-cycle costs.  The participation of marine equipment
          manufacturers and U.S. shipyards is currently being
          solicited to close the feedback loop.
<p>
     .    <b>Multimedia Training - USCG/ABS Shipboard Inspection
          Primer</b> - Two U.S. Coast Guard partnership programs,
          Alternate Compliance Program (ACP) and Streamlined
          Inspection Process (SIP) currently exist in an effort to
          improve the overall vessel inspection process.  The SOCP
          is developing a Multimedia Training Program to instruct
          shipboard officers on how to gain a better understanding
          of the inspection processes and criteria, prepare more
          efficiently for inspections, and conduct vessel self
<p>
     .    <b>Regulatory Research and Analysis</b> - The objective of this
          project is to identify U.S. regulations classified as
          high cost for the ship/vessel operator.  The research
          would include not only existing regulations, but also
          proposed regulations and would define specific
          applications of technology that could reduce the expense
          of compliance.  The analysis would also make
          recommendations for other actions which could be taken to
          reduce costs.

<center><b>PORT ISSUES</b></center>
<p>
<center><b>CONTAINERSHIP OPERATORS INTRODUCE<br> 
NEW VESSELS AND CARRIER ALLIANCES</b></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Impact of the Next Generation Containership</b>
<p>
During the next few years, U.S. ports again will be faced with the 
challenge of handling the
next generation of containerships.  Worldwide, containership 
operators will be taking delivery
of 67 vessels in the 4,500 to 6,000 TEU range in 1996 through 1998. 
The first of the large
6,000 TEU containerships, REGINA MAERSK, was delivered in January 1996.  
Specifically,
the order book shows 26 vessels in the 4,500 to 4,999 TEU range, 26 
vessels between 5,000
and 5,999 TEUs and 15 vessels at 6,000+ TEUs.  These new vessels 
will serve high volume,
long distance trades, with many operating as part of vessel sharing 
agreements or alliances. 
They will require sophisticated and efficient terminal facilities 
with excellent landside intermodal connections.
<p>
The first hurdle for some ports will be dredging.  Ports will need 
to provide channels and
berthing areas with minimum depths of 45 feet.  Currently, only 
half of the top 10 U.S.
container ports, which handle nearly 80 percent of the container 
traffic, have existing channel
depths that can accommodate these vessels.  Many of the leading 
ports, which lack adequate
depths, have projects underway or in the planning stage to increase 
their channel depths.  The
crucial question is whether they can complete these projects in 
time given the problems
experienced by many ports in seeking solutions to siltation, 
dredged material disposal and
contaminated sediments.  While not all ports need the capability to 
handle these vessels, the
failure to provide an adequate number of these channels in a timely 
manner will seriously
impact the efficiency and competitiveness of our intermodal 
transportation system.
<p>
The economics of these new vessels will mean fewer port calls for 
many ports and in some
cases the elimination of port calls all together.  The situation is 
similar to the 1980s when
carriers first introduced the 3,000 and 4,000 TEU vessels.  
For some ports, the pressure to 
ensure that the required infrastructure is in place will increase. 
For those ports which stand to
lose business, they will need to pursue other market opportunities, 
such as non-container
cargoes or niche markets, as was done by other ports during the 1980s.
<p>
Another issue ports must address is the impact of these vessels on 
terminal facilities.  The
volume of cargo carried by new vessels will require new or improved 
terminals.  This includes
larger cranes, berths and storage yards.  Landside access will have 
to be improved to handle
the higher peak volumes of rail and truck traffic.  Today, 
congestion is a major problem at
many container terminals where trucking delays at terminal gates is 
increasing.  Major
improvements will be required in this area before the new vessels 
enter into service.  Ports
have begun a number of major expansion projects.  Virtually, every 
major west coast port is
building or expanding container facilities, including many with 
on-dock rail facilities.  The cost
of a new facility can reach several hundred million dollars.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Impact of Global Shipping Alliances</b>
<p>
A new approach to world trade logistics has become a reality 
through the mechanism of "global
shipping alliances."  An alliance is a consortium or a sharing 
agreement among a group of
steamship lines serving similar trade areas for their mutual 
economic benefit.  The development
of shipping alliances will have a significant impact on how 
shipping and commercial operations
are conducted.  Global alliance shipping lines are rationalizing 
their services and costs by
coordinating their fleet and terminal operations across their trade routes.
<p>
For example, a containership operated by an alliance will share or 
charter space among its
members.  This will increase vessel load factors and reduce the 
number of vessels needed on a
trade route which will lower operating costs for the alliance 
shipping partners.  Other
considerations being discussed by shipping alliances include the 
coordination of container and
chassis pools and procurement.  Additionally, the  integration of 
feeder networks between
consortium partners allows for the shipping line partners to enter 
new markets without making large capital investments.
<p>
What does this mean in terms of impacts to U.S. ports?   Since the 
alliances will be
consolidating port operations, there will be winners and losers, 
especially among neighboring
ports.  For some, it may mean the total loss of alliance business 
because another port was
selected to serve a particular coastal range or, at a minimum, a 
reduction in cargo and vessel calls.
<p>
There will be significant adjustments for ports selected as 
alliance load centers.  Initially,
carriers will be consolidating terminal operations within the port 
area, which may stretch the
capabilities of some facilities.  In time, there will be a need to 
expand existing facilities and/or
construct new ones.  The added business may lead to increases in 
landside congestion--highway
and rail.  While there are many factors, which will determine port 
selection, those ports with
modern facilities, good landside transportation access and large 
local markets will be in a
stronger position to negotiate with the carrier alliances.

<p>
<b>Environmental Issues</b>
<p>
For any nation to thrive in today's global economy, it must develop 
and maintain an integrated transportation system, which is 
competitive, efficient, safe, and environmentally sound.  One of
the critical challenges facing the U.S. port industry is meeting 
the growing demands and diverse needs of waterborne transportation 
while protecting the environmentally sensitive harbor areas in 
which ports operate.  Vice President Gore's announcement (July 1996) 
of the Administration's plan to help resolve the dredging 
problems at the Port of New York and New Jersey is an example how 
a partnership of public and private interests can resolve difficult
issues.  The plan is designed to address regional environmental 
concerns while promoting economic growth.  The Department of 
Transportation and other Federal agencies, through their
programs and activities are encouraging the incorporation of 
environmental considerations into the transportation planning 
process.   Protecting the environment while providing an efficient
and cost effective transportation system is critical to this 
Nation's economic future. 
<p>
Environmental concerns are an integral part of a port's daily 
operations and development planning process.  Ports are seeing 
larger portions of their budgets and staffing allocated to
meeting environmental needs.  Environmental protection has been a 
particular concern for dredging and new terminal development, where 
controversies over dredged material disposal, environmental 
impacts, and mitigation have resulted in delays.
<p>
Among the key environmental concerns affecting the port industry 
are: (1) dredging navigation channels and disposing of dredged 
material in a timely, cost-effective, and environmentally
sound manner; (2) managing the wastes generated by facilities and
 ships in a safe and environmentally sound manner; (3) providing 
prompt and adequate response to spills of oil and hazardous 
substances; (4) controlling air polluting emissions from vessels 
and port operations; (5) preventing water pollution; (6) providing 
for the safe handling of hazardous cargo; (7) developing old 
industrial properties that may be contaminated; (8) complying with 
wetland and endangered species regulations; and (9) dealing with 
the various legal, liability, and financial obligations associated 
with environmental regulations.
<p>
Ports must comply with environmental laws and regulations from all 
levels of government--Federal, state, and local.  Recent Federal 
rulemakings of particular interest to port and related shipping
and shipyard activities include:
<p>
o    On December 22, 1993, the Coast Guard (USCG), U.S. Department 
of Transportation,
     issued interim final regulations that require vessels carrying 
     oil in bulk as cargo to carry
     discharge removal equipment, install spill prevention 
     coamings, and install emergency
     towing arrangements.
<p>
o    On July l, 1994, the USCG promulgated interim regulations to 
implement the provisions
     concerning financial responsibility for vessels under the Oil 
     Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90)
     and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, 
     and Liability Act
     (CERCLA).
<p>
o    On July 15, 1994, the USCG issued a final rule amending its 
vessel traffic services (VTS)
     regulations in order to make participation in all VTS mandatory.
<p>
o    On October 7, 1994, under the authority of the Act to Prevent 
Pollution from Ships
     (APPS), the USCG issued a final rule requiring the carriage of 
     approved shipboard oil
     pollution emergency plans.  These regulations implement the 
     requirements of regulation 26
     of Annex I of the 1973 International Convention for the 
     Prevention of Pollution from Ships,
     as modified by the Protocol of 1978, as amended, (MARPOL73/78).
<p>
o    On November 9, 1994, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) proposed
     emission standards under the Clean Air Act (CAA) for new 
     gasoline spark-ignition and
     diesel compression-ignition marine engines.
<p>
o    On December 6, 1994, the EPA proposed amendments to its rules 
under the Toxic
     Substances Control Act (TSCA) for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).  
     Changes proposed
     include: marking, storage, and disposal; decontamination 
     levels and procedures; and reporting and record keeping.
<p>
o    On April 7, 1995, the EPA promulgated changes to its National 
Pollutant Discharge
     Elimination System (NPDES) storm water permit application 
     regulations under the Clean
     Water Act (CWA).  These changes will examine additional 
     sources of pollutants.
<p>
o    On August 3, 1995, the USCG amended its regulations for
waterfront facilities capable of
     transferring liquefied hazardous gas (LHG) in bulk to or from 
     vessels in order to strengthen
     the requirements for LHG transfer.
<p>
o    On September 19, 1995, the EPA issued a final rule under the 
CAA concerning air
     pollution standards for marine tank vessel loading operations. 
     These standards require
     technology to limit air emissions of volatile organic 
     compounds (VOCs) and hazardous air
     pollutants (HAPs) from new and existing marine tank vessel 
     loading operations.
<p>
o    On December 15, 1995, the EPA issued a final rule that 
promulgates national emission
     standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) under the CAA 
     for shipbuilding and ship
     repair (surface coating) operations.
<p>

<p>
<b>Environmental Laws</b>
<p>
The following describes the key environmental laws affecting the 
port industry.
<p>
<i>Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, as amended, (APPS)</i>.  
This law implements the provisions
of MARPOL 73/78.  It provides for the prevention of pollution from 
ships by the discharge of
harmful substances or effluents.  MARPOL technical annexes address 
pollution by oil, noxious
liquid substances in bulk, harmful substances in packaged form or 
containers, sewage, and
garbage.  A new comprehensive annex for the control of air 
pollution from ships is under
development.  Annexes I, II, IV, and V have reception facility 
requirements for shipboard
wastes.  Annexes I, II, III, and V are in force in the United States.
<p>
<i>Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act, as amended,(MPRSA)</i>.  
Title I of this act
regulates the disposal of materials at sea, preventing or strictly 
limiting the dumping of
materials that may adversely affect the human health, welfare, 
amenities, or the marine
environment, ecological systems, or economic potentialities.  For 
example, under section 103
of the MPRSA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers must evaluate 
proposed projects that require
the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of disposal 
in the open ocean.  Activities under this act are also governed by the
Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by 
Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Convention).
<p>
<i>Clean Water Act, as amended, (CWA)</i>.  This law is designed to 
improve and protect surface
water quality.  The primary regulatory tool is the National 
Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit program.  It also includes separate permit 
programs for dredged
material disposal.  Under section 404 of the CWA, the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers
authorizes discharges of dredged or fill material in waters of the 
United States including
wetlands; and, under section 401 of the CWA, these disposal 
operations must be certified by
the affected state as complying with applicable state water quality 
standards.  The CWA also
addresses spills of oil and hazardous substances into surface water.
<p>
<i>Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability 
Act, as amended, (CERCLA)</i>.  
CERCLA provides for liability, compensation, clean-up, 
and emergency response
for hazardous substances released into the environment and for the 
cleanup of inactive hazardous waste disposal sites.
<p>
<i>Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, (RCRA)</i>.  
RCRA establishes a Federal-state permit system for hazardous waste 
management, promotes state non-hazardous waste
management efforts, and directs some effort to resource 
conservation and recovery.  It provides
for cradle to grave management of hazardous waste by imposing 
management requirements on
generators and transporters of materials and upon owners and 
operators of treatment, storage,
and disposal facilities.  It prohibits land disposal of hazardous 
wastes unless the wastes meet specified treatment standards.
<p>
<i>Clean Air Act, as amended, (CAA)</i>.  The CAA regulates emissions 
from stationary and mobile
sources and establishes the basic Federal-state regulatory 
framework, i.e., state implementation
plans (SIPS).  Other major programs include the prevention of 
significant deterioration (PSD)
 and attainment/nonattainment area programs.
<p>
<i>Ports and Waterways Safety Act, as amended, (PWSA)</i>.  
The PWSA seeks to enhance
navigation and vessel safety, protect the marine environment, and 
protect life, property, and structures in, on, or immediately adjacent
 to the navigable waters of the United States.  It 
implements many International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards 
concerning maritime safety.
<p>
<i>Coastal Zone Management Act, as amended, (CZMA)</i>.  Under the CZMA, 
coastal states can
formulate a management program for the land and water resources of 
their coastal zones and
submit them for approval to the Secretary of Commerce.  For an 
approved program, any
applicant for a Federal permit must certify that the proposed 
action (e.g., dredged material
disposal) is consistent with the State's approved program and the 
State must concur or disagree.
<p>
<i>Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, (OPA 90)</i>.  OPA 90 has a 
number of provisions that
profoundly change the way oil is transported in U.S. waters, 
including requirements for spill
response plans, certificates of financial responsibility and 
increased liability for companies that
handle, store, and transport oil.  The Act caps liability limits 
and establishes the use of a
Federal trust fund for financing clean-up operations through a five 
cents-per-barrel fee on both
imported and domestic oil.  These liability limits may be exceeded, 
however, in cases of gross
negligence, willful misconduct, or violation of an applicable 
Federal safety, construction, or
operating regulation, thus potentially subjecting owners and 
operators of vessels and facilities to
unlimited liability.  Moreover, OPA 90 does not preempt the 
authority of individual states to
impose unlimited liability on parties responsible for discharging 
oil.  The Act also prescribes
response planning and execution responsibilities for government 
entities, as well as owners and
operators of vessels and facilities.  Further, OPA 90 mandates new 
prevention measures
involving vessel construction and operation.
<p>
Ports recognize the need to deal with environmental issues in a 
more timely fashion and are
developing strategies to address potential delays and costs 
associated with environmental
regulations.  They understand the need to develop long-term plans 
to meet environmental
concerns.  They are becoming more proactive and involved with the 
environmental and
regulatory communities so that port issues can be resolved early in 
the regulatory process. 
Recognizing the need to identify environmental implications from 
the onset, the industry is 
working with regulators and interest groups to improve the permit 
processes, to clarify rules
and to develop consistent standards.  Ports understand the need to 
demonstrate their economic
importance to the communities they serve.  Ports, environmental 
groups, and regulatory
agencies are working in a more cooperative framework in the search 
for solutions to complex
problems that affect the environment, economic growth, and 
transportation services.

<center><b>PORT ISSUES</b></center>
<p>

<center><b>DREDGING AND DREDGED MATERIAL DISPOSAL</b></center>
<p>
One of the primary goals of the U.S. transportation system is to 
facilitate the efficient and
secure movement of people and cargo in domestic and international 
waterborne commerce in
order to promote America's economic growth and international 
competitiveness in a safe and
healthy environment.  To accomplish this, the Nation's ports and 
harbors need to be maintained
and improved.  However, the continued development and maintenance 
of U.S. ports has
become an increasing challenge, particularly in the area of 
dredging and dredged material
management.  The past two decades have witnessed increasing 
environmental awareness and
mounting environmental problems affecting coastal areas and ocean 
waters.  During the same
time, increasing world trade and rapid evolution of shipping 
practices and technology,
including containerization and intermodalism, have increased the 
need for port and harbor development.
<p>
Ports play an essential and growing role in the United States' 
economy.  Foreign trade accounts
for over 20 percent of our Gross Domestic Product and this 
percentage is growing.
Approximately 95 percent of all U.S. exports and imports pass 
through ports.  The critical role
of the U.S. ports in world trade makes it essential that harbors 
and channels be maintained and
improved.  However, most of the Nation's harbors and channels are 
not naturally deep to
accommodate modern vessels, and dredging becomes essential to the 
maintenance of our ports. 
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Dredging and Disposal of Dredged Materials</b>
<p>
There are over 400 ports and 25,000 miles of navigation channels 
throughout the United States,
that must be maintained to keep waterborne traffic moving 
efficiently and safely.  Annually, the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) dredges approximately 400 
million cubic yards (mcy) --
300 mcy from Federally maintained channels and harbors.  Permit 
applicants (e.g., port authorities, terminal operators and other 
private industry) apply to the Corps for an additional 
100 million cubic yards of dredging annually from navigation 
projects (berths, access channels,
etc).  About 60 million cubic yards are placed in ocean waters at 
more than 100 Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) approved sites.  The remaining 340 million 
cubic yards are dredged
in coastal and inland waters and placed in a variety of locations, 
including uplands, beach sites,
wetlands and construction sites.
<p>
The Corps reviews projects and issues permits for dredging and 
dredged material disposal in
accordance with Section 10 of Rivers and Harbors Act (RHA), Section 
404 of the Clean Water
Act (CWA--when the discharge is proposed in waters of the U.S.) and 
Section 103 of the
Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA--when the 
discharge is proposed in
the territorial sea or the oceans).  Under the CWA and the MPRSA, 
the EPA is responsible for
developing the environmental criteria used by the Corps to evaluate 
the disposal of dredged
materials for environmental oversight.  The Corps has the authority 
to issue or deny permits under these statutes.
<p>
Ideally, dredging permit applicants submit complete and technically 
adequate project
applications to the Corps and other review agencies for prompt 
review and decision and to
evaluate the risks and uncertainties associated with the proposed 
project.  Dredged material
testing results provide enough information to assess the 
environmental impacts of dredged
material disposal at the proposed disposal site.  Information is 
then shared among all relevant
stakeholders, from Federal and state agencies to the general 
public; and Congress expeditiously
reviews, authorizes, and funds essential new Federal navigation 
projects.  However, for a
broad range of reasons, dredging projects can become stalled in the 
review process.  
<p>
In some coastal ports, the main concern is the presence of 
contaminated sediments and the lack
or shortage of disposal capacity for contaminated dredged 
materials.  Dredging and disposal of
dredged materials contribute to resuspension of sediments.  The 
redistribution of contaminants
into the ambient environment can cause environmental problems 
including risks to human
health.  Scientific concerns about these issues have led to changes
in the national testing 
protocols for dredged materials rendering them more stringent.  As 
a result of the new testing
requirements, the volume of contaminated sediments has increased.  
Historically, contaminated
sediments accounted for five percent of the annual volume of 
dredged material.  While it is too
early to examine the impact of the new testing nationally, at least 
one port reported that
contaminated sediments represented 75 percent of the dredged 
material.  Further, uncertainties
related to implementation of these revised protocols coupled with 
the shortage or lack of
disposal options have contributed to delays in dredging.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>New Initiatives</b>
<p>
Recognizing the important role ports play in the U. S. economy, 
defense and environment, the
President, on August 13, 1993, acknowledged that the process for 
dredging and maintaining the
Nation's ports sometimes does not work as well as it could.  As a 
result, the Secretary of
Transportation convened the Interagency Working Group on the 
Dredging Process in October
1993, led by the Maritime Administration, to investigate and 
recommend actions to improve the
dredging project review process.
<p>
The Working Group had two major objectives:
<p>
o    Promote greater certainty and predictability in the dredging 
project review process and
     dredged material management, and
<p>
o    Facilitate effective long-term management strategies for 
addressing dredging and disposal
     needs at both the national and local levels.
<p>
The Group delivered a report to the Secretary of Transportation, 
"The Dredging Process in the
United States: An Action Plan for Improvement," in December 1994, 
which was adopted by six
Federal Agencies. The Action Plan contains 18 recommendations and 
a statement of  National
Dredging Policy.  The President endorsed the National Dredging 
Policy (see Figure 4), on June
22, 1995, and directed the Federal agencies to implement the Action Plan.
<p>
The Working Group categorized the problems that slow down the 
dredging process and
provided recommendations in the following four major areas: strengthening 
planning mechanisms, enhancing coordination and communication in the 
dredging project approval
process, addressing scientific uncertainties about dredged material 
and funding dredging
projects consistently and efficiently.
<p>
On July 20, 1995, Administration officials established a National 
Dredging Team--an
outgrowth of the Working Group.  The purpose of the Team is to 
assure that dredging of U.S.
harbors and channels is conducted in a timely and cost-effective 
manner, while ensuring
environmental protection.  The Team also monitors implementation of 
the Action Plan and
develops national guidance on issues affecting the dredging process.  
The Team is co-chaired
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency and includes
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Maritime 
Administration, and the U.S. National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries 
Service and Office of
Ocean and Coastal Resource Management.  The agencies have sent 
guidance to their field
offices to establish regional dredging teams to address specific 
regional concerns characteristic
of local and regional dredging issues.  The Regional Dredging Teams 
are being established and
include the same Federal agencies that participate in the National 
Team, as well as state resource agencies.
<p>
National and Regional Teams provide a reliable basis for 
interagency coordination and
increased predictability in the dredging process.  In addition, the 
agencies will be engaged in
long-term planning with the ports and affected stakeholders to 
prevent problems from arising in
the future.  The National Dredging Team will provide guidance to 
assist in the development of
long-term dredged material management plans for major ports and 
harbors in the United States. 
As the Department considers reauthorization of the Intermodal 
Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act of 1991, promoting improved connections among modes 
will continue to be
important.  Key considerations toward that end are how to ensure 
efficient access to ports and
better coordinate port access requirements in the transportation 
planning processes.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>National Dredging Policy (Figure 4)</b>
<p>
o  A network of ports and harbors is essential to the United 
States's economy, affecting its competitiveness in world trade and 
national security.  Port facilities serve as a key link in the
intermodal transportation chain and can realize their full potential
as magnets for shipping and commenrce only if dredging occurs
in a timely and cost-effective manners.
<p>
o  The nation's coastal, ocean, and freshwater resources are critcal 
assets which must be protected, conserved, and restored.  These 
resources are equally important to the United States by providing 
numerous economic and environmental benefits.
<p>
o  Consistent and integrated application of existing environmental 
statutes can protect the environment and can allow for sustainable 
economic growth.
<p>
o  Close coordination and planning at all governmental levels, and 
with all aspects of the private sector, are essential to developing 
and maintaining the nation's ports and harbors in a manner that will 
increase economic growth and protect, conserve, and restore coastal 
resources.
<p>
o  Planning for the development and maintenance of the nation's 
ports and harbors should occur in the context of broad transportation 
and environmental planning efforts such as the National Transportation 
System and the ecosystem/watershed management approach.
<p>
o  The regulatory process must be timely, efficient, and predictable, 
to the maximum extent possible.
<p>
o  Advanced dredged material management planning must be conducted on 
a port or regional scale by a partnership that includes the Federal 
government, the port authorities, state and local governments, natural 
resource agencies, public interest groups, the maritime industry, and 
private citizens.  To be effective, this planning must be doe prior 
to individual Federal or non-Federal dredging project proponents seeking  
individual project approval.
<p>
o  Dredged material managers must become more involved in watershed 
planning to emphasize the importance of point and non-point source 
pollution controls to reduce harbor sediment contamination.
<p>
o  Dredged material is a resource, and environmentally-sound 
beneficial use of dredged material for such projects as wetlands 
creation, beach nourishment, and development projects must be 
encouraged.

PORT ISSUES<BR> 
Introduction and Index</h4></center></a>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
The public port industry is faced with an ever increasing number 
of complex issues.  Today's port organizations must address issues 
ranging from financing current operations and future terminal development
to complying with environmental laws and regulations, which impact
most port activities.  For example, reliable and secure funding sources
are necessary to finance the development programs required to meet 
future trade growth.  Ports need a predictable, timely, and efficient 
dredging process to allow them to maintain and improve channels 
and to dispose of contaminated dredged material.  Our Nation's  
growing dependence on intermodal transportation means that the port 
industry must improve landside access to marine terminals and become
more involved in local community planning.  The port industry's 
ability to resolve these issues is critical not only to the industry
but to the Nation, because of the key role ports play in our intermodal
transportation system.

<h4><center>PORT ISSUES</center></h4> 
<p>
<b>PORT DEVELOPMENT FINANCING AND REVENUES</b>
<p>
Financing capital development programs and generating sufficient 
revenue streams remain two key issues for public ports.  In 1994, 
the American Association of Port Authorities
identified facility development and capital financing as the number 
one issue facing the port
industry.   With tonnage expected to double by the year 2010, ports 
need to expand existing
infrastructure and terminal facilities to accommodate this 
projected growth.  The present
political and economic situation is creating doubts as to how ports 
will finance these
development programs. The fiscal sentiment of many local 
communities makes raising
revenues through increased taxes unrealistic.  State and local 
governments, with their own
budget and revenue problems, continue to demand that ports become 
more financially self-sufficient.  Potentially affecting both 
issues is the relatively recent development of global
alliances among a number of U.S. and foreign carriers.  These new 
alliances allow traditional
competitors to improve their operating efficiencies and reduce 
costs by pooling their
resources, which includes consolidation of their port operations. 
Although it is too early to
see the fall-out from this, among the possible outcomes resulting 
from these carrier alliances
are fewer port tenants and a downward pressure on port tariffs and 
fees.  Carrier alliances are
likely to have greater leverage with ports than a single carrier in 
negotiating favorable tariffs, fees, financing, and services. 
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>Financing Capital Expenditures</b>
<p>
With budgetary shortfalls and the growing demand for public 
services, ports continue to face
stiff competition for scarce public funds.  Given this fiscal 
climate, ports are confronted with
a serious problem of convincing local communities of their need for 
public support in
financing capital programs.  Complicating the situation is the fact 
that many economic
benefits resulting from port investments extend beyond the local 
community or region to
distant communities where exports are produced and imports consumed.

<p>
The port industry's funding pattern for capital programs changed in 
1994.  The primary funding sources through 1993 were port revenues 
and revenue bonds with a combined usage
of 73 percent in 1993.  In 1994, the funding pattern changed to 
port revenues and "other"
(includes state transportation trust funds, state and local 
appropriations, property/sales taxes,
and lease revenues), which accounted for 56 percent of the 
industry's funding.  As a percentage of the total funding sources, 
the use of revenue bonds fell off sharply, from a high
of 40 percent in 1990, to 23 percent in 1993 and 15 percent in 1994.  
"Other" (at 21 percent) and loans (at 16 percent) supplanted revenue 
bonds in 1994 as preferred financing methods,
with port revenues leading at 35 percent.  While the cause of this 
shift is unclear, it may be
an indication that ports are seeking or using non-traditional 
funding sources, i.e. "other,"
when they are available.  The results of future surveys will 
determine whether this shift is an
anomaly or a new trend.
<p>
The funding pattern shifts again when we look at projected future 
funding sources for 1995-1999.  For this period, revenue bonds lead 
with 49 percent while port revenues are a distant
second at 22.5 percent.  The "other" category represents 14 percent 
while loans are 2
percent.  If 1995-1999 projections are correct and port revenues 
and revenue bonds continue
as the primary funding sources, the crucial question is whether 
ports can generate sufficient
income to support this type of financing.
<p>
In terms of capital expenditures, the importance of funding can be 
seen by examining the
1994 capital program for the top 10 ports.  The results show that 
one port exceeded $430
million with the remaining nine ports ranging from $77.5 million 
down to $15 million.  When
considering 5-year projections (1995-1999), estimated total capital 
expenditures exceed $1
billion at one port with the other nine ports ranging from $895 
million down to $153 million. 
Given the magnitude of these capital programs, the issue of funding 
is critical to the public port industry's future. 
<p>
In terms of capital financing, a worst-case scenario for the port 
industry is found in
California, where state legislation permitted local municipalities
to require payments from their local port:
<p>
     o    California enacted legislation in 1991 
          allowing five cities to require payments
          from their local port's reserves to offset 
          the loss of funds formerly provided
          by the state;
<p>
     o    During fiscal years 1991-92 and 1992-93, 
          the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach 
          gave their cities $69 million and $21 million, 
          respectively;
<p>
     o    In June 1995, the City of Los Angeles released 
          a city-commissioned study, which found that the 
          city could charge its port for municipal services, 
          such as police and fire protection, and not 
          violate state laws;
<p>
     o    In August 1995, as partial payment of its 
          $90 million bill (for municipal services 
          rendered over 18 years), the Port of Los Angeles 
          transferred $20 million to the city.  That 
          transfer is now being challenged by the California
          State Lands Commission which is threatening to sue 
          both the city and the port unless the city returns 
          the $20 million.  The city and state have agreed
          that no additional fund transfers will take place 
          in the mean time.  (Note: In May 1996, an additional 
          transfer of $20 million was made.)

<p>
The impact of this legislation has disrupted development plans, 
caused uncertainty in credit
markets, and upset port users.  This situation exists to a lesser 
degree in other states where port
funds have been utilized to finance nonmaritime projects.
<p>
In another development, six California ports created a joint 
financing authority in November
1995 to issue bonds on behalf of individual ports.  The California 
Maritime Infrastructure
Authority will provide ports with an alternative vehicle for 
issuing bonds when municipal
restrictions prevent or delay port plans to float bond issues on 
their own.  The authority will
work with a maritime infrastructure bank created in 1993-94 
(see next paragraph) as a conduit
for Federal and state funds to be loaned for port projects.  The 
authority will have no debt
rating of its own, and member ports are not responsible for the
debts of other ports.
<p>
The maritime infrastructure bank mentioned above was created in 
1993 and is called the
California Maritime Infrastructure Bank.  Its purpose is to promote 
the growth of international
trade flowing through California's port system and state economic 
growth.  Envisioned as a
type of credit union for ports, the bank was to finance both public 
and private port projects.  To
date, one airport project was funded and one port project is 
pending.  State legislation is being
proposed to establish a permanent source of funding for the bank.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Revenue Generation</b>
<p>
Two factors which commonly hinder a port's ability to generate 
revenue are strong national and
international competition and excess capacity.  Acting together, 
the two tend to exert downward
pressures on both rates charged for port services and, ultimately, 
port revenue.  In addition,
port revenues are tied closely to and dependent upon regional and 
national economies.
<p>
The data exhibited in Tables 28 and 29 summarize the port 
industry's 1994 net income.  These
figures show that 78 percent (43 ports) of those surveyed reported 
net profits, and 22 percent
(12 ports) had losses.  Although both the percentage and number of 
profitable ports increased
from 67 percent (38 ports) in 1992, most profits continued to fall 
under $5 million.  The
figures continue to reflect the industry's low profitability in 
relation to the potential revenues
required to finance day-to-day operations and capital development 
programs.
A knowledge of typical pricing practices used by public ports for 
services, facilities, and
equipment is useful in understanding the industry's low profit 
margins.  There are two main
philosophies on the role of public ports.  The more prevalent one 
in the industry is that ports
are to promote regional economic development and to create jobs. 
The second belief holds that
public ports are to be profit-making enterprises.  Emphasizing 
economic development, most
ports attempt to combine these two philosophies, with mixed results.  
Thus, while many ports
advocate a pricing policy that both covers their costs and provides 
an adequate return on investment, very few achieve it.  
<p>
Focusing on economic development tends to depress price levels for 
the whole industry.  Public
ports rely on price and service competition to attract and hold 
business.  Price competition
tends to lower revenues while service competition may require 
additional investments in
facilities and equipment.  One consequence of price/service 
competition is that many ports rely
on state and local subsidies to cover financial shortfalls. 
<p>
The economic costs of following price/service competition 
ultimately may force the port
industry to reexamine these practices.  By exploring the potential 
benefits of regional
cooperation within the context of the antitrust immunity which they 
are allowed by statute,
public ports may realize both substantial savings and improved 
profitability, while improving
their competitive standing nationally and internationally.

<h1>Biography of Maritime Administrator</h1>
<b><center>Vice Admiral Albert J. Herberger</b></center>
<p>

<p>

<p>

	<b>Vice Admiral Albert J. Herberger, </b>U.S. Navy (Retired), became Administrator of the Maritime
Administration (MARAD) on September 14, 1993, following his nomination by President
Clinton and confirmation by the U.S. Senate.  An agency of the U.S. Department of
Transportation, MARAD administers federal laws and programs designed to promote and
maintain a U.S. merchant marine capable of meeting the nation's shipping needs for domestic
and foreign commerce as well as national security.   <p>

<p>

	Under Vice Admiral Herberger's leadership, the Administration's National Shipbuilding Initiative
program has invigorated the American shipbuilding industry with the first oceangoing
commercial ships built for export in thirty years.  Foreign market orders continue to increase
helping shipbuilders compete in the global marketplace under Title XI of the Federal Ship
Financing Program.  As of June 1, 1996, Title XI loan guarantees had been approved for $1.6
billion in projects for four shipyard modernizations and 245 vessels of all sizes, including 13
double-hull tankers meeting the strict guidelines required by international standards and the Oil
Pollution Act (OPA).  <b><p>

<p>

</b>    An ardent advocate of the U.S. merchant marine, Vice Admiral Herberger has spearheaded the
Administration's efforts to ensure the continued operation of merchant ships under U.S. flag by
American civilian seafarers.  The initiative, entitled the Maritime Security Act (S.1139), has
passed the House and Senate approval is expected shortly.  Under Vice <p>

<p>

<p>

Admiral Herberger's direction, the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement, providing for the
availability of intermodal transportation systems for future military contingencies, has received
approval by the Secretary of Defense as a Sealift Readiness Program.  <p>

<p>

	To further strengthen the economy via the public-private partnership, Vice Admiral Herberger
has championed the critical role of maritime transportation in the nation's emerging seamless
intermodal transportation system, working to broaden the scope of ISTEA, the Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, and to address complex land, dock and port access issues. 
Vice Admiral Herberger has also promoted the development of global commerce, participating in
negotiations with foreign countries as well as executing foreign maritime agreements to further
facilitate maritime trade.     <p>

<p>

	Vice Admiral Herberger served in the merchant marine in his early career years and in the U.S.
Navy for 32 years.  He retired from active duty in the Navy in April, 1990.  From August, 1990
through April, 1993 Vice Admiral Herberger served as Vice President, Maritime Affairs, IPAC,
Inc. (International Planning and Analysis Center).<p>

<p>

<b>Vice Admiral Albert J. Herberger</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	Vice Admiral Herberger's last position with the Navy was as Deputy Commander-in-Chief, U.S.
Transportation Command, where he was responsible for developing and implementing a strategy
to promote public and private sector support for improvements for all modes of national
transportation.  This included the development of a transportation network incorporating both
public and private sector programs for traffic management and computer-based information
systems.  Vice Admiral Herberger has more than 17 years' executive experience involving all
aspects of managing manpower resources including recruiting, training, education, distribution
and logistics.<p>

<p>

	When the U.S. maritime industry began to experience severe decline, Vice Admiral Herberger
led educational and advocacy efforts to bring high-level attention to this vital area for national
economic and defense purposes.  After retiring from active military duty, he continued his
maritime advocacy efforts as a member of the National Defense Transportation Association
(Vice-Chairman, Sealift Committee); Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers' Sealift
Panel; Navy League of the U.S. National Merchant Marine Affairs Committee, and Chairman,
Marine Board Committee of the National Research Council.<p>

<p>

	Born in Albany, New York, Vice Admiral Herberger is a graduate of the U.S. Merchant Marine
Academy at Kings Point, New York.  <p>

<center>Remarks as Prepared for Delivery</center>
<p>
<center>VADM Albert J. Herberger, USN ((Ret)</center>
<p>
<center>70th American Merchant Marine and Maritime Industry</center>
<p>
<center>Propeller Club Conference</center>
<p>
<center>Theme: "National Maritime Policy - On or Off Course?"</center>
<p>
<center>Keynote Address</center>
<p>
<center>Tuesday, 15 October 1996, 1230</center>
</b>
<p>
<p>

      Let me begin by thanking Dan Smith for the invitation to speak to this distinguished
maritime industry forum.  It's always a pleasure for me to be with you.  I also want to
congratulate the Propeller Club on the occasion of their 70th convention here in historic
Baltimore harbor.  Coming right on the heels of the President's signing the Maritime Security
Act last Tuesday, the timing of this convention could not have been better.  
<br>
<p>
      Last year at the Buffalo convention I spoke with you about one of the most critical
issues on the national maritime agenda -- the Maritime Security Program.  This is the
program that would safeguard America's future as a maritime nation.  It would ensure that
American ships, crewed by skilled and loyal American civilian seafarers, would support our
economic and sealift defense requirements.   
<br>
<p>
      Many of you in this audience have worked non-stop together with us as well as
individually to get the message out on this program.   Like Churchill 55 years ago, all we
asked from Congress was to "give us the tools" to make sure that our nation's imports and
exports would be transported during peace and war.  
<br>
<p>
      Today I'm here to tell you that after a long, hard, and uphill struggle we finally have
those "tools" with the enactment of this new bill.  A bill that clearly demonstrates the strong
bipartisan support of Congress.  A bill that passed the Senate by a landslide vote of 88 to 10.  
A bill that the House approved last December and twice voted for overwhelmingly in 1993
and 1994.  
<br><p>
      Last Tuesday an historic moment occurred for the industry when the President signed
the Maritime Security Act.  The last time Congress had enacted any major maritime
legislation was the Merchant Marine Act of 1970.
<br>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<center>-2-</center>
<br><p>
      Now, nearly a quarter of a century later, the President, with just a stroke of a pen, was
putting a foundation in place for a strong U.S.-flag merchant marine.  He was also providing
proof of his determination to support the industry and preserve jobs for American citizens.  
<br><p>
      I want to express my deepest thanks and appreciation to all here, the Propeller Club
and, in particular, the Women's Propeller Club, as well as those in the industry who worked
so hard to help us make this program a reality.  It has taken the entire maritime community,
pulling together, to raise our nation's consciousness about the value of the American merchant
marine and the industry.   
<br><p>
      And as the groundswell of support keeps growing, let there be no doubt.  We intend to
keep our message right in front of the American people so that every citizen will understand
how important the maritime industry is to this country.  
<br><p>
      Let me emphasize some of the highlights of the Maritime Security Program.  
<br>      
<pre><b>
        It's a 10-year program providing funding 
         of up to $100 million annually for up to
         47 vessels.  That's half the cost of the 
         old Operating Differential Subsidy (ODS) 
         program.

        The Program will support an active, privately 
         owned, U.S.-flag and U.S.-crewed merchant 
         shipping fleet to provide sealift sustainment 
         in a contingency.  Let me take a moment to 
         address sealift.  
</b></pre>
<br><p>
      Six years ago, before the Berlin Wall crumbled in November of 1989, we had a
National Security Sealift Policy in place.  That mandate required the U.S. commercial ocean
carrier industry unilaterly -- to the extent it's  capable -- provide sealift in peace, crisis and
war.  
<br><p>
      Moreover, that mandate further required -- through law and regulation -- that we
promote the U.S. merchant marine and its supporting industries so that critical national
security requirements could be met.   
<br><p>
      We have hammered away at those critics who would have utter disregard for the
policy put in place to maintain this country's national security interests.  And we intend to
keep hammering away at them.  
<br><p>
      One of the follow-on requirements of the new legislation is that participating
shipowners must enroll in an Emergency Preparedness Program -- the mechanism in which
carriers will provide origin to destination transportation during military contingencies.   
<br><p>
<hr>
<p>
<center>-3-</center>
<br><p>
      The Program will give the Department of Defense access to the shipping companies'
worldwide intermodal networks: the vessels, the trains, the trucks, the cargo handling
equipment, the tracking and control systems, and even the traffic and logistics management
services.   By packaging all these elements, we capitalize on the assets of a multibillion dollar
capital base while maximizing the industry's modern door-to-door transportation capabilities.   
<br><p>

      Moreover, the carriers maintain their flexibility by pooling their resources and
rationalizing their services.
<br><p>
      So we get even more bang for the buck by expanding total sealift capability.  Here we
have a total package in which the carriers can transport the cargo from the factory or fort to
the frontline.  There isn't a more cost-effective and efficient game plan around to supplement
sealift capability than this.  
<br><p>
      Right now, we're ready to roll and get the gears going on this legislation.  We now
have a policy and a program that guarantees modern commercial vessels will continue to 
<br><p>
<pre><b>
        fly our flag; 
        promote our commerce; 
        employ skilled American seafarers, and 
        answer the call to serve our country 
         whenever needed.    
</b></pre>
<br><p>
      And on that same tack, let's not forget that the critics are still out there blasting away
at the Jones Act.  We are continuing our efforts to counteract their distortions and untruths.  
<br><p>
      Let me again point out the Jones Act facts to you.
<br><p>
<pre><b>
        The Jones Act generates 125,000 jobs 
         for American citizens and touches every
         region of the nation including 20,000 workers 
         here in the North Atlantic region of the
         country.

        More than 80 million passengers and 1 billion 
         tons of cargo worth about $222 billion get 
         transported under the Jones Act trade.  That's 
         30% of the cargo in America for just 2% of the 
         entire domestic freight bill.

        The Jones Act supports an economic infrastructure 
         of $26 billion.  That's a capital investment with 
         sunk costs made by thousands of American companies.  

</b></pre>
<hr><p>
<center>-4-</center>
<br><p>
      Here are the national security reasons:  
<br><p>
<pre><b>
        The Jones Act guarantees our nation's control 
         of essential transportation assets and their 
         related infrastructure in both peace and war.  

        The Jones Act makes certain that U.S.-owned, 
         U.S.-crewed, and U.S.-built ships will be 
         there to transport domestic cargo during a 
         national emergency.
</b></pre>  
<br><p>
      It's America keeping American assets and American interests under American control. 
It's the principle of sovereignty.  Every nation in the world, new and not so new, exercises
sovereignty over their domain.  As the greatest trading nation on the face of this earth, should
we do any less?
<br><p>
      We are a maritime nation whose American carriers and maritime unions have
pioneered the most innovative transportation technologies copied the world over.  
<br><p>
      We are a seafaring nation whose shipbuilders continue to build the most sophisticated,
high quality naval vessels known to the world.  And they are transitioning those highly
specialized skills to the commercial sector.   
<br><p>
      Commercial shipbuilding in America is making a comeback.  America's shipbuilders
are coming back into commercial shipbuilding -- made possible by their initiatives and two
National Shipbuilding Initiative programs, Title XI and MARITECH.
<br><p>
      As many of you know, the National Shipbuilding Initiative authorized Title XI
financing expanded authority to grant loan guarantees in two new directions: shipyard
modernizations and export projects such as the vessels built in U.S. shipyards but owned
under foreign registries.
<br><p>
      Thus far, we've approved over $2 billion in projects for 4 shipyard modernizations and
251 vessels.  This includes 13 double hull tankers and 2 double-hull chemical tankers meeting
OPA and IMO requirements as well as 196 liquid, dry cargo and power barges.
<br><p>
      Let me give you a few examples.  Over two years ago the National Steel and
Shipbuilding Company, known as NASSCO, received the first shipyard modernization loan
guarantee for $23 million to support its $26 million modernization project.  NASSCO made
capital improvements in their ship design and technology processes as well as investing in its
facilities, building a 175 ton gantry crane.  

<br><p>
<hr><p>
<center>-5-</center>
<br><p>
      Since the loan guarantee, not only are NASSCO's facilities more competitive but
they've performed contracts more efficiently and effectively.  The Title XI investment in
NASSCO has saved the government millions of dollars on Navy contracts.   
<br><p>
      In the export market arena we approved a $134 million loan guarantee for Fleves
Shipping Corporation, an affiliate of Eletson Holding Corporation in Greece.  Newport News
Shipbuilding & Drydock Company is now constructing four double-hull product tankers at a
cost of $153 million for Fleves.  The first tanker will be launched next January.  
<br><p>
      Another export project is the $47 million loan guarantee for Dannebrog Rederi of
Denmark.  The guarantee covers the construction of two double-hull tankers to be built at
Alabama Shipyard in Mobile.  The first tanker will be launched next June.  
<br><p>
      The other National Shipbuilding Initiative that is an outstanding success is
MARITECH.  This is a five-year research and development program that develops advanced
technology to improve shipyard competitiveness.
<br><p>
      MARITECH focuses on manufacturing and information technologies for ship design
and production.  It matches industry investment with federal funds on a competitive basis. 
Now in its third year, it has $150 million in ongoing projects and has generated 36 new
commercial ship designs thus far.  
<br><p>
       All of these elements are part and parcel of the new course we're charting in maritime
strategy.  And in charting that course we realize that we must develop a better blueprint for
our ports.  There's a lot of major challenges for them on the horizon.  
<br><p>
      One issue is dredging and the disposal of dredged material.  While we have National
and Regional Dredging Teams in place and we're making some progress, it's still going too
slow.
<br><p>
      In his address to the American Association of Port Authorities last month Secretary
Pea spoke about the dynamic change transforming the global economy and in particular our
ports.  The Department has developed a multi-agency strategy to address the dredging issue
and the Secretary is preparing to fully implement that strategy.  So we're hopeful that we'll
see some speedy progress shortly. 
<br><p>
      Another problem is land and waterside access.  One-half of all our ports and nearly
2/3 of our container ports will see congestion increase on major truck routes serving the
terminals.  The reauthorization of ISTEA, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency
Act, presents an opportunity to address and potentially fund some of these access problems.  
<br><p>
<hr><p>
<center>-6-</center>
<br><p>
      The Department of Transportation has just concluded a series of 13 outreach meetings
in September throughout the country on a range of issues from planning to global economy
and safety.   We're working hard with industry in this area to develop action plans.  But we
need to turn the burner up on these issues as well.  
<br><p>
      Let me conclude by saying that the policies we now have in place will bring the
outright hemorraghing of our industry to a stop.  
<br><p>
      We have a three-pronged strategy that's simple, sound and straight-forward -- the
National Shipbuilding Initiative, the Jones Act and now the Maritime Security Act.  
<br><p>
      These initiatives will propel us forward.  They will be our markers as we chart the
new maritime agenda for the 21st century.

      Your conference theme, "National Maritime Policy -- On or Off Course?"  We're
getting back on course.  It's up to us to keep the momentum going.  We need to keep pulling
together.  We need to keep putting our message out there.  We need to keep our merchant
marine and our maritime industry on "all ahead."  All of us, together, on "all ahead."

I am pleased to state at the outset that the impact is overwhelmingly positive.  We have a robust domestic shipping industry providing efficient, environmentally sound transportation and supporting thousands of jobs for American citizens.</P><P>The coastwise trade laws, including the Jones Act, generally require that U.S.-built, crewed, owned and registered vessels be used in domestic waterborne commerce.  The fundamental purpose of these laws is to maintain reliable domestic shipping services and to ensure the existence of a domestic maritime industry available and subject to national control in time of need.</P><P>The U.S.-flag Jones Act fleet transports cargo between U.S. ports, including U.S. ports on the east and west coasts through the Panama Canal, in the offshore domestic trade between the contiguous 48 states and Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Guam, and on the inland waterways and the Great Lakes.  </P><!-- Horizontal Line Tag --><HR><!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#Intro">Introduction</A><BR><BR><!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#Security">National Security</A><BR><BR><!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#Economic">Economic Security</A><BR><BR><!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#Conclusion">Conclusion</A>                        <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Intro"><!-- Horizontal Line Tag --><HR><H4> Introduction</H4></A>                                 <P>In the aftermath of World War I, Congress determined it was important for our national defense and the growth of our commerce for the United States to have its own merchant marine.  Under the 1920 Merchant Marine Act, the Maritime Administration (MARAD) is charged with the development and maintenance of a merchant marine necessary for "national defense and proper growth of its foreign and domestic commerce."   As part of this policy, section 27 of the 1920 Merchant Marine Act provides that merchandise transported entirely or partly by water between U.S. points, either directly or via a foreign point, must travel in U.S.-built, U.S.-citizen owned vessels that are documented by the U.S. Coast Guard for such carriage.  This law is known as the Jones Act after its sponsor, Senator Wesley L. Jones of the State of Washington.  </P><P>Some exceptions to these requirements are allowed, generally described in the 14 provisos to the Jones Act.</P><P>The Jones Act and related coastwise laws may be waived by the Treasury Department in the interest of national defense under the Act of December 27, 1950 (1950 Act).  The 1950 Act is often referred to as the national defense waiver provision of the Jones Act.</P><P>The reservation of a nation's coastwise trade exclusively to that nation's own vessels is called cabotage, and is common among maritime nations.  It has been part of U.S. law and policy, in some form, since the first Congress in 1789.  Forty industrialized nations have laws similar to the Jones Act, including most of our major trading partners -- Japan, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.  The Jones Act has served the Nation well.  </P><P>The Administration supports the Jones Act as an essential element of U.S. maritime policy.</P><P>The preeminence of American national security objectives is broadly accepted and readily understood.  At the same time, we have a parallel economic security interest to ensure the uninterrupted flow of vital commodities necessary to avoid disruption to our Nation's economy and industrial base during an emergency.  Our overall national maritime policy, of which the Jones Act is a key part, is designed to promote national and economic security.  U.S.-flag ships perform these services in all political or economic situations, during peace or war.</P><P>The coastwise laws provide a domestic fleet for national and economic security.   In like measure, the Maritime Security Program in the House-passed bill, H.R. 1350, will provide an active U.S.-flag fleet engaged in international commerce in peace time that is available to support military operations in a contingency.  </P><P>As a matter of perspective, Mr. Chairman, we should recognize that cabotage, in general, is common to transportation operations. </P><P>In recent years, there has been a dramatic change in the productivity of ocean and intermodal transportation, and the prime innovators have been American domestic and international carriers.  American entrepreneurs have pioneered specialized ships, containerization, double stack rail cars, specialized containers, electronic equipment identification, satellite tracking and just-in-time, door-to-door services which reduce inventory and warehousing costs for American industry.  The American public, as producers and consumers of raw materials and finished products, greatly benefit from this innovative and expanding global intermodal system.  These advances benefit shippers and consumers in both the domestic and international trades.  </P>                       <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Security"><!-- Horizontal Line Tag --><HR><H4>National Security</H4></A>                                <P>One of the most important roles of the Jones Act fleet is its contribution of qualified citizen mariners to the U.S. seafaring labor base.  Of the citizen mariners who sail on Jones Act vessels, nearly 8,000 are qualified to crew the government's controlled fleet in time of national need.  The crews who work aboard the ships of both the domestic and international U.S.-flag carriers are the primary source of crews for MARAD's Ready Reserve Force of 92 vessels located throughout the Nation ready for action.  The U.S.-flag fleet also provides crews for Department of Defense (DOD) sealift ships when needed.     </P><P>Over 75 percent of the oceangoing Jones Act vessels that are 1,000 gross tons (GT) and above are militarily useful, as defined by DOD.  Jones Act dry cargo ships and tankers were chartered by DOD for sealift support during the Persian Gulf conflict, and Jones Act seamen proved as essential to this effort as they have in past conflicts.  Many seafarers who normally crew Jones Act vessels volunteered during this conflict to crew government-owned ships, including the Ready Reserve Force.  Maritime unions voluntarily changed their labor contracts to accommodate national security needs.  Also, the unions were able to bring back  retired officers and seamen.  Actively sailing crews on Jones Act vessels delayed taking time off during the Persian Gulf War, thereby freeing up their normal relief crews to take jobs on sealift support ships.  </P><P>The Jones Act assisted greatly in our ability to deliver military supplies during the Persian Gulf conflict.  In fact, two Jones Act roll-on/roll-off ship and six Jones Act tankers were chartered by DOD for sealift operations.  </P><P>Jones Act seafarers have continued to volunteer during more recent missions.  In 1994, during Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY which helped stabilize conditions in Haiti, DOD used oceangoing Jones Act vessels under 1,000 GT to transport equipment.  During Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR, 70 percent of the civilian crew serving on Ready Reserve Force ships activated for Bosnia had been employed in the domestic fleet at some time during the five years following the Persian Gulf conflict.</P>   <P>Following the successful Persian Gulf experience, both domestic and international U.S.-flag vessel companies joined to form the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA) program, a joint initiative by the Departments of Defense and Transportation, which is designed to make commercial, intermodal, dry cargo capacity available to meet the contingency deployment requirements of DOD.  The purpose of the VISA is to meet DOD sustainment sealift requirements from existing commercial services to the maximum extent possible, while at the same time allowing carriers to continue to serve their commercial commitments.  </P><P>It is important to note that the entire Jones Act fleet is available for national defense in an emergency.  For example, during a conflict, domestic carriers (inland waterways, Great Lakes and deep sea) are part of the pipeline moving sealift cargoes from inland points to coastal ports for shipment to the theater of operations.  In addition, domestic carriers continue to support the civilian economy and move the cargo necessary to supply wartime production in the U.S. industrial base, including crude oil from Alaska, petroleum products coastwise, and coal to electric utility plants.  Additionally, Great Lakes ore carriers carry iron ore to steel mills on the Great Lakes.  </P>                      <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Economic"><!-- Horizontal Line Tag --><HR><H4> Economic Security</H4></A>                                <P>The domestic maritime industry is deeply rooted in the Nation's economy.  Over $26 billion in private funds have been invested in a domestic fleet of 44,000 vessels and barges.  Domestic vessel owners must comply with U.S. labor, environmental, safety, and tax laws and regulations, and by doing so, they protect our waterways and workers.  </P><P>In 1995, 124,000 U.S. citizens were employed in the Jones Act maritime industry as vessel crews, other shipboard workers, or in shoreside jobs.  Of this total, about 80,000 people are employed on board Jones Act vessels.  They pay Federal, state and local taxes and their salaries contribute to the well-being of local economies throughout the Nation.    </P><P>Domestic shipping moves over 30 percent of the cargo in America annually, at less than 2 percent of the entire domestic freight bill, including oil pipelines.  The cost of shipping this 30 percent in 1994 was $8 billion, compared to the total 1994 domestic freight bill of $402.2 billion.  The cargo carried on our Great Lakes, rivers and canals, and coastwise waters had a value of some $222 billion, or about 3.3 percent of the national GDP.  </P><P>The costs of waterborne shipping in the lower 48 states are small relative to other domestic transportation services, because shippers have competitive transportation alternatives in our outstanding infrastructure of highways, railroads, pipelines and air service.  Part of the strength of our domestic transportation system is its diversity.  Commercial factors unrelated to the Jones Act determine a modal transportation choice; these include volume and value of cargo carried, distance, time sensitivity, frequency of shipments, cost and convenience.    </P><P>For example, significant time and costs are incurred in transporting merchandise from an inland point-of-origin to the coast, loading the cargo onto a vessel, shipping the cargo from one port to another, discharging cargo from a vessel, and moving the freight from the coast to an inland point-of-destination.  Many of these handling costs can be avoided by direct overland transportation.  Since travel by water may not provide the most direct routing for shippers, a ship is chosen as a link in the movement of a commodity only if both timely delivery and a lower total transportation bill result.</P><P>Shipping by water is more cost-effective where navigable ship channels and ports are nearby.  Also, relatively lower value commodities of high weight and volume -- such as coal or corn -- require less costly, reliable transport rather than speed.  Still, the logical routing of grain from midwest producers to markets in the continental United States favors rail or truck.  Water is the economical and efficient choice only after all the factors I have stated have been taken into account.  </P>                           <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Conclusion"><!-- Horizontal Line Tag --><HR><H4>Conclusion</H4></A>                                <P>The domestic maritime fleet plays a vital and essential role in the nationwide intermodal transportation system that moves cargo interstate and offshore.  Jones Act vessels employ about 80,000 American citizens, generate another 44,000 jobs in the shipbuilding, ship repair and related industries, and support $26 billion in capital investment.   </P><P>The coastwise trades are active and competitive, serving American national and economic security needs dependably and efficiently.The Jones Act fleet is an essential link in our national transportation infrastructure.

  <H3>White House Press Release</H3>
  <H4>STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT </H4>
  </center>
  <HR>
  <PRE>


                           THE WHITE HOUSE
  
                    Office of the Press Secretary
  
  _______________________________________________________________
  
  For Immediate Release                           October 8, 1996
  
  
                      STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT
  
  
       Today I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 1350, the 
  "Maritime Security Act of 1996."  This Act sets the course 
  for America's merchant marine into the 21st century.
  
       The American flag must always sail in the sea lanes 
  of the world.  In recent years, our country has again been 
  reminded of the critical role played by the U.S. merchant
  marine in protecting our interests and the security of our    
  allies.  
 
       The enactment of this legislation is the culmination of a
  long, bipartisan effort.  It will ensure that the United States
  will continue to have American flag ships crewed by loyal
  American citizen merchant mariners to meet our Nation's
  economic and sealift defense requirements.
  
       The American merchant marine is an important component of 
  the sealift needed by the Department of Defense.  By
  contracting with the owners and operators of U.S.-flag
  commercial vessels, the Government will gain access to a fleet
  of modern commercial ships, along with the sophisticated
  intermodal transportation system supporting it.  The Government
  also assures that the seafaring men and women who crew these
  commercial ships in peacetime will be available to crew the   
  Government's reserve sealift ships in times of crisis.
  
       This Act extends to seafarers the same basic reemployment 
  rights that apply to reserve members of our Armed Forces in 
  time of war or national emergency.  American merchant mariners 
  have always responded to the call in times of crisis, and they 
  deserve the assurance that their peacetime jobs will be there 
  when they return.
  
       The Maritime Security Act will protect American jobs 
  and maintain a U.S. presence in international maritime trade, 
  ensuring that vital imports and exports are delivered in both 
  peacetime and wartime.  The Act reaffirms our Nation's resolve 
  to maintain a strong U.S.-flag presence on the high seas for 
  our continued national security and economic growth.
  
  
                              WILLIAM J. CLINTON
              
  THE WHITE HOUSE,
  October 8, 1996.

<h1>Jones Act -- Essential Element of
Maritime Program</h1>
<u><b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b></u><p>

Wednesday, June 12, 1996					<p>

<b>JONES ACT, DOMESTIC SHIPPING INDUSTRY <p>

SUPPORT NATIONAL AND ECONOMIC SECURITY,<p>

MARITIME ADMINISTRATOR TELLS CONGRESS</b><p>

<p>

	Echoing President Clinton's commitment to American shipping, Maritime Administrator <a href="VAAJHERB.TXT">Albert
J. Herberger</a> told a Congressional subcommittee today that the domestic shipping industry is an
essential part of the nationwide intermodal transportation system and serves America's national
and economic security needs dependably and efficiently. <p>

	Admiral Herberger spoke as part of a forum on domestic shipping held by the House
subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation.<p>

	"We have a robust domestic shipping industry providing efficient, environmentally sound
transportation and supporting thousands of jobs for American citizens," the admiral said.<p>

	The forum focused on America's coastwise trade laws, often called the Jones Act, which
generally require that U.S.-built, crewed, owned and registered vessels be used in the nation's
domestic waterborne commerce.<p>

	The purpose of the Jones Act, Herberger said, "is to maintain reliable domestic shipping
services and to ensure the existence of a domestic maritime industry available and subject to
national control in time of need."<p>

	"The Administration supports the Jones Act as an essential element of U.S. maritime policy,"
he emphasized.  "It will continue to serve the nation's interests well into the 21st century."<p>

	As an example of the importance to defense of the Jones Act, Herberger told the
Subcommittee that dry cargo ships and tankers were chartered by the Pentagon during the
Persian Gulf conflict.  In addition, many seafarers who normally crew Jones Act vessels
volunteered to crew government-owned ships to support U.S. forces.<p>

<p>

	Addressing economic and environmental contributions, Herberger said Jones Act vessels
employ about 80,000 American citizens, generate another 44,000 jobs in the shipbuilding, ship
repair and related industries and support $26 billion in capital investment.<p>

	"Domestic vessel owners must comply with U.S. labor, environmental, safety, and tax laws
and regulations, and by doing so, they protect our waterways and workers," he said.<p>

	In addition, Jones Act workers "pay federal, state and local taxes and their salaries contribute
to the well-being of local economies throughout the nation," he added.<p>

	As for efficiency, domestic shipping moves over 30 percent of the cargo in America annually
at less than 2 percent of the entire domestic freight bill, he said. <p>

The fundamental purpose of these laws is to maintain reliable domestic shipping services and to ensure the existence of a domestic maritime industry available and subject to national control in time of need.</P><P>The U.S.-flag Jones Act fleet transports cargo between U.S. ports, including U.S. ports on the east and west coasts through the Panama Canal, in the offshore domestic trade between the contiguous 48 states and Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Guam, and on the inland waterways and the Great Lakes.  </P><!-- Horizontal Line Tag --><HR><!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#Intro">Introduction</A><BR><BR><!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#Security">National Security</A><BR><BR><!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#Economic">Economic Security</A><BR><BR><!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#Conclusion">Conclusion</A>                        <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Intro"><!-- Horizontal Line Tag --><HR><H4> Introduction</H4></A>                                 <P>In the aftermath of World War I, Congress determined it was important for our national defense and the growth of our commerce for the United States to have its own merchant marine.  Under the 1920 Merchant Marine Act, the Maritime Administration (MARAD) is charged with the development and maintenance of a merchant marine necessary for "national defense and proper growth of its foreign and domestic commerce."   As part of this policy, section 27 of the 1920 Merchant Marine Act provides that merchandise transported entirely or partly by water between U.S. points, either directly or via a foreign point, must travel in U.S.-built, U.S.-citizen owned vessels that are documented by the U.S. Coast Guard for such carriage.  This law is known as the Jones Act after its sponsor, Senator Wesley L. Jones of the State of Washington.  </P><P>Some exceptions to these requirements are allowed, generally described in the 14 provisos to the Jones Act.</P><P>The Jones Act and related coastwise laws may be waived by the Treasury Department in the interest of national defense under the Act of December 27, 1950 (1950 Act).  The 1950 Act is often referred to as the national defense waiver provision of the Jones Act.</P><P>The reservation of a nation's coastwise trade exclusively to that nation's own vessels is called cabotage, and is common among maritime nations.  It has been part of U.S. law and policy, in some form, since the first Congress in 1789.  Forty industrialized nations have laws similar to the Jones Act, including most of our major trading partners -- Japan, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.  The Jones Act has served the Nation well.  </P><P>The Administration supports the Jones Act as an essential element of U.S. maritime policy.</P><P>The preeminence of American national security objectives is broadly accepted and readily understood.  At the same time, we have a parallel economic security interest to ensure the uninterrupted flow of vital commodities necessary to avoid disruption to our Nation's economy and industrial base during an emergency.  Our overall national maritime policy, of which the Jones Act is a key part, is designed to promote national and economic security.  U.S.-flag ships perform these services in all political or economic situations, during peace or war.</P><P>The coastwise laws provide a domestic fleet for national and economic security.   In like measure, the Maritime Security Program in the House-passed bill, H.R. 1350, will provide an active U.S.-flag fleet engaged in international commerce in peace time that is available to support military operations in a contingency.  </P><P>As a matter of perspective, Mr. Chairman, we should recognize that cabotage, in general, is common to transportation operations. </P><P>In recent years, there has been a dramatic change in the productivity of ocean and intermodal transportation, and the prime innovators have been American domestic and international carriers.  American entrepreneurs have pioneered specialized ships, containerization, double stack rail cars, specialized containers, electronic equipment identification, satellite tracking and just-in-time, door-to-door services which reduce inventory and warehousing costs for American industry.  The American public, as producers and consumers of raw materials and finished products, greatly benefit from this innovative and expanding global intermodal system.  These advances benefit shippers and consumers in both the domestic and international trades.  </P>                       <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Security"><!-- Horizontal Line Tag --><HR><H4>National Security</H4></A>                                <P>One of the most important roles of the Jones Act fleet is its contribution of qualified citizen mariners to the U.S. seafaring labor base.  Of the citizen mariners who sail on Jones Act vessels, nearly 8,000 are qualified to crew the government's controlled fleet in time of national need.  The crews who work aboard the ships of both the domestic and international U.S.-flag carriers are the primary source of crews for MARAD's Ready Reserve Force of 92 vessels located throughout the Nation ready for action.  The U.S.-flag fleet also provides crews for Department of Defense (DOD) sealift ships when needed.     </P><P>Over 75 percent of the oceangoing Jones Act vessels that are 1,000 gross tons (GT) and above are militarily useful, as defined by DOD.  Jones Act dry cargo ships and tankers were chartered by DOD for sealift support during the Persian Gulf conflict, and Jones Act seamen proved as essential to this effort as they have in past conflicts.  Many seafarers who normally crew Jones Act vessels volunteered during this conflict to crew government-owned ships, including the Ready Reserve Force.  Maritime unions voluntarily changed their labor contracts to accommodate national security needs.  Also, the unions were able to bring back  retired officers and seamen.  Actively sailing crews on Jones Act vessels delayed taking time off during the Persian Gulf War, thereby freeing up their normal relief crews to take jobs on sealift support ships.  </P><P>The Jones Act assisted greatly in our ability to deliver military supplies during the Persian Gulf conflict.  In fact, two Jones Act roll-on/roll-off ship and six Jones Act tankers were chartered by DOD for sealift operations.  </P><P>Jones Act seafarers have continued to volunteer during more recent missions.  In 1994, during Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY which helped stabilize conditions in Haiti, DOD used oceangoing Jones Act vessels under 1,000 GT to transport equipment.  During Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR, 70 percent of the civilian crew serving on Ready Reserve Force ships activated for Bosnia had been employed in the domestic fleet at some time during the five years following the Persian Gulf conflict.</P>   <P>Following the successful Persian Gulf experience, both domestic and international U.S.-flag vessel companies joined to form the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA) program, a joint initiative by the Departments of Defense and Transportation, which is designed to make commercial, intermodal, dry cargo capacity available to meet the contingency deployment requirements of DOD.  The purpose of the VISA is to meet DOD sustainment sealift requirements from existing commercial services to the maximum extent possible, while at the same time allowing carriers to continue to serve their commercial commitments.  </P><P>It is important to note that the entire Jones Act fleet is available for national defense in an emergency.  For example, during a conflict, domestic carriers (inland waterways, Great Lakes and deep sea) are part of the pipeline moving sealift cargoes from inland points to coastal ports for shipment to the theater of operations.  In addition, domestic carriers continue to support the civilian economy and move the cargo necessary to supply wartime production in the U.S. industrial base, including crude oil from Alaska, petroleum products coastwise, and coal to electric utility plants.  Additionally, Great Lakes ore carriers carry iron ore to steel mills on the Great Lakes.  </P>                      <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Economic"><!-- Horizontal Line Tag --><HR><H4> Economic Security</H4></A>                                <P>The domestic maritime industry is deeply rooted in the Nation's economy.  Over $26 billion in private funds have been invested in a domestic fleet of 44,000 vessels and barges.  Domestic vessel owners must comply with U.S. labor, environmental, safety, and tax laws and regulations, and by doing so, they protect our waterways and workers.  </P><P>In 1995, 124,000 U.S. citizens were employed in the Jones Act maritime industry as vessel crews, other shipboard workers, or in shoreside jobs.  Of this total, about 80,000 people are employed on board Jones Act vessels.  They pay Federal, state and local taxes and their salaries contribute to the well-being of local economies throughout the Nation.    </P><P>Domestic shipping moves over 30 percent of the cargo in America annually, at less than 2 percent of the entire domestic freight bill, including oil pipelines.  The cost of shipping this 30 percent in 1994 was $8 billion, compared to the total 1994 domestic freight bill of $402.2 billion.  The cargo carried on our Great Lakes, rivers and canals, and coastwise waters had a value of some $222 billion, or about 3.3 percent of the national GDP.  </P><P>The costs of waterborne shipping in the lower 48 states are small relative to other domestic transportation services, because shippers have competitive transportation alternatives in our outstanding infrastructure of highways, railroads, pipelines and air service.  Part of the strength of our domestic transportation system is its diversity.  Commercial factors unrelated to the Jones Act determine a modal transportation choice; these include volume and value of cargo carried, distance, time sensitivity, frequency of shipments, cost and convenience.    </P><P>For example, significant time and costs are incurred in transporting merchandise from an inland point-of-origin to the coast, loading the cargo onto a vessel, shipping the cargo from one port to another, discharging cargo from a vessel, and moving the freight from the coast to an inland point-of-destination.  Many of these handling costs can be avoided by direct overland transportation.  Since travel by water may not provide the most direct routing for shippers, a ship is chosen as a link in the movement of a commodity only if both timely delivery and a lower total transportation bill result.</P><P>Shipping by water is more cost-effective where navigable ship channels and ports are nearby.  Also, relatively lower value commodities of high weight and volume -- such as coal or corn -- require less costly, reliable transport rather than speed.  Still, the logical routing of grain from midwest producers to markets in the continental United States favors rail or truck.  Water is the economical and efficient choice only after all the factors I have stated have been taken into account.  </P>                           <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Conclusion"><!-- Horizontal Line Tag --><HR><H4>Conclusion</H4></A>                                <P>The domestic maritime fleet plays a vital and essential role in the nationwide intermodal transportation system that moves cargo interstate and offshore.  Jones Act vessels employ about 80,000 American citizens, generate another 44,000 jobs in the shipbuilding, ship repair and related industries, and support $26 billion in capital investment.   </P><P>The coastwise trades are active and competitive, serving American national and economic security needs dependably and efficiently.The Jones Act fleet is an essential link in our national transportation infrastructure.  The Administration supports the Jones Act and believes it will continue to serve the Nation's interests well into the 21st century.  </P><BR><P ALIGN=CENTER># # # # #</P><!-- Horizontal Line Tag --><HR>   </BODY> </HTML>

<h1><center>National Maritime Day Proclamation</h1>
</center>
<center>NATIONAL MARITIME DAY, 1996<p>

- - - - - - - - - - -<p>

</center>
<center>BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA<p>

A PROCLAMATION<p>

</center>
<p>

	The men and women of the United States Merchant Marine stand prepared to help our Nation in
times of crisis.  Their outstanding professionalism and performance have been manifest
throughout America's proud history, most recently in the Persian Gulf, Haiti, and Somalia. 
Today, these brave individuals continue to bring honor to the maritime community and to our
country through their steadfast service to our troops in Bosnia.<p>

<p>

	Those working on and in support of U.S. vessels play another important role by strengthening
our economy.  Every day, merchant ships carry the Nation's domestic and foreign commerce,
acting as an integral part of our seamless transportation system.  Those aboard go to sea to move
American goods and materials, to help provide aid and comfort to others around the world, and,
when necessary, to defend our interests and to seek international peace. <p>

<p>

	The Maritime Security Program legislation currently before the Congress will preserve a strong
sealift capability so that critical military cargoes can reach American troops and our allies aboard
as they strive to fulfill their peacekeeping and humanitarian missions.  It will protect American
jobs and foster our efforts to expand international trade.  In standing behind this important
measure, we affirm our commitment to maintaining a strong U.S.-flag presence on the high seas
for our continued national security and economic growth.<p>

<p>

	In recognition of the importance of the U.S. Merchant Marine, the Congress, by a joint resolution
approved May 20, 1933, has designated May 22 of each year as "National Maritime Day" and
authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its
observance.<p>

<p>

	NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do
hereby proclaim May 22, 1996, as National Maritime Day.  I urge all Americans to observe this
day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities and by displaying the flag of the
United States at their homes and in their communities.  I also request that all ships sailing under
the American flag dress ship on that day.<p>

<p>

	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of May, in the year
of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the Independence of the United States the
two hundred and twentieth.<p>

<p>

<b>NATION TO OBSERVE NATIONAL MARITIME DAY;<p>

MAY 22 EVENTS SCHEDULED IN WASHINGTON, D.C.</b><p>

<p>

	In New York, a wreath will be laid at the Merchant Marine Memorial in Battery Park.  In
Norfolk, one will be placed in the water from a riverboat.  A training ship will host a ceremony
in New Orleans; there will be a luncheon in Houston; war veterans will sponsor a San Francisco
celebration; and in Washington, D.C., government officials, labor leaders, industry
representatives and mariners will mark the day in the Hubert Humphrey Building's Great Hall.<p>

	 Since 1933, each year the President of the United States has called on the people of the United
States to observe May 22 as National Maritime Day, and 1996 is no different.  President Clinton,
too, proclaimed the day a special time to honor the heroism of seafarers.<p>

<p>

	"The men and women who serve aboard U.S. vessels, and in supporting industries, remain
prepared to support the Nation in times of crisis.  Their outstanding professionalism and heroic
performance have been evident throughout our Nation's history -- most recently in Vietnam, the
Persian Gulf, Haiti and Somalia.  Now these men and women continue to bring great honor, not
only to themselves, but also to the entire maritime community through their support of our troops
in Bosnia," President Clinton stated.<p>

"Seafarers from the United States have braved peacekeeping and humanitarian missions
throughout history.  Their contribution has been unstinting and professional.  I salute them for
their performance in peace and war," Secretary of Transportation Federico Pe&ntilde;a said.<p>

<p>

	During World War II, 733 American cargo ships were lost and more than 6,000 civilian
American seafarers were killed as a result of enemy action.  After World War II, many inland
states joined in saluting the merchant marine for its heroic contributions.<p>

<p>

	Today, most National Maritime Day observances are held in the nation's port cities.  But the
many civilian merchant mariners who lost their lives in wartime service are still remembered in
the Nation's Capital.<p>

<p>

	At 11:00 a.m. Wednesday, government officials, members of Congress, merchant marine war
veterans, active civilian seafarers, maritime industry and labor leaders, and others will gather in
the Great Hall of the Hubert Humphrey Building, 200 Independence Avenue, S.W. for the annual
Merchant Marine Memorial Service. The public is welcome at the ceremony. <p>

<p>

	Speakers will include Deputy Secretary of Transportation Mortimer Downey; Michael Sacco,
president, Maritime Trades Department, AFL-CIO; and Maritime Administrator Albert J.
Herberger.  Tributes from members of Congress and industry leaders also are expected.<p>

<p>

	Music will be provided by the Department of Transportation's choir along with Ms. Erin Gantt, a
1983 graduate of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.  The academy's color guard and chaplain
also will participate.<p>

<p>

     Mr.  John  E.   Graykowski   was   appointed   Deputy   Maritime
Administrator  for  Inland  Waterways  and  Great   Lakes,   Maritime
Administration on January 27, 1994. In this position  Mr.  Graykowski
will serve as the principal advisor to the Maritime Administrator  on
issues dealing with the Nation's inland  waterway  system  and  Great
Lakes.<P>

     Prior to joining the Maritime Administration, Mr. Graykowski was
a senior associate with the legal firms of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &
Walker and Crowell & Moring for over 3 years. In those  positions  he
represented transportation, health care, public lands, energy policy,
and telecommunications interests.<P>

both the Ready Reserve Fleet and the private, U.S.-flag merchant

Coastwise Laws</b> <p>

<p>

Introduction<p>

Title I of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 declares, in part, that the national defense and the
development of domestic commerce of the United States require a merchant marine sufficient to
carry the nation's domestic waterborne commerce.  A number of federal laws guide this policy,
including several that restrict domestic commerce to vessels that are constructed in the United
States , owned by U.S. citizens, and registered under the U.S. flag.  While actual interpretation
and enforcement of those laws is the responsibility of the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S.
Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration (MARAD) is concerned with their effect on the
national programs that it administers. Accordingly, MARAD is frequently the first of the three
agencies to be contacted on questions concerning the coastwise laws.<p>

	This pamphlet has been prepared as an aid to better understand the origin, purpose and content of
the coastwise laws. It is not intended to be an exhaustive treatment of the subject. Accordingly,
MARAD of the Department of Transportation, and the United States Government do not
represent this summary discussion of the major coastwise laws as determinative with regard to
any particular set of facts requiring construction or interpretation of the pertinent statutes and
regulations implementing the coastwise laws.  Readers are urged to consult the cited statutes
(United States Code) and regulations (Code of Federal Regulations) for their full text as well as
rulings of the U.S. Customs Service or U.S. Coast Guard for interpretations applicable to specific
situations.<p>

General inquiries concerning this publication or the coastwise laws may be made to:<p>

Shipping, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590 Tel: (202) 366-4357 Fax: (202)

<p>

<b>The Coastwise Laws</b><p>

<i>Q.</i>  <i>What is the Jones Act?</i><p>

A.  As popularly used, the term refers to several U.S. laws that govern the domestic
transportation of merchandise and passengers by water.  Strictly speaking, it applies only to
Section 27 of the Merchant Marine of 1920 [46 U.S.C. 883; 19 CFR 4.80 and 4.80(b)] which has
come to bear the name of its sponsor, Senator Wesley L. Jones.<p>

<i>Q. Whip does Section 27 do?</i><p>

A.  Basically, it provides that merchandise transported entirely or partly by water between U.S.
points--either directly or via a foreign point--must travel in U.S.-built, U.S.-citizen owned vessels
that are U.S.-documented by the Coast Guard for such carriage.<p>

<i>Q. Does Section 27 apply to passengers as well?<p>

</i>A. No. However, another law enacted in 1886 requires essentially the same standards for the
transport of passengers between U.S. points [46 App. U.S.C. 289; 19 CFR 4.80(a)].<p>

<i>Q. Are there similar laws affecting other kinds of marine activity?<p>

</i>A. Yes. <i>Fishing </i>in U.S. territorial waters and the Fishery Conservation Zone (3-200 miles from
the territorial sea baseline) may be conducted only by U.S.-built and documented vessels (with
fishery license or endorsement). However, in the Fishery Conservation Zone, fishing may be
conducted by foreign fishing vessels holding permits from the National Marine Fisheries Service. 
Except as otherwise provided by treaty, foreign vessels may not land in U.S. ports any fish
caught or received on the high seas (16 CFR 4.96, 10.78 and 10.79).<i> Towing </i>in U.S. harbors or
between U.S. points must be performed by a U.S.-built and documented tug, except where the
towed vessel is in distress (46 U.S.C. App. 316; 19 CFR 4.92). <i>Salvage </i>operations in U.S. waters
must be performed by U.S. documented vessels (not necessarily U.S.-built), except as provided
by treaty or unless the Customs Service is satisfied that no suitable U.S. vessel is available (46
U.S.C. 316(d); 19 CFR 4.97).  <i>Dredging</i> in U.S. waters must be performed by a U.S.-built and
document dredge (PL 100-329).<p>

<i>Q. Is there a name for such laws?</i><p>

A.  They are known collectively as "coastwise laws."  The word "cabotage" is probably derived
from the French word "caboter" meaning to sail coastwise or "by the capes."<p>

<i>Q. Was the Jones Act the first law of its kind?<p>

</i>A. No. There have been cabotage laws in this country since 1789. The first one imposed a fee
upon foreign build vessels operating in the coastal trades and fisheries and gave U.S.-built and
U.S.-owned vessels preferential treatment with respect to tonnage taxes and cargo import duties.<p>

<i>Q. Do other countries have cabotage laws?<p>

</i>A. Most major trading nations of the world have or have had cabotage laws of some kind (See
MARAD publication, By the Capes Around the World: A Summary of World Cabotage
Practices.)<p>

<i>Q. What is the purpose of having such laws?<p>

</i>A. The broad purposes, common to most countries, are to assure reliable domestic shipping
service and the existence of a maritime capability that is completely subject to national control in
times of war or national emergency.  Vessel construction and repair in domestic yards helps to
sustain these critical national mobilization capabilities. The freight money earned by these
vessels remains in the national economy as opposed to being exported, while public revenues
benefit from both corporate and personal tax receipts. Requirements for citizen crews provide
employment and develop a cadre of trained and experienced seafarers.  In the United States, the
business opportunities guaranteed by these laws has encouraged high risk, pioneering shipping
innovations such as integrated tug/barge combinations, containerization, and high speed roll-on/roll-off vessels.<p>

<i>Q.  Do U.S. cabotage laws apply uniformly throughout the country and its territories and
possessions?</i><p>

A.  Not entirely.  For example, American Samoa is fully exempt, and the Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands is exempt, except with regard to the activities of the United States
government and its contractors in the Northern Mariana Islands (48 U.S.C. 1664; Pub. L. 94-241,
Article V).  The Virgin Islands are exempt until declared otherwise by Presidential Proclamation
(46 App. U.S.C. 877).  Foreign-built, U.S. flag vessels may operate between Guam, American
Samoa, Wake, Midway or Kingman Reef and other U.S. ports (46 U.S. C 12105).  Passengers
may travel between the U.S. mainland and Puerto Rico on a foreign-flag passenger vessel,
provided there is no eligible U.S. vessel offering such service [46 U.S.C. 289(c)].<p>

<i>Q. Are there other kinds of exceptions to the coverage of the cabotage laws?</i><p>

A. Yes. There are several provisos in Section 27 which have been added over the years to address
conditions deemed by  Congress to warrant special treatment.  Topics covered include service on
the Yukon River; established ferry services owned by railroads; joint U.S. and Canadian
rail/water movements; carriage of empty cargo accessory equipment; transfers of cargo between
ship borne barges of the same owner; and transport of fish processing supplies.<p>

<i>Q. Are there any circumstances under which a foreign-built vessel may operate in U.S. domestic
service?</i><p>

A. A foreign-built or foreign-flagged vessel wrecked in U.S. waters, when it is salvaged and
rebuilt in the United States, may be reflagged and awarded domestic operating authority if the
cost of the rebuilding is at least three times the appraised value of the vessel <i>immediately
following salvage</i> (46 U.S.C. 14). Also, a foreign-built or foreign-flagged vessel which is
captured in war by citizens of the United States and lawfully condemned as prize, or adjudged to
be forfeited for a violation of U.S. law, becomes eligible for reflagging with domestic operating
authority (46 U.S.C. 12106-08).<p>

<i>Q.  What requirements must be met by a vessel for it to be considered as built in the United
States?</i><p>

A.  For documentation purposes, the U.S. Coast guard considers a vessel to be built in the United
States if all major components of its hull and superstructure are fabricated in the United States,
and the vessel is assembled entirely in the United States (46 CFR Part 67).<p>

<i>Q. If a U.S.-built vessel is operated under foreign registry, can it return to U.S. registry with
domestic trading privileges?<p>

</i>A. It can return to U.S. registry but it loses its domestic trading privileges.  Any period of foreign
registry makes a vessel permanently ineligible to operate in U.S. domestic trade (46 U.S.C. 883).
However, there have been instances in which Congress enacted special legislation to restore
domestic trading privileges of U S. -built, reflagged vessels.<p>

<i>Q. Can a U.S.-built vessel that is rebuilt over seas keep or regain its domestic trading
privileges?<p>

</i>A. Foreign rebuilding of a vessel of 500 or more gross tons disqualifies it for any subsequent
employment in the domestic trades (46 App. U.S.C. 883).  Determination of when rebuilding has
occurred requires a technical assessment by the U.S. Coast Guard.<p>

<i>Q. Are there any circumstances under which a U.S. corporation owned by non-citizens may own
and operate vessels in U.S. domestic trade.?<p>

</i>A. Yes. Under the provisions of the "Bowaters Act," a 1958 amendment to the Jones Act (46
App. U.S.C. 883-1) corporations that are organized under the laws of the United States, owned
by non-citizens, and primarily engaged in the manufacturing or mineral industries may transport
their proprietary cargo on their own or chartered barges.  To be eligible for documentation under
the laws of the United States under the Bowaters amendment, a self-propelled vessel
(tug/towboat) must be less than 500 gross tons.<p>

<i>Q.  What Federal agency is responsible for administration of vessel documentation?</i><p>

A.  The Merchant Vessel Inspection Division, Office of Merchant Marine Safety, Security and
Environmental Protection, U.S. Coast Guard, 2100 2nd Street, S.W., Washington, DC 20593,
Tel.:  (202) 267-1492, has overall responsibility.  Individual Coast Guard District Offices have
specific authority within their areas of jurisdiction.<p>

<i>Q. Do the cabotage laws apply to points located on the U.S. Outer</i> <i>Continental Shelf (OCS)?<p>

</i>A. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) (43 U.S.C. 1333) provided for extension of
certain U.S. laws to the OCS. The Customs Service has ruled that they apply to mobile drilling
rigs during the period that the rigs are secured to or submerged on the OCS (TD 54281, 1/9/57). 
Subsequent Customs rulings have applied the laws to drilling platforms, artificial islands, and
similar structures, and to warehouse vessels anchored at a point over the OCS when these vessels
are used to resupply drilling rigs on the OCS.<p>

<i>Q. What is the practical effect of such rulings?<p>

</i>A. The effect has been to require that water transportation of merchandise and personnel between
such structures and vessels, and between them and U.S. points not on the OCS, be accomplished
by U.S.-built, U.S.-owned, and U.S.-documented vessels.       <p>

<i>Q. Which office of the Customs Service deals with interpretation and enforcement of the
cabotage laws?<p>

</i>A.  The International Trade Compliance Division, U .S. Customs Service, 1301 Constitution
Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20220, Tel.:  (202) 482-6920, is responsible for interpreting
and enforcing the cabotage laws. Formal requests for ruling must be submitted in writing.
Informal requests for advice on proposed activities may be made to the Entry and Carrier Rulings
Branch of that Division, Tel.: (202) 482-7040.<p>

<i>Q.  Under what circumstances may foreign cruise ships conduct cruises from U.S. ports?</i><p>

A.  If a passenger leaves a vessel at the same port where boarding took place, there has been no
transportation <i>between</i> U.S. points.  Vessel calls at intermediate U.S. points in the course of a
single cruise are also allowable, provided that no passenger permanently leaves the vessel at any
of those ports and that a call is made at one or more foreign ports.  However, if the cruise
itinerary includes a call at a foreign port sufficiently far from the United States (as for example in
South America, Europe, Asia or Africa), a passenger may permanently leave the vessel at any
subsequent U.S. port.  When a passenger boards and leaves a vessel at the same U.S. point, and
the vessel touches no other U.S. or foreign points but merely goes on a so-called "voyage to
nowhere," the coastwise passenger law is not violated if the vessel proceeds beyond U.S.
territorial waters into the high seas or foreign waters (19 CFR 4.80(a)). This is not true, however,
for passengers aboard a charter fishing vessel, since such vessels are considered to be engaged in
coastwise trade, even though their itinerary may be identical to that of a cruise vessel on a
"voyage to nowhere."  Charter fishing boats must satisfy the same U.S. construction and
ownership requirements as any other vessel in coastwise trade.<p>

<i>Q. Is there any provision for waiver of the cabotage laws?<p>

</i>A. There is provision for administrative waiver by the Treasury Department (Customs Service) <i>in
the interest of national defense</i> (64 Stat. 1129).  Waivers may also be accomplished through
special legislation.  Neither process has been extensively used. If the Secretary of Defense states
that a waiver is in the interest of national defense, Treasury <i>must</i> grant it. Treasury <i>may </i>grant a
waiver on its own initiative or upon the written recommendation of the head of any other
government agency when such a waiver is deemed by Treasury to be in the interest of national
defense. Few waivers have been granted for purely commercial shipping activities; most have
been to accommodate governmental activity. <p>

A.  Have there been any recent amendments to the Jones Act?<p>

A.  Yes.  In 1988, Congress passed Public Law 100-329 that extended the requirement for U.S.-flag registry to any tow or vessel transporting valueless material or any dredged material between
a point in the United States and a point within the Exclusive Economic Zone or between points in
the Exclusive Economic Zone.<p>

<p>
        <I>The Maritime Administration as the U. S. Government's 
commercial shipbuilding advocate has established the National 
Maritime Resource and Education Center to assist the U.S. shipbuilding 
and allied industries in improving their competitiveness in the 
international commercial market. The center will be a major 
information source and facilitator within the government for 
the maritime industry by providing expertise, information and 
reference material on commercial shipbuilding. <P>
        
        The Center's near term focus is presented, but this 
is just the beginning of a continuous process to acquire and 
maintain marine standards, develop and conduct seminars and 
workshops, and provide other information to assist the industry.
The Center's program will adapt to meet those industry needs as 
they are identified. We will promote positive interaction between 
the industry and MARAD. We encourage input and recommendations from 
industry on ways to improve the Center's programs.<P> 

        MARAD will serve as the focal point within government, 
working closely within other government agencies and departments, 
standards developers and regulatory bodies and the marine industry, 
to move America forward in the international commercial maritime market.</I><P>

marine industry by identifying registrars and through seminars and 
workshops on the program.<P>

        Seminars, symposia and workshops will be developed and 
conducted on a variety of topics such as standards, regulations and 
environmental concerns. Materials and programs will be developed for 
skilled labor training in new technologies. They will be based on 
industry desires and inputs and conducted with participation of 
industry plus appropriate government agencies and departments.<P>

        MARAD will be working closely with standards developing 
bodies and the USCG to facilitate adoption of voluntary consensus 
standards, both international and domestic, in lieu of regulations.<P>

        Support will be provided to the U.S. Technical Advisory Group 
(TAG) to the International Standards Organization's Committee on Ships 
and Marine Technology(ISO/TC-8). This is the official representative 
group to ISO and chartered by American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) who is the U.S. member body to both ISO and International 
electrotechnical Commision(IEC). MARAD will take the lead, with the 
assistance of other departments and agencies to provide administrative 
support to the tag to insure our continued active participation and 
the dissemination of the information which is key to promoting U.S. 
interests in the development of international standards. The U.S. 
has assumed an increased leadership role in ISO and holds several
key leadership positions, including representing ISO in the 
International Association of Ports and Harbors.<P>

        MARAD is updating its "standard specifications" with today's
requirements. The last issue dated 1979 was aimed at ships built under
the construction differential subsidy(CDS) program. <I><B>The new version 
is a guideline metric specification for merchant ship construction 
to help U.S. shipyards in the export business</B></I>. This guideline concept 
references international, foreign and domestic commercial standards. 
These new guidelines will not prevent owner modification or tailoring 
for his particular needs; however, they will be compatible with 
current technology and satisfy current regulations. This guide, 
together with standard pro forma contracts being developed by MARAD 
based on industry inputs, should be valuable to both U.S. shipyards 
and potential foreign owners (buyers).<P>

        There is probably no more critical area to the marine industry
than environmentally responsible standards and regulations. We will be 
working with the USCG and the TAG to ISO/TC-8 in this critical area and 
will be an information source for marine environmental protection 
information.<P>

<HR>              <H3 ALIGN=CENTER>WORLD WAR II</H3>    <P>In
World War II, civilian-crewed U.S. cargo ships controlled by the
War Shipping Administration carried about 75 percent of shipments
from the United States.  Total cargo lifted between December 7,
1941, and the capitulation of Japan was approximately 300.5
million short tons.  The U.S.-flag merchant fleet also carried
the great majority of military personnel and civilians moving
overseas and returning to the United States during and after the
war.</P>      <P>Many civilian American seafarers made the
ultimate sacrifice; more than 6,000 were killed, and 733 American
cargo ships were lost to enemy action.  Thousands more seafarers
were injured during attacks, and nearly 600 were held as
prisoners of war.</P>      <P>Gen. Eisenhower and other Allied
war leaders praised America's civilian seafarers for their
heroism. General Douglas MacArthur said, "I hold no branch in
higher esteem than the Merchant Marine services."</P>    <!--

ALIGN=CENTER>KOREAN WAR</H3>    <P>Approximately 31.5 million
measurement tons of supplies were shipped from the United States
to the Far East during the Korean War.</P>      <P>About 95
percent of these supplies were shipped by sea, with 80 percent
carried by privately owned U.S.-flag merchant ships, and 15
percent by Military Sea Transportation Service ships -- all
crewed by civilian American citizen seafarers. </P>    <!--

ALIGN=CENTER> VIETNAM</H3>    <P>Privately owned U.S.-flag
merchant ships delivered 65 percent of the dry cargo shipments to
support American forces in Vietnam, and Government-owned ships
carried the balance. </P>     <P>The Maritime Administration
activated 172 World War II era Victory ships from its National
Defense Reserve Fleet.  Some 15,000 U.S. citizen merchant
mariners crewed the vessels.  Cargoes totaled more than 85
million measurement tons.</P>    <!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->
<HR>       <H3 ALIGN=CENTER>OPERATIONS DESERT SHIELD/DESERT
STORM</H3>    <P>During the Persian Gulf war, 95 percent of the
total cargo needed to support Allied forces went by sea. 
U.S.-flag ships crewed by American citizen seafarers transported
nearly 80 percent of the oceanborne cargoes.  These ships
included privately owned merchant ships in commercial service,
chartered ships, and 79 Ready Reserve Force (RRF) ships.  </P>   
  <P>On short notice, more than 3,000 civilian seafarers
volunteered to crew the RRF ships.  Merchant mariners who served
in the Persian Gulf war zone were awarded the Merchant Marine
Expeditionary Medal.  Their service also was recognized by their
inclusion in the victory parade which followed the war.  </P>    
 <P>President Bush said at the time, "The recent coalition
victory in the Persian Gulf has demonstrated, once again, the
importance of the American merchant marine to maintaining an
adequate and reliable sea lift capacity for the United
States."</P>      <P>General Colin Powell said "Since I became
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff, I have come to appreciate
first-hand why our merchant marine has long been called the
nation's fourth arm of defense.  </P>     <P> "The American
seafarer provides an essential service to the well-being of the
nation, as was demonstrated so clearly during Operations Desert
Shield and Desert Storm."</P>    <!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->
<HR>           <H3 ALIGN=CENTER>OPERATION RESTORE HOPE
SOMALIA</H3>    <P>In 1992, three Ready Reserve Force vessels
were activated to support the United Nation's humanitarian and
peacekeeping operations in Somalia.  These included  two offshore
petroleum discharge system (OPDS) tankers, the AMERICAN OSPREY
and POTOMAC.  The TS EMPIRE STATE, normally used for training
students at the New York State Maritime Academy, was activated to
repatriate troops from Somalia.</P>      <P>In 1994, the Maritime
Administration activated 14 of its Ready Reserve Force vessels,
this time to support Operation Support Democracy in Haiti.  The
ships transported military cargo from various U.S. ports to
Port-au-Prince, Haiti.  All were fully crewed by a total of more
than 400 civilian American seafarers and were operational within
four days of being requested, ahead of the military's activation
requirement.</P>      <P>General John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, praised the "flawless, timely
response" of everyone involved in activating the RRF ships to
support American troops serving in Haiti.</P>    <!-- Horizontal

QUICK LIFT<BR> and OPERATION ENDEAVOR<BR> BOSNIA</H3>    <P>In
June 1995, two Ready Reserve Force ships were activated to
support NATO peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia.  The CAPE RACE and
CAPE DIAMOND carried more than 92 percent of the cargo
transferred from the United Kingdom to Croatia.  This included
2,015 military vehicles, 232 containers and 3,629 pallets of
breakbulk cargo. </P>      <P>On December 1, 1995, the CAPE RACE
was again activated to support NATO activities in Bosnia, this
time in support of Operation Quick Endeavor.  A sistership, the
CAPE RISE, also was called into service.</P>  <!-- Horizontal

                 Customer Service Plan Update


*    How Well Have We Done Our Job ? 


     We have evaluated the six standards which comprise our
     commitment to you.  We have effectively met our
     commitments to you.  You have indicated that we have
     successfully fulfilled our commitments.

     We have met our overall goal of expediting our review of
     Title XI applications, with the large majority processed
     within the 60 day timeframe, a significant improvement
     from prior years.  We are continuing to refine our
     processing procedures. 



*    What Have We Done ?

     In fiscal year 1995, we approved 14 new applications for
     Title XI financing.  The total cost of these projects is
     about $500 million with a related guarantee is
     approximately $436.9 million.



*    What Have You Told Us ?  

     Avondale Industries and National Steel and Shipbuilding
     Company have each stated that, as a result of the
     modernization of their facilities, there will be cost
     savings for both and naval ship construction.

     Industry comments on the proposed changes to the Title XI
     regulations clearly support MARAD's efforts to improve
     our administrative procedures.


Highlights for 1994 and 1995

1)   The first ocean going export financing project.  The
     project involved the construction of 4 product tankers
     for Fleves Shipping Corporation at a cost of
     approximately $152 million.  This project is expected to
     support 500 jobs at Newport News Shipbuilding.  

2)   Shipyard modernization projects which totalled $46,320,00
     for Avondale Industries, Inc. and National Steel and
     Shipbuilding Company were approved.  

3)   The construction of 4 double-hulled product tankers for
     American Heavy Lift Shipping Company by Avondale
     Industries was approved.  The vessels will be the first
     U.S. flag tankers constructed for the domestic trade in
     over ten years.  They will fully comply with the Oil
     Pollution Act of 1990.  This project is expected to
     support 300 jobs at American Heavy Lift Shipping Company
     and 900 jobs at the shipyard, Avondale Industries.      

4)   We have proposed changes to our regulations to improve
     the processing of Title XI applications.

<a><center><h4><b>FREQUENTLY ASKED TITLE XI QUESTIONS</b></h4></center></a>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<pre>
<b>Q:    Does the Program provide funds similar to bank financing?</b>

A:    No, the Program is a guarantee program and not a direct loan
      program.  Funds are secured in the private sector with repayment
      guaranteed by the U.S. Government.  However, the review process and
      documentation are similar in nature to private sector transactions.


<b>Q:    What projects are eligible?</b>

A:    Construction, reconstruction and reconditioning of commercial
      vessels in U.S. shipyards.  U.S. shipyard modernization projects and
      certain refinancings.


<b>Q:    Who is eligible?</b>

A:    U.S. or foreign shipowners and U.S. shipyards.


<b>Q:    What is the length of the financing?</b>

A:    Up to 25 years depending on the project.


<b>Q:    What level of financing is available?</b>

A:    Up to 87 1/2 percent depending on the project.


<b>Q:    What is the normal amortization schedule?</b>

A:    The guaranteed debt is generally repaid through equal semi-annual
      payments of principal plus accrued interest (level principal).


<b>Q:    Are foreign components eligible for financing?</b>

A:    Yes, certain foreign items can be included in the costs to be
      financed.


<b>Q:    How is the interest rate determined?</b>

A:    The interest rate is set by the private sector which generally
      utilizes comparable U.S. Treasury obligations as a benchmark for
      rate determination.  Historically, the interest rate has been fixed
      for the entire term of the financing.


<b>Q:    How long is the application processing time?</b>

A:    Approximately 60 days from the date the application is determined to
      be complete by the Maritime Administration (MARAD).


<b>Q:    What are the costs of using the Program?</b>

A:    The Program fees include application fee, investigation fee and
      annual guarantee fee.  In addition, costs may be incurred to
      complete the application, document the transaction and place the
      debt obligation.

<H3><CENTER>ORIGIN OF<br> THE MARITIME ADMINISTRATION</CENTER></H3>
<p>     
<hr>
<p>
The Maritime Administration is the successor of several government agencies 
dating back to the establishment of the independent U.S. Shipping Board 
in 1916.  Executive Order 6166 made the Shipping Board part of the
Department of Commerce in 1933.  However, in 1936, following passage of 
the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, the maritime function was again made 
independent with the establishment of the United States Maritime Commission.
Reorganization Plan 21 of 1950 abolished the United States Maritime 
Commission and, among other things, established the Maritime Administration 
within the Department of Commerce. The Maritime Administration was 
transferred to the Department of Transportation in 1981 as a result of 
Public Law 97-31, approved August 6, 1981.

<center><h1>Marad '95 Report Introduction</h1></center>

<p>

<i>     The Annual Report of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) for the fiscal year (FY) which ended on
September 30, 1995, is submitted to Congress in accordance with Section 208 of the Merchant Marine Act
of 1936, as amended.<p>

<p>

	</i>During FY 1995, MARAD continued to provide strong support to the Administration's efforts to ensure
America's future as a maritime nation.<i><p>

<p>

</i>    MARAD published<i> </i>its <i>Strategic Plan</i> in FY 1995.  This comprehensive statement of the mission, goals,
and objectives of the Agency categorizes a broad spectrum of Federal responsibilities into clearly
recognizable objectives and provides a focus for future service to the Nation. The MARAD strategic plan
supports the broader goals set forth in the Department of Transportation (DOT) strategic plan as they
pertain to maritime affairs and to the maritime elements of the national intermodal transportation system.
Action plans for specific activities designed to implement the strategic plan also provide the basis for
periodic progress reviews between the Maritime Administrator and the Deputy Secretary of
Transportation.  <i><p>

</i><p>

	President Bill Clinton and Secretary of Transportation Federico Pe&ntilde;a resubmitted to Congress legislation
that would establish a Maritime Security Program (MSP) providing operating assistance for approximately
50 U.S.-flag liner vessels serving in foreign trade, providing the participating carriers  enroll in an
Emergency Preparedness Program established to provide intermodal sealift support in time of war or
national emergency.  The commercial transportation resources to be provided would include shipping
capacity, intermodal equipment, terminal facilities, and management services.  By the end of FY 1995,
authorizing committees in both the House and Senate passed legislative initiatives (H.R. 1350 and S. 1139)
similar to that proposed by the Administration. <p>

<p>

	MARAD also assisted the U.S. shipbuilding industry through the approval of 14 applications under the
Federal ship financing (Title XI) program.  They cover the construction of 36 commercial vessels in
American shipyards and the second shipyard modernization project approved under the program. <p>

FY 1995 approved guarantees total $437 million and will generate more than $500 million in shipyard
activity.<p>

<p>

	MARAD continued working with the Advanced Research Projects Administration's MARITECH program
which is leveraging limited Government funding into significant cooperative research and development
projects.  Eighteen U.S. shipbuilding companies are involved in 24 projects awarded this fiscal year.<p>

	<p>

	MARAD and the U.S. Transportation Command developed the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement
(VISA) to promote and facilitate the Department of Defense's (DODs)  use of existing commercial
integrated intermodal transportation systems and to maximize DOD's use of commercial transportation
resources, while minimizing disruption to commercial operations.  It provides a seamless, time-phased
transition from peace to wartime operations through coordinated, pre-negotiated contracts for the type and
quantity of sealift, when and where necessary, to deploy and sustain U.S. forces.<p>

<p>

	The United States and Brazil concluded negotiations on a new 3-year maritime agreement.  The
agreement assures U.S.-flag carriers equal access to Brazilian government cargoes and reaffirms the commitment of
both countries to continue liberalizing their maritime trade. <p>

<p>
	MARAD cosponsored a National Conference on the Intermodal Terminal of the Future attended
by public and private sector transportation representatives.  The conference provided an interactive
forum on innovative terminal designs, emerging information technology, new partnerships, and global
economics.<p>

<p>

	MARAD created its Office of Environmental Activities to help improve the environmental quality
of maritime activities.  <p>

<p>

	In coordination with the National Dredging Team, the Agency assisted in developing a National
Dredging Policy Action Plan, which was endorsed by President Clinton.  Recommendations were
submitted to Secretary Pe&ntilde;a in a report, <i>The Dredging Process in the United States:  An Action Plan
for Improvement.</i><p>

<p>

	Also in FY 1995, MARAD prepared customer service plans and brochures for its electronic
bulletin board (MARlinespike), its National Maritime Resource and Education Center (NMREC), and the
U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. <p>

<b><p>

	</b>MARAD formed NMREC to assist the U.S. shipbuilding, ship repair, and associated industries
to improve their international competitiveness.  The Agency also established a Computer Aided Design
(CAD) Component Library which includes 2-dimensional CAD files collected from two diesel engine
manufacturers and the Marine Industry Standards Library which makes international, foreign, and
domestic standards available, as well as information pertaining to standards.  Access to each of these
customer service tools is available via MARlinespike.<p>

<p>

	Additionally, MARAD developed a prototype World Wide Web home page and information
service.  It includes information about the Agency's mission and structure, the importance of the
maritime industry, and maritime issues and legislation.  (The Agency formally announced WWW
service on October 5, 1995.  MARAD's home page address is <i>http://marad.dot.gov</i>.).<p>

<p>

	This report contains details on these activities and many other efforts by the Maritime
Administration to support the Nation's maritime policy and the goals of the Administration.<p>

<h3><center>INTRODUCTION</center></h3>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
This edition of the <i>Report to Congress on the Status of the Public Ports of the United States</i>,
covering calendar years 1994 and 1995, discusses the U.S. public port industry's economic
activities and the critical issues facing it.  The U.S. port system is a vital element in our
national transportation system and an important contributor to our national economy and
security.  U.S. ports handle over 95 percent of the Nation's foreign trade and over two billion
tons of foreign and domestic waterborne commerce.  The trade that flows through the port
system provides significant economic benefits to the U.S. economy at all levels--local,
regional, and national.  
<p>
The first section of this report provides an overview of the U.S. public port industry.  It
addresses five fundamental areas that provide a picture of this industry's economic importance
and current capabilities.  The first area describes the industry's national economic impact
based on 1994 activity.  The second area details the volume and composition of the waterborne
commerce handled by our port system.  The third area profiles the port facilities that handle
the foreign and domestic commerce.  The fourth area reviews the industry's capital
investments in shoreside infrastructure and the funding sources used to finance this
development program.  The final area of this section provides a view of the port industry's
financial strength based on a recently completed survey by the industry. 
<p>
The second section of this report discusses the key issues facing the U.S. port industry.  The
most noticeable aspect of this subject is the complexity and broad range of issues.  The
industry's major concerns focus on financing facility development, new generation of
containerships, global shipping alliances, environmental regulation, dredging and dredged
material disposal and improving intermodal access to marine terminals through the
reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA).
<p>
The final section describes several related developments of interest or concern to the port
industry.  This year's report includes matters pertaining to improved maritime trade
opportunities within North America, military use of commercial ports and intermodal
transportation, and the conveyance of surplus Federal property for use by public ports.
<p>
The U.S. public port industry's future success lies with its ability to address and resolve the
critical issues facing it.  The accomplishment of this task will require planning and cooperation
by the industry and with those segments of government and industry that regulate, use, and
benefit from the port industry's activities.

<h3><center>APPENDIX-C: NEW MARITIME ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON<BR>  
U.S. PUBLIC PORT PROFITABILITY AND SELF-SUFFICIENCY</center></h3>
</b>
<p>
In fall 1996, MARAD will be publishing a new report, <i>Another Look at Public Port
Profitability and Self-Sufficiency</i>, which analyzes public port profitability from 1985 to 1994. 
The report evaluates profitability by port region, size (measured by both gross operating
revenue and net investment in plant, property and equipment), type of operation, type of
governmental agency, and extent of planning.  For the purpose of the study, a port has been
defined as being profitable and self-sufficient if it has a net profit before the collection of taxes
and contributions, donations, grants, and subsidies.

<a><center><b>SHIP OPERATIONS COOPERATIVE PROGRAM</b></center></a>
<p>
<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
     The Ship Operations Cooperative Program was established in
April 1993 with the signing of a Cooperative Agreement between
three U.S. shipping companies (ARCO Marine, Energy Transportation
Corporation, and Sea-Land Service) and two government agencies
(Maritime Administration and National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration).  Since then several new members, with full
membership and associate membership status have signed on.  
<p>     
     The purpose of the SOCP is to address and promote commercially
beneficial innovations in ship operations through the
identification, development, and application of new methods,
procedures, and technologies.
<p>
     Its overall objective is to improve the competitiveness,
productivity, efficiency, safety, and environmental responsiveness
of U.S. vessel operations.  All U.S. vessel operators are eligible
to participate in the program.  With the support of MARAD, industry
and government work together to address common challenges and to
cooperative program allows members to participate in research which
would not be economically feasible on an individual basis.  The
specific objectives of SOCP are to:
<p>     
     1.   Bring together on a continuing basis
          representatives from U.S. shipping
          organizations who are responsible for ship
          operations.
<p>     
     2.   Determine common problems and interests among
          the cooperative's members.
<p>
     3.   Make recommendations concerning cooperative
          actions which might be taken to resolve
          problems by implementing applicable technology
          or training initiatives.
<p>
     4.   Develop implementation plans for the
          performance of individual projects which are
          approved by the membership.
<p>
     5.   Make recommendations to regulatory or
          legislative agencies in the interest of
          maritime safety and the maritime industry,
          based on its collective knowledge and/or the
          results of SOCP projects.
<p>
Several projects have been completed or are currently underway that
lend themselves to these objectives.  They are:
<p>
Current Projects:
<p>
     .    <b>Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM)
          Database</b> - This program to improve the Reliability,
          Availability, and Maintainability of ship's equipment
          will develop and implement a system to collect ship's
          equipment failure/corrective maintenance data and store
          it in a central repository.  Member companies will have
          access to this data for making decisions on improving the
          reliability of their vessel's equipment to reduce vessel
          life-cycle costs.  The participation of marine equipment
          manufacturers and U.S. shipyards is currently being
          solicited to close the feedback loop.
<p>
     .    <b>Multimedia Training - USCG/ABS Shipboard Inspection
          Primer</b> - Two U.S. Coast Guard partnership programs,
          Alternate Compliance Program (ACP) and Streamlined
          Inspection Process (SIP) currently exist in an effort to
          improve the overall vessel inspection process.  The SOCP
          is developing a Multimedia Training Program to instruct
          shipboard officers on how to gain a better understanding
          of the inspection processes and criteria, prepare more
          efficiently for inspections, and conduct vessel self
<p>
     .    <b>Regulatory Research and Analysis</b> - The objective of this
          project is to identify U.S. regulations classified as
          high cost for the ship/vessel operator.  The research
          would include not only existing regulations, but also
          proposed regulations and would define specific
          applications of technology that could reduce the expense
          of compliance.  The analysis would also make
          recommendations for other actions which could be taken to
          reduce costs.

<b>CURRENT SOCP PROJECTS</b>
<p>
<b>RAM Database</b>
<p>
This program to improve the Reliability, 
Availability and Maintainability (RAM) of 
ship's equipment will develop and implement a 
system to collect ship's equipment 
failuret/corrective maintenance data and store

<b>Multimedia Training - USCG/ABS 
Shipboard Inspection Primer</b>
<p>
Two U.S. Coast Guard partnership programs, 
Alternate Compliance Program (ACP) and 
Streamlined Inspection Process (SIP) currently 
exist in an effort to improve the overall vessel 
inspection process. In this vein, the SOCP is 
developing a Multimedia Training Program to 
instruct shipboard officers in how to gain a 
better understanding of the inspection 
processes and criteria, prepare more 
efficiently for inspections, and conduct vessel 
self inspections to USCG/ABS 
specifications. 
<p>

<p>
                    

<b>OTHER CURRENT PROJECTS</b> 
<p>
<b>USCG Regulatory Reform</b>
<p>
The SOCP and its members are participating in 
the development of the Coast Guard's programs 
that help ease the burden of regulatory 
compliance and improve industry 
competitiveness. The main programs are 
Alternate Compliance Program (ACP), the 
Streamlined Inspection Process (SIP), 4C's 
QIT, and the Industry Task Force on Pacific 
Rim Consistency. The SOCP will present the 
lessons learned and successes of these pilot 
programs to the USCG to help formulate a more cost effective
Continuous Inspection Process (CIP).
<p>
<b>Regulatory Research and Analysis</b>
<p>
The objective of this project is to identify U.S. 
regulations classified as high cost for the 
ship/vessel operator. The research would include 
not only existing regulations, but also proposed 
regulations and would define specific 
applications of technology that could reduce the 
expense of compliance. The analysis would also 
make recommendations for other actions which

<A><CENTER><H4>MARAD '95 ANNUAL REPORT</h4></center></a>
<a><center><b><h4>Chapter 1: National Security</h4></b></center></a>
<hr><p>

  The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is responsible for assuring that 
merchant shipping is available in times of war or national emergency.  
MARAD administers programs to meet sealift requirements determined by 
the Department of Defense (DOD) and conducts related national security 
activities.<p>

<p>

  The Agency maintains  inactive, Government-owned vessels in the National 
Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF) and its Ready Reserve Force (RRF) component.  
The RRF was created to maintain a surge shipping and resupply capability 
available on short notice to support deployment of a multidivision force.<p>

<p>

  MARAD also conducts national security planning and operations in areas 
such as national emergency communications, war risk insurance, and port 
emergency operations.<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA)</b><p> 
 
  During fiscal year (FY) 1995, MARAD, together with the U.S. Transportation 
Command (USTRANSCOM), developed the VISA.  Terms of the VISA program were 
defined with the assistance of U.S.-flag carriers and maritime labor.  At the 
end of the reporting period, MARAD and USTRANSCOM were preparing to implement 
a 1-year prototype program.<p>

<p>

  The objectives of VISA are to promote and facilitate the DOD's use of 
existing commercial integrated intermodal transportation systems and to 
maximize use of commercial transportation resources, while minimizing 
disruption to commercial operations.  It provides a seamless, time-phased 
transition from peace to wartime operations through coordinated, 
pre-negotiated contracts for the type and quantity of sealift, when and 
where necessary, to deploy and sustain U.S. forces.<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF)</b><p>

  NDRF ships serve as an inactive reserve which can be activated to help 
meet U.S. shipping requirements during national emergencies.  These vessels 
are available for military emergencies.  MARAD maintains inactive merchant 
ships and naval auxiliaries in three Reserve fleet sites.  Retention vessels 
are under preservation, which normally includes dehumidification of interior 
spaces and cathodic (anticorrosion) protection of the hull.<p>

<p>

  As of September 30, 1995, the total number of vessels in MARAD custody 
was 296. (See Tables 1 and 2.)  Of these, 107 are located at Ft. Eustis, VA; 
51 at Beaumont, TX; 81 at Suisun Bay, CA; and 57 at other locations, 
including lay berths under contract in major U.S. port cities.<p>

<p>

  Of the 296 ships, 76 were being maintained on a cost- reimbursable basis.  
Such ships are maintained in various degrees of preservation depending on the requirements of the sponsors.  They are not in the
NDRF program and are being held for other Government agencies or MARAD's 
Title XI program.  Seventy-two of these are expected to be assigned to the 
NDRF or scrapped.<p>

<p>

  At the end of this reporting period, 155 ships, including those of the RRF, 
were being held as NDRF retention assets, maintained under preservation and 
available for activation. The remaining 65 were considered NDRF non-retention 
assets which were pending disposal or transfer.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Ready Reserve Force (RRF)</b><p>


  The RRF is a specific component of the retention NDRF which was established 
in 1976 by a Memorandum of Agreement between the DOD and MARAD.  RRF ships are 
kept in a higher state of readiness to enable them to be activated in 4, 5,
10, 20, or 30 days to meet surge military sealift requirements in the event of 
war, as was experienced in Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm.  Higher
priority vessels are maintained in a status which permits reliable activation 
within 4 days at their berth sites, allowing expedited loading of critical 
surge DOD equipment.<p>

<p>

  At the end of the reporting period, there were 92 ships in the RRF.<p>


  To meet the RRF readiness needs of DOD, the Outporting Program provides 
contracted lay berths for RRF ships near expected loading ports for defense 
cargoes.  At year's end, 32 RRF vessels were assigned to outport locations, 
with 14 on the East Coast, 8 on the Gulf Coast and 10 on the West Coast.<p>

<p>

  Two CAPE K-class Roll-on/Roll-off (RO/RO) ships were purchased in fiscal 
year (FY) 1995.  After upgrading, they will be added to the RRF.<p>

<p>
<hr>

<p>

<b>RRF Sea Trial and Dock Trial Program</b><p>

  Periodic, planned exercise of RRF vessels is vital to maintaining vessel 
readiness, especially in the absence of vessel operations.  MARAD's Sea Trial 
and Dock Trial Program provides prioritized rotation of all RRF ships to 
accomplish trials on a regular basis.<p>

<p>

  During FY 1995, 29 vessels successfully underwent sea trials, 15 in 
DOD-ordered notice or no-notice activations.  An additional seven vessels 
underwent dock trials during the year.  The significance of the program is 
reflected by  MARAD's success in recent vessel activations in support of 
DOD missions.<p>
<hr>

<p>
<p>

<b>RRF Expands Use Of Maintenance Crews</b>
<p>

  In 1994 MARAD inaugurated a test program utilizing 10-person maintenance 
crews aboard vessels in 4-day reduced operational status (ROS-4). This 
combination crew of licensed and unlicensed personnel from all departments 
conducts preventative maintenance year-round and provides sufficient resources 
to activate RRF vessels without shipyard assistance.  <p>

<p>

  During FY 1995, activations of RRF vessels with ROS crews demonstrated both 
enhanced material condition of the vessels and increased readiness and 
reliability.  Many were activated in less time than had been assigned.<p>

<p>

  Based upon initial results, during the year MARAD and DOD increased the use 
of ROS maintenance crews from 8 to 29 vessels, thereby employing more than 
200 mariners.  DOD asked MARAD to develop a similar program for ROS-5 vessels, 
using 9-person ROS maintenance crews.<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>Improvements in Vessel Maintenance</b><p>

<p>

  MARAD initiated several RRF vessel maintenance improvements in FY 1995, 
including full application of the RRF Maintenance and Repair Tracking System.  
This maintenance program enhances the material condition of RRF vessels by 
permitting accurate tracking of vessel deficiencies and better application of
maintenance funding.  <p>

<p>

  MARAD also implemented a Water Chemistry and Treatment Program which 
enhances the reliability of all RRF and MARAD-owned schoolships by providing 
real-time analysis of the condition of water aboard the vessels.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Logistics</b>

<p>

  MARAD improved the level of logistics support for RRF vessels in FY 1995.  
Ten RRF vessels received logistics overhauls, and 7,291 items, with a value 
of $11,361,503, were procured from Federal and commercial supply sources.<p>

<p>

  An Agency-wide Shore-Based Spares system was implemented and will serve 
as the first source of supply for vessel repair parts and equipment 
requirements.<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>RRF Operations</b><p>

<p>

  The use of RRF vessels as DOD prepositioned assets continued in FY 1995.  
In FY 1994 the U.S. Army requested eight RRF vessels for operations for up 
to 3 years as part of the Army's Interim Brigade Afloat Force (AWR-3).  The 
fully-loaded vessels, stationed in ports halfway around the world, sortie 
on frequent training missions and participate in other military exercises. <p>

<p>

  Two Offshore Petroleum Discharge System (OPDS) tankers, AMERICAN OSPREY and 
POTOMAC, continued serving the Afloat Preposition Force (APF) mission at Diego 
Garcia, at Guam, and in the Mediterranean.  All prepositioned RRF ships are 
fully manned with or crewed by civilian U.S. merchant mariners.<p>

<p>

  In October 1994, seven RRF RO/ROs and the crane ship GOPHER STATE sailed 
to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation  VIGILANT WARRIOR and Operation 
VIGILANT SENTINEL. <p>

<p>

  Operation QUICK LIFT involved activation of the CAPE RACE and the CAPE DIAMOND to support
NATO peacekeeping activities in Bosnia.  USTRANSCOM ordered a "TURBO Activation" of the CAPE
RACE on June 22, 1995, from an ROS-4 layberth at Portsmouth, VA; it was activated in a record time of
23 hours.  The CAPE DIAMOND was activated June 29, 1995, from an ROS-4 layberth at Jacksonville,
FL.  The two ships carried more than 92 percent of the cargo transferred from the United Kingdom to
Croatia.  This included 2,015 military vehicles, 232 containers, and 3,629 pallets of breakbulk cargo in
support of Britain's 24th Air Mobile Brigade, which numbered approximately 4,275 troops.<p>

<p>

  VADM Philip Quast, Commander of the Military Sealift Command (MSC), commended the officers and
crew for their professionalism and exceptional performance.  The two ships were ghven the Maritime
Administrator's Professional Ship Award to underscore the contributions made in Operation QUICK LIFT.<p>

<p>

  Six RRF vessels successfully met their activation timetables in no-notice RRF test activations.  The ships
were the Auxiliary Crane Ships EQUALITY STATE and FLICKERTAIL STATE; the breakbulk ships CAPE
BRETON, CAPE GIBSON and CAPE JOHNSON; and the LASH vessel CAPE FAREWELL.<p>

<p>

<hr>

<p>

<b>RRF Command Post Exercise BREAKOUT-95</b><p>

<p>
  During FY 1995, MARAD, RRF ship managers, maritime labor unions, and over 2,600 mariners
participated in Command Post Exercise (CPX) BREAKOUT-95, to test crewing of the RRF.  Ship
managers and labor unions cooperated fully throughout the exercise.  <p>

  <p>

  It was conducted in a very compressed time frame which was reflected in aggressive crewing
requirements and accomplishments.  <p>

<p>

  It also provided a valuable picture of current crewing requirements and manning base to support a full
scale activation. <p>

<p>

  Major lessons learned from the exercise were:<p>

<p>

o  Discussions between MARAD, ship managers and maritime labor unions should be pursued to alleviate
manning burdens and meet time critical shortfalls.<p>

<p>

o  A MARAD-prototype seafarers' manpowermobilization program is a possible method to retain mariners
and keep their skills current on RRF ships.  A key element of this program would be development of a
comprehensive mariner tracking system.<p>

<p>

o  Public advertising is recognized as an effective tool MARAD should refine as a standard recruiting
procedure during a large-scale activation.<p>

<p>

o  Direct telephone contacts with mariners should be improved.<p>

<p>

o The 800 WATS telephone line proved very helpful in contacting mariners.  
A "crewing hotline" would be beneficial during a large-scale RRF activation.<p>

<p>

o  E-mail connectivity represents an effective means for smooth and timely exchange of information.
However, the systems need to be more fully developed and tested to ensure that all participants are
connected.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Emergency Operations</b>

<p>

  MARAD Advisories rapidly disseminate information on Government policy, danger and safety issues
pertaining to vessel operations, and other timely maritime matters.  In FY 1995, advisories were issued on
a number of topics, including potential terrorist threats in the United States and South America;
establishment of the Department of Transportation Response Center Hotline; two Naval Control of
Shipping exercises; and training opportunities for mariners at the National Sealift Training Program.  In
addition, Special Warnings to Mariners were coordinated with the Department of State relative to
situations in Haiti, Algeria, Pakistan, and the Persian Gulf, including United Nations (U.N.) interdiction
policies.<p>

	<p>

  MARAD, in cooperation with the Departments of State and of Defense, monitored previously agreed
procedures facilitating the inspection of cargoes aboard U.S.-flag merchant vessels destined for Aqaba,
Jordan.  In May 1995, <u>Lloyd's Register</u> took over the inspection of cargoes from the Maritime Interdiction
Force (MIF).  However, the U.N. Security Council's Iraq Sanctions Committee and the MIF continued to
operate because vessels continued to attempt to break the embargo by carrying contraband cargo.
MARAD also participated in the development of policies regarding U.N. sanctions enforced against Haiti
and Liberia.<p>

<p>

  The Agency participated in the development of training exercises sponsored by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
These exercises familiarize military and civilian agencies with  procedures to be followed during a national
security crisis.  MARAD also participated in exercises sponsored by the National Defense University War
Gaming and Simulation Center, and in war games at the Naval War College in Newport, RI.  Personnel
and the Agency participated in two Naval Control and Protection of Shipping (NCAPS) exercises designed
to test and improve new NCAPS doctrine.<p>

<p>

  MARAD was involved in USTRANSCOM exercises TURBO CADS 95, designed to test the
Containerized Ammunition Distribution System, and TURBO INTERMODAL SURGE 95, a test movement
of an Artillery Battalion from a fort to a port.<p>

<p>

  MARAD participated in various civil emergency actions, including collecting and disseminating data
related to the Japanese earthquake which devastated the Port of Kobe in January 1995.  In addition,
MARAD personnel were involved in the emergency response to Hurricane Marilyn, which hit the Virgin
Islands in September 1995.  <p>

<p>

  MARAD participated in RESPONSE '95, a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-sponsored
exercise with a major hurricane disaster scenario.  MARAD was represented at the National Conference
of Emergency Coordinators in February 1995 and at the March interagency meeting chaired by the
National Security Council on the devolution of FEMA mobilization and national security preparedness
functions.<p>

<p>

  During the fiscal year, MARAD continued to assist the DOT in its effort to revise its Continuity of
Operations Plan. <p>

<p>

  MARAD established a Liaison Office at USTRANSCOM to provide coordinated, 
on-site support of the Defense Transportation System for maritime 
transportation planning and contingency operations.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>Piracy and Attacks on Merchant Shipping</b><p>

<p>

  International merchant shipping continued to be subject to piracy and robbery incidents around the world.
Various international maritime organizations cited areas of piracy and attacks on merchant shipping
continuing on the shores of the South China Sea, including Indonesia, Vietnam, Hong Kong, China, and
the Philippines; the Singapore and Malacca Straits; the Ivory Coast and the Horn of Africa; Brazil; and
Bangladesh.  <p>

<p>

  MARAD continued to alert mariners to the potential problems and offered 
advice on effective counter-measures to deter a piracy boarding.  MARAD 
actively participated with industry partners such as the Maritime Security 
Council and Seamen's Church Institute, to advise on training techniques, 
informational resources available, threat dissemination, and incident 
reporting.  (See Chart 1.)<p>

<p>

  The Agency continued to promote the use of the Defense Mapping Agency's Navigation Information
Network's Anti-Shipping Activities Message (ASAM) system to report incidents for a data base available to
all mariners.  There was an increase in reporting, but a large number of incidents still were thought to be
unreported.  A total of 101 incidents were reported in FY 1995.  While reporting of incidents may represent
only one third of the actual total, it is noted that the most active area for 
piracy remains in South East Asian waters, the Horn of Africa, and Brazil.  
(See Chapter 3 -- International Activities and Chapter 4 --
Port, Intermodal, and Environmental Activities.)<p>

<p>

<b>War Risk Insurance</b>

<p>

  Title XII of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended, authorizes MARAD to administer the war risk
insurance program.  The program insures operators and seamen against losses resulting from war, or
war-like actions, during periods when commercial insurance is not available on reasonable terms and
conditions.<p>

<p>

  At the end of this reporting period, the War Risk Revolving Fund (Fund) asset total was approximately
$25,119,000.  There were no new assureds receiving binders during FY 1995.  The fund earned
$1,700,000 in investment income.  Program expenses for FY 1995 totaled $53,316.<p>

  <p>

  As of September 30, 1995, there were 257 binders attached to provide eligibility for hull protection and
indemnity and Second Seamen's war risk insurance.  These binders would be effective for 30 days
following termination of commercial insurance.  <p>

<p>

  No binders were outstanding in MARAD's related standby war risk cargo insurance and builder's risk
insurance programs.<p>

<p>

  Statutory authority covering the Title XII War Risk Insurance Program 
expired on June 30, 1995.  At the end of the reporting period, MARAD was 
awaiting enactment of legislation for the renewal of this authority.
Congress reinstated the war risk authority on February 10, 1996, for a 
5-year interval expiring June 30, 2000.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Title XI and Other Insurance Compliance</b><p>

<p>

  MARAD monitors the contractual requirements for marine insurance coverage 
placed in the commercial market for all existing Title XI vessels on which 
MARAD holds the mortgage, together with vessels subsidized by the Government 
and Government-owned vessels on charter to private operators.  One aspect of 
this compliance is to assure that the American marine insurance market has 
the opportunity to compete for placement of marine insurance on these vessels.  
As indicated in Table 3, MARAD-approved marine hull and machinery insurance 
during FY 1995 aggregated 42 percent placement in the American
market and 58 percent placement in foreign insurance markets.  This contrasts 
with the 54 percent American market placement for hull and machinery 
insurance during fiscal year 1994.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Scrapping or Removal of Obsolete Vessels</b><p>

<p>

  No Government-owned vessels were sold scrap.<p>

<p>

  MARAD continued negotiations with the Environmental Protection Agency to 
allow continued sale of obsolete vessels from the National Defense Reserve 
Fleet.<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>RRF Claims Settlement</b><p>

<p>

  MARAD continued to act as the claim agent for Government- owned RRF vessels in FY 1995.  From the
inception of Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm through the end of FY 1995, approximately 375
personal injury claims submitted by or on behalf of American merchant seamen 
had been settled, at a total cost of approximately $16.2 million.  Among 
claims pending resolution at year's end were those for seamen who crewed RRF 
vessels in support of Operation QUICK LIFT to the former Republic of
Yugoslavia, as well as Operation RESTORE HOPE to Somalia.  As of September 30, 
1995, approximately 30 administrative claims were pending.  In addition, MARAD 
was assisting the U.S. Department of Justice in resolving approximately 70 
claims in which litigation against the United States was brought by or on
behalf of the claimant.  <p>

<b>Shipbuilding Initiatives</b><p>

<p>

<b>Title XI Guarantees</b><p>

Title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, established the Federal Ship Financing
Guarantee Program.  As originally enacted, Title XI authorized the Federal Government to insure private
sector loans or mortgages made to finance or refinance the construction or reconstruction of American-flag vessels.<p>

<p>

  Title XI was amended in 1972 to provide direct Government guarantees of the underlying debt
obligations, with the Government holding a mortgage on the equipment financed.<p>

<p>

  On November 30, 1993, the National Shipbuilding and Shipyard Conversion Act of 1993 (Shipbuilding
Act) was enacted (Sections 1351 to 1363 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994
[Public Law 103-160]).  It expanded the existing Title XI program by authorizing the Secretary of
Transportation to guarantee obligations issued to finance the construction, reconstruction, or
reconditioning of eligible export vessels.  It also authorized guarantees for shipyard modernization and
improvement.<p>

<p>

  The Shipbuilding Act established a National Shipbuilding Initiative (NSI) program to support the industrial
base for national security objectives.  It is expected to help reestablish the American shipbuilding industry
as an internationally competitive industry.<p>

<p>

  The benefits of the Administration's shipbuilding initiatives are already evident.  Interest in Title XI from
both domestic and foreign buyers has been strong.  Accomplishments include approval of the first U.S.-built commercial ship order for a foreign buyer since 1957.  The vessels, to be built in Newport News, VA,
for Eletson Corp. (Fleves Shipping Corp.) of Piraeus, Greece, are expected to generate 500 shipyard jobs.<p>

<p>

  Since FY 1994, MARAD has approved 21 new Title XI applications totalling approximately $727 million in
financing guarantees.  Significantly, prior to the President's announced initiative, MARAD was processing
only three applications for new vessels.  During FY 1995, MARAD approved Title XI applications totaling
approximately $437 million in financing guarantees.  These projects include eight tankers, one
breakbulk/container vessel, one paddlewheel steamboat, one catamaranferry, one undersea warfare
surface support ship, one deepwater supply vessel, various types of barges and tugs.  One Title XI loan guarantee
for a $17.78 million shipyard modernization project at Avondale Shipyards in New Orleans, LA was also
approved in this reporting period.  Other applications for shipyard modernization projects are now under
review.  It is anticipated that these projects will allow shipyards to perform contracts more efficiently through
productivity improvements.<p>

<p>

  Title XI applications approved in FY 1995 are shown on Table 4.  As of September 30, 1995, there were 30
Title XI applications pending.<p>

<p>

  Under the Title XI program the U.S. Government insures or guarantees full payment to the lender of the
unpaid principal and interest of the mortgage obligation in the event of default by the vessel owners or
general shipyard facility.<p>

<p>

  As of September 30, 1995, Title XI guarantees in force aggregate approximately $1.7 billion, covering
approximately 1,824 vessels and 106 individual shipowners.<p>

<p>

  During FY 1995, Congressional authority for the Title XI program had a cap of $12 billion, of which $850
million is authorized to guarantee the financing of fishing vessels and fisheries facilities by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Title XI guarantees for eligible export vessels are limited to $3.0
billion.<p>

<p>

  Title XI program participants are charged a one-time filing and investigation fee plus an annual guarantee
fee.  There were one default and nine voluntary payoffs on Title XI guaranteed contracts in FY 1995.  <p>

<p>

  During FY 1995, the Feder!l Ship Financing Fund had a net income of $72.2 million.  The cash balance of
the fund on September 30, 1995, was $3.9 million.  The Fund has been self-supporting since July 1989.
One default occurred during FY 1995.  Treasury investments of the Fund on September 30, 1995, were
$39&oslash;.8 million.  The cash and investment balance of the fund on Septemb%r 30, 1995, was approximately
$400.7 million.  During the fiscal year, in accordance with the Credit Reform Act, MARAD determined its
current needs and transferred excess funds of $585 million to Treasury.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>MARITECH</b><p>

<p>

  The National Shipbuilding and Shipyard Conversion Act of 1993 also contains funds for industrY-initiated
research and development projects, under the MARITECH program.  These cooperative research
agreements, funded on a 50/50 basis with industry, are intended to strengthen the Nation's shipbuilding
technology as the industry re-enters the international marketplace for commerc)al ship construction and to
maintain defense readiness.  They are awarded on a competitive basis by MARAD in partnership with the
Department of Defense (DOD).  The effort has two phases.  The first phase focused on near-term market
penetration with competitive, commercial ship designs for international buyers.  These efforts expanded into
the second phase, namely, to encompass longer-term technology development.   
<p>

<p>

  The MARITECH program has been well received.  To date, the Department of Transportation and DOD
have approved 44 MARITECH projects representing over 147 participants located in 22 states and 9 foreign
countries.  The projects cover research and development for a broad selection of ship types: double hull
tankers, passenger vessels, dry and bulk cargo vessels, container ships, high speed ferriEs, and off-shore
service craft.  MARAD has been selected to administer 24 of these projects with a total value of $100 million
in Government and industry funding.  <p>

<p>

  Through the expanded Title XI program and its complementary MARITECH program, administered by
MARAD and DOD, MARAD has provided the shipbuilding industry with the impetus to modify its <p>

operations to more effectively compete in the international marketplace.  U.S. shipbuilders are closing the
gap to offer competitive prices for new construction projects in the international market.  Shipyards have
improved and enlarged their marketing approach to include the expanded Title XI program, have developed
commercially viable ship designs, and have entered into partnerships with international shipbuilders.<p>

<p>

  The MARITECH program has begun to fulfi,l the President's vision of strengthening the American
shipbuilding industry in the commercial market, as well as maintaining the Nation's defense readiness and
vital shipyard worker skills.  U.S. commercial shipbuilding capabilities and jobs, and the skills their workers
possess, are now on the rise after many years of decline.<p>

<p>

  Also in FY 1995, MARAD participated in an effort led by the United States to remove foreign shipyard
subsidies that met with success at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),
when an agreement was concluded in FY 1995 among the OECD nations and others to eliminate unfair
subsidies to shipbuilders.  This agreement will become effective 30 days after all signatories enact
appropriate enabling legislation to modify existing lavs not consistent with the termr of the OECD agreement.<p>

<p>

  In order to further assist U.S. shipyards' ability to become internationally competitive, MARAD is working
closely with standards developing organizations, such as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and
the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), to assist in the adoption of international ship consTruction and quality
standards, thus removing any unfair advantage foreign competitors may have as a result of less stringent
requirements.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Capital Construction Fund (CCF)</b>

<p>

  The CCF Program was established under the Merchant Marine Act of 1970.  It assists operators in
accumulating capital to build, acquire, and reconstruct vessels through the deferral of Federal income taxes
on certain deposits, as defined in Section 607 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended.<p>

<p>

  The CCF Program enables operators to build vessels for the U.S. foreign trade, Great Lakes,
noncontiguous domestic trade (e.g., between the West Coast and Hawaii), and the fisheries of the United
States.  It aids in the construction, reconstruction, or acquisition of a wide variety of vessels, including
containerships, tankers, bulk carriers, tugs, barges, supply vessels, ferries, and passenger vessels.<p>

<p>

  During calendar year 1994, $142 million was deposited into these accounts.  Since the program was
initiated in 1971, fund holders have deposited $6.0 billion in CCF accounts and withdrawn $4.8 billion for the
modernization and expansion of the U.S. merchant marine.  As of December 31, 1994, a total of 113
companies were parties to CCF agreements (see Table 7). <p>

<p>

  Another matter of importance involved defending Department of Transportation authority to administer the
CCF program.  In the Fall of 1993, MARAD learned the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was taking certain
positions at variance with the provisions of applicable CCF regulations and contractual agreements.
Meetings over a 2-year period among DOT, IRS, the Department of Treasury, and MARAD failed to resolve
the dispute.  Meanwhile, the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
became involved in a separate dispute over the administration of its CCF program for fishing vessels.  In
June 1995, the General Counsels of DOT and Commerce submitted a joint brief to the Office of Legal
Counsel (OLC) in the Department of Justice requesting OLC to resolve the dispute with IRS and Treasury.
The matter was pending at year's end.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Construction Reserve Fund (CRF)</b>

<p>

  Like the CCF, the CRF encourages upgrading of the American-flag fleet.  This program allows eligible
parties to defer taxation of capital gains on the sale or other disposition of a vessel if net proceeds are placed
in a CRF and reinvested in a new vessel within three years.<p>

<p>

  The CRF is used predominately by owners of vessels operated in coastwise trades, the inland waterwAys,
and other trades not eligible for the CCF Program.  Its benefits are as broad as those of the CCF.<p>

<p>

  The number of companies with CRF balances increased from six to eight during fiscal year 1995 (see <a name="Table 8"><a>Table</a></a>
8).  The total monies on deposit increased from $1.7 million to $2.1 million. <p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>National Maritime Resource and Education Center (NMREC)</b>
<p>

  MARAD formed the National Maritime Resource and Education Center (NMREC) to assist the U.S.
shipbuilding, ship repair, and associated industries in improving their international competitiveness&amp;  NMREC
programs will be added or modified to meet industry needs.  Under NMREC, MARAD established the
following new initiatives to assist these industries.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>NMREC Home Page and MARlinespike Bulletin Board</b><p>

<p>

  The NMREC portion of MARlinespike, MARAD's computer bulletin board, has been operating for almost a
year.  A wide array of information relating to NMREC programs, such as standards, guideline specifications,
computer-aided design, seminar topics and dates, metrication, and research and development activities&ccedil; are
available to the marine industry. (See Chapter 10.)<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Component Library</b><p>

<p>

  MARAD established a "Computer Aided Design (CAD) Component Library,"  which allows shipyards to
download files from the MARlinespike bulletin board and use them in their designs.  To date, there are 21
CAD files available for use.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Marine Industry Standards Library</b>

<p>

  International, foreign, and domestic standards are available from the Marine Industry Standards Library as
well as information pertaining to standards.  Technical assistance is available to the marine industry for
questions on standards and applications.  During FY 1995, the Library's customers have included marine
equipment suppliers, shipyards, consultants, and several Government agencies.  The activities have
included 146 requests processed, which resulted in 264 documents totalling 9,167 pages. <p>

<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>MARAD Guideline Specifications for Merchant Ship Construction</b><p>

<p>

  MARAD is updating its Standard Specifications with current requirements to assist U.S. shipyards in the
export business.  The Guideline Specifications references international, foreign, and domestic commercial
standards using the metric system.  An Executive Summary has been prepared in addition to the detailed
version.  They were reviewed by the USCG, international classification societies, and members of the
maritime industry.  Both versions will be made available in hard copy, by 
downloading from the MARlinespike and the NMREC Home Page. <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Seminars</b>
<p>

<p>

MARAD's NMREC held four seminars in FY 1995.  The participants consisted of chief executive officers,
presidents, and top management in the marine industry.  The seminar topics included Title XI Loan
Guarantees, Cruise Ship Construction in the U.S.A., Shipbuilding Competitiveness, and Assessing the
Impact of Marine Envi2onmental Standards and Regulations on U.S. Competitiveness in International
Markets.<p>

<p>

  The Title XI Loan Guarantees seminar offered discussions of this U.S. Government guarantee program for
private sector debt financing, with emphasis on the terms of the program and procedures applicants must
follow.<p>

<p>

  Cruise Ship Construction in the U.S.A. was presented by <u>Lloyd's Register</u> and focused on the aspects of
modern cruise ship structure design and operations as well as the safety aspects of ship construction.<p>

<p>

  Shipbuilding Competitiveness was presented by A&P Appledore International, 
  and focused on factors that
are directly related with achieving high productivity.<p>

<p>

Assessing the Impact of Marine Environmental Standards and Regulations on 
U.S. Competitiveness in International Markets was presented by MARAD with 
guest speakers addressing the Impact of ISO 14000 on Business Operations, 
Maritime Industry Concerns, Government Response, and Action
Items/Next Steps Leading to Consensus Approach.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>ISO 9000</b><p>

<p>

  MARAD has participated in shipyard assessments/audits with registries such as American Bureau of
Shipping, Det Norske Veritas, Lloyd's Register and Underwriters Laboratories.  ISO 9000 presentations have
been given to the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers (SNAME) through the sponsorship of the
National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP) for workshops and conferences.  MARAD's representative
is an Executive Steering Group Member to the Government/Industry Quality Liaison Panel (G&amp;IQLP).  The
G&amp;IQLP was created bythe Federal Government and industry to encourage participation of interested
Federal agencies and industry associations in the development and deployment of uniform quality
management systems and advanced quality concepts.  The main mission of the G&amp;IQLP is consistent
satisfaction oF customer expectations through a Government and industry association partnership using
world-class quality processes and practices to enhance international competitiveness.   <p>

 <p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Joint Efforts with the United States Coast Guard (USCG)</b>
<p>

<p>

  The Maritime Administrator and the Chief, OffIce of Marine Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection,
USCG, meet on a quarterly basis to discuss issues relating to regulations and standards.  In addition,
MARAD and USCG personnel continue to meet on various issues regarding the adoption of voluntary
consensus stajdards in lieu of regulations.  MARAD and USCG personnel meet to improve international
safety rules for various ship types, including dry cargo ships and RO/RO passenger ferries.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Support to ISO/TC-8"</b><p>

<p>

  Support is being provided to the U.S. Technical Advisory Group to thd International Standards Organization
on Ships and Marine Technology (ISO/TC-8).  MARAD is an active participant in the American Society for
Testing and Materials (ASTM) shipbuilding standards committees, where conversion from ASTM standards to
ISO standards is in process.  Metrication of standards is being stressed by MARAD to make them acceptable
as ISO standards.  <p>

<p>
<hr>

<b>Metrication</b><p>

<p>

  It is MARAD's goal to convert to the System International (SI) measurement 
(metric) by 1997.  To accomplish this, MARAD will issue the "Guideline 
Specifications for Merchant Ship Construction" using only SI.  MARAD also 
collects information and reference material for dissemination within 
Government and to industry.  The annual reports "Outlook for the U.S. 
Shipbuilding and Repair Industry" (OUTLOOK) and "The Report on Survey of U.S. 
Shipbuilding and Repair Facilities" (Survey) are published using the SI system.
MARAD also has publications relating to the SI system of measurement available for dissemination to
industry.  <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Assessment of Environmental Issues Affecting Competitiveness 
of the United States Ship Repair Industry</b><p>

<p>

  MARAD awarded a contract to Halliburton NUS to perform a research and development project.  The
project is scheduled for completion in July 1996.  It encompasses a comprehensive assessment of
environmental issues which are considered to affect the competitiveness of ship repair in the United
States.  <p>

  MARAD's goal is to assist the U.S. ship repair industry in complying with increasingly complex and costly
environmental laws and regulations.  In addition, the contract study is designed to enhance the industry's
competitiveness in worldwide markets by identifying and determining the approaches that foreign ship
repair industries utilize to address and comply with their national environmental laws and regulatory
requirements.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Shipyard Activity</b><p>

<p>

  As of September 30, 1995, there were 9 commercial oceangoing vessels larger than 1,000 gross tons on
order from commercial shipyards in the United States.  <p>

<p>

  Commercial shipyards continued to be awarded all the Navy's new construction contracts.  Seven new
vessels of 1,000 light displacement tons (LDT) and larger were ordered and 19 new Navy vessels were
delivered by privately owned U.S. shipyards during this reporting period.<p>

<p>

  As of September 30, 1995, 54 Navy vessels 1,000 LDT and larger were under construction, being
converted, or on order in nine privately owned U.S. shipyards.  
Thirty-one have delivery dates extending through 1997.<p>

<p>

  A significant portion of the Navy's ship construction and conversion program is devoted to "T" ships.  The
"T" designates Government-owned, civilian-manned ships which, in most instances, are assigned to the
Navy's Military Sealift Command.<p>

<p>

  As of September 30, 1995, 11 T-ships were on order or under construction in 3 privately owned U.S.
shipyards.  In addition, there were five T-ships undergoing conversion.  Three T-ships were completed
and orders for four new ships were placed in FY 1995.<p>

<p>

  While naval construction continues to represent the mainstay of business for some commercial
shipyards, the expanded Title XI program has given the U.S. shipbuilding industry the impetus to modify
the way they operate in order to compete in the international marketplace.  U.S. shipbuilders are closing
the gap to offer competitive prices for new construction projects in the world market.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Shipyard Improvements</b><p>

<p>

  The U.S. shipbuilding and ship repair industry invested more than $162 million in FY 1995 to upgrade
and expand facilities.  Much of this investment went to improve efficiency and competitiveness, including
new building basins, floating drydocks, cranes, automated equipment, and highly mechanized production
systems.  The emphasis has been on introducing modular techniques, fabrication of larger subassemblies,
and pre-outfitting of ship components.  <p>

<p>

  Information received by MARAD indicates that U.S. shipyards plan to spend approximately $125 million
for improvements in FY 1996.  The industry's capital investments since 1970 have totaled almost $5.6
billion.  <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Ship Structures Research</b><p>

<p>

  MARAD participates in the activities of the Ship Structure Committee (SSC), an international interagency
group and research sponsor dedicated to promote safety, economy, marine environmental protection, and
education in the North American maritime industry through the advancement of marine structures
technology.  Established in 1946, the Committee advises the Government on improving the structural
design, material, and construction methods for ships.<p>  
<p>
The Committee also supports the research and development that focuses on 
improving the safety and integrity of marine structures, reducing marine
environmental risks, and supporting the U.S. and Canadian maritime industry 
in shipbuilding, maintenance, and repair.  Section 804 of the Merchant Marine
Act, 1936, as amended, precludes subsidized U.S.-flag operators or 
their affiliates from operating foreign-flag vessels which compete with
essential U.S.-flag shipping services unless the Secretary of Transportation 
waives the provision of this section for a specific period of time.<p>

<p>

  During the reporting period, the Committee selected 1 project for funding, initiated the contracting
processes for 4 projects, administered 22 on-going projects, received 6 draft reports, and published 10
reports.  These projects covered the areas of probability based design, fatigue and fracture, corrosion
control, strength of pitted plates, weld properties, and hydrogen cracking prevention.  The Committee
selected the following projects for future development:<p>

<p>

o SR1381 Development of CD ROM Library of SSC Reports<p>

<p>

o SR1382 Evaluation of Effect of Construction Tolerances on Vessel Strength<p>

<p>

o SR1383 Failure Definition for Structural Reliability Assessment<p>

<p>

o SR1384 Crack-Arrest Toughness of Steel Weldments, and<p>

o SR1385 In-Service Nondestructive Evaluation of Fatigue and Fracture Properties for Ship Structures.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>Offshore Petroleum Discharge System Program (OPDS)</b>

<p>

  The OPDS Conversion Program, which began in 1984, is part of a project which uses modified tankers to
pump fuel to Marine Corps and Army beach units from an offshore mooring.  The system is designed to
deploy up to 4 miles of conduit from ship to shore and begin delivering petroleum products within 48 hours of
arrival on station.  Other tankers can come alongside the OPDS, tie up, and transfer their cargo to shore.
These operations are accomplished by civilian tanker personnel, with assistance from Navy tugs and diving
units.<p>

<p>

  At the U.S. Navy's request, MARAD designed and contracted for the conversion of five OPDS vessels.  The
redeliveries of the OPDS-1 through OPDS-5 are shown on Chart 2.  The fifth and final OPDS vessel was
redelivered in February 1995.

  The Maritime Administration (MARAD) continued its efforts to obtain equitable treatment for U.S.-flag
carriers in world trade and for the U.S. shipbuilding industry.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Agreement with Brazil</b><p>

	<p>

  During talks held in July 1995 in Brasilia, the United States and Brazil concluded negotiations on a new
3-year maritime agreement.  The agreement assures U.S.-flag carriers equal access to Brazilian
government cargoes and reaffirms the commitment of both countries to continue liberalizing their maritime
trade.  In Agreed Minutes of the discussions, the United States emphasized support for U.S. carrier efforts
to obtain licenses to operate bonded warehouse facilities.  In addition, the U.S. delegation stressed its
interest in gaining full access for U.S. liner carriers to cargo moving between Brazil and its South
American neighbors.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)</b><p>

<p>

  In December 1994, the United States and the world's other key shipbuilding nations (including Japan,
Korea, the European Union, and Norway) signed the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement.  The agreement is
designed to eliminate government subsidies and other trade-distorting practices in the industry.  It carries
out a key goal of the Administration's shipyard revitalization plan--to ensure fair international competition.
At the request of the U.S. Trade Representative, MARAD played a major role in helping to draft
implementing legislation for consideration by Congress.  In June 1995, a MARAD official joined the U.S.
delegation in an OECD meeting to discuss preparations for the agreement's entry into force.<p>

<p>

  MARAD also was represented on the U.S. delegation at meetings of the OECD's Maritime Transport
Committee.  Issues discussed by the Committee included competition policy, support measures for
shipping, and OECD relations with Asia and Eastern Europe.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>Meeting with Vietnam</b><p>

<p>

  MARAD officials met with a Vietnamese delegation, headed by Hoan Ngoc Le, First Vice Minister of
Transportation, in Washington, DC, on September 26, 1995, to explain the Agency's programs available to
the maritime industry.  This was the first contact by MARAD with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam since the
normalization of diplomatic relations was announced on July 11, 1995.  The meeting provided an opportunity
for the Agency to express the importance of developing a positive maritime relationship between the two
nations.  The Vietnamese delegation also met with Secretary of Transportation Federico Pe&ntilde;a and
representatives from DOT's Federal Highway Administration and Federal Railroad Administration.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Transportation Ministerial</b><p>

<p>

  The Maritime Administrator participated in an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Transportation
Symposium and Ministerial on June 12-13, 1995, in Washington, DC.  Secretary Pe&ntilde;a convened the
ministerial conference with representatives from all APEC members, as well as industry representatives from
all modes of transportation.  The central theme of the symposium was "Transportation in the Asia-Pacific
Region: Supporting Economic Growth and Prosperity."<p>
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)</b><p>
<p>

  MARAD participated in several sessions of the GATS Negotiating Group on Maritime Transport Services
(NGMTS) held in Geneva.  At these meetings a fact-finding initiative identified maritime policies and practices
of participating countries with respect to international shipping, auxiliary services, and port access.  The
NGMTS is scheduled to conclude its work in 1996.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Consultations with Canada and Mexico</b><p>

<p>

  MARAD officials also met in Ottawa in June 1995 with maritime delegations from Mexico and Canada.  This
was the first meeting of the Maritime and Port Policy Subgroup established under the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) during the Transportation Summit held in 1994.  The primary purpose of the
meeting was to review maritime transport policy developments.  Among the subjects discussed were marine
policy initiatives, port privatization, and multilateral trade issues affecting North America. <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Other Activities</b>

<p>

  MARAD chaired a meeting in Washington in April 1995 between a U.S. delegation and the Consultative
Shipping Group, an informal organization consisting of West European shipping nations and Japan.
Discussions covered a wide variety of maritime topics, including competition policy, support measures,
market access, and safety and environmental matters.  For the first time in such meetings, Canada and
Mexico participated as observers.  <p>

  <p>

  In October 1994, MARAD participated in the U.S. delegation for the initial meeting under the Transportation,
Science and Technology Exchange Agreement between the U.S. Department of Transportation and the
Japanese Ministry of Transport.  MARAD's areas of interest included advanced ship navigation technology
and marine environmental protection issues. <p>

<p>

  The Agency also participated in the annual meeting of the Transport Canada-U.S. Department of
Transportation Emergency Planning Committee for Civil Transportation held in Washington, DC, in May
1995.<p>

<p>

  Additionally, MARAD participated in meetings and training sessions of various subsidiary groups of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  The Maritime Administrator is the   Washington Chairman of
NATO's Planning Board for Ocean Shipping.   The Agency also participated in selected activities of NATO's
Senior Civil Emergency Planning Committee, including planning for a Crisis Management Exercise and
training of international shipping executives.<p>

<p>

   The first of three seminars on "Port Security Training For the Control Of Drugs, Chemicals and Hazardous
Materials" was held for officials from English-speaking Caribbean Basin countries in Barbados during April
1995.  The seminars are sponsored by the Organization of American States (OAS) and its Inter-American
Drug Abuse Control Commission and are funded by the U.S. Department of State.  The seminars, organized
by MARAD to provide port training for port officials in Latin America, are intended to alleviate the criminal
threat to trade by improving port security. <p>

<p>

  The OAS Port Training Committee, chaired by a MARAD representative, held its first Inter-American Course
on Port Security in October 1994 at the Port of Miami. Twenty-nine representatives from 25 nations in the
Western Hemisphere participated in this 3-week training event.  Topics included physical port security
practices, port safety measures, cargo  thefts, drug smuggling, stowaways, piracy, anti-terrorism, hazardous
cargoes, bombs/explosives, organized crime, and advanced technological detection equipment.  The course
included on-site inspections of the Port of Miami facilities and U.S. Customs Service and U.S. Coast Guard
sites.  It was funded by the OAS and the Port of Miami.<p>

<a><center><h4>MARAD '95 ANNUAL REPORT</h4></CENTER></A>
<A><center><h4>Chapter 4: Port, Intermodal, and Environmental Activities
   </h4></center></a>
<hr>
<p>

MARAD provides technical assistance in port, intermodal, and environmental planning and operations to
State and local port authorities, terminal operators, private industry, agencies of the United States, and
foreign governments.  In times of National emergency or contingency, the Agency directs the use of ports
and port facilities and the priority use and procurement of containers and other intermodal equipment to
minimize disruption of commercial inventory distribution. (See Chapter 1.)
<p>
<p>

  MARAD provides for environmental control and pollution abatement of ship-generated pollution caused
by vessels under its jurisdiction.  The Agency also supports the U.S. maritime industry on domestic
environmental compliance issues and serves as an advocate for the U.S. maritime industry on
international environmental issues to ensure the industry's competitiveness in the global marketplace.
(International port and intermodal activities are discussed in Chapter 3.)
<p>

<p>

  A reorganization at the beginning of FY 1995 established the Office of the Associate Administrator for
Ports, Intermodal, and Environmental Activities. <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Ports and Domestic Shipping</b><p>

<p>

  MARAD promotes development of technologically advanced, efficient, and competitive public and private
ports serving the domestic and deep ocean maritime commerce of the United States both in peace and
times of national emergency.<p>

<p>

   The principal FY 1995 activities are summarized below.<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Congressional Report on Public Ports</b><p>

<p>

   The Secretary of Transportation is required by Public Law 96-371 to report biannually to the Congress
on the status of United States public ports.  The report for calendar years 1992 and 1993 examined the
capabilities, composition, and financial status of the port industry, highlighted issues and problems, and
reviewed the importance of U.S. ports to the Nation's economy and military security.<p>

<p>
<hr>

<b>Port Facility Conveyance Program</b><p>

<p>

  Public Law 103-160 authorized DOT to convey Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) and other surplus
Federal property to public entities for the development or operation of a port facility. This authority was
subsequently delegated to MARAD for implementation.  The program provides a mechanism for entities to
acquire needed property at no consideration, provided it is used and maintained in perpetuity as a port
facility.  MARAD processes applications, conveys assigned property, and enforces compliance with the terms
and conditions of the conveyances.  No conveyance have been completed during the fiscal year.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>National Maritime System (NMS)</b><p>

<p>

  The NMS significantly contributes to the American economy and links the United States to the world.  Over
1.9 billion metric tons of foreign and domestic commerce were transported by water in 1993.<p>

<p>

  The NMS is composed of deepdraft ocean trades, the deepdraft rivers, bays and estuaries -- including over
1,205 miles of channels and canals.  It also includes over 10,500 miles of shallow draft inland and
intracoastal waterways, 160 locks and dams and 355 ports.<p>

<p>

  In addition, the NMS includes the coastwise and intercoastal deepdraft trades, and U.S. controlled offshore
sealanes to Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam, as well as the Great Lakes deepdraft trades.<p>

<p>

  MARAD defined the NMS to ensure that its importance was fully recognized during development of the
National Transportation System (NTS).<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Automated Tools for Improved Planning and Operations</b><p>

<p>

   MARAD continued its efforts to develop automated tools to assist in improving port planning and operation
capabilities and to estimate advances in productivity and contributions to the local and national economies.<p>

<p>

  The Agency continued evaluating the use of geographic information systems (GIS) as they apply to
intermodal port planning and operations. <p>

<p>

  At year's end, MARAD was developing GIS simulation technologies for port planning.  These advanced
technologies can be used to model marine terminal, ship, rail, and truck operations using simulation
mapping techniques.<p>

   <p>

  MARAD completed development of an educational video titled, <i>"U.S. Ports: Intermodal Gateways to
Growth</i>."  The purpose of the video is to educate the public on the importance of the U.S. port system in our
local, regional, and national economies.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Technical Assistance</b><p>


  MARAD continued to provide technical assistance to the port and intermodal industry.  Several projects
were aimed at enhancing the role of U.S. ports and intermodal transportation companies in economic
development and national defense.  This involved developing analytical reports, methodologies, and data
systems for improving planning, productivity, and the general efficiency of port management and marine
terminal operations.  Projects were cost-shared by MARAD and appropriate State or local port authorities and
private sector organizations.<p>

<p>

  In addition, MARAD provided information to support several local port dredging projects and dredged
material disposal plans.  In discussions with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Agency stressed the
importance of adequate water depths in navigation channels and berthing areas to national trade
competitiveness and intermodal transportation efficiency.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>


<b>Port Planning</b>

<p>

  MARAD participated in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) and landside
access presentations with other Department agencies and with private entities.  Port planning information
systems and port financial and economic analyses were emphasized as well as development of generic
methodologies that can be used by any port and region.<p>

<p>

Projects under these programs which were completed, ongoing, or initiated in FY 1995 are briefly
summarized in the sections which follow:<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>National Freight Transportation Model</b><p>

<p>

  Many sources predicted the Nation's foreign commerce would grow at a compounded rate of five to eight
percent over the next several years.  This indicated that between 2010 and 2020 approximately 12 million
cargo containers would be moving through our harbors and ports and over our highway and rail networks.  A
key question is whether there would be adequate port capacity to cope with this volume of containers.<p>

<p>

  A 1992 MARAD/Corps of Engineers study of container movements through South Atlantic ports provided a
breakthrough context for investigating potential capacity limitations as these volumes are imposed on the
system.  During FY 1995, MARAD accomplished the following:<p>

<p>

o   With the Corps of Engineers and others, developed a conceptual paper on the expanded national
model.<p>

o   Developed a scope of work and cost estimate for making the expansion and building the modeling
capability.<p>

o  Initiated discussions with DOT's Office of Economics and with Oak Ridge National Laboratory for
financial and technical support.  The Office of Economics perceives this project as an important
contribution to the National Transportation System and is considering allocation of up to $250,000 in
matching funds.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Public Port Financing</b><p>

The United States is the world's largest trading nation.  U.S. ports, as facilitators and transfer points for
most international commerce, must have a sound financial base in order to remain competitive. <p>

<p>

  This year MARAD began updating of its publication, <i>Public Port Financing in the United States.</i>  Among
other things, the report assessed the profitability and self-sufficiency of U.S. public ports from 1988-1992.
MARAD has initiated an addendum to the 1994 report which will investigate whether port size, type of
operation, type of government agency, and strategic planning impact on public port profitability.  The
addendum has been funded under a cooperative effort between MARAD and the American Association of
Port Authorities (AAPA). <p>

<p>

  This year MARAD also:<p>

o  Created an extensive database (18 years, from 1977-1994) of U.S. port financial data to allow more
extensive analysis over time.  <p>

<p>

o  Prepared and published the <i>United States Port Development Expenditure Report</i>.  The report
summarizes the public port industry's capital expenditures for 1993 and proposed expenditures for
1994 through 1998.  The report also analyzed the funding sources used to finance these
expenditures.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Public Port Pricing</b><p>
<p>

  MARAD began evaluating and revising a port pricing model last published in October 1986.  Traditionally,
most public ports have relied on some form of subsidy (tax revenues and/or taxing authority, grants, bonding
authority, etc.) to cover their operating and debt expenses.  However, with competition growing for fewer
government dollars, public ports realize the necessity to maximize operating revenues as the best way to
finance both present operations and future capital expenditures.  <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Risk Management</b><p>

<p>

  MARAD also began revising its <i>Port Risk Management Guidebook</i>, last published in 1985.  The guidebook
is designed to provide port executives with the basic skills and information needed to establish and maintain
appropriate, cost-effective insurance programs.  It is designed to assist port executives at small and medium
U.S. ports with part-time responsibility for port risk management and insurance.  The revised <i>Guidebook</i>
should also be useful for experienced risk managers who need to be familiar with the special risk
management requirements of public port authorities.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>Maritime Intelligence and Security</b><p>

<p>

  U.S. cargoes on ocean vessels or in any port worldwide can be jeopardized by maritime security threats
including piracy, terrorism, stowaways, drugs, cargo theft and fraud, bribery, and extortion.  MARAD's
Maritime Intelligence and Security Program, through its Security Working Group, seeks to improve the
security of U.S.-flag merchant ships, U.S. ports, and U.S. cargo moving in vessels of all flags or while in
foreign ports.  Key functions in FY 1995 included:<p>

<p>

o  Coordination of Federal/maritime industry interaction on courses of action, facilitation of effective
solutions, the exchange of information on maritime security issues, and dissemination of intelligence
to the commercial maritime industry.<p>

<p>

o  Electronic dissemination of warning and threat information to ships at sea worldwide and U.S. port
authorities, pertaining to piracy, terrorism, or other activities detrimental to commercial shipping.<p>

<p>

o  Distribution to the commercial maritime industry of the quarterly publication, <i>Maritime Security
Report</i>, spotlighting international criminal activity and security issues which could pose a threat to
U.S. commercial maritime interests and the movement of U.S. cargoes in foreign trade.<p>

<p>

o  Assisting shipboard security training conducted at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.<p>

<p>

o  Providing technical assistance and interagency coordination in the development of maritime security
training for foreign port officials.<p>
<p>
(Also see Chapter 1 -- National Security and 
Chapter 3 -- International Activities.)<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Development of GIS for Port Planning</b><p>

<p>

  A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a system of computer hardware, software, and procedures
designed to support the capture and management, manipulation, analysis, and modeling of spatially
referenced data solving complex planning and management problems.  In FY 1995, MARAD supported
development of the technology as an analytical tool. One major component of the GIS will be the ability to
analyze the dynamics of cargo flows on international and domestic routes, including port and intermodal
connections.  <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Remediation of Marine Contaminated Sediments</b><p>

<p>

  The National Research Council's Marine Board was jointly funded by the Environmental Protection Agency,
the Maritime Administration, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, and the U.S. Navy to study and investigate the feasibility of decontamination technologies to
remediate contaminated sediments.  This was of particular interest because of dredging and disposal of
dredged operations that occur at port and harbor locations.  The final study will serve as a technical tool that
will provide guidelines on the optimum utilization of decontamination technologies.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Development of Ferry Systems</b><p>

<p>

  The rebirth of ferry systems in urban metropolitan areas is a recent phenomenon occurring within ports and
harbors of the United States.  Funds expended to-date for new ferry development have resulted mostly from
private sector investments.  There are now current initiatives to form private sector partnerships in funding
and development.  In this vein, MARAD has been instrumental in facilitating and coordinating activities to
promote ferry development with the DOT and the private sector.<p>

<p>

  MARAD, working jointly with FHWA and FTA, assisted the State of New Jersey in the development of a new
ferry terminal in Weehawken, NJ, which will be co-located with a new light rail commuter station.  These
cooperative efforts resulted in the project receiving a $1 million grant from FHWA under Section 1064 of
ISTEA for project planning and a $2.1 million grant to New York DOT for terminal improvements in
Manhattan.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Resolution of Land Use and Port</b><p> 
<b>Access Conflicts at Inland Waterway Ports</b><p>

<p>

  Under the National Maritime Enhancement Institute Program, funded by the Maritime Administration, the
University of Memphis was awarded a contract to analyze the land use/traffic access conflicts that are
created by the redevelopment of inland waterway waterfront areas and at ports and terminals.  In addition,
the University of Memphis developed guidelines which could be used by local decision-makers to conduct
the transportation and redevelopment planning process recognizing the needs of the inland waterway
industry.  This university research work used case studies to examine the inland waterway system and
certain coastal ports.<p>

<p>

  The potential exists for this work to serve as an educational tool for local transportation and land use
planners, waterway users and operators, state and municipal decision makers, and relevant Federal, State
and local government entities.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>
<p>

<b>Port Operations Program</b> <p>
<b>Port Readiness</b><p>
<p>

The Maritime Administration continued its efforts to ensure that port facilities will be available to the military
when there is a deployment of troops and their supplies.  Planning orders at selected ports provided the
ports with listings of the specific facilities which the military plans to use in a deployment.  Retaining
membership in the National Port Readiness Network, MARAD--<p>

o  Began monthly port status reporting concerning availability of facilities at ports with planning orders<p>

<p>

o  Monitored Port Readiness Exercise (PRX-95) in Houston, TX<p>

   <p>

o  Visited all ports with planning orders to identify which facilities should be listed in planning orders<p>

   <p>

o  Developed plans for semi-annual port visits<p>

<p>

o  Issued new planning orders to replace those which had expired or where new facilities would be listed<p>

   <p>

o  Established a policy wherein planning orders would be valid for a 1-year, which would encourage
discussions by MARAD and the military with port officials<p>

<p>

o  Began draft of a new issue of the <i>Planning Order Digest</i> which provides information on all planning
orders currently in effect.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Intermodal Development</b><p>

<p>

   MARAD established the new Office of Intermodal Development in FY 1995.  The primary mission of the
new office is to promote development and improved utilization of marine-related intermodal transportation
systems and advanced cargo handling technologies. <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA)</b><p>

<p>

ISTEA marks the first time Federal transportation policy explicitly 
recognized intermodal connections as an important element for transportation 
planning and decision making. In FY 1995, ports and intermodal
terminal operators continued to view provisions of ISTEA as one of many 
ways to address and potentially fund adequate land transportation port 
access infrastructure. <p>

<p>

MARAD continued to work with the port and maritime industry and the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA) to identify port access connectors to the National Highway System (NHS).  The National Highway
System Act of 1995, which was signed into law November 28, 1995, identified over 100 major port access
connectors.   The Act directs the Secretary of Transportation  to submit additional NHS connectors to
Congress for approval within 180 days of enactment.  Most states have submitted their additional
recommendations to DOT for consideration.  <p>

<p>

  MARAD continued its efforts to assure that land transportation infrastructure requirements of the maritime
industry were addressed adequately.<p>

<p>

  The Agency also continued its educational outreach program with public and private sector organizations to
address all port-related provisions of ISTEA.  Efforts in FY 1995 were focused on briefings and technical
seminars conducted in cooperation with other DOT operating agencies.  The overall program informs State
and local transportation officials and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in port regions about the
importance of including intermodal port access in their planning and funding processes.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>National Transportation System (NTS)</b><p>
<p>

MARAD continued active involvement in the Department's efforts to develop a NTS concept.  DOT is refining
the NTS concept to focus on three products-- a transportation performance monitoring system, a
national/regional level system analytical capability, and a state of the transportation system report.  MARAD's
objective is to ensure that marine transportation and intermodal freight components of the NTS receive
adequate appraisal, consideration, and funding.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Intermodal Systems and Equipment</b><p>
<p>

A key initiative for the Agency is the Maritime System of the Americas Program.  This system explores
transportation opportunities on the Inland Waterway System that connects the Central and Eastern United
States, Canada, Mexico, and Latin America.  The research focuses on economic, operational, and
technological trends for water transportation and analyzes river, short sea, and intermodal operations.<p>

<p>

  Through the Cargo Handling Cooperative Program (CHCP), the Agency continued to support research to
advance cargo handling techniques in support of marine-related intermodal transportation systems.
Initiatives such as the Video Container Recognition System were developed through the CHCP.  The CHCP
has focused on advanced technologies in cargo handling to increase productivity and cost-effectiveness of
terminal operations.<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>Completed Initiative: <u>Intermodal Conferences</u></b><p>

<p>

MARAD cosponsored a National Conference on the Intermodal Terminal of the Future.  The conference
provided an interactive forum on innovative terminal designs, emerging information technology, new
partnerships, and global economics.<p>

<p>

MARAD, in cooperation with other DOT operating agencies, cosponsored a National Conference on
Intermodalism: <i>"Making the Case, Making it Happen,"</i> which was conducted by the Transportation Research
Board of the National Research Council.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>


<b>Completed Initiative: <u>Intermodal Systems and Outreach</u></b><p>

<p>

The Agency completed Phases II and III of the Maritime System of the Americas 
project, a study of the commercial waterbridge which includes the Great Lakes, 
the Mississippi River system, the Gulf Intracoastal
Waterway, and the Gulf of Mexico.  The two phases analyzed opportunities to 
utilize innovative intermodal technologies that support the growth of 
general cargo movements via water routes in the NAFTA region. <p>

<p>

MARAD organized 6 outreach meetings with over 200 representatives from the 
private and public sectors identified in Maritime System of the Americas 
research as potential beneficiaries of increased water
transportation in the Western Hemisphere.<p>

<p>
<hr>

<b>Completed Initiative: <u>Intermodal Data and Information</u></b><p>

<p>

  MARAD and FHWA cost-shared the development and distribution of an intermodal freight video which
demonstrates the importance of intermodal transport to freight mobility and the need for adequate transport
infrastructure (particularly land transportation access to ports and terminals) to maintain an efficient system.<p>

<p>

  The <i>Inventory of American Intermodal Equipment</i> was automated and is now available through MARAD's
<i>MARlinespike</i> bulletin board. <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Ongoing Initiative: <u>Intermodal Systems</u></b><p>

<p>


  Phase II of a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Program to develop an "Integrated Marine/Rail
Intermodal System" continued.  The objective is to define the critical elements of an efficient marine/rail
intermodal system that can accommodate cargo growth in areas where port expansion is limited. <p>

<p>

  Phase IV of the Maritime System of the America (MSA) program is underway; it will include an analysis of
the northern portions of the MSA study area.  Outreach meetings will be held on the potential growth of
general cargo movements via water routings in the North American Free Trade 
Zone (NAFTA) region.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Ongoing Initiative: <u>Interagency Activities</u></b><p>
<p>

MARAD continued implementing key provisions of memoranda of understanding 
with other DOT agencies which seek to remove land transportation bottlenecks 
affecting the flow of cargo and people to and from the Nation's ports.<p>

   <p>

MARAD also continued to provide maritime and seaport perspectives to the NAFTA's Land Transportation
Standard Subcommittee.  This Subcommittee seeks compatibility of land transportation standards among the
United States, Canada, and Mexico.   <p>

<p>

  MARAD further supported the National Economic Council's (NEC) Border Efficiency Task Force on Border
Issues, Program, and Barriers to Further ImproveMents.  This Task Force was established by the NEC in
response to results of the ISTEA Section 6015 Border Crossing Study.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>New Initiative: <u>Military Liaison</u></b><p>

<p>

  MARAD began a study to determine the quantity and type of containers 
available from the commercial sector in the event of a military contingency.  
The study will help determine potential shortfalls, based on
time-phased leasing of containers.  Follow-up meetings will be held with the 
military and lessors to review the study and plan for reducing shortfall 
areas.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>New Initiative: <u>Intermodal Data and Information</u></b><p>

<p>

  The Agency initiaded development of a marine intermodal tranport infrastructure catalogue.  Hnformation
will provide guidance on how port and terminal access infrastructure issues should be treated/included in the
next authorization of ISTEA and the proposed National Transportation System.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Environmental Activities</b><p>

<p>

As part of the overall reorganization of phe Agency early in FY 1995, 
MARAD consolidated its diverse marine-related environmental activities by 
establishing a single new Office of Environmental Activities.  The
Agency monitors the development of the national and international 
environmental standards affecting the maritime industry.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>New Initiatives in Environmental Standards</b><p>

<p>

As part of its effort to remove barriers to U.S. maritime industry 
competitiveness, the Agency increased its involvement in the development 
of national and international standards.  As a result, MARAD serves on the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Advisory Group, 
Technical Committee on Ships and Marine Technology (TC8); also an Agency 
official is the United States Delegate to The Marine Environmental Protection 
Subcommittee (SC2).  The Agency also co-chaired two sessions of MARIENV'95
<i>"International Conference on Technologies for Marine Environment 
Preservation"</i> in Tokyo, Japan, September 24-29, 1995.<p>

<p>

MARAD participated on the ASTMF-25 Shipbuilding Standards Committee, 
Environmental Subcommittee;
the National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP), SP-1 Environmental Panel; 
the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Oil Pollution Research; 
the US-Japan Marine Facilities panel; and in the
environmental protection work of the Marine Board of the National Research 
Council.  The Agency also actively participated in Departmental and 
interagency committees involved in environmental issues affecting
the maritime industry.   <p>

<p>

MARAD continued participation in the U.S. Shipping Coordinating Committee 
(SHC).  The SHC and its subcommittees and working groups prepare U.S. 
positions for meetings of the Assembly, Council, committees, subcommittees, 
and various international conferences of the International Maritime 
Organization (IMO).  Topics include international maritime safety and 
marine environmental protection issues.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>New Environmental Standards Initiative:</b><p> 
<u><b>Dredging Process in the United States</b></u><p>
<p>

MARAD continued its commitment to addressing the difficult dredging issues 
that face many of the Nation's harbors.  MARAD maintained active 
participation in the activities of the National Dredging Team, which seeks
to facilitate communication, coordination, and resolution of dredging 
issues among participating Federal agencies.  <p>

  <p>

The National Dredging Team also serves as a forum for promoting 
implementation of the recommendations in the December 1994 Report to 
the Secretary of Transportation <i>"The Dredging Process in the United
States: An Action Plan for Improvement."</i>  <p>

   <p>

Participating Federal agencies include the Environmental Protection Agency, 
the Army Corps of Engineers, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and MARAD.  MARAD
also assisted in educating stakeholders, including ports, on the dredging 
process and the regional dredging teams that are being formed.<p>

   <p>

MARAD's leadership and commitment to resolving dredging issues was also 
reflected by other activities
related to disposal and management of contaminated dredge material in FY 1995.  
These included participation in various activities of the New York/New Jersey 
 Dredged Material Management Forum, which is
working to resolve the dredging crisis in the Port of New York/New Jersey 
caused by large volumes of contaminated harbor sediments.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>
<b>Environmental Standards New Initiative:</b><p>
<u><b>Environmental Compliance and Compliance Management</b></u><p>

<p>

As part of its cmmmitment to environmental compliance and compliance 
management, MARAD initiated the second round of environmental compliance 
reviews and training for five MARAD facilities: the U.S. Merchant
Marine Academy, Great Lakes Fire Training Center, James River Reserve Fleet, 
Beaumont Reserve Fleet, and Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet.  In addition, 
MARAD continues to implement recent Presidential executive
orders dealing with pollution preventaon, recycling, and environmental 
justice.<p>

<p>

MARAD initiated a research prohect directed at shipbreaking, a growing 
environmental issue facing the
maritime industry.  MARAD's study of environmentally sensitive shipbreaking 
in the United States involves:
hazardous materials sampling and testing of ships destined for scrapping; 
assessing current and advanced technologies for ship scrapping/recycling; 
reviewing the legal and regulatory regime for ship scrapping/recycling; 
assessing costs and benefits of ship scrapping/recycling in the United States; 
and preparing an environmental assessment of Federal Government shipbreaking 
in the United States.<p>

<p>

MARAD continued to fulfill its responsibilities for the safe and 
environmentally sound management of
hazardous materials, including polychlorinated biphenyls, on board 
MARAD ships scheduled for disposal in
both foreign countries and the United States.<p>

<p>

MARAD continued to fulfill its legal, financial and technical 
responsibilities for evaluating and
implementing remediation plans and actions concerning two contaminated sites 
in California that were previously World War II shipyards under U.S. 
Government control. <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Environmental Standards New Initiative:</b><p>
<u><b>Industry Support</b></u><p>

<p>

MARAD assists the U.S. shipbuilding and ship repaIr industries with their 
efforts to comply with environmental laws and regulations.<p>

<p>

MARAD prepared and distributed four issues of its quarterly 
<i>"Report on Port and Shipping Safety and Environmental Protection."</i>  
These reports summarized activities at the international and national levels
concerning safety and environmental protection matters related to ports and 
shipping.<p>

<p>

MARAD continued support for interagency environmental research regarding 
marine engine air pollution monitoring and control; 
U.S. implementation of MARPOL 73/78 Annex V (Prevention of Pollution by 
Garbage from Ships); remediation and management of contaminated marine 
sediments; and shipboard ballast technologies and practices for controlling 
introductions of nonindigenous aquatic organisms.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<p>

<b>Environmental Standards New Initiative:</b><p>
<u><b>Nuclear Ship NS SAVANNAH</b></u><p>

<p>

MARAD remains responsible for the NS SAVANNAH, the world's first 
nuclear-powered merchant vessel. The NS SAVANNAH was designed and 
constructed in 1958 and decommissioned in 1972 after successfully
fulfilling all of the R & D objectives established by the U.S. Atomic 
Energy Commission/MARAD Joint
Program Office which managed the program for the Government. <p>

 <p>

After 13 years in the Patriots Point Naval and Maritime Museum in 
Mt. Pleasant, SC, the NS SAVANNAH was
returned to MARAD in May 1995.  After MARAD obtained modification of the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission's license required for relocation of the 
vessel, the vessel was redelivered to MARAD control,
moved to the BethShip Sparrows Point Shipyard, Baltimore, MD, for necessary 
repairs and maintenance, and towed to the James River Reserve Fleet for 
indefinite layup.

<h4><CENTER>MARAD '95 ANNUAL REPORT</CENTER></H4><p>
<a><H4><CENTER>Chapter 5: Domestic Operations</center></h4></a> 
<hr>

<p>

<p>
<b>
The segment of the American merchant marine which operates on the Great 
Lakes, the inland waterways, and in the coastwise, intercoastal, and 
domestic offshore trades carries a combined total of
over 1 billion short tons of cargo each year.</b><p>

<p>

<hr>

<p>

<p>

<b>Technical Assistance</b><p>


 MARAD provides technical assistance to the domestic shipping industry.  The Agency completed a
significant investigative project, the "Assessment of Port and Terminal Infrastructure Damage and
Navigation Impacts -- 1993 Upper Mississippi River Flood" and initiated work on a second project, the
"Shallow Draft Waterways Industry Assessment." MARAD also developed the film short "Barging into the
21st Century," which highlights the efficiency and reliability of the U.S. domestic barge industry.  Release
is scheduled for mid-1996.  MARAD also provided advanced information and distributed the Department of
Energy's assessment of the winter fuels forecast for 1995 in order to 
diminish the likelihood for energy-related Jones Act waiver requests.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Jones Act Information Services</b><p>

<p>

MARAD receives over 150 requests annually for Jones Act information.  Typically, the Division of
Domestic Shipping will respond with official clarification of Jones Act law, provide points of contacts in
obtaining Jones Act vessels, and respond within 48 hours to formal Jones Act Waiver Requests.  With
less than 48 hours to respond to waivers, personnel continuously update contacts and exchange
information with officials at the Departments of Energy and Treasury, and the Defense Department.<p>

<p>

  No new waivers were granted during this reporting period.<p>
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Great Lakes</b>

<p>

The U.S.-flag Great Lakes bulk fleet consisted of 65 self-propelled 
vessels of 1,000 gross registered tons and over.  This includes 63 dry-bulk 
vessels and 2 tankers, of which 57 were active, 1 was temporarily
inactive, and 7 were inactive on long-term lay-up.  (See Table 9.)  
This represents nearly full utilization of the
vessels capable of competitive operation in the region's bulk trades.  
The Great Lakes also has 6 ferries of over 1,000 gross registered tons, 
of which 1 is active and the remaining 5 are in long-term lay-up.<p>

<p>

The primary dry bulk cargoes (iron ore, coal, and limestone), shipped 
from U.S. ports during the 1995 shipping season through September 
totaled 83.9 million short tons.  Total cargo carried in 1995 increased
about 6 percent from the previous year.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Inland Waterways</b><p>

<p>

  After experiencing more than a decade of losses, the barge industry finally returned to profitability.  This
turnaround of the industry was attributed to fewer barges, higher freight rates, new traffic patterns, and a
near-record grain harvest.<p>

According to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) statistics, 619 million tons of freight moved on the
Nation's inland waterways in 1994, which is just below the record 622.6 million tons moved in 1990, but well
above the 607.3 million tons moved in 1993.  Estimates of shallow-draft tonnage for 1995 are predicted to be
higher than last year, with future annual growth rates expected to be between 1 and 2 percent.  The COE
predicts that between 715 and 865 million tons of cargo will be moving on the inland waterway system by
2010. <p>

There were a number of bright spots for inland waterway operators in 1995.  One was the grain market,
especially for export corn.  The bulk of the grain that is exported moves via the Gulf of Mexico, and 90
percent of that moves down the Mississippi River by barge.  Another strong business sector for inland water
transport was the chemical industry, with waterway carriers moving 
nearly 25 percent of their total tonnage.  The United States is the world's 
largest exporter of chemicals and these shipments are
expected to remain strong.  The oil industry also contributed last year to 
the growth of tonnage on the inlandwaterways.  <p>

The United States demand for oil is expected to grow by 1 to 2 percent annually, and that is expected to
lead to more barging of petroleum and petroleum products.  Another user of barge transportation is the steel
industry, with its waterside plants receiving scrap metals by barge and then shipping out finished steel
products also by barge.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Higher Freight Rates</b><p>

<p>

  The barge industry had been hit hard in recent years by sagging freight rates.  However, during 1994, grain
crops created a big increase in demand for barges and, as a consequence, rates rose significantly.  This
trend lasted throughout 1995. <p>


  The major factor leading to higher rates was a shortage of barge capacity.  With barges aging and,
consequently, being phased out, retirements outstripped new construction.  
This lack of equipment led to full barge employment and higher freight 
rates.<p>

Rates, which are based on a 1976 benchmark tariff of 100, have never been higher.  In fact, there were
reports of barge rates rising to the extent that some shippers shifted their grain from water to rail because of
lower rail rates.  In the spring of 1994, for example, barge rates were around 95 percent of tariff  which is 5
percent lower than they were nearly 20 years ago.  But with the record harvests of corn and soybeans in late
1994, rates rose to 250 percent.  <p>

By late September, they hit their peak at between 350 and 370 percent -- or about 133 percent higher in
dollar terms than the average rate for that month.  What was most unusual was when the harvest ended,
rates did not fall during what is traditionally the slow season.  Expectations are that if farmers continue to
produce such large volumes, rates will continue to remain above 
average for the coming years.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Shipyard Activity</b><p>

Business for smaller "second-tier" shipyards was mixed in 1995.  The first half of the year saw yards closing
and being sold, a continued lack of demand for new offshore service vessels, and a slowdown in the casino
boat market. More than 15 gambling boats were either for sale or looking for new venues.  However, shipyard
activity improved later in the year, with the brightest area being the 
inland barge sector. <p>

However, the increase in their freight rates and revenues still have not completely convinced waterway
operators to begin any new large-scaled building boom.  The number of barges retired from service
continues to exceed the number of new buildings, a situation that is expected to continue for at least another
year. <p>

There were several sizeable barge construction contracts announced in 1995, with one yard reporting it was
building a barge a day.  Some inland shipyards had substantial back orders for 1995 and some have even
reported a full order book through 1996.  But the majority of these contracts continue to be for replacement
equipment, not additions.  For example, one sizeable contract to build 68 new tank barges will not add to the
fleet, but replace older barges being retired. <p>

However, because of years of pent-up demand, the potential for new construction is definitely there.  The
barge fleet is aging and shrinking slightly.  At the end of 1994, the number of active barges on the
Mississippi River System, including tributaries and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway totaled 21,156.  This
compares with a total of 21,232 barges at the end of 1993.  Also, of the 1,224 towboats in the Nation's fleet,
as of August 1994, 49 percent had been in service 21 years or longer, and some 32 percent were built over
25 years ago.  Since 1985, a total of only 80 towboats have been 
built -- just 28 of these in the last 5 years.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>New Traffic Patterns</b><p>

<p>

  Market conditions improved considerably in the latter half of 1994, initially as a result of a stronger economy
that increased demand for many raw material commodities.  As manufacturing increased in the Midwest,
imports of aluminum, steel, coal, cement, and fertilizer began moving northbound, creating a shortage of
barges to haul export grain south.  Strong demand for grain exports only made this situation worse, with
grain tonnage moving down the Mississippi up nearly 30 percent over last year.  With many petrochemical
plants operating at near capacity, tank barge utilization was also around 100 percent.  The record 1994 grain
harvest taxed the capacity of the barge industry even further in the fall, which brought the demand/supply
balance close to equilibrium.  <p>

Based on recent growth trends, tonnage for dry cargo barges is expected to increase at a rate of 1 to 2
percent annually, a rate that will exceed that for dry cargo capacity, which is expected to be no more than 1
percent annually.  This situation is expected to contribute to an improvement in barge utilization and,
consequently, an increase in freight rates to the year 2000.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>River Conditions</b><p>

<p>

  The barge industry experienced its third-worst consecutive spring flooding.  Losses amounted to $1.5
million a day.  For over 3 weeks, flooding closed or restricted traffic on the Mississippi River and tributaries.
Although not as devastating as in 1993, high water had a significant impact on waterway operations when
the Mississippi was closed from May 19 to June 13, the Illinois River from May 28 to June 12, and the
Missouri River from May 16 to June 7.  In addition to disrupting ferry and riverboat casino operations, some
198 tows with over 5,100 barges were either stranded or halted 
by high water.<p>

The chief concerns expressed by the industry include the potential for an increase in user fees; additional
regulations (State and/or Federal); a deteriorating infrastructure (32, or 80 percent, of the 40 lock chambers
on the Upper Mississippi River were built before 1942); insufficient monies from the Inland Waterway Trust
Fund; the high costs of dredging; and the lack of acceptable dredge material disposal sites. One new
concern is the downsizing of Federal agencies, such as the COE and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), that
interact with the shallow-draft industry.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Great Lakes to Inland Waterways</b><p>

<p>

  Shippers in the Great Lakes are using river barges between Great Lakes ports in Lake Michigan through
Chicago and the Illinois Waterway to domestic and international markets.  This new trend led to the Port of
Milwaukee's gain of over 400,000 tons of new business over the past 2 years.  In addition, the ports of
Benton Harbor/St. Joseph, Michigan have been approved by the USCG for river barge operation.  Additional
ports such as Grand Haven, Holland, and Muskegon, Michigan, are presently under USCG review for
approval of river barge operation.  Barge transportation offers cost-effective alternatives to shippers and
reduces the impact on the environment.<p>

During the 1995 shipping season, both U.S. and Canadian-flag Great Lakes self-unloading vessels
increased the operation of direct ship-to-river barge cargo transfer offshore at the harbor entrance to the
Calumet River at Chicago.  <p>

This new transfer technique between a self-unloader vessel to river barge has been used primarily for grain,
salt, and chemicals imported from Canadian ports within the Upper Great Lakes and destined to U.S.
destinations as far as the Gulf Intercoastal Waterway.<p>

This integration of the inland system with the Great Lakes is an integral 
part of America's national transportation strategy for full utilization of 
the Nation's waterways system.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Domestic Tanker Movements</b><p>

  <p>

U.S.-flag tankers averaged 67 voyages each month from Valdez, AK in FY 1994.  
An average of 1.70 million barrels per day of crude were transported from 
Valdez in calendar year 1993. Of these shipments, 79 percent went to the 
U.S. west coast, 9 percent to Panama for transshipment to 
the U.S. east coast, 6 percent to the Virgin Islands, and 6 percent to 
Alaska and Hawaii.  The tanker and barge movements of petroleum from the 
gulf coast to the east coast has increased by over 8 percent, averaging 
about .5 million barrels per day.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Offshore Drilling</b><p>

<p>

  Seventy percent of the production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is natural gas.  In October 1995, gas prices
from offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico were quoted at $1.57 per million cubic feet ($/mcf).  This price
was up from $1.47 a year earlier.  Over the last 25 years, the oil industry reorganized its exploration and
development activities to minimize fixed costs.  A pyramidal structure evolved: major assets are now rented,
not owned, and the major oil companies permit independent service companies to bid on each aspect of
development projects, such as seismic survey, exploratory drilling and logistics support.  Additionally, mobile
rigs now are typically chartered and equipment used in wells, such 
as drill pipe, is rented.  This structure permits rapid changes in the size of oil company exploration budgets,
but support/supplier companies (and their lenders) have experienced feast 
or famine business cycles. <p>

A significant increase in the level of gas production in the U.S. Gulf seems unlikely.  The depletion rates of
existing wells suggest that many will be exhausted within 3 years, and in the near future many of the
currently operating offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico will have to be replaced.  At year's end, there were 176
mobile offshore rigs located in the Gulf of Mexico, of which 147 were under contract.  This translates into a
83.5 percent utilization rate, up from 79.2 percent in 1994.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Offshore Service Vessels</b><p>

<p>

MARAD maintains an active liaison with the offshore industry by following 
U.S.-flag vessel activity, and assisting industry in locating qualified 
Jones Act vessels to support this important trade.<p>

The utilization rate for offshore supply vessels has been improving gradually as a result of only limited new
building, while a number of existing vessels have been converted for use in specialized services, such as
spill response.  The utilization rate for November 1995 was over 94.5 percent, a dramatic increase over the
recent industry low of 55 percent in 1992.<p>

The rate paid for tug/supply boat and other support craft is almost totally dependent on the number of
working offshore petroleum product rigs.  Each working rig means work for 1.5 to 2 support/supply vessels.
Jobs for these support vessels are put out to bid by the oil companies on a "day rate" basis.  Since there is
little to differentiate one supply boat from another, the "day rate" a boat can command is a direct function of
the "rig count" (the number of rigs working).  Demand for work boats remained high through the end of 1995
with day rates averaging about $3,600 for the charter of an 180-foot supply vessel.  This is good news as
1995 started slowly with day rates in the $2,900 range.<p>

Approximately 16,054 marine employees are engaged aboard 1,188 U.S.-flag, 
offshore support vessels.

<h4><center>MARAD '95 ANNUAL REPORT</CENTER></H4><P>
<H4><center>Chapter 6:  Ship Operations</center></h4><p>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>U.S.-Flag Fleet Profile</b><p>

<p>

The U.S.-flag, privately owned, deep-draft oceangoing merchant 
fleet (including the Great Lakes fleet shown in Table 9) totaled 322 
vessels with an aggregate carrying capacity of about 15.3 million
deadweight tons (dwt.) on September 30, 1995.<p>

Of this total, 292 ships of 13.6 million dwt. were active.  The latter included 16 breakbulk cargo ships, 122
intermodal vessels (containerships, barge-carrying vessels and roll-on\roll-off vanships known as
RO/ROs), 1 combination passenger-cargo ship, 135 tankers (including liquefied natural gas carriers), and
18 bulk carriers.  (See Table 10.)  The remaining 30 vessels were inactive 
and laid up.<p>

Employment of the U.S.-flag oceangoing merchant fleet 
(including Government-owned ships) in fiscal
year (FY) 1994 is shown in Table 11.<p>

The privately owned, American-flag merchant fleet ranked 11th in the world 
on a dwt. basis and 23rd in the total number of ships on October 1, 1995.  
(See Table 12.)<p>

Commercial cargoes carried by ships of all flags in the U.S. oceanborne foreign trade totaled 899.1
million tons during calendar year 1994.  U.S.-flag foreign trade tonnage decreased from 36.2 million tons
in 1993 to 35 million tons in 1994, and the U.S.-flag share of total tonnage decreased from 4.2 percent in
1993 to 3.9 percent in 1994.<p>

Commercial cargoes transported in U.S. oceanborne foreign trade from calendar 
year 1985 through calendar year 1994 are shown in Table 13.  
The table shows the total trade by tonnage and value, and the
portion carried by U.S.-flag vessels.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>
<p>

<b>Operating-Differential Subsidy (ODS)</b><p>

<p>

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) administers the operating-differential 
subsidy (ODS) program, which is designed to offset certain lower ship 
operating costs of foreign flag competitors.  U.S.-flag vessels which
operate in essential foreign trade are eligible for ODS.<p>

Net subsidy outlays in FY 1995 totaled $199 million.  There were no 
subsidized voyages terminated in the Great Lakes trade during FY 1995.<p>

ODS accruals and expenditures from January 1, 1937, through September 30, 1995, 
are summarized in Table 14.  Accruals and outlays by shipping lines for the 
same period are shown in Table 15.  ODS contracts in force are shown in 
Table 16.<p>

On December 20, 1994, the Maritime Subsidy Board granted consent for the 
merger of Farrell Lines Incorporated into Argonaut Line, Inc.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>Section 614</b><p>

<p>

  Section 614 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, permits a company receiving ODS funds to
elect to suspend its ODS agreement for all or a portion of its vessels, subject to certain conditions.
Suspension of the ODS agreement includes suspending all attendant statutory and contractual restrictions
in the ODS agreement, except those pertaining to operation in the domestic 
trade.<p>

No vessels operated under suspended ODS agreements during FY 1995.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>
<p>

<b>Subsidy Rates</b><p>

<p>

The Subsidy Index System was established by the Merchant Marine Act of 1970.  
It provides for payment of seafaring wage subsidies in per diem amounts.  
The rate of change in the index is computed annually by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics and is used as the measure of change in seafaring 
employment costs.  ODS rates also are calculated for maintenance and repairs, 
hull and machinery insurance, and protection and indemnity
insurance for both premiums and deductibles.<p>

MARAD has substantially completed the 1994 subsidy rates applicable to 
liner and bulk vessel operations.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Section 804 Activities</b><p>

<p>

  Section 804 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, prohibits any contractor receiving ODS or any
holding company, subsidiary, affiliate, or associate of such contractor, directly or indirectly, to own, charter,
act as agent or broker for, or operate any foreign-flag vessel which competes with an essential U.S.-flag
service, without prior approval of the Secretary of Transportation.  The prohibition also applies to any officers,
directors, agents, or executives of such an organization.  Waivers are approved under special circumstances
or if good causes are shown.<p>

During the year, MARAD approved waivers for APL:<p>

o  to charter and operate a foreign-flag relief vessel for a single voyage of approximately 45 days,
commencing in late December 1994 due to required drydocking of two APL line haul vessels
(October 24, 1994),<p>

o  to operate in its existing services six new vessels under foreign flag 
(November 15, 1994), and <p>

o  to charter slots on vessels of other participants in Asia-Atlantic Alliance Agreement 203-011467 and
Master Slot Charter Agreement.  APL is participating in a reciprocal slot exchange agreement and in
a Master Slot Agreement with Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd., Nedlloyd Lines B.V., and Orient Overseas
Container Line, Inc. (February 3, 1995)  <p>

<p>

MARAD also approved Lykes' requests for waivers which:<p>

o  permit the time charter of four vessels under foreign registry between ports in the U.S. gulf and east
coast and north Europe after delivery from a German shipyard, through the termination of Lykes'
operating subsidy contract on December 31, 1997 (February 27, 1995),<p>

o  allow carriage of two commuter railcar shells on a foreign-flag ship between Lisbon, Portugal, and
Baltimore, MD (March 8, 1995),<p>

o  allow up to three commuter railcar shells to be carried on a foreign-flag ship between Lisbon,
Portugal, and Baltimore, MD (March 17, 1995),<p>

o  authorize up to 45 commuter railcar shells to be lifted from Lisbon, Portugal, to Baltimore, MD, on a
foreign-flag ship when Lykes' U.S. flag vessels were not in position (April 25, 1995), and<p>

o  permit participation in a reciprocal space charter, sailing, and cooperative working agreement with
Evergreen Marine Corporation in the trade between the U.S. gulf, east, and west coasts and
Northern Europe (May 11, 1995).<p>

<p>

MARAD also approved Waterman's request for waivers by:<p>

o  authorizing an amendment to the waiver granted January 31, 1989, to Waterman and its parent,
International Shipholding Corporation (ISC), to reflect the substitution of the vessel LE DUAN for the
vessel ATLANTIC FOREST, and the removal of the HICKORY and MAMMOTH TIGER, which are no
longer operated by ISC subsidiaries (April 7, 1995), and<p>

o  amending further the waiver granted January 31, 1989, to allow certain 
technical changes to be made to reflect more accurately the current 
operations of ISC and its affiliates (May 22, 1995).<p>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<p>

<b>Foreign Transfers</b><p>

<p>

  Under Section 9 of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended, MARAD approved the transfer of 78 ships of 1,000
gross tons and over to foreign ownership and/or registry.  Twenty-eight (28) privately owned vessels were
sold for scrapping abroad.  Permission also was granted for eight vessels of less than 1,000 gross tons to be
registered in Russia.<p>

Public Law 100-710 authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to determine the criteria for approval of
citizen and noncitizen trustees for mortgages held for the benefit of noncitizens who cannot qualify as a
preferred mortgagee.  Three new banks were approved as trustees, and one company was approved as
preferred mortgagee.  All approvals are published in the 
<u>Federal Register</u>.<p>

MARAD's approval of the transfer of vessels of 3,000-gross tons and over to foreign ownership and/or
registry is subject to the terms and conditions of 46 CFR Part 221.  As such, the vessels require MARAD
approval for any subsequent transfer of ownership and/or registry and are 
available for requisitioning if needed.   <p>

At year's end there were a total of 187 vessels subject to these terms, 20 of which were approved for
subsequent transfer of ownership and/or registry during the year.  User charges for processing applications
for foreign transfers and similar actions totaled $46,470 in this reporting period.  This total includes fees filed
pursuant to MARAD contracts reflecting the terms and conditions stipulated 
in 46 CFR Part 221.<p>

Activities under Section 9 of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended, 
are summarized in Table 17.<p>

<h4><center>MARAD '95 ANNUAL REPORT</center></h4><p>
<h4><center>Chapter 7: National Cargo and Compliance</center></h4><p>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

  The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is responsible for monitoring the administration of and compliance with
U.S. cargo preference laws and regulations by Federal agencies as they relate to individual programs which
generate oceanborne cargoes.<p>

MARAD is responsible for ensuring that cargo preference compliance is achieved.  It also encourages Federal
agencies to maximize the use of U.S.-flag vessels, monitors bilateral and similar agreements, and identifies
discriminatory or potentially discriminatory trade practices against U.S.-flag vessels.<p>

Major programs monitored include humanitarian aid shipments provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) and U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), commodities financed by the Export-Import Bank
(Eximbank), foreign military sales, and Department of Defense (DOD) cargo shipped by commercial ocean
carriers.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Preference Cargo</b><p>

<p>

  Monitoring compliance with United States cargo preference laws is essential in encouraging Federal agencies to
maximize the use of U.S.-flag vessels.  MARAD is required to report annually to Congress on compliance with the
three major cargo preference laws:<p>

<p>

o  The <b>Cargo Preference Act of 1954 </b>(P.L. 83-664), as amended, requires that at least 50 percent of the gross
tonnage of all Government-generated cargo be transported on privately owned, U.S.-flag commercial vessels to
the extent such vessels are available at fair and reasonable rates.  In 1985, the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 was
amended to require that the percentage of certain agricultural cargoes required to be carried on U.S.-flag vessels
increase from 50 to 75 percent.<p>

o  <b>The Cargo Preference Act of 1904 </b>requires all items procured for or owned by U.S. military departments and
defense agencies be carried exclusively (100 percent) on U.S.-flag vessels available at fair and reasonable rates.<p>

These cargoes are generated primarily by DOD contracts with domestic and foreign contractors.  Cargo
preference applies not only to the end product but also to component parts.<p>

<p>

o  <b>Public Resolution (P.R.) 17 of the 73rd Congress</b> requires that all cargoes generated by the Export-Import Bank
be shipped on U.S.-flag vessels, unless a waiver is granted.<p>

<p>

MARAD monitors the shipping activities of Federal agencies, independent entities, and Government corporations
(see Table 18).  Statistics are maintained on a calendar year (CY) basis or 
on a 12-month program maintained over the life of a loan or guarantee.<p>

<p>

  In FY 1994 and 1995, the Department of Justice (DOJ) responded to a Military Sealift Command (MSC) request to
resolve its disagreement relating to MARAD's approval of conditions in time and space charters of U.S.-flag ships that
are privately negotiated between the shipowner and noncitizens that prohibit noncitizens from carrying preference
cargoes in space on U.S.-flag ships chartered by such companies.  This matter remains under active review at the
Federal Maritime Commission.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Civilian Agencies</b><p>

<b>Israeli Cash Transfer</b><p>

Under the Israeli Cash Transfer Program, a "side letter" was in effect from FY 1980 through FY 1989.  The
Government of Israel did not execute a side letter with AID commencing October 1, 1990.  In December 1991, Israel
issued a new "side letter" to AID to transport 50 percent of grain shipments from the United States to Israel on U.S.-flag vessels during FY 1992.  The "side letter" agreement was renewed again for FY 1994.  During FY 1994, U.S.-flag
vessels transported approximately 800,000 metric tons and earned revenues of approximately $20 million. <p>

 <p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Export-Import Bank (Eximbank)</b><p>

<p>

  Eximbank shipments are governed by P.R. 17, which requires that 100 percent of all cargoes generated by this
resolution move on U.S.-flag vessels.  <p>

<p>

  If a recipient country meets United States' requirements and requests a general waiver, it would be allowed to move
50 percent of the cargoes on national-flag vessels.<p>

<p>

  In the Eximbank program, total tonnage increased from 144,752 metric tons in CY 1993 to 167,289 metric tons in CY
1994.  U.S. operators' carriage increased some 12 percent from 92,907 metric tons in CY 1993 to 104,034 metric tons
during CY 1994.  The 11,127 metric ton increase in U.S.-flag carriers' tonnage resulted from an upturn in new project
activities.  The U.S.-flag ocean freight revenue for CY 1994 was $36,686,031.<p>

<p>

  Eximbank officials continue to support P.R. 17.  Since the termination of Lykes breakbulk vessels, the request for
non-availability waivers for project cargoes has increased dramatically.  Eximbank has participated in several
meetings designed to introduce new U.S.-flag service and to improve the working relationship between the carriers
and shippers.  No new U.S.-flag services were reported during this fiscal year.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR)</b><p>

<p>

  In 1977, the U.S. Government announced its intention to store 750 million barrels of crude oil in salt domes along
the U.S. Gulf Coast as a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).  At the end of CY 1994, approximately 592 million
barrels had been stored at five SPR sites.<p>

The Cargo Preference Act of 1954 requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to transport at least 50 percent of the
oil in U.S.-flag tankers.  In 1977, MARAD and DOE agreed that to ascertain compliance, long ton/miles (LTM) more
accurately reflect the diverse geographical distances in transporting the 
oil than by tonnage alone.<p>

In CY 1992, DOE reactivated its procurement activities following its August 1990 suspension of oil purchases due to
unstable conditions in the Persian Gulf.  During 1994, U.S.-flag tankers carried SPR cargoes amounting to 1.623
billion LTM (57.51 percent) with revenue of $7.34 million.<p>

The SPR program is monitored cumulatively from its inception for compliance purposes.  U.S.-flag carriers have
received 53 percent of the cargoes.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Military Cargoes</b><p>

<p>

  MARAD initiates and recommends regulations and procedures for DOD agencies to follow in administering cargo
preference.  Program efforts concentrate on meetings and discussions with DOD contractors, suppliers, freight
forwarders, and shipping companies to focus attention on meeting the needs of all constituents within the context of
U.S.-flag carriage requirements.<p>

The Cargo Preference Act of 1904 (10 U.S.C. 2631) (the 1904 Act) is the primary law that applies to DOD.  It
requires that items procured for, or owned by the military departments or defense agencies, must be carried
exclusively (100 percent) on U.S.-flag vessels, if available at reasonable rates.  The preponderance of DOD cargoes
moves on vessels chartered-in to Military Sealift Command (MSC) and the Military Traffic Management Command
(MTMC).  However, a significant amount of DOD cargo moves in the commercial sector.  Cargo preference applies not
only to the end item but also to its component parts and supplies.  <p>

MARAD, MTMC, and MSC are creating a "Memorandum of Agreement" which will establish procedures for reporting
DOD sponsored shipments of personal effects.  Upon finalization of the agreement in FY 1996, MTMC will provide
MARAD with quarterly reports on the movement of these personal effects, including copies of reports indicating
approval to use foreign-flag vessels.  <p>

Since 1994, MARAD has been receiving data on the movement of privately owned vehicles (POVs) being
transported between selected turn-in points in CONUS to six points in the Republic of Germany.  The ocean carrier
awarded the contract reports ocean tonnage and revenue.   <p>

MSC continues to use time chartered vessels in direct competition with U.S.-flag scheduled service.  Twice, in
calendar year 1995, Farrell Lines lost cargo to a MSC-controlled vessel and to an RRF vessel.  MARAD is formally
proposing a joint task group to meet periodically to review and to resolve these types of problems.<p>

The Federal Acquisition Council published a notice in the <u>Federal Register</u> on March 22, 1995, which would waive
the cargo preference laws for shipments of commercial items and commercial components by subcontractors.  Both
MARAD and the ocean carrier industry oppose the proposed change since it will result in a loss of revenue for U.S.
ocean carriers.  MARAD, through the Department of Transportation, filed comments on May 22, 1995, in opposition to
any waivers of the cargo preference laws, noting that any changes to cargo preference should be addressed in the
context of "maritime" reform legislation rather than "procurement" reform.  As a compromise, "firewall" language was
added to the regulation to limit its impact, and the implementation date was delayed until May 1, 1996, in order to
give the maritime industry an opportunity to propose an alternative 
solution.<p>

A review of the top 10 defense contractors for FY 1994 shows that only 2 companies have excellent records of
reporting shipments to MARAD.  (See Chart 3.)  However, MARAD is working with both MTMC and MSC to improve
reporting by these contractors.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>DOD Services and Agencies</b><p>

<p>

A brief description of the activity in each DOD organization follows.<p>
<p>
<hr><p>
<p>
<b>Defense Security Assistance Agency</b><p>

The Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA) is the sponsoring DOD agency for the Foreign Military Financing
(FMF)/Military Assistance Program Merger (MAP) and related programs authorized within the scope of the Foreign
Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA).  The movement of excess defense articles within these programs is
consistent with the continued drawdown of U.S. forces, especially from Northern Europe, and the closure of U.S.
military bases worldwide.<p>

The statistics reflected in <i>Table 18</i> from the FMF/MAP Merger and related FAA programs represent combined
tonnage and revenue data for those ocean shipments arranged by the foreign recipients' freight forwarder.  These
statistics also reflect cargoes that were authorized to move within the Defense Transportation System (DTS) and
which were processed by the MTMC and the MSC.<p>

U.S.-flag participation meets the compliance requirements as set forth in the governing cargo preference law (P.L.
83-664) and reflects MARAD's efforts to maximize the use of U.S.-flag vessels.  Continuing its support of the U.S.
merchant marine, and its cooperation with MARAD, DSAA extends its 100 percent U.S.-flag shipping policy for the
FMF/MAP Merger programs to the related FAA program transfer.  DSAA policy incorporates general waivers thereby
allowing the recipient's national-flag vessels to participate in the ocean carriage of cargo within each program.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Air Force</b><p>

The Air Force program decreased during this reporting period.  This program uses a significant amount of air
transportation, which reduces the use of ocean transportation.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Army/Corps of Engineers</b><p>

<p>

As a result of DOD downsizing and budgetary cutbacks, a slight reduction in 
Army program tonnage resulted in CY 1994.  The Corps of Engineers showed an 
increase in metric tons reported.  MARAD has established productive working 
relationships with DOD agencies and contractors to improve communication and 
awareness on the availability and benefits of U.S.-flag transportation.  
Enhancements to the computer system used by MARAD allow greater efficiency 
and flexibility in reporting.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)</b><p>

<p>

There was a significant increase in DLA contracts awarded in CY 1994.  
This increase was based on a large shipment of coal in bulk from the 
East Coast to Amsterdam, and large shipments of rubber from 
Indonesia/Malaysia to the West Coast.  DLA is 100 percent in compliance.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA)</b><p>

<p>

The DNA recently began using commercial ocean transportation to ship supplies 
from Japan to the West Coast. They also use the Defense Transportation 
System (DTS) in most of their shipments. <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Navy/Marine Corps</b><p>

<p>

The Navy program was principally in compliance with the cargo preference 
laws during this reporting period. However, the total tonnage is much 
lower due to Department of Defense budgetary cutbacks.<p>

Twenty-three percent of U.S. Navy cargoes were shipped on foreign-flag 
vessels.  The major cause of the foreign-flag shipments was lack of U.S. 
breakbulk service for large oversize articles.  Because no U.S.-flag 
carrier was able to provide this service, 95 percent of the foreign-flag 
shipments were made with a confirmation of non-availability of
U.S.-flag vessels by the Military Sealift Command.<p>

Continued MARAD communication with contracting officers and shipyard 
personnel, has resulted in better compliance with cargo preference 
procedures between prime contractors and their subcontractors. <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Agricultural Cargoes</b><p>

<p>

The statutory sources of agricultural cargo preference programs are Titles I, 
II, and III of P.L. 83-480; Section 416 of the Agricultural Act of 1949; 
and the Food for Progress Act of 1985.  These programs have a 75 percent 
U.S.-flag shipping requirement.  Collectively, 78.2 percent of the 6.2 
million metric tons of humanitarian aid commodities were transported on 
U.S.-flag vessels during the 1994/1995 Cargo Preference Year (CPY).<p>

<p>

Title I provides for U.S. Government financing of sales of U.S. agricultural commodities to developing countries on
concessional credit terms.  During FY 1995, 1.6 million metric tons of bulk grain were shipped during the current
CPY.<p>

Title II is a donation program administered by AID which generated approximately 2.8 million metric tons of
packaged, processed, and bulk commodities for least developed countries.<p>

Title III, Food for Development Program, was established by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of
1990 (1990 Farm Bill).  Under this bilateral grant program, agricultural commodities are donated to least developed
countries.  Shipments under the Title III program began during Cargo Preference Year 1991/1992.  Approximately 1.1
million metric tons of bulk grain were shipped during the current Cargo 
Preference Year.<p>

Section 416 is a donation program established primarily to distribute surplus commodity which generated
approximately 174,000 metric tons of bulk grain and other surplus agricultural commodities for least developed
countries.<p>

Food for Progress provides agricultural commodities to developing countries on a grant basis in exchange for
development policy reforms.  During the current CPY, 593,000 metric tons of commodity, principally bulk grain, were
donated.<p>

MARAD, USDA, and AID have conducted numerous joint discussions concerning the adoption of certain commercial
shipping terms for bulk humanitarian aid cargoes.  With their cooperation, it is hoped that the agricultural shipping
agencies will allow cargo to be fixed on a more commercial basis which should reduce carrier risk and lower ocean
carriage costs.<p>

<b>Ocean Freight Differential (OFD)</b><p>

<p>

The Food Security Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-198) increased the required percentage for U.S.-flag carriage from 50 to 75
percent of gross tonnage of certain agricultural programs (i.e., P.L. 83-480, Food for Progress, and Section 416
programs).<p>

The Department of Transportation is responsible for financing any increased 
ocean freight charges resulting from the application of the increased 
U.S.-flag portion.  MARAD reimburses USDA for its share of the OFD costs 
above 50 percent of the gross tonnage up to but not exceeding the additional 
25 percent.<p>

OFD cost is defined as the difference between the cost of shipping cargo on a U.S.-flag vessel as compared to
shipping the same cargo on a foreign-flag vessel.<p>

MARAD reimbursed the Commodity Credit Corp. (CCC) $28.4 million for OFD invoices and documents submitted
for the CPY which started on April 1, 1994.  This amount declined $7.7 million from the previous year due to reduced
agricultural program funding which resulted in lower tonnage and lower OFD rates.  CCC was not reimbursed for
OFD that included inland freight and bagging and stacking costs.<p>

The average OFD cost for which MARAD reimbursed USDA was $22.96 per metric ton, a reduction of $7.26 per
metric ton, or 24 percent.  This decrease was due to lower agricultural program funding levels, increased competition
for decreased tonnage, and strong foreign-flag rates during the CPY.  <p>

Under the 1985 Act, if the total obligations incurred by USDA and CCC of ocean freight and OFD on exports of
agricultural commodities and products under certain agricultural programs exceed 20 percent of the value of the
commodities exported under these programs, plus the ocean freight and OFD, MARAD must reimburse CCC for the
excess.  In 1994, MARAD received an $81 million invoice from USDA claiming that ocean freight rates for FY 1992
exceeded the 20 percent threshold.  After auditing, and removal of non-OFD charges, payment in the amount of
$35.2 million was forwarded during the CPY.  
This payment was in addition to the OFD reimbursed during the CPY. <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Minimum Tonnage</b><p>

<p>

The minimum tonnage for agricultural products was established under 
Section 901c(a)(1) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended.  This 
includes P.L. 480, Section 416, and Food for Progress.  The purpose of 
formulating a minimum average was to ensure that U.S.-flag carriers 
continue to receive a fair share of Government-generated agricultural 
exports.  <p>

Based on MARAD's preliminary program tonnage for FY 1995, a total 
of 5,188,383 metric tons of agricultural products were exported.  
The minimum tonnage for FY 1995, as calculated is 7,928,008 metric tons.  
This represents a deficit of 2,739,625 metric tons.  <p>

The foreign food aid tonnage exported during CY 1995 was below the average 
of the base period because of lower Congressional appropriations, 
higher average commodity costs, and reduced tonnage for the Section 416 
program.<p>

<h4><center>MARAD '95 ANNUAL REPORT</center></h4><p>
<a><h4><center>Chapter 8: Market Promotion</center></h4></a><p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<p>

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) engages in a variety of marketing programs designed to increase
U.S. participation in global commerce.  <p>

The Agency's programs focus on improving communications between U.S. ocean 
carriers and importers/exporters, and providing assistance on sea transport 
to U.S. manufacturing firms active in international trade.  MARAD also has 
developed a marketing program to promote U.S. shipyards in the international 
commercial market place, as part of the Administration's shipbuilding 
initiative.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Marketing Program - Carriers</b><p>

<p>

MARAD's marketing program for U.S. ocean carriers focuses on assisting companies through market
leads and personal contacts with exporters and importers to encourage them to give preference to U.S.
vessels for their ocean transport needs.  The Market Lead System refers to market intelligence collected
from both private and Government sources which MARAD, in turn, makes available to U.S. vessel
operators.  Over 5,000 market leads were distributed to U.S. carriers and exporters during fiscal year
1995.<p>

MARAD has offices strategically located throughout the country which consult with the transportation
policymakers of import and export firms.  In this reporting period, MARAD trade specialists consulted with
some 2,100 firms to encourage use of U.S. vessels.  Voluntary reports from carriers and shippers indicate
that over $90 million in additional ocean freight revenues for U.S. vessels resulted from these policy
consultations.  Over the last 11 years, in excess of $350 million in additional revenue for U.S. carriers has
been generated by this program.  To improve the quality of information provided to U.S. carriers and to
enhance the effectiveness of meetings with shippers, MARAD's computer data base was enhanced which
enables quick access to vital shipper information from America's importers and exporters.<p>

During FY 1995, MARAD participated in more than 350 seminars, forums, workshops, and other
meetings dealing with international trade and transportation.  The Agency sustained the visibility of its
marketing mission for support of the U.S. merchant marine by taking an active role in Government and
private export promotion programs.  Those programs include interacting with export trade promotional
organizations such as the Association of South East Asian Nations Council and Japan External Trade
Organization.  MARAD also is an active member of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee,
consisting of 19 Government agencies engaged in the promotion of U.S. international trade.  In addition,
MARAD is a member of the Presidential E-Award selection committee.  <p>

MARAD provided U.S.-flag carriers with promotional materials for distribution at nationwide, multi-city
export workshops and seminars sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  These meetings presented an
opportunity to provide information on transport economics and practices to shippers, carriers, freight
forwarders, and other maritime interests.  They also enabled the Agency to brief executives of firms involved
in foreign trade on the national policy benefits which result from shipper usage of U.S. services.<p>

In addition, MARAD provides business leads to U.S. companies through a shipper help line, which is
maintained to facilitate assistance to both U.S. exporters and importers.  The Agency maintains information
on U.S.-flag services in the Department of Commerce's National Trade Data Bank and "Flash Fax" system.
MARAD's computer bulletin board, MARlinespike, provides carriers and the public with U.S. ocean transport
service information and schedules, and international business opportunities.  MARlinespike has been further
enhanced and includes news releases and major announcements, shipbuilding market leads, legislation, the
Ship Financing Guarantee Program (Title XI), standards, design files, etc. <p>

The National Maritime Resource and Education Center's complete marine standards library also may be
accessed through MARlinespike.  <p>

An Internet E-mail address was established to allow rapid, inexpensive access by the public to
comprehensive trade information. <p> 

MARAD also worked with MARITECH to establish NSnet, the National Shipbuilding 
Network, which provides international Internet connections to shipyards, 
foreign purchasers, brokers, banks, and vendors.  (See Chapter 10.)<p>

MARAD's Shipper Award Program recognizes importers and exporters who patronize U.S. carriers with a
substantial share of their international cargoes.  In FY 1995, a total of 247  companies based in the United
States were presented with MARAD's U.S. Merchant Marine Certificates of Appreciation for carrying from 40
up to 100 percent of their goods on U.S. ships.  The program continued to recognize foreign companies
which support U.S. vessels, with 165 exporters and importers in Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong
receiving certificates. <p>

Under the highly successful Executive Contact Program, a select group of shippers was contacted by
senior MARAD executives to encourage and enhance their use of American carriers.  During FY 1995,
emphasis again was placed on contact with high volume, high value importers and exporters.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Marketing Program - Shipyards</b><p>

<p>

MARAD and agencies at the Departments of Commerce, State, and Defense, and 
the U.S. Trade Representative's office have developed proactive, focused and 
integrated programs to support the U.S. shipbuilding industry's 
marketing efforts.<p>

<p>

The United States continues to implement a country team concept for commercial activities.  The heads of
all agencies at missions abroad take a coordinated approach to commercial planning.  The Secretaries of
State and Commerce have pledged to encourage use of U.S. firms in international competition.<p>

<p>

MARAD works closely with the U.S. Foreign Commercial Service and embassy and mission personnel to
gather market information.  The Agency also participates in select international trade shows to promote the
U.S. shipyard industry.  At year's end, MARAD was working with industry on the American International
Shipbuilding Exposition, the first major international shipbuilding exhibition scheduled in the United States.  It
is scheduled to be held in New Orleans in April 1996.  In addition, MARAD arranged for the United States to
be named Partner Country for the world's largest shipyard related exhibition, the "Shipbuilding Machinery
and Marine Technology" conference to be held in Hamburg, Germany in October 1996.<p>

<p>

In conjunction with the American Waterways Shipyard Conference, the Shipbuilders Council of America, the
American Shipbuilding Association, the Marine Machinery Association, and others, MARAD again conducted
ship construction workshops and seminars on the subjects of marketing, environment,   labor, and finance.<p>

<h4><center>MARAD '95 ANNUAL REPORT</center></h4><p>
<h4><center>Chapter 9:  Maritime Labor, Training, and Safety</center></h4>
<p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) supports the training of merchant 
marine officers and crew members with a focus on safety in U.S. waterborne 
commerce.  The Agency also monitors national and international maritime 
industry labor-management practices and policies and promotes healthy 
labor-management relations.  MARAD's focus in this area is on fostering a 
safe and efficient maritime transportation system through the effective 
use of human resources.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>U.S. Merchant Marine Academy</b><p>

<p>

   MARAD operates the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, NY, which educates young men
and women to become officers in the American merchant marine.<p>

Graduates receive Bachelor of Science degrees and U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) licenses as deck or
engineering officers, or both, and reserve commissions as officers in an armed service of the United
States.<p>

The Federal Government maintains the Academy because it is an integral component of the defense
readiness called for in our national security policy.  Maintaining the Academy is also a declaration by the
Federal Government that there will always be a guaranteed source of merchant marine officers to meet
our domestic and international trade requirements.<p>

The Academy strives to keep its educational program responsive to the needs of America's maritime
industry.  <p>

As a key component of our national security effort, all Academy graduates incur an 8-year U.S. Navy
Reserve commitment which obligates them to serve in time of war or national emergency.  The critical
maritime skills developed with their military training and obligations significantly increase our Nation's
defense readiness.<p>

Academy graduates also are committed to a 5-year maritime service obligation.  This requires graduates
to obtain a merchant marine officer's license on or before graduation and to maintain the license for at
least 6
years.  This service obligation may be satisfied in the merchant marine as an officer aboard U.S. merchant
ships, or in shoreside maritime or intermodal transportation industry positions if afloat employment is not
obtainable.  Active military duty also satisfies the obligation.<p>

The Class of 1995 comprised 101 third mates, 101 third assistant engineers, and 17 graduates who
completed the dual deck/engine license program.  Four students from the Russian Federation were in the
graduating class.  Thirty-four of the third mate licensees earned endorsements as Qualified Members of the
Engine Department (QMED) in the third year of the Academy's ship's officer program; they completed
selected engineering courses which increased their knowledge of today's technologically advanced ships,
where both navigation and power are controlled from the bridge.  All graduates complete required nautical
science and maritime business courses.  Twenty-one women were among the 1995 graduates.  Admiral
Joseph W. Prueher, USN, Vice Chief of Naval Operations delivered the 
commencement address.<p>

Within 3 months after graduation, about 88 percent of the 219 graduates had found employment in the
maritime or transportation industry--aboard ship or ashore--or were serving on active military duty in the U.S.
military services.<p>

Average enrollment at the Academy during the year was 940.<p>

At the beginning of the 1995-96 academic year, the regiment of midshipmen 
included 102 women, 26 of whom were scheduled to graduate in June 1996.<p>

Members of Congress nominated 1,232 constituents for the Class of 1999 and a total of 254 appointments
were made in FY 1995.<p>

The Academy is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.  The Marine
Engineering Systems curriculum is approved by the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology.<p>

In addition to classroom study, Academy midshipmen are assigned to U.S.-flag merchant ships for two 6-month periods for practical shipboard experience.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>State Academies</b>
<p>
<p>

MARAD provides financial assistance to six State maritime academies to train merchant marine officers by
authority of the Maritime Education and Training Act of 1980.  The six academies and their locations are:
California Maritime Academy, Vallejo, CA; Great Lakes Maritime Academy, Traverse City, MI; Maine Maritime
Academy, Castine, ME; Massachusetts Maritime Academy, Buzzards Bay, MA; State University of New York
Maritime College, Fort Schuyler, NY; and, Texas State Maritime Program, Texas A &amp; M University at
Galveston, TX.<p>

State maritime academy cadets who participate in the Student Incentive Payment Program receive a
maximum of $3,000 to offset school costs.  Participating cadets are obligated to remain employed in the
maritime industry for 3 years, to accept a reserve commission in the U.S. Navy or one of the other armed
forces, and to renew or upgrade their USCG merchant marine license at least once after graduation.<p>

MARAD provides training vessels to five sea coast academies for use in at-sea training and as shoreside
laboratories.  Three of the schools -- California, Maine and Texas -- are in the process of replacing their aging
schoolships.  At year's end, the CHAUVENET, a decommissioned Navy Survey vessel, was being converted
to replace the Texas State Maritime Program's TEXAS CLIPPER; the MAURY, an oceanographic survey ship
deactivated by the Navy, will replace the California Maritime Academy's GOLDEN BEAR; and the TANNER,
sistership to the MAURY, will replace the Maine Maritime Academy's STATE OF MAINE.<p>

RADM Floyd H. Miller, USN (Ret.), retired as President of the State University of New York Maritime
College.  He was replaced by RADM David Brown, USMS, former Superintendent at the Great Lakes
Maritime Academy.<p>

RADM John Tanner, USMS, is the new Superintendent at the Great Lakes 
Maritime Academy.<p>

Dr. William T. McMullen is the new Superintendent at the Texas State Maritime Program, Texas A &amp; M
University at  Galveston.  He replaced Dr. David Schmidly, CEO and Campus 
Dean, who served in the interim.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Supplemental Training</b><p>

MARAD provides supplemental training for seafarers in maritime firefighting, intermodalism, and defense
readiness.  In FY 1995, 2,129 maritime personnel were trained in ship and barge firefighting.  Participants
included U.S. citizen seafarers and others concerned with maritime fire safety, including United States Coast
Guard personnel and port city professional firefighters.   MARAD-sponsored basic and advanced firefighting
training is offered at its fire school at Swanton, OH; the U.S. Navy-Military Sealift Command/MARAD fire
training facility in Earle, NJ; and the U.S. Navy fire training installation at Treasure Island, San Francisco, CA.<p>

In support of firefighting readiness in port cities, shipboard firefighting training is offered to municipal
firemen from waterfront communities.  Forty port city firefighters participated in marine firefighting training
with regular seafaring students at the Toledo Marine Fire Training Center several times during the fiscal year.
<p>

In cooperation with Bowling Green State University and the Ohio State Fire School, over 80 municipal
firefighters were trained at the Merchant Marine Fire Training Center at Swanton, OH.  In addition, a wide
variety of crews were trained including personnel from gaming boats, fishing vessels, ocean vessels, river
towboats, maritime academy cadets, and Great Lakes vessels.<p>

This was the fourth year of MARAD's National Sealift Training Program for Masters and Chief Mates at the
U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.  This program was developed to improve U.S.-flag strategic sealift support
capability and reduce vulnerability to piracy and hostage threats.  The course combines the Master Mariners
Readiness Course with course modules in Defense Communications and Maritime Security, which integrates
defense communications, maritime security and sealift readiness training drawing from lessons learned from
operations EARNEST WILL, DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM, UPHOLD DEMOCRACY, and RESTORE
HOPE.  In FY 1995, 71 senior deck officers completed this program.<p>

This was the second year MARAD sponsored the "Commercial International Freight Transportation" course.
It was held at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.  Military officers and civilians newly assigned to
transportation/logistics activities within the DOD, DOT, and other Federal agencies are the primary focus for
this class.  Commercial carrier personnel are also eligible to take this 2-week course which provides students
with an in-depth understanding of the principles of intermodal transportation systems and their application to
military/contingency logistics.  Sixty-six transportation professionals have completed this new program.<p>

<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Merchant Marine Awards</b><p>

Public Law 100-324, the Merchant Marine Decorations and Medals Act, authorizes the Secretary of
Transportation to recognize outstanding and meritorious service or participation in national defense action.  In
FY 1995, the Gallant Ship Award was presented to the tugboat PT. MILNE.  The tugboat and her crew were
honored for rescuing 132 people in July 1994 from a burning fish processing vessel in the Bering Sea.  At
the same time, the tug's captain, Al Krininger, was presented the Meritorious Service Medal.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Labor Data</b><p>

<p>

   In FY 1995, average monthly U.S. seafaring employment in all sectors (private, Government contract, and
Great Lakes) decreased to 12,024, down 5 percent from the FY 1994 average of 12,696.  (See <a name="Table 19"></a><a>Table </a>19.)
The total work force in selected U.S. commercial shipyards decreased 3 percent from 75,615 in FY 1994 to
73,339 in FY 1995.  Average longshore employment decreased 5 percent from 23,538 to 22,427.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Labor</b><p>

<p>

Global agreements for more open trade have encouraged ship operators to form multi-national alliances to
share vessels and to network the coordination of the use of port waterside and landside intermodal facilities
worldwide.  U.S. seafaring unions are internationally active because of global sourcing of labor and are
moving toward developing international labor alliances and linking labor rights to future international trade
agreements.  U.S. waterfront labor unions are concerned with the future of ports under labor contract which
will not have the intermodal infrastructure to handle the more than 4,000 TEU new containerships now being
built and delivered.  Newly formed international shipping consortia will determine the fate of current and
future ports worldwide.  The preservation of jobs and the jurisdiction of new crafts are issues waterfront labor
will bring to future labor negotiations with management.  Planning by the shipping consortia to build new
mega terminals outside city, county, or port authority jurisdictions will intensify these job issues.  Existing
labor agreements will be major factors in determining the future of smaller ports.  Both labor and
management are demonstrating flexibility in order to keep their facilities, service, and charges competitive,
and thereby to influence new world trade patterns and attract more cargo.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Seafaring</b><p>

<p>

   Most seafaring labor collective bargaining agreements remain in effect through June 1996.  In FY 1995,
many U.S. shipping companies began implementing business plans of selectively reflagging, selling, and
scrapping ships.<p>

The International Organization of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots (MM&amp;P) signed a 57-month labor contract with
Sea-Land Services, Inc. to supply licensed deck officers. The MM&amp;P also completed an agreement with the
Hanseatic Shipping Company of Limasol, Cypress to place U.S. citizen officers on foreign-flag ships owned
by Sea-Land. <p>

 <p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Longshore</b><p>

<p>

   Longshore direct labor costs on the West, East, and Gulf Coasts were at or below planned levels.  Benefit
programs and pay guarantee plans were below projections while labor productivity continues to improve.
However, changing global trade patterns, accompanied by an international awareness of safety and
protection of the environment, are adding to the pressure on ports to reduce costs and search for ways to
streamline operations.  Ports which do not have adequate container storage space or available land to
improve their waterside and landside intermodal infrastructure will find worldwide ship operator alliances
looking elsewhere and developing their own terminal, rail, and truck facilities.  Increasing container traffic will
shift to those ports which can effect container throughput without delaying the containerships.<p>

On the West Coast the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILWU) master
agreement with the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA) remains in effect through July 1996.  The ILWU
membership elected a new slate of officers who were installed in July of 1994.  <p>

The expanding use of containers for more cargo is resulting in the concentration of cargo handling
activities at fewer and larger ports.  Cargo shifts among ports have created workforce imbalances in an
industry which traditionally relies on casual labor.<p>

The East and Gulf Coast divisions of the International Longshoremen's 
Association (ILA) master agreement with the Carriers Container Council 
remains in effect through October 1996.  The ILA also is concerned with
preserving benefits gained through the years and with agreements entered 
into by non-union companies that pay workers much less than the hourly
rate earned by ILA members.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<p>
<b>Annual Crewing Assessment of U.S. Merchant Marines</b><p>

<p>

   Approximately 2,760 mariners would be required to activate all reserve sealift billets not presently manned.
Sealift ships involved include the 92 RRF ships operated by MARAD, 2 hospital ships and 8 Fast Sealift
Ships operated by the Military Sealift Command.<p>

During a MARAD-sponsored exercise conducted last summer, the U.S. maritime labor unions reported that
approximately 8,820 active mariners were available to meet reserve sealift needs.  It is anticipated that these
mariners would be sufficient for at least two crew rotations to meet initial manning requirements and to staff
the ships for the first few months of a sealift crisis.<p>

In order to meet future crewing demands, it is essential to operate the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and
State maritime academy programs near current levels, promote use of approved industry schools for training
licensed and unlicensed seagoing personnel, and improve access to qualified inactive mariners coupled with
gaining employment rights legislation for service on sealift support vessels activated to serve national
requirements.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>
<p>

<b>Safety</b><p>

<p>

MARAD continues to sharpen its focus on safety and human performance in the maritime industry.  Of
interest are the combined effects of personnel, training, management, organization, operating procedures,
design, construction, and ship and shore relationships, on the safe and efficient operation of vessels.<p>

Human factors have been proven to be a contributing cause in about 80 percent of all accidents.  The
human factors aspects of systems are thus the key to achieving reliable, efficient, and competitive marine
transportation that is safe for crew, passengers, and freight while reducing the potential for pollution from
accidents.  This area is of equal concern in the shipbuilding, ship repair, and longshoring industries.<p>

MARAD is working with other DOT modal administrations through DOT's Human Factors Coordinating
Committee and "Fatigue Group" to identify common interests, research, and approaches as means to
collectively address operator performance issues.  MARAD also participated on the National Science and
Technology Council Transportation Interagency Coordinating Committee's Subcommittee on Human
Performance in Transportation Systems.  A national multi-agency strategic plan for transportation research
on human factors in transportation has been drafted by the group.<p>

The Maritime Advisory Committee for Occupational Safety and Health (MACOSH) was formed by the
Department of Labor in February 1995 to advise the Occupational Safety and Health Administration on
maritime issues.  MARAD is working with the industry in supporting this committee, which is focusing on both
shipbuilding and longshoring issues of standards and safety.<p>

Two safety-related research cooperatives with industry also were initiated.  A "Human Factors Cooperative
Research Program with the State and Federal Maritime Academies" originated from a meeting in Fall 1994.
Cooperative agreements were signed in March 1995 formalizing this research effort, which brings the state
and Federal maritime academies together to develop visions for the future and address critical human factors
issues in maritime transportation.<p>

The "Vessel Piloting Cooperative Program" is another MARAD initiative and has resulted in a cooperative
agreement with the American Pilots Association.  This program addresses improvements in ship piloting and
vessel navigation systems where the safety of ship operations in harbors and waterways is affected.  The
major effort initiated this fiscal year was the study of the potential utility of portable navigation systems by
pilots.  These portable navigation devices are carried onboard by the pilot and utilize differential global
positioning system signals to provide a highly accurate location in the waterway.  A number of equipment
trials are underway to encourage and ensure the safe and proper implementation of this advanced
technology.

<h4><center>MARAD '95 ANNUAL REPORT</center></h4><p>
<h4><center>Chapter 10:   Administration</center></h4><p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>

<p>
The administrative actions taken in support of the mission and programs of the Maritime Administration
(MARAD) in fiscal year (FY) 1995 are summarized below.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Maritime Policy</b><p>

<p>

  Secretary of Transportation Federico Pe&ntilde;a unveiled the Maritime Security Act of 1995, the
Administration's proposed maritime revitalization program, on March 10, 1994, following an extensive
review of Federal maritime promotional programs.<p>

  The Maritime Security Program (MSP) proposes limited operating assistance for approximately 50 U.S.-flag liner vessels operating in foreign trade.  The 10-year program would provide annual payments of $2.5
million per vessel for 3 years and $2.0 million thereafter beginning in FY 1996.  Participating carriers would
be required to enroll in an Emergency Preparedness Program established to provide intermodal sealift
support in time of war or national emergency.  The commercial transportation resources to be provided
would include shipping capacity, intermodal equipment, terminal facilities, and management services.<p>

  By the end of FY 1995, authorizing committees in both the House and Senate passed legislative
initiatives similar to that proposed by the Administration.  The House and Senate versions allow for
payments to vessels enrolled in the MSP of $2.3 million per vessel in FY 1996 and $2.1 million for the
remaining nine years.  Contracts awarded during the first year would be renewable, subject to availability
of funds in fiscal years 1997 through 2005. <p>

<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

 <p>

<b>Strategic Planning</b><p>

<p>

MARAD published its first strategic plan in FY 1995, a comprehensive statement of the mission, goals,
and objectives of the Agency.  The plan categorizes a broad spectrum of Federal responsibilities into
clearly recognizable objectives and provides a focus for future service to the nation. <p>

The MARAD strategic plan supports the broader goals set forth in the Department of Transportation (DOT)
strategic plan as they pertain to maritime affairs and to the maritime elements of the national intermodal
system.  Action plans have been developed for specific activities designed to implement the strategic plan.<p>

Measures to implement the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) are closely
associated with strategic planning.  This law is aimed at measuring the effectiveness of Federal programs
against performance goals derived from the strategic planning process.  In 1995, MARAD began to quantify
specific program goals and to formulate appropriate performance measures for major programs.  The GPRA
requires complete implementation in FY 1997.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Customer Service Initiatives</b><p>

<p>

  Executive Order 12862, "Setting Customer Service Standards," mandates a customer needs-driven
approach to providing Government services to the public, as does DOT's Strategic Plan.  In 1995,
performance under the pilot Customer Service Plan and brochure for the Federal Ship Financing Program
(Title XI) and customer reactions were evaluated and reported in an update.<p>

The National Performance Review (NPR) Customer Service Team, in response to Presidential Memorandum
of March 22, 1995, requested that all proposed customer service plans be completed in FY 1995.  MARAD
responded with plans for MARlinespike (its electronic bulletin board), its National Maritime Resource and
Education Center (NMREC), and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.  (The three new brochures were
printed and distributed in October 1995.)<p>

Additionally, MARAD's Office of Acquisition received the Vice President's Hammer Award for sustained
excellence in customer service.  The Office forged an alliance with industry through the Advanced Research
Projects Agency and developed a contract administration review program which improved the overall
effectiveness of the Agency's administration of contracts.<p>

The Office of Acquisition also received two Secretarial awards for Best in Class Runnerup.  These awards
were in the categories of maximizing the value of the procurement system and maximizing cost savings.
MARAD continues to meet the President's goals of providing improved customer service and improving
Government efficiency.  <p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<p>
<b>Maritime Subsidy Board</b> <p>

<p>

  The Maritime Subsidy Board (MSB), by delegation of the Secretary of Transportation, makes, amends, and
terminates contracts subsidizing the operation of U.S.-flag vessels in the U.S. foreign commerce.  The MSB
may hold public hearings, conducts fact-finding investigations, and compiles and analyzes trade statistics
and cost data to perform its functions. MSB decisions, opinions, orders, rulings, and reports are final unless
the Secretary undertakes review of a decision.<p>

The MSB is composed of the Maritime Administrator, who acts as Chairman of the Board, the Deputy
Maritime Administrator, and the Agency's Chief Counsel.  The Secretary of MARAD and of the MSB acts as
an alternate member in the absence of any one of the three permanent MSB members.<p>

The MSB conducted regular meetings and published a number of notices in the <i>Federal Register</i> in FY
1995.<p>

The Maritime Administrator and the MSB took a number of administrative actions to help strengthen the
U.S. merchant marine.  Significantly, the MSB authorized the transfer of an unutilized Operating-Differential
Subsidy Agreement (ODSA) to Lachmar for operation of two 126,500 cubic meter liquid natural gas (LNG)
vessels.  The ODSA had been dormant since 1986 but remained valid through the end of 1997.  The MSB's
action immediately placed these two U.S.-flag LNG carriers in a position to compete with foreign-flag vessels
and provide the U.S. with an important resource for maintaining its growing energy requirements.<p>

The MSB also approved the extension of subsidizable lives for several liner and bulk vessels.  The liner
vessel EXPORT FREEDOM was approved for payment of operating-differential subsidy (ODS) for operation
5 months beyond its 25 year subsidizable life enabling Farrell Lines, Incorporated to maintain the integrity of
its liner service sailing schedule through the end of its ODSA.  Bulk vessels are eligible for subsidized
operations for 20 years.  MSB extended the subsidizable lives of two tankers of Mormac Marine
Transportation, Inc., the MORMACSTAR and MORMACSUN, for 1 additional year and for 6 months,
respectively, to enable full utilization of the 20-year subsidy contract.  Similarly the MSB acted to extend the
subsidizable lives of the Margate Shipping Co. tankers CORONADO and CHELSEA terminating when their
ODS contracts conclude.  These life extensions will permit the vessels to remain active participants in the
U.S. foreign trade and be available for use in case of national emergency during the extension period.<p>

<p>

<p>
<p>

<b>Legal Services, Litigation,</b><p>
<b>Regulations, and Legislation</b><p>

<p>

All legal matters affecting MARAD are the responsibility of the Chief 
Counsel.<p>

On March 22, 1995, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council issued a proposed rulemaking which would
waive the cargo preference laws for subcontracts for commercial items and commercial components.
MARAD submitted comments on May 22, 1995, in opposition to the proposed change, as it would result in a
loss of preference cargoes for U.S. ocean carriers.  Subsequent meetings between the Council, the maritime
industry, shippers, and MARAD resulted in the addition of "firewall" language to the regulation to limit its
impact.  In addition, the effective date of the rule was suspended for nine months to May 1, 1996, in order to
give the maritime industry an opportunity to propose an alternative solution.<p>

Intensive discussions were held with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to allow continued sale of
obsolete vessels from the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF).  By statute, MARAD is directed to sell all
obsolete vessels in the NDRF by September 30, 1999, and to transfer 25 percent of the sale proceeds to the
Department of the Interior to help administer the National Maritime Heritage Program (P. L. 103-451).  An
agreement with EPA, which was still being negotiated at year's end, may allow export of two ships as a
demonstration project, after removal of polychlorinated biphenyls in the United States.  In the long term,
MARAD expects to continue the sales of obsolete vessels under the provisions of a new regulation being
developed by EPA to open the borders for exports of waste that comply with the Basel Convention on the
Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal.<p>

A highly significant case involved defending Department of Transportation (DOT) authority to administer the
Capital Construction Fund (CCF) program.  In the Fall of 1993, MARAD learned that the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) was taking certain positions at variance with the provisions of applicable CCF regulations and
contractual agreements.  Meetings over a 2-year period between DOT, IRS, the Department of the Treasury
(Treasury), and MARAD failed to resolve the dispute.  Meanwhile, the Department of Commerce (Commerce)
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration became involved in a separate dispute over the
administration of its CCF program for fishing vessels.  In June 1995, the General Counsels of DOT and
Commerce submitted a joint brief to the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in the Department of Justice (DOJ)
requesting OLC to resolve the jurisdictional dispute with IRS and Treasury.  The matter was pending at
year's end.<p>

The Title XI Ship Financing Program saw its workload increase during the fiscal year.  Fourteen actions
guaranteed $437 million worth of commitments on vessel construction and shipyard revitalization projects.
Thirteen closings produced guarantees of $380 million in obligations, including the Agency's first export ship
Financing under P. L. 103-160, a power barge in the Dominican Republic.  Collaborative efforts with the DOJ
continued in four bankruptcy actions involving Title XI companies.<p>

In this reporting period, MARAD issued a final rule prescribing the terms and conditions under which the
Agency will convey surplus Federal real property to public entities for use in the development or operation of
a port facility.  MARAD has received numerous applications under these regulations.<p>

Appropriations bills for fiscal year 1996 had not been enacted at year's end, but the immediate effect was
cushioned by a Continuing Resolution.<p>

The Agency successfully defended two precedent-setting cases challenging its authority under the
Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (1936 Act).  In one case, the issue was whether a ship which had
major conversion work in a foreign shipyard had lost its U.S.-built vessel status for purposes of participating
in the cargo preference trades, pursuant to sections 901(b)(1) and 901b of the 1936 Act.  MARAD had ruled
that the privilege of participation was lost.  This decision was sustained by the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit.  The second case involved a union challenge to the Maritime Administrator's decision to grant
a waiver under section 804(b) of the 1936 Act to permit a subsidized operator to use six newly built foreign
ships in international trade.  The Administrator's decision was sustained by the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia, but was on appeal at year's end.<p>

At the end of the reporting period, over 150 merchant mariner injury claims were still active.  Many stem
from Ready Reserve Force (RRF) operations in Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, but some filings arose
out of RRF participation in Somalia and Haiti and from alleged injuries aboard prepositioned ships on charter
with the Military Sealift Command. <p>

The Agency also is a defendant in an asbestos exposure class action.  A total of 260 seamen injury claims
have been filed to date alleging asbestos exposure injuries while working aboard government-chartered
vessels dating back to World War II. <p>
<p>

<p>
<p>

<b>Information Resources Management (IRM)</b><p>

MARAD has an ongoing information resources management planning program 
which supports short- and long-range mission goals defined in the Agency's 
Strategic Plan.<p>

The continued use of the Government Credit Card Program has proven to be effective in streamlining
procurement processes and expediting delivery of solutions to workstation and network problems.<p>

MARAD continues to concentrate technology resources toward strengthening its network infrastructure so
that internal communication can be enhanced, information and data sharing opportunities can be expanded,
and the Federal telecommuting program can be effectively supported.<p>

The Agency has successfully incorporated its information systems from a mainframe environment to a
network-based, client-server platform, resulting in increased flexibility in analyzing and utilizing data, more
timely access to information, and a reduction in cost to maintain Agency mission databases.<p>

MARAD's ongoing microcomputer application software training program, which is used to empower
employees with the knowledge and skills required to increase the use of 
technologies, will create a more effective and productive internal 
organization.<p>

A Maritime Administration World Wide Web (WWW) site was established as 
a vehicle for communicating with the maritime industry and the public.  
The MARAD Web Site enhances the public's ability to access Government 
information.  MARAD's Web Site complements MARlinespike, MARAD's bulletin 
board service.  MARlinespike can be accessed via direct dial or via  
Internet telecommunications gateways.  The MARAD Web Site  
address is http://marad.dot.gov.  <p>

The MARAD Electronic Forms Processing Initiative was defined in FY 1995.  
Electronic forms software is expected to automate standard Government forms 
such as personnel and travel forms, as well as MARAD-specific forms.<p>

Full implementation of Electronic Mail Processing was completed.  MARAD 
offices now can exchange data and information via the network.  Network 
access to other Federal agencies and private sector organizations
also is available via Internet telecommunications gateways.<p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<p>

<b>Safety Program</b><p>

<p>

 MARAD continued to manage its Occupational Safety and Health Program (OSH) to provide the safest and
healthiest work environments possible.<p>

<p>

  The Agency began the review and consolidation of its OSH directives, which will result in the issuance of an
OSH Management Manual in FY 1996.  <p>

<p>

  Also during FY 1995, MARAD continued its Action Plan for the prevention of asbestos exposures and uses
in MARAD programs.  MARAD's policy is to prohibit or stringently limit personnel exposure to airborne
asbestos fibers.  The Plan is geared to the elimination of asbestos materials from MARAD programs.  It
encompasses the repair or replacement of such materials already installed, modified work procedures, and
employee training.  <p>

<p>

  MARAD's Asbestos Medical Surveillance Program provides preplacement, periodic, and preseparation
medical examinations to designated MARAD employees exposed or potentially exposed to hazardous
substances or conditions.  Employees assigned to MARAD's headquarters, the reserve fleets, the regional
offices, and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy were provided occupational medical examinations during FY
1995.<p>

<p>

  During the fiscal year, MARAD continued to administer its Respiratory Protection Program at its field
installations to safeguard employees against possible work-related airborne hazards.  The program, originally
begun in 1990, provides each employee, as needed, with a respirator approved by the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health, and high efficiency cartridges for protection against a wide range of dust
particles.  Additional types of respirators and filters/cartridges are available to employees, as needed.
Employees at the installations received respirator training, respirator fit testing, and medical clearance for
wearing a respirator.<p>

<p>

  MARAD also administered a Hearing Conservation Program to minimize occupational noise exposure
through initiation of engineering controls, if practical, and by issuing personal protective equipment (ear
protection) for use by employees in high-noise work areas.  The Agency conducts noise exposure level
surveys of work areas and work operations to identify occupational exposure levels.  The Agency also
provides appropriate training and annual audiometric examinations.  <p>

<p>

  MARAD's Safety Shoe Program at the Beaumont, James River, and Suisun Bay National Defense Reserve
Fleets (NDRFs),  continued to provide, at MARAD's expense, protective toe guard and non-slip sole safety
shoes to employees assigned to foot hazardous areas and operations in the performance of their duties.
This program is intended to provide foot protection against falling objects and loss of footing and to reduce
the number of employee injuries and compensation claims.<p>

<p>

  Specialized training was provided to groups of employees at each of the fleets.  Several employees
received training to enable them to give immediate medical care to fellow employees who suffer on-the-job
injuries.  For example, eleven James River Reserve Fleet employees completed a program at the Mary
Immaculate Hospital, Newport News, VA, and were certified by the Commonwealth of Virginia as "Emergency
Medical Services First Responders."<p>

<p>

One fatality occurred at the James River Reserve Fleet.  Occupational 
Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) investigators were called to the 
scene and MARAD immediately began actions to preclude recurrence.  
A subsequent unannounced inspection by OSHA found all recommendations 
implemented.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Personnel</b><p>
<p>

MARAD's employment totaled 1,066 at the end of FY 1995.  The Agency's percentage of female and
minority employees, as well as their representation in supervisory positions, remained relatively unchanged
from last fiscal year, as did the percentage of handicapped employees.<p>

Three upward mobility positions were established in FY 1995 and three employees were promoted to target
positions under previously established upward mobility positions.<p>

Sixteen cross-training positions were advertised under  MARAD's Career Enhancement Program and 24
special training announcements were issued.  Seventy employees were approved for tuition assistance
through the MARAD Educational Assistance Program.  Two MARAD employees participated in the U.S.
Office of Personnel Management Executive Potential Program and New Leader Program and one was
selected for the Commerce Science and Technology Fellowship Program.<p>

MARAD employees received the Secretary's Silver Medal and three individuals received the Secretary's
Award for Excellence.  One employee received the coveted Lawrence Schneider award from the Department.
In addition, the Office of Acquisition received the Secretary's Award for Excellence in Customer Service.
Further, 17 employees received the Administrator's Bronze Medals and 
2 received the MARAD EEO Award in recognition of their contributions to 
the Equal Employment Opportunity Program.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Installations and Logistics</b><p>
<b>Real Property</b> <p>

<p>

  On September 30, 1995, MARAD's real property included NDRF sites at Suisun Bay, CA; Beaumont, TX;
and James River, VA; the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, NY, and the New Orleans Military
Ocean Terminal at New Orleans, LA.<p>

<p>

  Facilities for training maritime firefighters were operated at Freehold, NJ, and Treasure Island, CA, under
MARAD agreements with the U.S. Navy, and at facilities operated by Delgado Community College in New
Orleans, LA.  MARAD operates the Toledo, OH, marine fire-training facility.  Regional headquarters offices
were maintained in New York, NY; Norfolk, VA; New Orleans, LA; Des Plaines, IL; and San Francisco, CA.
Regional marketing, ports, and/or environmental staffs were maintained in Long Beach, CA; Seattle, WA;
Houston, TX; Atlanta, GA; Miami, FL; St. Louis, MO; Cleveland, OH; and at the five regional headquarters.
In addition to those located at Regional headquarters offices, ship management staffs were maintained in
New York, NY, and Port Arthur, TX.<p>

<p>

  Operation and maintenance of the Computer-Aided Operations and Research Facility at the U.S. Merchant
Marine Academy will be transferred in mid-1996 from Marine Safety International, Inc., to the Government.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Audits</b> <p>

<p>

  In FY 1995, the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the DOT's Office of Inspector General (OIG)
submitted final principal survey or internal audit reports on MARAD activities.  They were:<p>

<p>

o   Cargo Preference Laws - Estimated Costs and Effects -- GAO Review   <p>

<p>

o   Ready Reserve Force - Ship Readiness Has Improved, but Other Concerns Remain - GAO Review <p>

<p>

o   Merchant Marine Training Incentives -- OIG Audit<p>

<p>

o   Financial Statement Audits for FY 1994 in MARAD -- OIG Audits <p>

<p>

o   Shore-Based Spares System in MARAD -- OIG Audit<p>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<p>

<b>Accounting</b><p>

<p>

  MARAD's accounts are maintained on an accrual basis in conformity with generally accepted principles and
standards, and related requirements prescribed by the Comptroller General.  The net cost of MARAD's FY
1995 operations totaled $674.2 million.  This included $263.3 million in operating-differential and ocean
freight differential subsidies; and $74.9 million in administrative expenses and financial assistance to State
Maritime Academies.  MARAD received $5.9 million in other operating expenses 
net of income.  Financial statements of MARAD appear as Exhibits 1 and 2.<p>

* The designations TR 2 and TR 1 are as defined in the eight Essential Trade Routes promulgated May 7, 1987.  All other trade 
route designations in this Table  are as defined prior to May 7, 1987 (30 Essential Trade Routes plus 5 Essential Trade Areas),
in the Operators' service descriptions in 20-year operating subsidy contracts.
**The Maritime Subsidy Board approved the transfer from Lykes to First American Bulk Carriers Corp. of ODS rights to 20 annual 
sailings on the former Trade Route 21 (U.S. Gulf/North Europe) and the obligation to replace two vessels.  As part of the action, 
the MSB approved the time charter by Lykes of two C6-M-F146a ships owned by FABC, for 36 months with subsequent charter extensions 
of 36 months (through December 31, 1998).  Sailings to/from ports in southwest Asia from Suez to Burma, 
inclusive, and Africa on the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden shall count against the maximum for such geographic areas under both Contract 
MA/MSB-451 and Contract MA/MSB-451(a).


 1  Service to/from U.S. Atlantic ports is on a privilege basis with a maximum of 28 sailings.

 2  Includes required service to Indonesia, Malaysia (except Sarawak and Sabah), and Singapore.  Numbers of required sailings are a portion of the
    required sailings on TR 2.

 3  Includes required service to Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore.  Numbers of required sailings are a portion of the required sailings on TR 2.

 4  Farrell is also permitted to make 12 sailings annually from the U.S. Gulf to West Africa.

 5  Lykes is permitted to make 24 sailings annually between U.S. North Atlantic and Mediterranean ports on a privilege basis in conjunction with required
    service on TR 15B, 22, and TR 1.

 6  Lykes is permitted to make 24 sailings annually between U.S. Atlantic and South and East Africa on a privilege basis in conjunction with required service
    on TR 15B.

 7  Lykes has the option to perform additional sailings on TRs 22 and 15B over maximum sailings if the minimum sailings are made on all other services:
    on TR 22, nine additional sailings; on TR 15B, five additional sailings.  The overall maximum for all services must not exceed 330 annual sailings in
    Contracts 451 and 451(a).

 8  Subject to stipulation that a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 30 sailings per annum shall include ports in Indonesia and Malaysia (including
    Singapore).

 9  Lykes is also permitted to make 12 sailings annually from the U.S. Gulf to West Africa on a privilege basis in conjunction with required service on
    TR 15B.

10  Lykes is permitted to make 16 sailings annually between U.S. Atlantic and Gulf ports and Southwest Asian ports (Suez to Burma) in conjunction with
    required service on TR 15B, TR 22 and TR 1.

11  Caribbean Subservice--a maximum of 24 sailings per annum may provide limited TR 19 service exclusively between U.S. Gulf ports and ports on the
    Atlantic coast of the Republic of Panama, the former Panama Canal Zone, and the north coast of Colombia.

12  Lykes stopped service on TR 29 and TR 17/29 in July 1986.

13  Lykes may make privilege calls from the U.S. Atlantic to the Far East in conjunction with required service on TR 22.

14  USL/USL(S.A.), in bankruptcy, provides no service under the subsidy contract; contracts have been authorized by MSB to be assigned to Midlantic
    National Bank as Trustee.

<b>
Notes:
</b>
 1. Imbalance due to nonavailablity of U.S.-flag service.

 2. The Food Security Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-198) impacted on the P.L. 480 
    Section 416, titles I, II nd III, and the Food for Progress
    programs by changing the reporting period from a calendar year to a 
    12-month period commencing April 1, 1986, through March 31, 1987, 
    and by increasing the U.S.-flag share from 50 to 75 percent over a 
    three year period.  The required U.S.-flag share for the current 
    reporting period, April 1, 1994 to March 31, 1995, is 75 percent.

 3. Liner vessels failed to meet the 75 percent requirement.

 4. Cargo preference is monitored on a global basis by vessel type for the 
    Title II program.

 5. After accounting for the non-availability of certain U.S.-flag vessels, 
    the program met the 75 percent U.S.-flag requirement.

 6. All preference cargo shipped to Bangladesh and Ghana were carried on 
    foreign-flag vessels.  Bolivia (74 percent) and Ethiopia (64 percent) 
    did not meet the 75 percent requirement.

 7. Nicaragua and Uganda did not ship any preference cargo on U.S-flag 
    tankers.
                         
 8. Cargo preference is monitored on a country and vessel type basis.

 9. Croatia (HR-5001 66 percent) did not meet the 75 percent requirement 
    due to non-performance by a commodity supplier.

10. The following countries did not meet the 75 percent requirement for 
    bulk vessels: Lithuania (LH-5006 0 percent), Macedonia
    (MK-5001 57 percent - insufficient U.S.-flag offers), and the 
    Philippines (RP-5004 72 percent).  The alternative for Lithuania
    would have been to fix 100 percent U.S.-flag without ocean freight 
    differential reimbursement from MARAD to the
    Commodity Credit Corp. for the tonnage in excess of 75 percent.

11. The Title I program is monitored on an individual Purchase Authorization 
    (PA) basis.
                         
12. Ten of the fifteen participating countries did not achieve the 75 percent 
    requirement: Kazahhstan 68 percent, Kyrgyzstan 54 percent, 
    Russia 18 percent, and Uzbekistan 49 percent while Armenia, Azerbaijan, 
    Moldova, Mongolia, Romania, and Ukraine did not receive any preference 
    cargo on U.S.-flag liners.

13. Tajikistan did not ship any preference cargo on U.S.-flag bulk vessels.

14. The following countries failed to meet the 75 percent requirement for 
    liner vessels: Armenia 45 percent, Azerbaijan 74 percent, and 
    Tajikistan 19 percent.

15. Three of the seven participating countries failed to meet the 75 percent 
    requirement: Armenia 66 percent, Azerbaijan 74 percent, 
    and Russia 15 percent.

16. Albania did not ship any preference cargo on U.S.-flag tanker vessels.

17. MARAD accounts for the SPR program on the basis of long ton miles (LTM).  
    In CY 1994, this program provided a total of 2,822 billion LTM, 
    of which U.S.-flag carriers received 1.623 billion LTM or 57.51 percent.  
    Compliance is based on cumulative LTM since the program's inception 
    which indicates U.S.-flag at 53 percent.

<center><h1>Marad '95 Report Introduction</h1></center>

<p>

<i>     The Annual Report of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) for the fiscal year (FY) which ended on
September 30, 1995, is submitted to Congress in accordance with Section 208 of the Merchant Marine Act
of 1936, as amended.<p>

<p>

	</i>During FY 1995, MARAD continued to provide strong support to the Administration's efforts to ensure
America's future as a maritime nation.<i><p>

<p>

</i>    MARAD published<i> </i>its <i>Strategic Plan</i> in FY 1995.  This comprehensive statement of the mission, goals,
and objectives of the Agency categorizes a broad spectrum of Federal responsibilities into clearly
recognizable objectives and provides a focus for future service to the Nation. The MARAD strategic plan
supports the broader goals set forth in the Department of Transportation (DOT) strategic plan as they
pertain to maritime affairs and to the maritime elements of the national intermodal transportation system.
Action plans for specific activities designed to implement the strategic plan also provide the basis for
periodic progress reviews between the Maritime Administrator and the Deputy Secretary of
Transportation.  <i><p>

</i><p>

	President Bill Clinton and Secretary of Transportation Federico Pe&ntilde;a resubmitted to Congress legislation
that would establish a Maritime Security Program (MSP) providing operating assistance for approximately
50 U.S.-flag liner vessels serving in foreign trade, providing the participating carriers  enroll in an
Emergency Preparedness Program established to provide intermodal sealift support in time of war or
national emergency.  The commercial transportation resources to be provided would include shipping
capacity, intermodal equipment, terminal facilities, and management services.  By the end of FY 1995,
authorizing committees in both the House and Senate passed legislative initiatives(H.R. 1350 and S. 1139
similar to that proposed by the Administration. <p>

<p>

	MARAD also assisted the U.S. shipbuilding industry through the approval of 14 applications under the
Federal ship financing (Title XI) program.  They cover the construction of 36 commercial vessels in
American shipyards and the second shipyard modernization project approved under the program. <p>

FY 1995 approved guarantees total $437 million and will generate more than $500 million in shipyard
activity.<p>

<p>

	MARAD continued working with the Advanced Research Projects Administration's MARITECH program
which is leveraging limited Government funding into significant cooperative research and development
projects.  Eighteen U.S. shipbuilding companies are involved in 24 projects awarded this fiscal year.<p>

	<p>

	MARAD and the U.S. Transportation Command developed the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement
(VISA) to promote and facilitate the Department of Defense's (DODs)  use of existing commercial
integrated intermodal transportation systems and to maximize DOD's use of commercial transportation
resources, while minimizing disruption to commercial operations.  It provides a seamless, time-phased
transition from peace to wartime operations through coordinated, pre-negotiated contracts for the type and
quantity of sealift, when and where necessary, to deploy and sustain U.S. forces.<p>

<p>

	The United States and Brazil concluded negotiations on a new 3-year maritime agreement.  The
agreement assures U.S.-flag carriers equal access to Brazilian government cargoes and reaffirms the commitment of
both countries to continue liberalizing their maritime trade. <p>

<p>
	MARAD cosponsored a National Conference on the Intermodal Terminal of the Future attended
by public and private sector transportation representatives.  The conference provided an interactive
forum on innovative terminal designs, emerging information technology, new partnerships, and global
economics.<p>

<p>

	MARAD created its Office of Environmental Activities to help improve the environmental quality
of maritime activities.  <p>

<p>

	In coordination with the National Dredging Team, the Agency assisted in developing a National
Dredging Policy Action Plan, which was endorsed by President Clinton.  Recommendations were
submitted to Secretary Pe&ntilde;a in a report, <i>The Dredging Process in the United States:  An Action Plan
for Improvement.</i><p>

<p>

	Also in FY 1995, MARAD prepared customer service plans and brochures for its electronic
bulletin board (MARlinespike), its National Maritime Resource and Education Center (NMREC), and the
U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. <p>

<b><p>

	</b>MARAD formed NMREC to assist the U.S. shipbuilding, ship repair, and associated industries
to improve their international competitiveness.  The Agency also established a Computer Aided Design
(CAD) Component Library which includes 2-dimensional CAD files collected from two diesel engine
manufacturers and the Marine Industry Standards Library which makes international, foreign, and
domestic standards available, as well as information pertaining to standards.  Access to each of these
customer service tools is available via MARlinespike.<p>

<p>

	Additionally, MARAD developed a prototype World Wide Web home page and information
service.  It includes information about the Agency's mission and structure, the importance of the
maritime industry, and maritime issues and legislation.  (The Agency formally announced WWW
service on October 5, 1995.  MARAD's home page address is <i>http://marad.dot.gov</i>.).<p>

<p>

	This report contains details on these activities and many other efforts by the Maritime
Administration to support the Nation's maritime policy and the goals of the Administration.<p>

  The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is responsible for assuring that merchant shipping is available in
times of war or national emergency.  MARAD administers programs to meet sealift requirements
determined by the Department of Defense (DOD) and conducts related national security activities.<p>

<p>

  The Agency maintains  inactive, Government-owned vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet
(NDRF) and its Ready Reserve Force (RRF) component.  The RRF was created to maintain a surge
shipping and resupply capability available on short notice to support deployment of a multidivision force.<p>

<p>

  MARAD also conducts national security planning and operations in areas such as national emergency
communications, war risk insurance, and port emergency operations.<p>

Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (<a name="VISA"></b><a href="contents.htm#VISA">VISA</a><b></a>)</b><p>

<p>

  During fiscal year (FY) 1995, MARAD, together with the U.S. Transportation Command
(USTRANSCOM), developed the VISA.  Terms of the VISA program were defined with the assistance of
U.S.-flag carriers and maritime labor.  At the end of the reporting period, MARAD and USTRANSCOM
were preparing to implement a 1-year prototype program.<p>

<p>

  The objectives of VISA are to promote and facilitate the DOD's use of existing commercial integrated
intermodal transportation systems and to maximize use of commercial transportation resources, while
minimizing disruption to commercial operations.  It provides a seamless, time-phased transition from
peace to wartime operations through coordinated, pre-negotiated contracts for the type and quantity of
sealift, when and where necessary, to deploy and sustain U.S. forces.<p>

<b>National Defense Reserve Fleet </b><a href="contents.htm#NDRF">(<a name="NDRF">NDRF</a><b></a>)<p>

</b><p>

  NDRF ships serve as an inactive reserve which can be activated to help meet U.S. shipping
requirements during national emergencies.  These vessels are available for military emergencies.
MARAD maintains inactive merchant ships and naval auxiliaries in three Reserve fleet sites.  Retention
vessels are under preservation, which normally includes dehumidification of interior spaces and cathodic
(anticorrosion) protection of the hull.<p>

<p>

  As of September 30, 1995, the total number of vessels in MARAD custody was 296.  (See <a name="Tables "><a>Tables</a> </a>1 and
<a name="2"><a>2</a></a>.)  Of these, 107 are located at Ft. Eustis, VA; 51 at Beaumont, TX; 81 at Suisun Bay, CA; and 57 at
other locations, including lay berths under contract in major U.S. port cities.<p>

<p>

  Of the 296 ships, 76 were being maintained on a cost- reimbursable basis.  Such ships are maintained in
various degrees of preservation depending on the requirements of the sponsors.  They are not in the
NDRF program and are being held for other Government agencies or MARAD's Title XI program.
Seventy-two of these are expected to be assigned to the NDRF or scrapped.<p>

<p>

  At the end of this reporting period, 155 ships, including those of the RRF, were being held as NDRF
retention assets, maintained under preservation and available for activation.  The remaining 65 were
considered NDRF non-retention assets which were pending disposal or transfer.<p>

<p>

<b><p>

<a name="Ready Reserve Force"></b><a href="contents.htm#RRF">Ready Reserve Force</a></a> <b>(RRF)</b><p>

  <p>

  The RRF is a specific component of the retention NDRF which was established in 1976 by a
Memorandum of Agreement between the DOD and MARAD.  RRF ships are kept in a higher state of
readiness to enable them to be activated in 4, 5, 10, 20, or 30 days to meet surge milidary sealift
requirements in the event of war, as was experienced in Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm.  Higher
priority vessels are maintained in a status which permits reliable activation within 4 days<p>

at their berth sites, allowing expedited loading of critical surge DOD equipment.<p>

<p>

<p>

  At the end of the reporting period, there were 92 ships in the RRF.<p>

<p>

  To meet the RRF readiness needs of DOD, the Outporting Program provides contracted lay berths for
RRF ships near  expected loading ports for defense cargoes.  At year's end, 32 RRF vessels were
assigned to outport locations, with 14 on the East Coast, 8 on the Gulf Coast and 10 on the West Coast.<p>

<p>

  Two CAPE K-class Roll-on/Roll-off (RO/RO) ships were purchased in fiscal year (FY) 1995.  After
upgrading, they will be added to the RRF.<p>

RRF Sea Trial and <a name="Dock Trial"></b><a href="contents.htm#Dock Trial">Dock Trial</a><b></a> Program<p>

</b><p>

  Periodic, planned exercise of RRF vessels is vital to maintaining vessel readiness, especially in the
absence of vessel operations.  MARAD's Sea Trial and Dock Trial Program provides  prioritized rotation of
all RRF ships to accomplish trials on a regular basis.<p>

<p>

  During FY 1995, 29 vessels successfully underwent sea trials, 15 in DOD-ordered notice or no-notice
activations.  An additional seven vessels underwent dock trials during the year.  The significance of the
program is reflected by  MARAD's success in recent vessel activations in support of DOD missions.<p>

RRF Expands Use Of<a name=" Maintenance Crews"> </b><a href="contents.htm#Maintenance Crews">Maintenance Crews</a></a><p>

	<p>

  In 1994 MARAD inaugurated a test program utilizing 10-person maintenance crews aboard vessels in 4-day reduced operational status (ROS-4). This combination crew of licensed and unlicensed personnel
from all departments conducts preventative maintenance year-round and provides sufficient resources to
activate RRF vessels without shipyard assistance.  <p>

<p>

  During FY 1995, activations of RRF vessels with ROS crews demonstrated both enhanced material
condition of the vessels and increased readiness and reliability.  Many were activated in less time than
had been assigned.<p>

<p>

  Based upon initial results, during the year MARAD and DOD increased the use of ROS maintenance
crews from 8 to 29 vessels, thereby employing more than 200 mariners.  DOD asked MARAD to develop
a similar program for ROS-5 vessels, using 9-person ROS maintenance crews.<p>

<b><p>

Improvements in <a name="Vessel Maintenance"></b><a href="contents.htm#Vessel Maintenance">Vessel Maintenance</a></a><p>

<p>

  MARAD initiated several RRF vessel maintenance improvements in FY 1995, including full application of
the RRF Maintenance and Repair Tracking System.  This maintenance program enhances the material
condition of RRF vessels by permitting accurate tracking of vessel deficiencies and better application of
maintenance funding.  <p>

<p>

  MARAD also implemented a Water Chemistry and Treatment Program which enhances the reliability of
all RRF and MARAD-owned schoolships by providing real-time analysis of the condition of water aboard
the vessels.<p>

<a name="Logistics"></b><a href="contents.htm#Logistics">Logistics</a></a><p>

  <p>

  MARAD improved the level of logistics support for RRF vessels in FY 1995.  Ten RRF vessels received
logistics overhauls, and 7,291 items, with a value of $11,361,503, were procured from Federal and
commercial supply sources.<p>

<p>

  An Agency-wide Shore-Based Spares system was implemented and  will serve as the first source of
supply for vessel repair parts and equipment requirements.<p>

RRF <a name="Operations"></b><a href="contents.htm#Operations">Operations</a></a><p>

<p>

  The use of RRF vessels as DOD prepositioned assets continued in FY 1995.  In FY 1994 the U.S. Army
requested eight RRF vessels for operations for up to 3 years as part of the Army's Interim Brigade Afloat
Force (AWR-3).  The fully-loaded vessels, stationed in ports halfway around the world, sortie on frequent
training missions and participate in other military exercises.  <p>

<p>

  Two Offshore Petroleum Discharge System (OPDS) tankers, AMERICAN OSPREY and POTOMAC,
continued serving the Afloat Preposition Force (APF) mission at Diego Garcia, at Guam, and in the
Mediterranean.  All prepositioned RRF ships are fully manned with or crewed by civilian U.S. merchant
mariners.<p>

<p>

  In October 1994, seven RRF RO/ROs and the crane ship GOPHER STATE sailed to the Persian Gulf in
support of Operation  VIGILANT WARRIOR and Operation VIGILANT SENTINEL. <p>

<p>

  Operation QUICK LIFT involved activation of the CAPE RACE and the CAPE DIAMOND to support
NATO peacekeeping activities in Bosnia.  USTRANSCOM ordered a "TURBO Activation" of the CAPE
RACE on June 22, 1995, from an ROS-4 layberth at Portsmouth, VA; it was activated in a record time of
23 hours.  The CAPE DIAMOND was activated June 29, 1995, from an ROS-4 layberth at Jacksonville,
FL.  The two ships carried more than 92 percent of the cargo transferred from the United Kingdom to
Croatia.  This included 2,015 military vehicles, 232 containers, and 3,629 pallets of breakbulk cargo in
support of Britain's 24th Air Mobile Brigade, which numbered approximately 4,275 troops.<p>

<p>

  VADM Philip Quast, Commander of the Military Sealift Command (MSC), commended the officers and
crew for their professionalism and exceptional performance.  The two ships were ghven the Maritime
Administrator's Professional Ship Award to underscore the contributions made in Operation QUICK LIFT.<p>

<p>

  Six RRF vessels successfully met their activation timetables in no-notice RRF test activations.  The ships
were the Auxiliary Crane Ships EQUALITY STATE and FLICKERTAIL STATE; the breakbulk ships CAPE
BRETON, CAPE GIBSON and CAPE JOHNSON; and the LASH vessel CAPE FAREWELL.<p>

RRF Command Post Exercise <a name="BREAKOUT-95"></b><a href="contents.htm#BREAKOUT-95">BREAKOUT-95</a><b><p>

</b>	</a><p>

  During FY 1995, MARAD, RRF ship managers, maritime labor unions, and over 2,600 mariners
participated in Command Post Exercise (CPX) BREAKOUT-95, to test crewing of the RRF.  Ship
managers and labor unions cooperated fully throughout the exercise.  <p>

  <p>

  It was conducted in a very compressed time frame which was reflected in aggressive crewing
requirements and accomplishments.  <p>

<p>

  It also provided a valuable picture of current crewing requirements and manning base to support a full
scale activation. <p>

<p>

  Major lessons learned from the exercise were:<p>

<p>

o  Discussions between MARAD, ship managers and maritime labor unions should be pursued to alleviate
manning burdens and meet time critical shortfalls.<p>

<p>

o  A MARAD-prototype seafarers' manpowermobilization program is a possible method to retain mariners
and keep their skills current on RRF ships.  A key element of this program would be development of a
comprehensive mariner tracking system.<p>

<p>

o  Public advertising is recognized as an effective tool MARAD should refine as a standard recruiting
procedure during a large-scale activation.<p>

<p>

o  Direct telephone contacts with mariners should be improved.<p>

<p>

  The 800 WATS telephone line proved very helpful in contacting mariners.  A "crewing hotline" would be
beneficial during a large-scale RRF activation.<p>

<p>

o  E-mail connectivity represents an effective means for smooth and timely exchange of information.
However, the systems need to be more fully developed and tested to ensure that all participants are
connected.<p>

  MARAD Advisories rapidly disseminate information on Government policy, danger and safety issues
pertaining to vessel operations, and other timely maritime matters.  In FY 1995, advisories were issued on
a number of topics, including potential terrorist threats in the United States and South America;
establishment of the Department of Transportation Response Center Hotline; two Naval Control of
Shipping exercises; and training opportunities for mariners at the National Sealift Training Program.  In
addition, Special Warnings to Mariners were coordinated with the Department of State relative to
situations in Haiti, Algeria, Pakistan, and the Persian Gulf, including United Nations (U.N.) interdiction
policies.<p>

	<p>

  MARAD, in cooperation with the Departments of State and of Defense, monitored previously agreed
procedures facilitating the inspection of cargoes aboard U.S.-flag merchant vessels destined for Aqaba,
Jordan.  In May 1995, <u>Lloyd's Register</u> took over the inspection of cargoes from the Maritime Interdiction
Force (MIF).  However, the U.N. Security Council's Iraq Sanctions Committee and the MIF continued to
operate because vessels continued to attempt to break the embargo by carrying contraband cargo.
MARAD also participated in the development of policies regarding U.N. sanctions enforced against Haiti
and Liberia.<p>

<p>

  The Agency participated in the development of training exercises sponsored by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
These exercises familiarize military and civilian agencies with  procedures to be followed during a national
security crisis.  MARAD also participated in exercises sponsored by the National Defense University War
Gaming and Simulation Center, and in war games at the Naval War College in Newport, RI.  Personnel
and the Agency participated in two Naval Control and Protection of Shipping (NCAPS) exercises designed
to test and improve new NCAPS doctrine.<p>

<p>

  MARAD was involved in USTRANSCOM exercises TURBO CADS 95, designed to test the
Containerized Ammunition Distribution System, and TURBO INTERMODAL SURGE 95, a test movement
of an Artillery Battalion from a fort to a port.<p>

<p>

  MARAD participated in various civil emergency actions, including collecting and disseminating data
related to the Japanese earthquake which devastated the Port of Kobe in January 1995.  In addition,
MARAD personnel were involved in the emergency response to Hurricane Marilyn, which hit the Virgin
Islands in September 1995.  <p>

<p>

  MARAD participated in RESPONSE '95, a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-sponsored
exercise with a major hurricane disaster scenario.  MARAD was represented at the National Conference
of Emergency Coordinators in February 1995 and at the March interagency meeting chaired by the
National Security Council on the devolution of FEMA mobilization and national security preparedness
functions.<p>

<p>

  During the fiscal year, MARAD continued to assist the DOT in its effort to revise its Continuity of
Operations Plan. <p>

<p>

  MARAD established a Liaison Office at USTRANSCOM to provide coordinated, on-site support of the
Defense Transportation System for maritime transportation planning and contingency operations.<p>

<a name="Piracy "><a href="contents.htm#Piracy">Piracy</a><b> </a>and Attacks on Merchant Shipping</b><p>

<p>

  International merchant shipping continued to be subject to piracy and robbery incidents around the world.
Various international maritime organizations cited areas of piracy and attacks on merchant shipping
continuing on the shores of the South China Sea, including Indonesia, Vietnam, Hong Kong, China, and
the Philippines; the Singapore and Malacca Straits; the Ivory Coast and the Horn of Africa; Brazil; and
Bangladesh.  <p>

<p>

  MARAD continued to alert mariners to the potential problems and offered advice on effective counter-measures to deter a piracy boarding.  MARAD actively participated with industry partners such as the
Maritime Security Council and Seamen's Church Institute, to advise on training techniques, informational
resources available, threat dissemination, and incident reporting.  (See Chart 1.)<p>

<p>

  The Agency continued to promote the use of the Defense Mapping Agency's Navigation Information
Network's Anti-Shipping Activities Message (ASAM) system to report incidents for a data base available to
all mariners.  There was an increase in reporting, but a large number of incidents still were thought to be
unreported.  A total of 101 incidents were reported in FY 1995.  While reporting of incidents may represent
only one third of the actual total, it is noted that the most active area for piracy remains in South East
Asian waters, the Horn of Africa, and Brazil.  (See <a name="Chapter 3"><a href="#Chapter 3">Chapter 3</a></a> -- International Activities and <a href="#Chapter 4"><a name="Chapter 4">Chapter 4</a></a> --

<p>

  Title XII of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended, authorizes MARAD to administer the war risk
insurance program.  The program insures operators and seamen against losses resulting from war, or
war-like actions, during periods when commercial insurance is not available on reasonable terms and
conditions.<p>

<p>

  At the end of this reporting period, the War Risk Revolving Fund (Fund) asset total was approximately
$25,119,000.  There were no new assureds receiving binders during FY 1995.  The fund earned
$1,700,000 in investment income.  Program expenses for FY 1995 totaled $53,316.<p>

  <p>

  As of September 30, 1995, there were 257 binders attached to provide eligibility for hull protection and
indemnity and Second Seamen's war risk insurance.  These binders would be effective for 30 days
following termination of commercial insurance.  <p>

<p>

  No binders were outstanding in MARAD's related standby war risk cargo insurance and builder's risk
insurance programs.<p>

<p>

  Statutory authority covering the Title XII War Risk Insurance Program expired on June 30, 1995.  At the
end of the reporting period, MARAD was awaiting enactment of legislation for the renewal of this authority.
Congress reinstated the war risk authority on February 10, 1996, for a 5-year interval expiring <p>

June 30, 2000.<p>

  MARAD monitors the contractual requirements for marine insurance coverage placed in the commercial
market for all existing Title XI vessels on which MARAD holds the mortgage, together with vessels
subsidized by the Government and Government-owned vessels on charter to private operators.  One
aspect of this compliance is to assure that the American marine insurance market has the opportunity to
compete for placement of marine insurance on these vessels.  As indicated in<a name=" Table 3"> <a>Table 3</a></a>, MARAD-approved
marine hull and machinery insurance during FY 1995 aggregated 42 percent placement in the American
market and 58 percent placement in foreign insurance markets.  This contrasts with the 54 percent
American market placement for hull and machinery insurance during fiscal year 1994.<p>

  MARAD continued to act as the claim agent for Government- owned RRF vessels in FY 1995.  From the
inception of Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm through the end of FY 1995, approximately 375
personal injury claims submitted by or on behalf of American merchant seamen had been settled, at a total
cost of approximately $16.2 million.  Among claims pending resolution at year's end were those for
qeamen who crewed RRF vessels in support of Operation QUICK LIFT to the former Republic of
Yugoslavia, as well as Operation RESTORE HOPE to Somalia.  As of September 30, 1995, approximately
30 administrative claims were pending.  In addition, MARAD was assisting the U.S. Department of Justice
in resolving approximately 70 claims in which litigation against the United States was brought by or on
behalf of the claimant.  <p>

<a name="Title XI"></b><a href="contents.htm#Title XI">Title XI</a><b></a> Guarantees</b><p>

<p>

  Title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, established the Federal Ship Financing
Guarantee Program.  As originally enacted, Title XI authorized the Federal Government to insure private
sector loans or mortgages made to finance or refinance the construction or reconstruction of American-flag vessels.<p>

<p>

  Title XI was amended in 1972 to provide direct Government guarantees of the underlying debt
obligations, with the Government holding a mortgage on the equipment financed.<p>

<p>

  On November 30, 1993, the National Shipbuilding and Shipyard Conversion Act of 1993 (Shipbuilding
Act) was enacted (Sections 1351 to 1363 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994
[Public Law 103-160]).  It expanded the existing Title XI program by authorizing the Secretary of
Transportation to guarantee obligations issued to finance the construction, reconstruction, or
reconditioning of eligible export vessels.  It also authorized guarantees for shipyard modernization and
improvement.<p>

<p>

  The Shipbuilding Act established a National Shipbuilding Initiative (NSI) program to support the industrial
base for national security objectives.  It is expected to help reestablish the American shipbuilding industry
as an internationally competitive industry.<p>

<p>

  The benefits of the Administration's shipbuilding initiatives are already evident.  Interest in Title XI from
both domestic and foreign buyers has been strong.  Accomplishments include approval of the first U.S.-built commercial ship order for a foreign buyer since 1957.  The vessels, to be built in Newport News, VA,
for Eletson Corp. (Fleves Shipping Corp.) of Piraeus, Greece, are expected to generate 500 shipyard jobs.<p>

<p>

  Since FY 1994, MARAD has approved 21 new Title XI applications totalling approximately $727 million in
financing guarantees.  Significantly, prior to the President's announced initiative, MARAD was processing
only three applications for new vessels.  During FY 1995, MARAD approved Title XI applications totaling
approximately $437 million in financing guarantees.  These projects include eight tankers, one
breakbulk/container vessel, one paddlewheel steamboat, one catamaranferry, one undersea warfare
surface support ship, one deepwater supply vessel, various types of barges and tugs.  One Title XI loan guarantee
for a $17.78 million shipyard modernization project at Avondale Shipyards in New Orleans, LA was also
approved in this reporting period.  Other applications for shipyard modernization projects are now under
review.  It is anticipated that these projects will allow shipyards to perform contracts more efficiently through
productivity improvements.<p>

<p>

  Title XI applications approved in FY 1995 are shown on Ta"le 4.  As of September 30, 1995, there were 30
Title XI applications pending.<p>

<p>

  Under the Title XI program the U.S. Government insures or guarantees full payment to the lender of the
unpaid principal and interest of the mortgage obligation in the event of default by the vessel owners or
general shipyard facility.<p>

<p>

  As of September 30, 1995, Title XI guarantees in force aggregate approximately $1.7 billion, covering
approximately 1,824 vessels and 106 individual shipowners.<p>

<p>

  During FY 1995, Congressional authority for the Title XI program had a cap of $12 billion, of which $850
million is authorized to guarantee the financing of fishing vessels and fisheries facilities by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Title XI guarantees for eligible export vessels are limited to $3.0
billion.<p>

<p>

  Title XI program participants are charged a one-time filing and investigation fee plus an annual guarantee
fee.  There were one default and nine voluntary payoffs on Title XI guaranteed contracts in FY 1995.  <p>

<p>

  During FY 1995, the Feder!l Ship Financing Fund had a net income of $72.2 million.  The cash balance of
the fund on September 30, 1995, was $3.9 million.  The Fund has been self-supporting since July 1989.
One default occurred during FY 1995.  Treasury investments of the Fund on September 30, 1995, were
$39&oslash;.8 million.  The cash and investment balance of the fund on Septemb%r 30, 1995, was approximately
$400.7 million.  During the fiscal year, in accordance with the Credit Reform Act, MARAD determined its
current needs and transferred excess funds of $585 million to Treasury.<p>

<a name="MARITECH"></a>
<a href="contents.htm#MARITECH">MARITECH</a><p>

<p>

  The National Shipbuilding and Shipyard Conversion Act of 1993 also contains funds for industrY-initiated
research and development projects, under the MARITECH program.  These cooperative research
agreements, funded on a 50/50 basis with industry, are intended to strengthen the Nation's shipbuilding
technology as the industry re-enters the international marketplace for commerc)al ship construction and to
maintain defense readiness.  They are awarded on a competitive basis by MARAD in partnership with the
Department of Defense (DOD).  The effort has two phases.  The first phase focused on near-term market
penetration with competitive, commercial ship designs for international buyers.  These efforts expanded into
the second phase, namely, to encompass longer-term technology development.   <p>

<p>

  The MARITECH program has been well received.  To date, the Department of Transportation and DOD
have approved 44 MARITECH projects representing over 147 participants located in 22 states and 9 foreign
countries.  The projects cover research and development for a broad selection of ship types: double hull
tankers, passenger vessels, dry and bulk cargo vessels, container ships, high speed ferriEs, and off-shore
service craft.  MARAD has been selected to administer 24 of these projects with a total value of $100 million
in Government and industry funding.  <p>

<p>

  Through the expanded Title XI program and its complementary MARITECH program, administered by
MARAD and DOD, MARAD has provided the shipbuilding industry with the impetus to modify its <p>

operations to more effectively compete in the international marketplace.  U.S. shipbuilders are closing the
gap to offer competitive prices for new construction projects in the international market.  Shipyards have
improved and enlarged their marketing approach to include the expanded Title XI program, have developed
commercially viable ship designs, and have entered into partnerships with international shipbuilders.<p>

<p>

  The MARITECH program has begun to fulfi,l the President's vision of strengthening the American
shipbuilding industry in the commercial market, as well as maintaining the Nation's defense readiness and
vital shipyard worker skills.  U.S. commercial shipbuilding capabilities and jobs, and the skills their workers
possess, are now on the rise after many years of decline.<p>

<p>

  Also in FY 1995, MARAD participated in an effort led by the United States to remove foreign shipyard
subsidies that met with success at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),
when an agreement was concluded in FY 1995 among the OECD nations and others to eliminate unfair
subsidies to shipbuilders.  This agreement will become effective 30 days after all signatories enact
appropriate enabling legislation to modify existing lavs not consistent with the termr of the OECD agreement.<p>

<p>

  In order to further assist U.S. shipyards' ability to become internationally competitive, MARAD is working
closely with standards developing organizations, such as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and
the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), to assist in the adoption of international ship consTruction and quality
standards, thus removing any unfair advantage foreign competitors may have as a result of less stringent
requirements.<p>

 <b>Capital Construction Fund <a name="(CCF">(</b>
<a href="contents.htm#CCF">CCF</a><b></a>)</b><p>

<p>

  The CCF Program was established under the Merchant Marine Act of 1970.  It assists operators in
accumulating capital to build, acquire, and reconstruct vessels through the deferral of Federal income taxes
on certain deposits, as defined in Section 607 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended.<p>

<p>

  The CCF Program enables operators to build vessels for the U.S. foreign trade, Great Lakes,
noncontiguous domestic trade (e.g., between the West Coast and Hawaii), and the fisheries of the United
States.  It aids in the construction, reconstruction, or acquisition of a wide variety of vessels, including
containerships, tankers, bulk carriers, tugs, barges, supply vessels, ferries, and passenger vessels.<p>

<p>

  During calendar year 1994, $142 million was deposited into these accounts.  Since the program was
initiated in 1971, fund holders have deposited $6.0 billion in CCF accounts and withdrawn $4.8 billion for the
modernization and expansion of the U.S. merchant marine.  As of December 31, 1994, a total of 113
companies were parties to CCF agreements (see <a name="Table 7"><a>Table</a></a> 7). <p>

<p>

  Another matter of importance involved defending Department of Transportation authority to administer the
CCF program.  In the Fall of 1993, MARAD learned the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was taking certain
positions at variance with the provisions of applicable CCF regulations and contractual agreements.
Meetings over a 2-year period among DOT, IRS, the Department of Treasury, and MARAD failed to resolve
the dispute.  Meanwhile, the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
became involved in a separate dispute over the administration of its CCF program for fishing vessels.  In
June 1995, the General Counsels of DOT and Commerce submitted a joint brief to the Office of Legal
Counsel (OLC) in the Department of Justice requesting OLC to resolve the dispute with IRS and Treasury.
The matter was pending at year's end.<p>

Construction Reserve Fund (<a name="CRF"></b>
<a href="contents.htm#CRF">CRF</a><b></a>)</b><p>

<p>

  Like the CCF, the CRF encourages upgrading of the American-flag fleet.  This program allows eligible
parties to defer taxation of capital gains on the sale or other disposition of a vessel if net proceeds are placed
in a CRF and reinvested in a new vessel within three years.<p>

<p>

  The CRF is used predominately by owners of vessels operated in coastwise trades, the inland waterwAys,
and other trades not eligible for the CCF Program.  Its benefits are as broad as those of the CCF.<p>

<p>

  The number of companies with CRF balances increased from six to eight during fiscal year 1995 (see <a name="Table 8"><a>Table</a></a>
8).  The total monies on deposit increased from $1.7 million to $2.1 million. <p>

  As of September 30, 1995, there were 9 commercial oceangoing vessels larger than 1,000 gross tons on
order from commercial shipyards in the United States.  <p>

<p>

  Commercial shipyards continued to be awarded all the Navy's new construction contracts.  Seven new
vessels of 1,000 light displacement tons (LDT) and larger were ordered and 19 new Navy vessels were
delivered by privately owned U.S. shipyards during this reporting period.<p>

<p>

  As of September 30, 1995, 54 Navy vessels 1,000 LDT and larger were under construction, being
converted, or on order in nine privately owned <p>

U.S. shipyards.  Thirty-one have delivery dates extending through 1997.<p>

<p>

  A significant portion of the Navy's ship construction and conversion program is devoted to "T" ships.  The
"T" designates Government-owned, civilian-manned ships which, in most instances, are assigned to the
Navy's Military Sealift Command.<p>

<p>

  As of September 30, 1995, 11 T-ships were on order or under construction in 3 privately owned U.S.
shipyards.  In addition, there were five T-ships undergoing conversion.  Three T-ships were completed
and orders for four new ships were placed in FY 1995.<p>

<p>

  While naval construction continues to represent the mainstay of business for some commercial
shipyards, the expanded Title XI program has given the U.S. shipbuilding industry the impetus to modify
the way they operate in order to compete in the international marketplace.  U.S. shipbuilders are closing

  The U.S. shipbuilding and ship repair industry invested more than $162 million in FY 1995 to upgrade
and expand facilities.  Much of this investment went to improve efficiency and competitiveness, including
new building basins, floating drydocks, cranes, automated equipment, and highly mechanized production
systems.  The emphasis has been on introducing modular techniques, fabrication of larger subassemblies,
and pre-outfitting of ship components.  <p>

<p>

  Information received by MARAD indicates that U.S. shipyards plan to spend approximately $125 million
for improvements in FY 1996.  The industry's capital investments since 1970 have totaled almost $5.6
billion.  <p>

education in the North American maritime industry through the advancement of marine structures
technology.  Established in 1946, the Committee advises the Government on improving the structural
design, material, and construction methods for ships.  The Committee also  supports the research and
development that focuses on improving the safety and integrity of marine structures, reducing marine
environmental risks, and supporting   804 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, precludes

  The OPDS Conversion Program, which began in 1984, is part of a project which uses modified tankers to
pump fuel to Marine Corps and Army beach units from an offshore mooring.  The system is designed to
deploy up to 4 miles of conduit from ship to shore and begin delivering petroleum products within 48 hours of
arrival on station.  Other tankers can come alongside the OPDS, tie up, and transfer their cargo to shore.
These operations are accomplished by civilian tanker personnel, with assistance from Navy tugs and diving
units.<p>

  During talks held in July 1995 in Brasilia, the United States and Brazil concluded negotiations on a new
3-year maritime agreement.  The agreement assures U.S.-flag carriers equal access to Brazilian
government cargoes and reaffirms the commitment of both countries to continue liberalizing their maritime
trade.  In Agreed Minutes of the discussions, the United States emphasized support for U.S. carrier efforts
to obtain licenses to operate bonded warehouse facilities.  In addition, the U.S. delegation stressed its
interest in gaining full access for U.S. liner carriers to cargo moving between Brazil and its South
American neighbors.<p>

  In December 1994, the United States and the world's other key shipbuilding nations (including Japan,
Korea, the European Union, and Norway) signed the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement.  The agreement is
designed to eliminate government subsidies and other trade-distorting practices in the industry.  It carries
out a key goal of the Administration's shipyard revitalization plan--to ensure fair international competition.
At the request of the U.S. Trade Representative, MARAD played a major role in helping to draft
implementing legislation for consideration by Congress.  In June 1995, a MARAD official joined the U.S.
delegation in an OECD meeting to discuss preparations for the agreement's entry into force.<p>

<p>

  MARAD also was represented on the U.S. delegation at meetings of the OECD's Maritime Transport
Committee.  Issues discussed by the Committee included competition policy, support measures for
shipping, and OECD relations with Asia and Eastern Europe.<p>

  MARAD officials met with a Vietnamese delegation, headed by Hoan Ngoc Le, First Vice Minister of
Transportation, in Washington, DC, on September 26, 1995, to explain the Agency's programs available to
the maritime industry.  This was the first contact by MARAD with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam since the
normalization of diplomatic relations was announced on July 11, 1995.  The meeting provided an opportunity
for the Agency to express the importance of developing a positive maritime relationship between the two
nations.  The Vietnamese delegation also met with Secretary of Transportation Federico Pe&ntilde;a and
representatives from DOT's Federal Highway Administration and Federal Railroad Administration.<p>

  MARAD chaired a meeting in Washington in April 1995 between a U.S. delegation and the Consultative
Shipping Group, an informal organization consisting of West European shipping nations and Japan.
Discussions covered a wide variety of maritime topics, including competition policy, support measures,
market access, and safety and environmental matters.  For the first time in such meetings, Canada and
Mexico participated as observers.  <p>

  <p>

  In October 1994, MARAD participated in the U.S. delegation for the initial meeting under the Transportation,
Science and Technology Exchange Agreement between the U.S. Department of Transportation and the
Japanese Ministry of Transport.  MARAD's areas of interest included advanced ship navigation technology
and marine environmental protection issues. <p>

<p>

  The Agency also participated in the annual meeting of the Transport Canada-U.S. Department of
Transportation Emergency Planning Committee for Civil Transportation held in Washington, DC, in May
1995.<p>

<p>

  Additionally, MARAD participated in meetings and training sessions of various subsidiary groups of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  The Maritime Administrator is the   Washington Chairman of
NATO's Planning Board for Ocean Shipping.   The Agency also participated in selected activities of NATO's
Senior Civil Emergency Planning Committee, including planning for a Crisis Management Exercise and
training of international shipping executives.<p>

<p>

   The first of three seminars on "Port Security Training For the Control Of Drugs, Chemicals and Hazardous
Materials" was held for officials from English-speaking Caribbean Basin countries in Barbados during April
1995.  The seminars are sponsored by the Organization of American States (OAS) and its Inter-American
Drug Abuse Control Commission and are funded by the U.S. Department of State.  The seminars, organized
by MARAD to provide port training for port officials in Latin America, are intended to alleviate the criminal
threat to trade by improving port security. <p>

<p>

  The OAS Port Training Committee, chaired by a MARAD representative, held its first Inter-American Course
on Port Security in October 1994 at the Port of Miami. Twenty-nine representatives from 25 nations in the
Western Hemisphere participated in this 3-week training event.  Topics included physical port security
practices, port safety measures, cargo  thefts, drug smuggling, stowaways, piracy, anti-terrorism, hazardous
cargoes, bombs/explosives, organized crime, and advanced technological detection equipment.  The course
included on-site inspections of the Port of Miami facilities and U.S. Customs Service and U.S. Coast Guard
sites.  It was funded by the OAS and the Port of Miami.<p>

  MARAD provides technical assistance in port, intermodal, and environmental planning and operations to
State and local port authorities, terminal operators, private industry, agencies of the United States, and
foreign governments.  In times of National emergency or contingency, the Agency directs the use of ports
and port facilities and the priority use and procurement of containers and other intermodal equipment to
minimize disruption of commercial inventory distribution. (See <a name="Chapter 1"><a href="#Chapter 1">Chapter 1</a></a>.)<p>

<p>

  MARAD provides for environmental control and pollution abatement of ship-generated pollution caused
by vessels under its jurisdiction.  The Agency also supports the U.S. maritime industry on domestic
environmental compliance issues and serves as an advocate for the U.S. maritime industry on
international environmental issues to ensure the industry's competitiveness in the global marketplace.
(International port and intermodal activities are discussed in <a name="Chapter 3"><a href="#Chapter 3">Chapter 3</a></a>.)<p>

<p>

  A reorganization at the beginning of FY 1995 established the Office of the Associate Administrator for
Ports, Intermodal, and Environmental Activities. <p>

Congressional Report on <a name="Public Ports"></b><a href="contents.htm#Public Ports">Public Ports</a></a><p>

<p>

   The Secretary of Transportation is required by Public Law 96-371 to report biannually to the Congress
on the status of United States public ports.  The report for calendar years 1992 and 1993 examined the
capabilities, composition, and financial status of the port industry, highlighted issues and problems, and
reviewed the importance of U.S. ports to the Nation's economy and military security.<p>

<p>

<b>Port Facility <a name="Conveyance"></b><a href="contents.htm#Conveyance">Conveyance</a><b></a> Program</b><p>

<p>

  Public Law 103-160 authorized DOT to convey Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) and other surplus
Federal property to public entities for the development or operation of a port facility. This authority was
subsequently delegated to MARAD for implementation.  The program provides a mechanism for entities to
acquire needed property at no consideration, provided it is used and maintained in perpetuity as a port
facility.  MARAD processes applications, conveys assigned property, and enforces compliance with the terms
and conditions of the conveyances.  No conveyance have been completed during the fiscal year.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>National Maritime System <a name="NMS">(</b><a href="contents.htm#NMS">NMS</a><b></a>)</b><p>

<p>

  The NMS significantly contributes to the American economy and links the United States to the world.  Over
1.9 billion metric tons of foreign and domestic commerce were transported by water in 1993.<p>

<p>

  The NMS is composed of deepdraft ocean trades, the deepdraft rivers, bays and estuaries -- including over
1,205 miles of channels and canals.  It also includes over 10,500 miles of shallow draft inland and
intracoastal waterways, 160 locks and dams and 355 ports.<p>

<p>

  In addition, the NMS includes the coastwise and intercoastal deepdraft trades, and U.S. controlled offshore
sealanes to Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam, as well as the Great Lakes deepdraft trades.<p>

<p>

  MARAD defined the NMS to ensure that its importance was fully recognized during development of the
National Transportation System (NTS).<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Automated <a name="Tools"></b>
<a href="contents.htm#Tools">Tools</a><b></a> for Improved Planning and Operations</b><p>

<p>

   MARAD continued its efforts to develop automated tools to assist in improving port planning and operation
capabilities and to estimate advances in productivity and contributions to the local and national economies.<p>

<p>

  The Agency continued evaluating the use of geographic information systems (GIS) as they apply to
intermodal port planning and operations. <p>

<p>

  At year's end, MARAD was developing GIS simulation technologies for port planning.  These advanced
technologies can be used to model marine terminal, ship, rail, and truck operations using simulation
mapping techniques.<p>

   <p>

  MARAD completed development of an educational video titled, <i>"U.S. Ports: Intermodal Gateways to
Growth</i>."  The purpose of the video is to educate the public on the importance of the U.S. port system in our
local, regional, and national economies.<p>

<b><p>

Technical <a name="Technical Assistance"></b>
<a href="contents.htm#Technical Assistance">Assistance</a></a><b><p>

</b><p>

  MARAD continued to provide technical assistance to the port and intermodal industry.  Several projects
were aimed at enhancing the role of U.S. ports and intermodal transportation companies in economic
development and national defense.  This involved developing analytical reports, methodologies, and data
systems for improving planning, productivity, and the general efficiency of port management and marine
terminal operations.  Projects were cost-shared by MARAD and appropriate State or local port authorities and
private sector organizations.<p>

<p>

  In addition, MARAD provided information to support several local port dredging projects and dredged
material disposal plans.  In discussions with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Agency stressed the
importance of adequate water depths in navigation channels and berthing areas to national trade
competitiveness and intermodal transportation efficiency.<p>

<b>Port <a name="Planning"></b>
<a href="contents.htm#Planning">Planning</a></a><p>

<p>

  MARAD participated in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) and landside
access presentations with other Department agencies and with private entities.  Port planning information
systems and port financial and economic analyses were emphasized as well as development of generic
methodologies that can be used by any port and region.<p>

<p>

<p>

  Projects under these programs which were completed, ongoing, or initiated in FY 1995 are briefly
summarized in the sections which follow:<p>

<p>

  Many sources predicted the Nation's foreign commerce would grow at a compounded rate of five to eight
percent over the next several years.  This indicated that between 2010 and 2020 approximately 12 million
cargo containers would be moving through our harbors and ports and over our highway and rail networks.  A
key question is whether there would be adequate port capacity to cope with this volume of containers.<p>

<p>

  A 1992 MARAD/Corps of Engineers study of container movements through South Atlantic ports provided a
breakthrough context for investigating potential capacity limitations as these volumes are imposed on the
system.  During FY 1995, MARAD accomplished the following:<p>

<p>

With the Corps of Engineers and others, developed a conceptual paper on the expanded national
model.<p>

<p>

Developed a scope of work and cost estimate for making the expansion and building the modeling
capability.<p>

<p>

Initiated discussions with DOT's Office of Economics and with Oak Ridge National Laboratory for
financial and technical support.  The Office of Economics perceives this project as an important
contribution to the National Transportation System and is considering allocation of up to $250,000 in
matching funds.<p>

  <b>Public Port <a name="Financing"></b>
<a href="contents.htm#Financing">Financing</a><p>

</a><p>

  The United States is the world's largest trading nation.  U.S. ports, as facilitators and transfer points for
most international commerce, must have a sound financial base in order to remain competitive. <p>

<p>

  This year MARAD began updating of its publication, <i>Public Port Financing in the United States.</i>  Among
other things, the report assessed the profitability and self-sufficiency of U.S. public ports from 1988-1992.
MARAD has initiated an addendum to the 1994 report which will investigate whether port size, type of
operation, type of government agency, and strategic planning impact on public port profitability.  The
addendum has been funded under a cooperative effort between MARAD and the American Association of
Port Authorities (AAPA). <p>

<p>

  This year MARAD also:<p>

<p>

Created an extensive database (18 years, from 1977-1994) of U.S. port financial data to allow more
extensive analysis over time.  <p>

<p>

Prepared and published the <i>United States Port Development Expenditure Report</i>.  The report
summarizes the public port industry's capital expenditures for 1993 and proposed expenditures for
1994 through 1998.  The report also analyzed the funding sources used to finance these
expenditures.<b><p>

<a href="contents.htm#Pricing">Pricing</a><b>g</b></a><p>

<p>

  MARAD began evaluating and revising a port pricing model last published in October 1986.  Traditionally,
most public ports have relied on some form of subsidy (tax revenues and/or taxing authority, grants, bonding
authority, etc.) to cover their operating and debt expenses.  However, with competition growing for fewer
government dollars, public ports realize the necessity to maximize operating revenues as the best way to
finance both present operations and future capital expenditures.  <p>

<a name="Management">Management</a></a><p>

<p>

  MARAD also began revising its <i>Port Risk Management Guidebook</i>, last published in 1985.  The guidebook
is designed to provide port executives with the basic skills and information needed to establish and maintain
appropriate, cost-effective insurance programs.  It is designed to assist port executives at small and medium
U.S. ports with part-time responsibility for port risk management and insurance.  The revised <i>Guidebook</i>
should also be useful for experienced risk managers who need to be familiar with the special risk
management requirements of public port authorities.<p>

<p>

Maritime Intelligence and <a name="Security">
<a href="contents.htm#Security">Security</a></a><p>

<p>

  U.S. cargoes on ocean vessels or in any port worldwide can be jeopardized by maritime security threats
including piracy, terrorism, stowaways, drugs, cargo theft and fraud, bribery, and extortion.  MARAD's
Maritime Intelligence and Security Program, through its Security Working Group, seeks to improve the
security of U.S.-flag merchant ships, U.S. ports, and U.S. cargo moving in vessels of all flags or while in
foreign ports.  Key functions in FY 1995 included:<p>

<p>

Coordination of Federal/maritime industry interaction on courses of action, facilitation of effective
solutions, the exchange of information on maritime security issues, and dissemination of intelligence
to the commercial maritime industry.<p>

<p>

Electronic dissemination of warning and threat information to ships at sea worldwide and U.S. port
authorities, pertaining to piracy, terrorism, or other activities detrimental to commercial shipping.<p>

<p>

Distribution to the commercial maritime industry of the quarterly publication, <i>Maritime Security
Report</i>, spotlighting international criminal activity and security issues which could pose a threat to
U.S. commercial maritime interests and the movement of U.S. cargoes in foreign trade.<p>

<p>

Assisting shipboard security training conducted at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.<p>

<p>

Providing technical assistance and interagency coordination in the development of maritime security
training for foreign port officials.<p>

<p>

   (Also see <a name="Ch1"><a href="#Chapter 1">Chapter 1</a></a> -- National Security and <a name="Ch3"><a href="#Chapter 3">Chapter 3</a></a> -- International Activities.)<p>

<b> <p>

Development of <a name="GIS"></b>
<a href="contents.htm#GIS">GIS</a><b></a> for Port Planning</b><p>

<p>

  A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a system of computer hardware, software, and procedures
designed to support the capture and management, manipulation, analysis, and modeling of spatially
referenced data solving complex planning and management problems.  In FY 1995, MARAD supported
development of the technology as an analytical tool. One major component of the GIS will be the ability to
analyze the dynamics of cargo flows on international and domestic routes, including port and intermodal
connections.  <p>

Remediation of Marine Contaminated
<a name="Sediments"></b>
<a href="contents.htm#Sediments">Sediments</a></a><p>

<p>

  The National Research Council's Marine Board was jointly funded by the Environmental Protection Agency,
the Maritime Administration, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, and the U.S. Navy to study and investigate the feasibility of decontamination technologies to
remediate contaminated sediments.  This was of particular interest because of dredging and disposal of
dredged operations that occur at port and harbor locations.  The final study will serve as a technical tool that
will provide guidelines on the optimum utilization of decontamination technologies.<p>

 Development of</b><a href="contents.htm#Ferry">
<a name="Ferry">Ferry</a><b></a> Systems<p>

</b><p>

  The rebirth of ferry systems in urban metropolitan areas is a recent phenomenon occurring within ports and
harbors of the United States.  Funds expended to-date for new ferry development have resulted mostly from
private sector investments.  There are now current initiatives to form private sector partnerships in funding
and development.  In this vein, MARAD has been instrumental in facilitating and coordinating activities to
promote ferry development with the DOT and the private sector.<p>

<p>

  MARAD, working jointly with FHWA and FTA, assisted the State of New Jersey in the development of a new
ferry terminal in Weehawken, NJ, which will be co-located with a new light rail commuter station.  These
cooperative efforts resulted in the project receiving a $1 million grant from FHWA under Section 1064 of
ISTEA for project planning and a $2.1 million grant to New York DOT for terminal improvements in
Manhattan.<p>

<b> Resolution of Land Use and</b>
<a href="contents.htm#Port Access"> <a name="Port  Access">Port Access</a><b></a> Conflicts at Inland Waterway Ports</b><p>

<p>

  Under the National Maritime Enhancement Institute Program, funded by the Maritime Administration, the
University of Memphis was awarded a contract to analyze the land use/traffic access conflicts that are
created by the redevelopment of inland waterway waterfront areas and at ports and terminals.  In addition,
the University of Memphis developed guidelines which could be used by local decision-makers to conduct
the transportation and redevelopment planning process recognizing the needs of the inland waterway
industry.  This university research work used case studies to examine the inland waterway system and
certain coastal ports.<p>

<p>

  The potential exists for this work to serve as an educational tool for local transportation and land use
planners, waterway users and operators, state and municipal decision makers, and relevant Federal, State
and local government entities.<p>

  The Maritime Administration continued its efforts to ensure that port facilities will be available to the military
when there is a deployment of troops and their supplies.  Planning orders at selected ports provided the
ports with listings of the specific facilities which the military plans to use in a deployment.  Retaining
membership in the National Port Readiness Network, MARAD--<p>

<p>

   o Began monthly port status reporting concerning availability of facilities at ports with planning orders<p>

<p>

 o Monitored Port Readiness Exercise (PRX-95) in Houston, TX<p>

   <p>

   o Visited all ports with planning orders to identify which facilities should be listed in planning orders<p>

   <p>

   o Developed plans for semi-annual port visits<p>

<p>

   o Issued new planning orders to replace those which had expired or where new facilities would be listed<p>

  ISTEA marks the first time Federal transportation policy explicitly recognized intermodal connections as an
important element for transportation planning and decision making. In FY 1995, ports and intermodal
terminal operators continued to view provisions of ISTEA as one of many ways to address and potentially
fund adequate land transportation port access infrastructure. <p>

<p>

  MARAD continued to work with the port and maritime industry and the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA) to identify port access connectors to the National Highway System (NHS).  The National Highway
System Act of 1995, which was signed into law November 28, 1995, identified over 100 major port access
connectors.   The Act directs the Secretary of Transportation  to submit additional NHS connectors to
Congress for approval within 180 days of enactment.  Most states have submitted their additional
recommendations to DOT for consideration.  <p>

<p>

  MARAD continued its efforts to assure that land transportation infrastructure requirements of the maritime
industry were addressed adequately.<p>

<p>

  The Agency also continued its educational outreach program with public and private sector organizations to
address all port-related provisions of ISTEA.  Efforts in FY 1995 were focused on briefings and technical
seminars conducted in cooperation with other DOT operating agencies.  The overall program informs State
and local transportation officials and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in port regions about the
importance of including intermodal port access in their planning and funding processes.<p>

  MARAD continued active involvement in the Department's efforts to develop a NTS concept.  DOT is refining
the NTS concept to focus on three products-- a transportation performance monitoring system, a
national/regional level system analytical capability, and a state of the transportation system report.  MARAD's
objective is to ensure that marine transportation and intermodal freight components of the NTS receive
adequate appraisal, consideration, and funding.<p>

  A key initiative for the Agency is the Maritime System of the Americas Program.  This system explores
transportation opportunities on the Inland Waterway System that connects the Central and Eastern United
States, Canada, Mexico, and Latin America.  The research focuses on economic, operational, and
technological trends for water transportation and analyzes river, short sea, and intermodal operations.<p>

<p>

  Through the Cargo Handling Cooperative Program (CHCP), the Agency continued to support research to
advance cargo handling techniques in support of marine-related intermodal transportation systems.
Initiatives such as the Video Container Recognition System were developed through the CHCP.  The CHCP

  MARAD provides technical assistance to the domestic shipping industry.  The Agency completed a
significant investigative project, the "Assessment of Port and Terminal Infrastructure Damage and
Navigation Impacts -- 1993 Upper Mississippi River Flood" and initiated work on a second project, the
"Shallow Draft Waterways Industry Assessment." MARAD also developed the film short "Barging into the
21st Century," which highlights the efficiency and reliability of the U.S. domestic barge industry.  Release
is scheduled for mid-1996.  MARAD also provided advanced information and distributed the Department of
Energy's assessment of the winter fuels forecast for 1995 in order to diminish the likelihood for energy-related Jones Act waiver requests.<p>

  The U.S.-flag Great Lakes bulk fleet consisted of 65 self-propelled vessels of 1,000 gross registered tons
and over.  This includes 63 dry-bulk vessels and 2 tankers, of which 57 were active, 1 was temporarily
inactive, and 7 were inactive on long-term lay-up.  (See <a name="Table 9"><a>Table 9</a></a>.)  This represents nearly full utilization of the
vessels capable of competitive operation in the region's bulk trades.  The Great Lakes also has 6 ferries of
over 1,000 gross registered tons, of which 1 is active and the remaining 5 are in long-term lay-up.<p>

<p>

  The primary dry bulk cargoes (iron ore, coal, and limestone), shipped from U.S. ports during the 1995
shipping season through September totaled 83.9 million short tons.  Total cargo carried in 1995 increased
about 6 percent from the previous year.<p>

  After experiencing more than a decade of losses, the barge industry finally returned to profitability.  This
turnaround of the industry was attributed to fewer barges, higher freight rates, new traffic patterns, and a
near-record grain harvest.<p>

<p>

  According to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) statistics, 619 million tons of freight moved on the
Nation's inland waterways in 1994, which is just below the record 622.6 million tons moved in 1990, but well
above the 607.3 million tons moved in 1993.  Estimates of shallow-draft tonnage for 1995 are predicted to be
higher than last year, with future annual growth rates expected to be between 1 and 2 percent.  The COE
predicts that between 715 and 865 million tons of cargo will be moving on the inland waterway system by
2010. <p>

<p>

  There were a number of bright spots for inland waterway operators in 1995.  One was the grain market,
especially for export corn.  The bulk of the grain that is exported moves via the Gulf of Mexico, and 90
percent of that moves down the Mississippi River by barge.  Another strong business sector for inland water
transport was the chemical industry, with waterway carriers moving nearly 25 percent of<p>

<p>

<p>

their total tonnage.  The United States is the world's largest exporter of chemicals and these shipments are
expected to remain strong.  The oil industry also contributed last year to the growth of tonnage on the inland
waterways.  <p>

<p>

  The United States demand for oil is expected to grow by 1 to 2 percent annually, and that is expected to
lead to more barging of petroleum and petroleum products.  Another user of barge transportation is the steel
industry, with its waterside plants receiving scrap metals by barge and then shipping out finished steel
products also by barge.<p>

Higher <a name="Freight Rates"></b>
<a href="contents.htm#Freight Rates">Freight Rates</a></a><p>

<p>

  The barge industry had been hit hard in recent years by sagging freight rates.  However, during 1994, grain
crops created a big increase in demand for barges and, as a consequence, rates rose significantly.  This
trend lasted throughout 1995. <p>

<p>

  The major factor leading to higher rates was a shortage of barge capacity.  With barges aging and,
consequently, being phased out, retirements outstripped new construction.  This lack of equipment led to full
barge employment and higher freight rates.<p>

<p>

  Rates, which are based on a 1976 benchmark tariff of 100, have never been higher.  In fact, there were
reports of barge rates rising to the extent that some shippers shifted their grain from water to rail because of
lower rail rates.  In the spring of 1994, for example, barge rates were around 95 percent of tariff  which is 5
percent lower than they were nearly 20 years ago.  But with the record harvests of corn and soybeans in late
1994, rates rose to 250 percent.  <p>

<p>

  By late September, they hit their peak at between 350 and 370 percent -- or about 133 percent higher in
dollar terms than the average rate for that month.  What was most unusual was when the harvest ended,
rates did not fall during what is traditionally the slow season.  Expectations are that if farmers continue to
produce such large volumes, rates will continue to remain above average for the coming years.<p>

<a href="contents.htm#Shipyard Activity">Shipyard Activity</a><p>

</a><p>

  Business for smaller "second-tier" shipyards was mixed in 1995.  The first half of the year saw yards closing
and being sold, a continued lack of demand for new offshore service vessels, and a slowdown in the casino
boat market. More than 15 gambling boats were either for sale or looking for new venues.  However, shipyard
activity improved later in the year, with the brightest area being the inland barge sector. <p>

<p>

  However, the increase in their freight rates and revenues still have not completely convinced waterway
operators to begin any new large-scaled building boom.  The number of barges retired from service
continues to exceed the number of new buildings, a situation that is expected to continue for at least another
year. <p>

<p>

  There were several sizeable barge construction contracts announced in 1995, with one yard reporting it was
building a barge a day.  Some inland shipyards had substantial back orders for 1995 and some have even
reported a full order book through 1996.  But the majority of these contracts continue to be for replacement
equipment, not additions.  For example, one sizeable contract to build 68 new tank barges will not add to the
fleet, but replace older barges being retired. <p>

<p>

  However, because of years of pent-up demand, the potential for new construction is definitely there.  The
barge fleet is aging and shrinking slightly.  At the end of 1994, the number of active barges on the
Mississippi River System, including tributaries and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway totaled 21,156.  This
compares with a total of 21,232 barges at the end of 1993.  Also, of the 1,224 towboats in the Nation's fleet,
as of August 1994, 49 percent had been in service 21 years or longer, and some 32 percent were built over
25 years ago.  Since 1985, a total of only 80 towboats have been built -- just 28 of these in the last <p>

5 years.<p>

<p>

  Market conditions improved considerably in the latter half of 1994, initially as a result of a stronger economy
that increased demand for many raw material commodities.  As manufacturing increased in the Midwest,
imports of aluminum, steel, coal, cement, and fertilizer began moving northbound, creating a shortage of
barges to haul export grain south.  Strong demand for grain exports only made this situation worse, with
grain tonnage moving down the Mississippi up nearly 30 percent over last year.  With many petrochemical
plants operating at near capacity, tank barge utilization was also around 100 percent.  The record 1994 grain
harvest taxed the capacity of the barge industry even further in the fall, which brought the demand/supply
balance close to equilibrium.  <p>

<p>

  Based on recent growth trends, tonnage for dry cargo barges is expected to increase at a rate of 1 to 2
percent annually, a rate that will exceed that for dry cargo capacity, which is expected to be no more than 1
percent annually.  This situation is expected to contribute to an improvement in barge utilization and,
consequently, an increase in freight rates to the year 2000.<p>

<a name="River"></b>
<a href="contents.htm#River">River</a></a><b> Conditions</b><p>

<p>

  The barge industry experienced its third-worst consecutive spring flooding.  Losses amounted to $1.5
million a day.  For over 3 weeks, flooding closed or restricted traffic on the Mississippi River and tributaries.
Although not as devastating as in 1993, high water had a significant impact on waterway operations when
the Mississippi was closed from May 19 to June 13, the Illinois River from May 28 to June 12, and the
Missouri River from May 16 to June 7.  In addition to disrupting ferry and riverboat casino operations, some
198 tows with over 5,100 barges were either stranded or halted by high water.<p>

<p>

  The chief concerns expressed by the industry include the potential for an increase in user fees; additional
regulations (State and/or Federal); a deteriorating infrastructure (32, or 80 percent, of the 40 lock chambers
on the Upper Mississippi River were built before 1942); insufficient monies from the Inland Waterway Trust
Fund; the high costs of dredging; and the lack of acceptable dredge material disposal sites. One new
concern is the downsizing of Federal agencies, such as the COE and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), that
interact with the shallow-draft industry.<p>

Great Lakes to Inland<a name="Waterways"> </b>

<p>

  Shippers in the Great Lakes are using river barges between Great Lakes ports in Lake Michigan through
Chicago and the Illinois Waterway to domestic and international markets.  This new trend led to the Port of
Milwaukee's gain of over 400,000 tons of new business over the past 2 years.  In addition, the ports of
Benton Harbor/St. Joseph, Michigan have been approved by the USCG for river barge operation.  Additional
ports such as Grand Haven, Holland, and Muskegon, Michigan, are presently under USCG review for
approval of river barge operation.  Barge transportation offers cost-effective alternatives to shippers and
reduces the impact on the environment.<p>

<p>

  During the 1995 shipping season, both U.S. and Canadian-flag Great Lakes self-unloading vessels
increased the operation of direct ship-to-river barge cargo transfer offshore at the harbor entrance to the
Calumet River at Chicago.  <p>

<p>

  This new transfer technique between a self-unloader vessel to river barge has been used primarily for grain,
salt, and chemicals imported from Canadian ports within the Upper Great Lakes and destined to U.S.
destinations as far as the Gulf Intercoastal Waterway.<p>

<p>

  This integration of the inland system with the Great Lakes is an integral part of America's <p>

national transportation strategy for full utilization of the Nation's waterways system.<p>

  <p>

  U.S.-flag tankers averaged 67 voyages each month from Valdez, AK in FY 1994.  An average of 1.70 million
barrels per day of crude were transported from Valdez in calendar year 1993.  Of these shipments, 79
percent went to the U.S. west coast, 9 percent to Panama for transshipment to the U.S. east coast, 6 percent
to the Virgin Islands, and 6 percent to Alaska and Hawaii.  The tanker and barge movements of petroleum
from the gulf coast to the east coast has increased by over 8 percent, averaging about .5 million barrels per
day.<p>

<b>Offshore <a name="Drilling"></b>
<a href="contents.htm#Drilling ">Drilling</a></a><p>

<p>

  Seventy percent of the production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is natural gas.  In October 1995, gas prices
from offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico were quoted at $1.57 per million cubic feet ($/mcf).  This price
was up from $1.47 a year earlier.  Over the last 25 years, the oil industry reorganized its exploration and
development activities to minimize fixed costs.  A pyramidal structure evolved: major assets are now rented,
not owned, and the major oil companies permit independent service companies to bid on each aspect of
development projects, such as seismic survey, exploratory drilling and logistics support.  Additionally, mobile
rigs now are typically chartered and equipment used in wells, such <p>

<p>

<p>

as drill pipe, is rented.  This structure permits rapid changes in the size of oil company exploration budgets,
but support/supplier companies (and their lenders) have experienced feast or famine business cycles. <p>

<p>

  A significant increase in the level of gas production in the U.S. Gulf seems unlikely.  The depletion rates of
existing wells suggest that many will be exhausted within 3 years, and in the near future many of the
currently operating offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico will have to be replaced.  At year's end, there were 176
mobile offshore rigs located in the Gulf of Mexico, of which 147 were under contract.  This translates into a
83.5 percent utilization rate, up from 79.2 percent in 1994.<p>

<b>Offshore <a name="Service Vessels"></b>
<a href="contents.htm#Service Vessels">Service Vessels</a></a><p>

<p>

  MARAD maintains an active liaison with the offshore industry by following U.S.-flag vessel activity, and
assisting industry in locating qualified Jones Act vessels to support this important trade.<p>

<p>

  The utilization rate for offshore supply vessels has been improving gradually as a result of only limited new
building, while a number of existing vessels have been converted for use in specialized services, such as
spill response.  The utilization rate for November 1995 was over 94.5 percent, a dramatic increase over the
recent industry low of 55 percent in 1992.<p>

<p>

  The rate paid for tug/supply boat and other support craft is almost totally dependent on the number of
working offshore petroleum product rigs.  Each working rig means work for 1.5 to 2 support/supply vessels.
Jobs for these support vessels are put out to bid by the oil companies on a "day rate" basis.  Since there is
little to differentiate one supply boat from another, the "day rate" a boat can command is a direct function of
the "rig count" (the number of rigs working).  Demand for work boats remained high through the end of 1995
with day rates averaging about $3,600 for the charter of an 180-foot supply vessel.  This is good news as
1995 started slowly with day rates in the $2,900 range.<p>

<p>

  Approximately 16,054 marine employees are engaged aboard 1,188 U.S.-flag, offshore support vessels.

<p>

  The U.S.-flag, privately owned, deep-draft oceangoing merchant fleet (including the Great Lakes fleet
shown in <a><a name="Table 9">Table 9</a></a>) totaled 322 vessels with an aggregate carrying capacity of about 15.3 million
deadweight tons (dwt.) on September 30, 1995.<p>

<p>

  Of this total, 292 ships of 13.6 million dwt. were active.  The latter included 16 breakbulk cargo ships, 122
intermodal vessels (containerships, barge-carrying vessels and roll-on\roll-off vanships known as
RO/ROs), 1 combination passenger-cargo ship, 135 tankers (including liquefied natural gas carriers), and
18 bulk carriers.  (See Table 10.)  The remaining 30 vessels were inactive and laid up.<p>

<p>

  Employment of the U.S.-flag oceangoing merchant fleet (including Government-owned ships) in fiscal
year (FY) 1994 is shown in <a name="Table 11."></a><a>Table 11.</a><p>

<p>

  The privately owned, American-flag merchant fleet ranked 11th in the world on a dwt. basis and 23rd in
the total number of ships on October 1, 1995.  (See <a name="Table 12"><a>Table 12.)</a></a><p>

<p>

</u>  The Maritime Administration (MARAD) administers the operating-differential subsidy (ODS) program, which
is designed to offset certain lower ship operating costs of foreign flag competitors.  U.S.-flag vessels which
operate in essential foreign trade are eligible for ODS.<p>

<p>

  Net subsidy outlays in FY 1995 totaled $199 million.  There were no subsidized voyages terminated in the
Great Lakes trade during<p>

FY 1995.<p>

  The Subsidy Index System was established by the Merchant Marine Act of 1970.  It provides for payment of
seafaring wage subsidies in per diem amounts.  The rate of change in the index is computed annually by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics and is used as the measure of change in seafaring employment costs.  ODS rates
also are calculated for maintenance and repairs, hull and machinery insurance, and protection and indemnity
insurance for both premiums and deductibles.<p>

  Section 804 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, prohibits any contractor receiving ODS or any
holding company, subsidiary, affiliate, or associate of such contractor, directly or indirectly, to own, charter,
act as agent or broker for, or operate any foreign-flag vessel which competes with an essential U.S.-flag
service, without prior approval of the Secretary of Transportation.  The prohibition also applies to any officers,
directors, agents, or executives of such an organization.  Waivers are approved under special circumstances
or if good causes are shown.<p>

<p>

  During the year, MARAD approved waivers for APL:<p>

<p>

	to charter and operate a foreign-flag relief vessel for a single voyage of approximately 45 days,
commencing in late December 1994 due to required drydocking of two APL line haul vessels
(October 24, 1994),<p>

<p>

	to operate in its existing services six new vessels under foreign flag (November 15, 1994), and <p>

<p>

	to charter slots on vessels of other participants in Asia-Atlantic Alliance Agreement 203-011467 and

a Master Slot Agreement with Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd., Nedlloyd Lines B.V., and Orient Overseas
Container Line, Inc. (February 3, 1995)  <p>

<p>

  MARAD also approved Lykes' requests for waivers which:<p>

<p>

	permit the time charter of four vessels under foreign registry between ports in the U.S. gulf and east
coast and north Europe after delivery from a German shipyard, through the termination of Lykes'
operating subsidy contract on December 31, 1997 (February 27, 1995),<p>

<p>

  Under Section 9 of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended, MARAD approved the transfer of 78 ships of 1,000
gross tons and over to foreign ownership and/or registry.  Twenty-eight (28) privately owned vessels were
sold for scrapping abroad.  Permission also was granted for eight vessels of less than 1,000 gross tons to be
registered in Russia.<p>

<p>

  Public Law 100-710 authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to determine the criteria for approval of
citizen and noncitizen trustees for mortgages held for the benefit of noncitizens who cannot qualify as a
preferred mortgagee.  Three new banks were approved as trustees, and one company was approved as
preferred mortgagee.  All approvals are published in the <u>Federal Register</u>.<p>

<p>

  MARAD's approval of the transfer of vessels of 3,000-gross tons and over to foreign ownership and/or
registry is subject to the terms and conditions of 46 CFR Part 221.  As such, the vessels require MARAD
approval for any subsequent transfer of ownership <p>

and/or registry and are available for requisitioning if needed.   <p>

<p>

  At year's end there were a total of 187 vessels subject to these terms, 20 of which were approved for
subsequent transfer of ownership and/or registry during the year.  User charges for processing applications
for foreign transfers and similar actions totaled $46,470 in this reporting period.  This total includes fees filed
pursuant to MARAD contracts reflecting the terms and conditions stipulated in 46 CFR Part 221.<p>

  The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is responsible for monitoring the administration of and compliance with
U.S. cargo preference laws and regulations by Federal agencies as they relate to individual programs which
generate oceanborne cargoes.<p>

<p>

  MARAD is responsible for ensuring that cargo preference compliance is achieved.  It also encourages Federal
agencies to maximize the use of U.S.-flag vessels, monitors bilateral and similar agreements, and identifies
discriminatory or potentially discriminatory trade practices against U.S.-flag vessels.<p>

<p>

  Major programs monitored include humanitarian aid shipments provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) and U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), commodities financed by the Export-Import Bank
(Eximbank), foreign military sales, and Department of Defense (DOD) cargo shipped by commercial ocean

  Monitoring compliance with United States cargo preference laws is essential in encouraging Federal agencies to
maximize the use of U.S.-flag vessels.  MARAD is required to report annually to Congress on compliance with the
three major cargo preference laws:<p>

<p>

o  The <b>Cargo Preference Act of 1954 </b>(P.L. 83-664), as amended, requires that at least 50 percent of the gross
tonnage of all Government-generated cargo be transported on privately owned, U.S.-flag commercial vessels to
the extent such vessels are available at fair and reasonable rates.  In 1985, the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 was
amended to require that the percentage of certain agricultural cargoes required to be carried on U.S.-flag vessels
increase from 50 to 75 percent.<p>

<p>

o  <b>The Cargo Preference Act of 1904 </b>requires all items procured for or owned by U.S. military departments and
defense agencies be carried exclusively (100 percent) on U.S.-flag vessels available at fair and reasonable rates.<p>

<p>

  These cargoes are generated primarily by DOD contracts with domestic and foreign contractors.  Cargo
preference applies not only to the end product but also to component parts.<p>

<p>

o  <b>Public Resolution (P.R.) 17 of the 73rd Congress</b> requires that all cargoes generated by the Export-Import Bank
be shipped on U.S.-flag vessels, unless a waiver is granted.<p>

<p>

  MARAD monitors the shipping activities of Federal agencies, independent entities, and Government corporations
(see <a name="Table 18"><a>Table 18</a></a>).  Statistics are maintained on a calendar year (CY) basis or on a 12-month program maintained over
the life of a loan or guarantee.<p>

<p>

  In FY 1994 and 1995, the Department of Justice (DOJ) responded to a Military Sealift Command (MSC) request to
resolve its disagreement relating to MARAD's approval of conditions in time and space charters of U.S.-flag ships that
are privately negotiated between the shipowner and noncitizens that prohibit noncitizens from carrying preference
cargoes in space on U.S.-flag ships chartered by such companies.  This matter remains under active review at the
Federal Maritime Commission.<p>

  Under the Israeli Cash Transfer Program, a "side letter" was in effect from FY 1980 through FY 1989.  The
Government of Israel did not execute a side letter with AID commencing October 1, 1990.  In December 1991, Israel
issued a new "side letter" to AID to transport 50 percent of grain shipments from the United States to Israel on U.S.-flag vessels during FY 1992.  The "side letter" agreement was renewed again for FY 1994.  During FY 1994, U.S.-flag
vessels transported approximately 800,000 metric tons and earned revenues of approximately $20 million. <p>

<p>

Export-Import Bank (<a name="Eximbank)"></a></b><a href="contents.htm#Eximbank">Eximbank</a><b>)<p>

</b><p>

  Eximbank shipments are governed by P.R. 17, which requires that 100 percent of all cargoes generated by this
resolution move on U.S.-flag vessels.  <p>

<p>

  If a recipient country meets United States' requirements and requests a general waiver, it would be allowed to move
50 percent of the cargoes on national-flag vessels.<p>

<p>

  In the Eximbank program, total tonnage increased from 144,752 metric tons in CY 1993 to 167,289 metric tons in CY
1994.  U.S. operators' carriage increased some 12 percent from 92,907 metric tons in CY 1993 to 104,034 metric tons
during CY 1994.  The 11,127 metric ton increase in U.S.-flag carriers' tonnage resulted from an upturn in new project
activities.  The U.S.-flag ocean freight revenue for CY 1994 was $36,686,031.<p>

<p>

  Eximbank officials continue to support P.R. 17.  Since the termination of Lykes breakbulk vessels, the request for
non-availability waivers for project cargoes has increased dramatically.  Eximbank has participated in several
meetings designed to introduce new U.S.-flag service and to improve the working relationship between the carriers
and shippers.  No new U.S.-flag services were reported during this fiscal year.<p>

<a href="contents.htm#SPR">SPR</a></a>)<p>

<p>

  In 1977, the U.S. Government announced its intention to store 750 million barrels of crude oil in salt domes along
the U.S. Gulf Coast as a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).  At the end of CY 1994, approximately 592 million
barrels had been stored at five SPR sites.<p>

<p>

  The Cargo Preference Act of 1954 requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to transport at least 50 percent of the
oil in U.S.-flag tankers.  In 1977, MARAD and DOE agreed that to ascertain compliance, long ton/miles (LTM) more
accurately reflect the diverse geographical distances in transporting the oil than by tonnage alone.<p>

<p>

  In CY 1992, DOE reactivated its procurement activities following its August 1990 suspension of oil purchases due to
unstable conditions in the Persian Gulf.  During 1994, U.S.-flag tankers carried SPR cargoes amounting to 1.623
billion LTM (57.51 percent) with revenue of $7.34 million.<p>

<p>

  The SPR program is monitored cumulatively from its inception for compliance purposes.  U.S.-flag carriers have
received 53 percent of the cargoes.<p>

  MARAD initiates and recommends regulations and procedures for DOD agencies to follow in administering cargo
preference.  Program efforts concentrate on meetings and discussions with DOD contractors, suppliers, freight
forwarders, and shipping companies to focus attention on meeting the needs of all constituents within the context of
U.S.-flag carriage requirements.<p>

<p>

  The Cargo Preference Act of 1904 (10 U.S.C. 2631) (the 1904 Act) is the primary law that applies to DOD.  It
requires that items procured for, or owned by the military departments or defense agencies, must be carried
exclusively (100 percent) on U.S.-flag vessels, if available at reasonable rates.  The preponderance of DOD cargoes
moves on vessels chartered-in to Military Sealift Command (MSC) and the Military Traffic Management Command
(MTMC).  However, a significant amount of DOD cargo moves in the commercial sector.  Cargo preference applies not
only to the end item but also to its component parts and supplies.  <p>

  MARAD, MTMC, and MSC are creating a "Memorandum of Agreement" which will establish procedures for reporting
DOD sponsored shipments of personal effects.  Upon finalization of the agreement in FY 1996, MTMC will provide
MARAD with quarterly reports on the movement of these personal effects, including copies of reports indicating
approval to use foreign-flag vessels.  <p>

<p>

  Since 1994, MARAD has been receiving data on the movement of privately owned vehicles (POVs) being
transported between selected turn-in points in CONUS to six points in the Republic of Germany.  The ocean carrier
awarded the contract reports ocean tonnage and revenue.   <p>

<p>

  MSC continues to use time chartered vessels in direct competition with U.S.-flag scheduled service.  Twice, in
calendar year 1995, Farrell Lines lost cargo to a MSC-controlled vessel and to an RRF vessel.  MARAD is formally
proposing a joint task group to meet periodically to review and to resolve these types of problems.<p>

<p>

  The Federal Acquisition Council published a notice in the <u>Federal Register</u> on March 22, 1995, which would waive
the cargo preference laws for shipments of commercial items and commercial components by subcontractors.  Both
MARAD and the ocean carrier industry oppose the proposed change since it will result in a loss of revenue for U.S.
ocean carriers.  MARAD, through the Department of Transportation, filed comments on May 22, 1995, in opposition to
any waivers of the cargo preference laws, noting that any changes to cargo preference should be addressed in the
context of "maritime" reform legislation rather than "procurement" reform.  As a compromise, "firewall" language was
added to the regulation to limit its impact, and the implementation date was delayed until May 1, 1996, in order to
give the maritime industry an opportunity to propose an alternative solution.<p>

<p>

  A review of the top 10 defense contractors for FY 1994 shows that only 2 companies have excellent records of
reporting shipments to MARAD.  (See Chart 3.)  However, MARAD is working with both MTMC and MSC to improve
reporting by these contractors.<p>

<a name="DOD"><a href="contents.htm#DOD">DOD</a> </a><b>Services and Agencies</b><p>

<p>

	A brief description of the activity in each DOD organization follows.<p>

<p>

<a name="Defense Security"></a><a href="contents.htm#Defense Security">Defense Security</a><b> Assistance Agency</b><p>

<p>

  The Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA) is the sponsoring DOD agency for the Foreign Military Financing
(FMF)/Military Assistance Program Merger (MAP) and related programs authorized within the scope of the Foreign
Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA).  The movement of excess defense articles within these programs is
consistent with the continued drawdown of U.S. forces, especially from Northern Europe, and the closure of U.S.
military bases worldwide.<p>

<p>

  The statistics reflected in <a name="Tab18"><a>Table 18</a></a> from the FMF/MAP Merger and related FAA programs represent combined
tonnage and revenue data for those ocean shipments arranged by the foreign recipients' freight forwarder.  These
statistics also reflect cargoes that were authorized to move within the Defense Transportation System (DTS) and
which were processed by the MTMC and the MSC.<p>

<p>

  U.S.-flag participation meets the compliance requirements as set forth in the governing cargo preference law (P.L.
83-664) and reflects MARAD's efforts to maximize the use of U.S.-flag vessels.  Continuing its support of the U.S.
merchant marine, and its cooperation with MARAD, DSAA extends its 100 percent U.S.-flag shipping policy for the
FMF/MAP Merger programs to the related FAA program transfer.  DSAA policy incorporates general waivers thereby
allowing the recipient's national-flag vessels to participate in the ocean carriage of cargo within each program.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<a name="Air Force"></a><a href="contents.htm#Air Force ">Air Force </a><p>

<p>

  The Air Force program decreased during this reporting period.  This program uses a significant amount of air
transportation, which reduces the use of ocean transportation.<p>

<p>

<b><hr>
<p>

<p>

Army/<a name="Corps"></a></b>
<a href="contents.htm#Corps">Corps</a><b> of Engineers<p>

<p>

</b>  As a result of DOD downsizing and budgetary cutbacks, a slight reduction in Army program tonnage resulted in CY
1994.  The Corps of Engineers showed an increase in metric tons reported.  MARAD has established productive
working relationships with DOD agencies and contractors to improve communication and awareness on the
availability and benefits of U.S.-flag transportation.  Enhancements to the computer system used by MARAD allow
greater efficiency and flexibility in reporting.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b><p>

Defense Logistics Agency (<a name="DLA"></a></b>
<a href="contents.htm#DLA">DLA</a><b>)<p>

</b><p>

  There was a significant increase in DLA contracts awarded in CY 1994.  This increase was based on a large
shipment of coal in bulk from the East Coast to Amsterdam, and large <p>

<p>

shipments of rubber from Indonesia/Malaysia to the West Coast.  DLA is 100 percent in compliance.<p>

<p>

<b><hr>
<p>

<p>

<p>

Defense Nuclear Agency (<a name="DNA"></a></b>
<a href="contents.htm#DNA">DNA</a><b>)</b><p>

<p>

  The DNA recently began using commercial ocean transportation to ship supplies from Japan to the West Coast.
They also use the Defense Transportation System (DTS) in most of their shipments. <p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<a name="Navy/Marine"></a></b>
<a href="contents.htm#Navy/Marine">Navy/Marine </a><b>Corps</b><p>

<p>

  The Navy program was Principally in compliance with the cargo preference laws during this reporting period.
However, the total tonnage is much lower due to Department of Defense budgetary cutbacks.<p>

<p>

  Twenty-three percent of U.S. Navy cargoes were shipped on foreign-flag vessels.  The major cause of the foreign-flag shipments was lack of U.S. breakbulk service for large oversize articles.  Because no U.S.-flag carrier was able to
provide this service, 95 percent of the foreign-flag shipments were made with a confirmation of non-availability of
U.S.-flag vessels by the Military Sealift Command.<p>

<p>

Continued MARAD communication with contracting officers and shipyard personnel, has resulted in better
compliance with cargo preference procedures between prime contractors and their subcontractors.	<p>

<p>

<p>

<b><a name="Agricultural"></a></b>
<a href="contents.htm#Agricultural">Agricultural</a><b> Cargoes</b><p>

<p>

  The statutory sources of agricultural cargo preference programs are Titles I, II, and III of P.L. 83-480; Section 416 of
the Agricultural Act of 1949; and the Food for Progress Act of 1985.  These programs have a 75 percent U.S.-flag
shipping requirement.  Collectively, 78.2 percent of the 6.2 million metric tons of humanitarian aid commodities were
transported on U.S.-flag vessels during the 1994/1995 Cargo Preference Year (CPY).<p>

<p>

o  Title I provides for U.S. Government financing of sales of U.S. agricultural commodities to developing countries on
concessional credit terms.  During FY 1995, 1.6 million metric tons of bulk grain were shipped during the current
CPY.<p>

<p>

o  Title II is a donation program administered by AID which generated approximately 2.8 million metric tons of
packaged, processed, and bulk commodities for least developed countries.<p>

<p>

o  Title III, Food for Development Program, was established by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of
1990 (1990 Farm Bill).  Under this bilateral grant program, agricultural commodities are donated to least developed
countries.  Shipments under the Title III program began during Cargo Preference Year 1991/1992.  Approximately 1.1
million metric tons of bulk grain were shipped during the current Cargo Preference Year.<p>

<p>

o  Section 416 is a donation program established primarily to distribute surplus commodity which generated
approximately 174,000 metric tons of bulk grain and other surplus agricultural commodities for least developed
countries.<p>

<p>

o  Food for Progress provides agricultural commodities to developing countries on a grant basis in exchange for
development policy reforms.  During the current CPY, 593,000 metric tons of commodity, principally bulk grain, were
donated.<p>

<p>

  MARAD, USDA, and AID have conducted numerous joint discussions concerning the adoption of certain commercial
shipping terms for bulk humanitarian aid cargoes.  With their cooperation, it is hoped that the agricultural shipping
agencies will allow cargo to be fixed on a more commercial basis which should reduce carrier risk and lower ocean
carriage costs.<p>

<b><p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

Ocean Freight Differential</b> <b>(<a name="OFD"></a></b>
<a href="contents.htm#OFD">OFD</a><b>)</b><p>

<p>

  The Food Security Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-198) increased the required percentage for U.S.-flag carriage from 50 to 75
percent of gross tonnage of certain agricultural programs (i.e., P.L. 83-480, Food for Progress, and Section 416
programs).<p>

<p>

  The Department of Transportation is responsible for financing any increased ocean freight charges resulting from
the application of the increased U.S.-flag portion.  MARAD reimburses USDA for its share of the OFD <p>

<p>

costs above 50 percent of the gross tonnage up to but not exceeding the additional 25 percent.<p>

<p>

  OFD cost is defined as the difference between the cost of shipping cargo on a U.S.-flag vessel as compared to
shipping the same cargo on a foreign-flag vessel.<p>

<p>

     MARAD reimbursed the Commodity Credit Corp. (CCC) $28.4 million for OFD invoices and documents submitted
for the CPY which started on April 1, 1994.  This amount declined $7.7 million from the previous year due to reduced
agricultural program funding which resulted in lower tonnage and lower OFD rates.  CCC was not reimbursed for
OFD that included inland freight and bagging and stacking costs.<p>

<p>

  The average OFD cost for which MARAD reimbursed USDA was $22.96 per metric ton, a reduction of $7.26 per
metric ton, or 24 percent.  This decrease was due to lower agricultural program funding levels, increased competition
for decreased tonnage, and strong foreign-flag rates during the CPY.  <p>

<p>

  Under the 1985 Act, if the total obligations incurred by USDA and CCC of ocean freight and OFD on exports of
agricultural commodities and products under certain agricultural programs exceed 20 percent of the value of the
commodities exported under these programs, plus the ocean freight and OFD, MARAD must reimburse CCC for the
excess.  In 1994, MARAD received an $81 million invoice from USDA claiming that ocean freight rates for FY 1992
exceeded the 20 percent threshold.  After auditing, and removal of non-OFD charges, payment in the amount of
$35.2 million was forwarded during the CPY.  This payment was in addition to the OFD reimbursed during the CPY. <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b><p>

<a name="Minimum"></a></b>
<a href="contents.htm#Minimum">Minimum</a><b> Tonnage</b><p>

<p>

  The minimum tonnage for agricultural products was established under Section 901c(a)(1) of the Merchant Marine
Act, 1936, as amended.  This includes P.L. 480, Section 416, and Food for Progress.  The purpose of formulating a
minimum average was to ensure that U.S.-flag carriers continue to receive a fair share of Government-generated
agricultural exports.  <p>

<p>

  Based on MARAD's preliminary program tonnage for FY 1995, a total of 5,188,383 metric tons of agricultural
products were exported.  The minimum tonnage for FY 1995, as calculated is 7,928,008 metric tons.  This represents
a deficit of 2,739,625 metric tons.  <p>

<p>

  The foreign food aid tonnage exported during CY 1995 was below the average of the base period because of lower
Congressional appropriations, higher average commodity costs, and reduced tonnage for the Section 416 program.

<p>

  The Maritime Administration (MARAD) engages in a variety of marketing programs designed to increase
U.S. participation in global commerce.  <p>

<p>

  The Agency's programs focus on improving communications between U.S. ocean carriers and
importers/exporters, and providing assistance on sea transport to U.S. manufacturing firms active in
international trade.  MARAD also has developed a marketing program to promote U.S. shipyards in the
international commercial market place, as part of the Administration's shipbuilding initiative.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>Marketing Program - <a name="Carriers"></a></b><a href="contents.htm#Carriers">Carriers</a><p>

<p>

  MARAD's marketing program for U.S. ocean carriers focuses on assisting companies through market
leads and personal contacts with exporters and importers to encourage them to give preference to U.S.
vessels for their ocean transport needs.  The Market Lead System refers to market intelligence collected
from both private and Government sources which MARAD, in turn, makes available to U.S. vessel
operators.  Over 5,000 market leads were distributed to U.S. carriers and exporters during fiscal year
1995.<p>

<p>

  MARAD has offices strategically located throughout the country which consult with the transportation
policymakers of import and export firms.  In this reporting period, MARAD trade specialists consulted with
some 2,100 firms to encourage use of U.S. vessels.  Voluntary reports from carriers and shippers indicate
that over $90 million in additional ocean freight revenues for U.S. vessels resulted from these policy
consultations.  Over the last 11 years, in excess of $350 million in additional revenue for U.S. carriers has
been generated by this program.  To improve the quality of information provided to U.S. carriers and to
enhance the effectiveness of meetings with shippers, MARAD's computer data base was enhanced which
enables quick access to vital shipper information from America's importers and exporters.<p>

<p>

  During FY 1995, MARAD participated in more than 350 seminars, forums, workshops, and other
meetings dealing with international trade and transportation.  The Agency sustained the visibility of its
marketing mission for support of the U.S. merchant marine by taking an active role in Government and
private export promotion programs.  Those programs include interacting with export trade promotional
organizations such as the Association of South East Asian Nations Council and Japan External Trade
Organization.  MARAD also is an active member of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee,
consisting of 19 Government agencies engaged in the promotion of U.S. international trade.  In addition,
MARAD is a member of the Presidential E-Award selection committee.  <p>

<p>

  MARAD provided U.S.-flag carriers with promotional materials for distribution at nationwide, multi-city
export workshops and seminars sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  These meetings presented an
opportunity to provide information on transport economics and practices to shippers, carriers, freight
forwarders, and other maritime interests.  They also enabled the Agency to brief executives of firms involved
in foreign trade on the national policy benefits which result from shipper usage of U.S. services.<p>

<p>

  In addition, MARAD provides business leads to U.S. companies through a shipper help line, which is
maintained to facilitate assistance to both U.S. exporters and importers.  The Agency maintains information
on U.S.-flag services in the Department of Commerce's National Trade Data Bank and "Flash Fax" system.
MARAD's computer bulletin board, MARlinespike, provides carriers and the public with U.S. ocean transport
service information and schedules, and international business opportunities.  MARlinespike has been further
enhanced and includes news releases and major announcements, shipbuilding market leads, legislation, the
Ship Financing Guarantee Program (Title XI), standards, design files, etc. <p>

<p>

 The National Maritime Resource and Education Center's complete marine standards library also may be
accessed through MARlinespike.  <p>

<p>

  The Internet E-mail address was established to allow rapid, inexpensive access by the public to
comprehensive trade information.  The <p>

<p>

address is:  <p>

<p>

(marketing_marad@postmaster2.dot.<p>

gov.)<p>

<p>

  MARAD also worked with MARITECH to establish NSnet, the National Shipbuilding Network, which provides
international Internet connections to shipyards, foreign purchasers, brokers, banks, and vendors.  (See
Chapter 10.)<p>

<p>

  MARAD's Shipper Award Program recognizes importers and exporters who patronize U.S. carriers with a
substantial share of their international cargoes.  In FY 1995, a total of 247  companies based in the United
States were presented with MARAD's U.S. Merchant Marine Certificates of Appreciation for carrying from 40
up to 100 percent of their goods on U.S. ships.  The program continued to recognize foreign companies
which support U.S. vessels, with 165 exporters and importers in Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong
receiving certificates. <p>

<p>

  Under the highly successful Executive Contact Program, a select group of shippers was contacted by
senior MARAD executives to encourage and enhance their use of American carriers.  During FY 1995,
emphasis again was placed on contact with high volume, high value importers and exporters.<p>

<p>

  MARAD and agencies at the Departments of Commerce, State, and Defense, and the U.S. Trade
Representative's office have developed proactive, focused and integrated programs to support the U.S.
shipbuilding industry's marketing efforts.<p>

<p>

  The United States continues to implement a country team concept for commercial activities.  The heads of
all agencies at missions abroad take a coordinated approach to commercial planning.  The Secretaries of
State and Commerce have pledged to encourage use of U.S. firms in international competition.<p>

<p>

  MARAD works closely with the U.S. Foreign Commercial Service and embassy and mission personnel to
gather market information.  The Agency also participates in select international trade shows to promote the
U.S. shipyard industry.  At year's end, MARAD was working with industry on the American International
Shipbuilding Exposition, the first major international shipbuilding exhibition scheduled in the United States.  It
is scheduled to be held in New Orleans in April 1996.  In addition, MARAD arranged for the United States to
be named Partner Country for the world's largest shipyard related exhibition, the "Shipbuilding Machinery
and Marine Technology" conference to be held in Hamburg, Germany in October 1996.<p>

<p>

  In conjunction with the American Waterways Shipyard Conference, the Shipbuilders Council of America, the
American Shipbuilding Association, the Marine Machinery Association, and others, MARAD again conducted
ship construction workshops and seminars on the subjects of marketing, environment,   labor, and finance.<p>

   The Maritime Administration (MARAD) supports the training of merchant marine officers and crew
members with a focus on safety in U.S. waterborne commerce.  The Agency also monitors national and
international maritime industry labor-management practices and policies and promotes healthy labor-management relations.  MARAD's focus in this area is on fostering a safe and efficient maritime
transportation system through the effective use of human resources.<p>

U.S. Merchant Marine<a name="Academy"></a> </b><a href="contents.htm#Academy">Academy</a><p>

<p>

   MARAD operates the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, NY, which educates young men
and women to become officers in the American merchant marine.<p>

<p>

   Graduates receive Bachelor of Science degrees and U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) licenses as deck or
engineering officers, or both, and reserve commissions as officers in an armed service of the United
States.<p>

<p>

   The Federal Government maintains the Academy because it is an integral component of the defense
readiness called for in our national security policy.  Maintaining the Academy is also a declaration by the
Federal Government that there will always be a guaranteed source of merchant marine officers to meet
our domestic and international trade requirements.<p>

<p>

   The Academy strives to keep its educational program responsive to the needs of America's maritime
industry.  <p>

   As a key component of our national security effort, all Academy graduates incur an 8-year U.S. Navy
Reserve commitment which obligates them to serve in time of war or national emergency.  The critical
maritime skills developed with their military training and obligations significantly increase our Nation's
defense readiness.<p>

<p>

   Academy graduates also are committed to a 5-year maritime service obligation.  This requires graduates
to obtain a merchant marine officer's license on or before graduation and to maintain the license for at
least 6
years.  This service obligation may be satisfied in the merchant marine as an officer aboard U.S. merchant
ships, or in shoreside maritime or intermodal transportation industry positions if afloat employment is not
obtainable.  Active military duty also satisfies the obligation.<p>

<p>

   The Class of 1995 comprised 101 third mates, 101 third assistant engineers, and 17 graduates who
completed the dual deck/engine license program.  Four students from the Russian Federation were in the
graduating class.  Thirty-four of the third mate licensees earned endorsements as Qualified Members of the
Engine Department (QMED) in the third year of the Academy's ship's officer program; they completed
selected engineering courses which increased their knowledge of today's technologically advanced ships,
where both navigation and power are controlled from the bridge.  All graduates complete required nautical
science and maritime business courses.  Twenty-one women were among the 1995 graduates.  Admiral
Joseph W. Prueher, USN, Vice Chief of Naval Operations delivered the commencement address.<p>

<p>

   Within 3 months after graduation, about 88 percent of the 219 graduates had found employment in the
maritime or transportation industry--aboard ship or ashore--or were serving on active military duty in the U.S.
military services.<p>

<p>

   Average enrollment at the Academy during the year was 940.<p>

<p>

   At the beginning of the 1995-96 academic year, the regiment of midshipmen included 102 women, 26 of
whom were scheduled to graduate in June 1996.<p>

<p>

   Members of Congress nominated 1,232 constituents for the Class of 1999 and a total of 254 appointments
were made in FY 1995.<p>

<p>

   The Academy is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.  The Marine
Engineering Systems curriculum is approved by the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology.<p>

<p>

   In addition to classroom study, Academy midshipmen are assigned to U.S.-flag merchant ships for two 6-month periods for practical shipboard experience.<p>

<p>

   MARAD provides financial assistance to six State maritime academies to train merchant marine officers by
authority of the Maritime Education and Training Act of 1980.  The six academies and their locations are:
California Maritime Academy, Vallejo, CA; Great Lakes Maritime Academy, Traverse City, MI; Maine Maritime
Academy, Castine, ME; Massachusetts Maritime Academy, Buzzards Bay, MA; State University of New York
Maritime College, Fort Schuyler, NY; and, Texas State Maritime Program, Texas A &amp; M University at
Galveston, TX.<p>

<p>

   State maritime academy cadets who participate in the Student Incentive Payment Program receive a
maximum of $3,000 to offset school costs.  Participating cadets are obligated to remain employed in the
maritime industry for 3 years, to accept a reserve commission in the U.S. Navy or one of the other armed
forces, and to renew or upgrade their USCG merchant marine license at least once after graduation.<p>

<p>

   MARAD provides training vessels to five sea coast academies for use in at-sea training and as shoreside
laboratories.  Three of the schools -- California, Maine and Texas -- are in the process of replacing their aging
schoolships.  At year's end, the CHAUVENET, a decommissioned Navy Survey vessel, was being converted
to replace the Texas State Maritime Program's TEXAS CLIPPER; the MAURY, an oceanographic survey ship
deactivated by the Navy, will replace the California Maritime Academy's GOLDEN BEAR; and the TANNER,
sistership to the MAURY, will replace the Maine Maritime Academy's STATE OF MAINE.<p>

<p>

   MARAD provides supplemental training for seafarers in maritime firefighting, intermodalism, and defense
readiness.  In FY 1995, 2,129 maritime personnel were trained in ship and barge firefighting.  Participants
included U.S. citizen seafarers and others concerned with maritime fire safety, including United States Coast
Guard personnel and port city professional firefighters.   MARAD-sponsored basic and advanced firefighting
training is offered at its fire school at Swanton, OH; the U.S. Navy-Military Sealift Command/MARAD fire
training facility in Earle, NJ; and the U.S. Navy fire training installation at Treasure Island, San Francisco, CA.<p>

<p>

   In support of firefighting readiness in port cities, shipboard firefighting training is offered to municipal
firemen from waterfront communities.  Forty port city firefighters participated in marine firefighting training
with regular seafaring students at the Toledo Marine Fire Training Center several times during the fiscal year.
<p>

<p>

   In cooperation with Bowling Green State University and the Ohio State Fire School, over 80 municipal
firefighters were trained at the Merchant Marine Fire Training Center at Swanton, OH.  In addition, a wide
variety of crews were trained including personnel from gaming boats, fishing vessels, ocean vessels, river
towboats, maritime academy cadets, and Great Lakes vessels.<p>

<p>

   This was the fourth year of MARAD's National Sealift Training Program for Masters and Chief Mates at the
U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.  This program was developed to improve U.S.-flag strategic sealift support
capability and reduce vulnerability to piracy and hostage threats.  The course combines the Master Mariners
Readiness Course with course modules in Defense Communications and Maritime Security, which integrates
defense communications, maritime security and sealift readiness training drawing from lessons learned from
operations EARNEST WILL, DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM, UPHOLD DEMOCRACY, and RESTORE
HOPE.  In FY 1995, 71 senior deck officers completed this program.<p>

<p>

   This was the second year MARAD sponsored the "Commercial International Freight Transportation" course.
It was held at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.  Military officers and civilians newly assigned to
transportation/logistics activities within the DOD, DOT, and other Federal agencies are the primary focus for
this class.  Commercial carrier personnel are also eligible to take this 2-week course which provides students
with an in-depth understanding of the principles of intermodal transportation systems and their application to
military/contingency logistics.  Sixty-six transportation professionals have completed this new program.<p>

   Public Law 100-324, the Merchant Marine Decorations and Medals Act, authorizes the Secretary of
Transportation to recognize outstanding and meritorious service or participation in national defense action.  In
FY 1995, the Gallant Ship Award was presented to the tugboat PT. MILNE.  The tugboat and her crew were
honored for rescuing 132 people in July 1994 from a burning fish processing vessel in the Bering Sea.  At
the same time, the tug's captain, Al Krininger, was presented the Meritorious Service Medal.<p>

Labor</b><p>

<p>

   Global agreements for more open trade have encouraged ship operators to form multi-national alliances to
share vessels and to network the coordination of the use of port waterside and landside intermodal facilities
worldwide.  U.S. seafaring unions are internationally active because of global sourcing of labor and are
moving toward developing international labor alliances and linking labor rights to future international trade
agreements.  U.S. waterfront labor unions are concerned with the future of ports under labor contract which
will not have the intermodal infrastructure to handle the more than 4,000 TEU new containerships now being
built and delivered.  Newly formed international shipping consortia will determine the fate of current and
future ports worldwide.  The preservation of jobs and the jurisdiction of new crafts are issues waterfront labor
will bring to future labor negotiations with management.  Planning by the shipping consortia to build new
mega terminals outside city, county, or port authority jurisdictions will intensify these job issues.  Existing
labor agreements will be major factors in determining the future of smaller ports.  Both labor and
management are demonstrating flexibility in order to keep their facilities, service, and charges competitive,
and thereby to influence new world trade patterns and attract more cargo.<p>

   Most seafaring labor collective bargaining agreements remain in effect through June 1996.  In FY 1995,
many U.S. shipping companies began implementing business plans of selectively reflagging, selling, and
scrapping ships.<p>

   <p>

   The International Organization of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots (MM&amp;P) signed a 57-month labor contract with
Sea-Land Services, Inc. to supply licensed deck officers. The MM&amp;P also completed an agreement with the
Hanseatic Shipping Company of Limasol, Cypress to place U.S. citizen officers on foreign-flag ships owned
by Sea-Land. <p>

   Longshore direct labor costs on the West, East, and Gulf Coasts were at or below planned levels.  Benefit
programs and pay guarantee plans were below projections while labor productivity continues to improve.
However, changing global trade patterns, accompanied by an international awareness of safety and
protection of the environment, are adding to the pressure on ports to reduce costs and search for ways to
streamline operations.  Ports which do not have adequate container storage space or available land to
improve their waterside and landside intermodal infrastructure will find worldwide ship operator alliances
looking elsewhere and developing their own terminal, rail, and truck facilities.  Increasing container traffic will
shift to those ports which can effect container throughput without delaying the containerships.<p>

<p>

   On the West Coast the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILWU) master
agreement with the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA) remains in effect through July 1996.  The ILWU
membership elected a new slate of officers who were installed in July of 1994.  <p>

<p>

   The expanding use of containers for more cargo is resulting in the concentration of cargo handling
activities at fewer and larger ports.  Cargo shifts among ports have created workforce imbalances in an
industry which traditionally relies on casual labor.<p>

<p>

   The East and Gulf Coast divisions of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) master agreement
with the Carriers Container Council remains in effect through October 1996.  The ILA also is concerned with
preserving benefits gained through the years and with agreements entered into by non-union <p>

<b>Annual<a name="Crewing"></a> </b>
<a href="contents.htm#Crewing">Crewing</a><b> Assessment of U.S. Merchant Marines</b><p>

<p>

   Approximately 2,760 mariners would be required to activate all reserve sealift billets not presently manned.
Sealift ships involved include the 92 RRF ships operated by MARAD, 2 hospital ships and 8 Fast Sealift
Ships operated by the Military Sealift Command.<p>

<p>

   During a MARAD-sponsored exercise conducted last summer, the U.S. maritime labor unions reported that
approximately 8,820 active mariners were available to meet reserve sealift needs.  It is anticipated that these
mariners would be sufficient for at least two crew rotations to meet initial manning requirements and to staff
the ships for the first few months of a sealift crisis.<p>

<p>

   In order to meet future crewing demands, it is essential to operate the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and
State maritime academy programs near current levels, promote use of approved industry schools for training
licensed and unlicensed seagoing personnel, and improve access to qualified inactive mariners coupled with
gaining employment rights legislation for service on sealift support vessels activated to serve national
requirements.<p>

   MARAD continues to sharpen its focus on safety and human performance in the maritime industry.  Of
interest are the combined effects of personnel, training, management, organization, operating procedures,
design, construction, and ship and shore relationships, on the safe and efficient operation of vessels.<p>

<p>

   Human factors have been proven to be a contributing cause in about 80 percent of all accidents.  The
human factors aspects of systems are thus the key to achieving reliable, efficient, and competitive marine
transportation that is safe for crew, passengers, and freight while reducing the potential for pollution from
accidents.  This area is of equal concern in the shipbuilding, ship repair, and longshoring industries.<p>

<p>

   MARAD is working with other DOT modal administrations through DOT's Human Factors Coordinating
Committee and "Fatigue Group" to identify common interests, research, and approaches as means to
collectively address operator performance issues.  MARAD also participated on the National Science and
Technology Council Transportation Interagency Coordinating Committee's Subcommittee on Human
Performance in Transportation Systems.  A national multi-agency strategic plan for transportation research
on human factors in transportation has been drafted by the group.<p>

<p>

   The Maritime Advisory Committee for Occupational Safety and Health (MACOSH) was formed by the
Department of Labor in February 1995 to advise the Occupational Safety and Health Administration on
maritime issues.  MARAD is working with the industry in supporting this committee, which is focusing on both
shipbuilding and longshoring issues of standards and safety.<p>

<p>

   Two safety-related research cooperatives with industry also were initiated.  A "Human Factors Cooperative
Research Program with the State and Federal Maritime Academies" originated from a meeting in Fall 1994.
Cooperative agreements were signed in March 1995 formalizing this research effort, which brings the state
and Federal maritime academies together to develop visions for the future and address critical human factors
issues in maritime transportation.<p>

<p>

   The "Vessel Piloting Cooperative Program" is another MARAD initiative and has resulted in a cooperative
agreement with the American Pilots Association.  This program addresses improvements in ship piloting and
vessel navigation systems where the safety of ship operations in harbors and waterways is affected.  The
major effort initiated this fiscal year was the study of the potential utility of portable navigation systems by
pilots.  These portable navigation devices are carried onboard by the pilot and utilize differential global
positioning system signals to provide a highly accurate location in the waterway.  A number of equipment
trials are underway to encourage and ensure the safe and proper implementation of this advanced
technology.

  Secretary of Transportation Federico Pe&ntilde;a unveiled the Maritime Security Act of 1995, the
Administration's proposed maritime revitalization program, on March 10, 1994, following an extensive
review of Federal maritime promotional programs.<p>

  The Maritime Security Program (MSP) proposes limited operating assistance for approximately 50 U.S.-flag liner vessels operating in foreign trade.  The 10-year program would provide annual payments of $2.5
million per vessel for 3 years and $2.0 million thereafter beginning in FY 1996.  Participating carriers would
be required to enroll in an Emergency Preparedness Program established to provide intermodal sealift
support in time of war or national emergency.  The commercial transportation resources to be provided
would include shipping capacity, intermodal equipment, terminal facilities, and management services.<p>

  By the end of FY 1995, authorizing committees in both the House and Senate passed legislative
initiatives similar to that proposed by the Administration.  The House and Senate versions allow for
payments to vessels enrolled in the MSP of $2.3 million per vessel in FY 1996 and $2.1 million for the
remaining nine years.  Contracts awarded during the first year would be renewable, subject to availability
of funds in fiscal years 1997 through 2005. <p>

<p>

  MARAD published its first strategic plan in FY 1995, a comprehensive statement of the mission, goals,
and objectives of the Agency.  The plan categorizes a broad spectrum of Federal responsibilities into
clearly recognizable objectives and provides a focus for future service to the nation. <p>

 <p>

  The MARAD strategic plan supports the broader goals set forth in the Department of Transportation (DOT)
strategic plan as they pertain to maritime affairs and to the maritime elements of the national intermodal
system.  Action plans have been developed for specific activities designed to implement the strategic plan.<p>

<p>

  Measures to implement the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) are closely
associated with strategic planning.  This law is aimed at measuring the effectiveness of Federal programs
against performance goals derived from the strategic planning process.  In 1995, MARAD began to quantify
specific program goals and to formulate appropriate performance measures for major programs.  The GPRA
requires complete implementation in FY 1997.<p>

<p>

  Executive Order 12862, "Setting Customer Service Standards," mandates a customer needs-driven
approach to providing Government services to the public, as does DOT's Strategic Plan.  In 1995,
performance under the pilot Customer Service Plan and brochure for the Federal Ship Financing Program
(Title XI) and customer reactions were evaluated and reported in an update.<p>

<p>

  The National Performance Review (NPR) Customer Service Team, in response to Presidential Memorandum
of March 22, 1995, requested that all proposed customer service plans be completed in FY 1995.  MARAD
responded with plans for MARlinespike (its electronic bulletin board), its National Maritime Resource and
Education Center (NMREC), and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.  (The three new brochures were
printed and distributed in October 1995.)<p>

<p>

  Additionally, MARAD's Office of Acquisition received the Vice President's Hammer Award for sustained
excellence in customer service.  The Office forged an alliance with industry through the Advanced Research
Projects Agency and developed a contract administration review program which improved the overall
effectiveness of the Agency's administration of contracts.<p>

<p>

  The Office of Acquisition also received two Secretarial awards for Best in Class Runnerup.  These awards
were in the categories of maximizing the value of the procurement system and maximizing cost savings.
MARAD continues to meet the President's goals of providing improved customer service and improving
Government efficiency.  <p>

<b><a name="Maritime Subsidy Board"></a>Maritime Subsidy Board</b> (<a name="MSB"></a><a href="contents.htm#MSB">MSB</a>)<p>

<p>

  The Maritime Subsidy Board (MSB), by delegation of the Secretary of Transportation, makes, amends, and
terminates contracts subsidizing the operation of U.S.-flag vessels in the U.S. foreign commerce.  The MSB
may hold public hearings, conducts fact-finding investigations, and compiles and analyzes trade statistics
and cost data to perform its functions. MSB decisions, opinions, orders, rulings, and reports are final unless
the Secretary undertakes review of a decision.<p>

<p>

  The MSB is composed of the Maritime Administrator, who acts as Chairman of the Board, the Deputy
Maritime Administrator, and the Agency's Chief Counsel.  The Secretary of MARAD and of the MSB acts as
an alternate member in the absence of any one of the three permanent MSB members.<p>

   <p>

   The MSB conducted regular meetings and published a number of notices in the <i>Federal Register</i> in FY
1995.<p>

<p>

   The Maritime Administrator and the MSB took a number of administrative actions to help strengthen the
U.S. merchant marine.  Significantly, the MSB authorized the transfer of an unutilized Operating-Differential
Subsidy Agreement (ODSA) to Lachmar for operation of two 126,500 cubic meter liquid natural gas (LNG)
vessels.  The ODSA had been dormant since 1986 but remained valid through the end of 1997.  The MSB's
action immediately placed these two U.S.-flag LNG carriers in a position to compete with foreign-flag vessels
and provide the U.S. with an important resource for maintaining its growing energy requirements.<p>

<p>

  The MSB also approved the extension of subsidizable lives for several liner and bulk vessels.  The liner
vessel EXPORT FREEDOM was approved for payment of operating-differential subsidy (ODS) for operation
5 months beyond its 25 year subsidizable life enabling Farrell Lines, Incorporated to maintain the integrity of
its liner service sailing schedule through the end of its ODSA.  Bulk vessels are eligible for subsidized
operations for 20 years.  MSB extended the subsidizable lives of two tankers of Mormac Marine
Transportation, Inc., the MORMACSTAR and MORMACSUN, for 1 additional year and for 6 months,
respectively, to enable full utilization of the 20-year subsidy contract.  Similarly the MSB acted to extend the
subsidizable lives of the Margate Shipping Co. tankers CORONADO and CHELSEA terminating when their
ODS contracts conclude.  These life extensions will permit the vessels to remain active participants in the
U.S. foreign trade and be available for use in case of national emergency during the extension period.<p>

<a href="contents.htm#Legal">Legal</a><b> Services, Litigation, Regulations, and Legislation<p>

</b><p>

  All legal matters affecting MARAD are the responsibility of the Chief Counsel.<p>

<p>

  On March 22, 1995, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council issued a proposed rulemaking which would
waive the cargo preference laws for subcontracts for commercial items and commercial components.
MARAD submitted comments on May 22, 1995, in opposition to the proposed change, as it would result in a
loss of preference cargoes for U.S. ocean carriers.  Subsequent meetings between the Council, the maritime
industry, shippers, and MARAD resulted in the addition of "firewall" language to the regulation to limit its
impact.  In addition, the effective date of the rule was suspended for nine months to May 1, 1996, in order to
give the maritime industry an opportunity to propose an alternative solution.<p>

<p>

  Intensive discussions were held with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to allow continued sale of
obsolete vessels from the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF).  By statute, MARAD is directed to sell all
obsolete vessels in the NDRF by September 30, 1999, and to transfer 25 percent of the sale proceeds to the
Department of the Interior to help administer the National Maritime Heritage Program (P. L. 103-451).  An
agreement with EPA, which was still being negotiated at year's end, may allow export of two ships as a
demonstration project, after removal of polychlorinated biphenyls in the United States.  In the long term,
MARAD expects to continue the sales of obsolete vessels under the provisions of a new regulation being
developed by EPA to open the borders for exports of waste that comply with the Basel Convention on the
Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal.<p>

  <p>

  A highly significant case involved defending Department of Transportation (DOT) authority to administer the
Capital Construction Fund (CCF) program.  In the Fall of 1993, MARAD learned that the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) was taking certain positions at variance with the provisions of applicable CCF regulations and
contractual agreements.  Meetings over a 2-year period between DOT, IRS, the Department of the Treasury
(Treasury), and MARAD failed to resolve the dispute.  Meanwhile, the Department of Commerce (Commerce)
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration became involved in a separate dispute over the
administration of its CCF program for fishing vessels.  In June 1995, the General Counsels of DOT and
Commerce submitted a joint brief to the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in the Department of Justice (DOJ)
requesting OLC to resolve the jurisdictional dispute with IRS and Treasury.  The matter was pending at
year's end.<p>

<p>

  The Title XI Ship Financing Program saw its workload increase during the fiscal year.  Fourteen actions
guaranteed $437 million worth of commitments on vessel construction and shipyard revitalization projects.
Thirteen closings produced guarantees of $380 million in obligations, including the Agency's first export ship
Financing under P. L. 103-160, a power barge in the Dominican Republic.  Collaborative efforts with the DOJ
continued in four bankruptcy actions involving Title XI companies.<p>

<p>

  In this reporting period, MARAD issued a final rule prescribing the terms and conditions under which the
Agency will convey surplus Federal real property to public entities for use in the development or operation of
a port facility.  MARAD has received numerous applications under these regulations.<p>

<p>

  Appropriations bills for fiscal year 1996 had not been enacted at year's end, but the immediate effect was
cushioned by a Continuing Resolution.<p>

  <p>

  The Agency successfully defended two precedent-setting cases challenging its authority under the
Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (1936 Act).  In one case, the issue was whether a ship which had
major conversion work in a foreign shipyard had lost its U.S.-built vessel status for purposes of participating
in the cargo preference trades, pursuant to sections 901(b)(1) and 901b of the 1936 Act.  MARAD had ruled
that the privilege of participation was lost.  This decision was sustained by the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit.  The second case involved a union challenge to the Maritime Administrator's decision to grant
a waiver under section 804(b) of the 1936 Act to permit a subsidized operator to use six newly built foreign
ships in international trade.  The Administrator's decision was sustained by the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia, but was on appeal at year's end.<p>

<p>

  At the end of the reporting period, over 150 merchant mariner injury claims were still active.  Many stem
from Ready Reserve Force (RRF) operations in Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, but some filings arose
out of RRF participation in Somalia and Haiti and from alleged injuries aboard prepositioned ships on charter
with the Military Sealift Command. <p>

<p>

  The Agency also is a defendant in an asbestos exposure class action.  A total of 260 seamen injury claims
have been filed to date alleging asbestos exposure injuries while working aboard government-chartered
vessels dating back to World War II. <p>

<p>

  MARAD has an ongoing information resources management planning program which supports short- and
long-range mission goals defined in the Agency's Strategic Plan.<p>

<p>

  The continued use of the Government Credit Card Program has proven to be effective in streamlining
procurement processes and expediting delivery of solutions to workstation and network problems.<p>

<p>

  MARAD continues to concentrate technology resources toward strengthening its network infrastructure so
that internal communication can be enhanced, information and data sharing opportunities can be expanded,
and the Federal telecommuting program can be effectively supported.<p>

<p>

  The Agency has successfully incorporated its information systems from a mainframe environment to a
network-based, client-server platform, resulting in increased flexibility in analyzing and utilizing data, more
timely access to information, and a reduction in cost to maintain Agency mission databases.<p>

<p>

  MARAD's ongoing microcomputer application software training program, which is used to empower
employees with the knowledge and skills required to increase the use of technologies, will create a more
effective and productive internal organization.<p>

<p>

  A MARAD Internet Home Page was established as a vehicle for communicating with the maritime industry
and the public.  The Home Page enhances the public's ability to access Government information.  MARAD's
Home Page complements MARlinespike, MARAD's bulletin board.  It can be accessed via direct dial or the
Internet Home Page.  The Address is http://marad.dot.gov.(See <a href="Chap2.htm">Chapters <p>

2 --</a> Shipbuilding and Ship Conversion and <a href="chap8.htm">Chapter 8</a> -- Market Promotion.)<p>

<p>

  The MARAD Electronic Forms Processing Initiative was defined in FY 1995.  Electronic forms software is
expected to automate standard Government forms such as personnel and travel forms, as well as MARAD-specific forms.<p>

<p>

  Full implementation of Electronic Mail Processing was completed.  MARAD offices now can exchange data
and information via the network.  Network access to other Federal agencies and private sector organizations
also is available via Internet telecommunications gateways.<b><p>

  MARAD continued to manage its Occupational Safety and Health Program (OSH) to provide the safest and
healthiest work environments possible.<p>

<p>

  The Agency began the review and consolidation of its OSH directives, which will result in the issuance of an
OSH Management Manual in FY 1996.  <p>

<p>

  Also during FY 1995, MARAD continued its Action Plan for the prevention of asbestos exposures and uses
in MARAD programs.  MARAD's policy is to prohibit or stringently limit personnel exposure to airborne
asbestos fibers.  The Plan is geared to the elimination of asbestos materials from MARAD programs.  It
encompasses the repair or replacement of such materials already installed, modified work procedures, and
employee training.  <p>

<p>

  MARAD's Asbestos Medical Surveillance Program provides preplacement, periodic, and preseparation
medical examinations to designated MARAD employees exposed or potentially exposed to hazardous
substances or conditions.  Employees assigned to MARAD's headquarters, the reserve fleets, the regional
offices, and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy were provided occupational medical examinations during FY
1995.<p>

<p>

  During the fiscal year, MARAD continued to administer its Respiratory Protection Program at its field
installations to safeguard employees against possible work-related airborne hazards.  The program, originally
begun in 1990, provides each employee, as needed, with a respirator approved by the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health, and high efficiency cartridges for protection against a wide range of dust
particles.  Additional types of respirators and filters/cartridges are available to employees, as needed.
Employees at the installations received respirator training, respirator fit testing, and medical clearance for
wearing a respirator.<p>

<p>

  MARAD also administered a Hearing Conservation Program to minimize occupational noise exposure
through initiation of engineering controls, if practical, and by issuing personal protective equipment (ear
protection) for use by employees in high-noise work areas.  The Agency conducts noise exposure level
surveys of work areas and work operations to identify occupational exposure levels.  The Agency also
provides appropriate training and annual audiometric examinations.  <p>

<p>

  MARAD's Safety Shoe Program at the Beaumont, James River, and Suisun Bay National Defense Reserve
Fleets (NDRFs),  continued to provide, at MARAD's expense, protective toe guard and non-slip sole safety
shoes to employees assigned to foot hazardous areas and operations in the performance of their duties.
This program is intended to provide foot protection against falling objects and loss of footing and to reduce
the number of employee injuries and compensation claims.<p>

<p>

  Specialized training was provided to groups of employees at each of the fleets.  Several employees
received training to enable them to give immediate medical care to fellow employees who suffer on-the-job
injuries.  For example, eleven James River Reserve Fleet employees completed a program at the Mary
Immaculate Hospital, Newport News, VA, and were certified by the Commonwealth of Virginia as "Emergency
Medical Services First Responders."<p>

<p>

  Ofe fatality occurred at the James River Reserve Fleet.  Occupational Health and Safety Administration
(OSHA) investigators were called to the scene and MARAD immediately began actions to preclude
recurrence.  A subsequent unannounced inspection by OSHA found all recommendations implemented.<p>

  MARAD's employment totaled 1,066 at the end of FY 1995.  The Agency's percentage of female and
minority employees, as well as their representation in supervisory positions, remained relatively unchanged
from last fiscal year, as did the percentage of handicapped employees.<p>

<p>

  Three upward mobility positions were established in FY 1995 and three employees were promoted to target
positions under previously established upward mobility positions.<p>

<p>

  Sixteen cross-training positions were advertised under  MARAD's Career Enhancement Program and 24
special training announcements were issued.  Seventy employees were approved for tuition assistance
through the MARAD Educational Assistance Program.  Two MARAD employees participated in the U.S.
Office of Personnel Management Executive Potential Program and New Leader Program and one was
selected for the Commerce Science and Technology Fellowship Program.<p>

<p>

  MARAD employees received the Secretary's Silver Medal and three individuals received the Secretary's
Award for Excellence.  One employee received the coveted Lawrence Schneider award from the Department.
In addition, the Office of Acquisition received the Secretary's Award for Excellence in Customer Service.
Further, 17 employees received the Administrator's Bronze Medals and 2 received the <p>

<p>

MARAD EEO Award in recognition of their contributions to the Equal Employment Opportunity Program.<p>

<a><center><h4>AN OVERVIEW OF U.S. PUBLIC PORT INDUSTRY</h4></center></a>
<p>
<b>ECONOMIC IMPACT OF U.S. PORTS</b>
<p>
The ports of the United States play an important role in meeting the 
demands for water transportation service, which is driven by the producers 
and consumers of waterborne cargo--both in foreign and domestic commerce.  
This demand for waterborne cargo initiates a chain of economic activity 
which contributes to the overall national economy.  U.S. ports are a vital 
link in this economic chain.
<p>
This section analyzes the economic impact of the port industry, public 
port capital expenditures, and port users.  The measurement of the direct, 
indirect, and induced effects are shown in terms of employment, personal 
income, business sales, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and taxes.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Port Industry Impacts</b>
<p>
The port industry is defined as any economic activity that is directly 
needed for the movement of waterborne cargo.  The main categories include 
vessel services for pilotage and dockage; trade services for freight 
forwarders, customs brokers, and insurance; cargo handling and storage 
activities; and inland transportation.
<p>
The port industry's impact on the national economy is summarized in Table 1.  
The economic impacts were based on the total domestic and foreign waterborne 
tonnage handled in 1994 by the Nation's deep and shallow draft ports.  The 
benefits shown include direct, indirect, and induced impacts.  The latter 
two impacts result from themultiplier effect of the direct spending 
associated with port activity.  The port industry is responsible for 
generating over 1.6 million jobs.  This equates to the creation of one 
job, nationally, for the movement of every 1,858 metric tons of 
waterborne commerce.  The handling of the Nation's waterborne
commerce was directly and indirectly responsible for $151.3 billion of 
sales revenues. 
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Capital Expenditure Impacts</b>
<p>
Table 2 highlights the national economic impact derived from the public 
port industry's capital expenditure program for the construction and 
modernization of the terminal facilities and
channel dredging.  For 1994, the public port industry's capital 
expenditures total $686.6 million.  The impacts reflect the short, 
but not the long-term benefits.  For example, it includes the 
benefits derived from the construction of a new terminal facility, 
but not the economic gains that result from future terminal use.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Port User Impacts</b>
<p>
Port users are businesses that make significant use of the port 
system for shipping or receiving goods.  The economic impacts shown 
in Table 3 illustrate the importance of waterborne trade
to the national economy.  As an example, about 95 percent by weight  
of all U.S. foreign trade moves through U.S. ports.  The total number 
of jobs generated by port users is 14.3 million, with business 
revenues in excess of $1.4 trillion.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Total Economic Impacts</b>
<p>
Table 4 presents a summary of the overall national economic impact 
of the port industry, capital expenditures, and port users.  
This includes 15.9 million jobs, income of $515.1 billion, and sales in 
excess of $1.6 trillion.  This impact also contributes $783.3 billion 
to the Nation's GDP and $154.3 billion in federal taxes and $55.8 billion 
in state and local taxes.

<p>
Table 5 shows how the total impacts in Table 4 are distributed 
within the economy. Specifically, it depicts which industrial sectors 
of the economy benefit from the U.S. ports total economic activity 
in terms of employment, income, sales, and contribution to Gross Domestic 
Product.  The manufacturing sector continues to be the largest beneficiary 
of port activity across all four impact measures.  The services and retail 
trade sectors are beneficiaries of port activity in terms of employment, 
while services and transportation are among the principal sectors for income.  
The finance and transportation sectors are leaders in sales and
contributors to GNP.

<a><h4>WATERBORNE COMMERCE AT U.S. PORTS<br> 
(Foreign and Domestic Trades)</h4></a>
<p>
For 1994, the waterborne commerce of the United States reached a record 
level of 2 billion metric tons.  The 1994 tonnage increase represents a 
4.1 percent gain over 1993.  Foreign
trade shows growth for the fourth consecutive year with volume exceeding 
the one billion mark with domestic tonnages rising over the 
four-year period despite some slippage in 1993.
Table 7 provides a 40-year summary of the U.S. waterborne trade 
from 1955 to 1994.  This table includes a breakdown of the foreign 
and domestic trade figures by trade segment.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>Domestic Waterborne Trade</b>
<p>
The 1994 domestic waterborne tonnage increased by 2.9 percent to 
996.8 million metric tons. 
Within the domestic trade segment, traffic figures for all elements 
rose over the previous
year's level.  Coastwise trade shows an increase of 1.9 percent to 
251.2 million metric tons
with lakewise traffic increasing by 4.4 percent to 104.1 million metric 
tons.  Internal or inland waterway tonnage, which accounts for 56.2 
percent of the domestic trade, grew by 1.8 percent 
to 560.9 million metric tons rebounding from the flood induced 
decline in 1993.  Table 6 compares the 1995 through 1993 tonnages for 
selected inland waterways.  As shown, the
Mississippi and Ohio rivers and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway 
continue to carry the majority
of the inland waterway traffic.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>Foreign Waterborne Trade</b>
<p>
The Bureau of Census trade data in Table 8 shows that U.S. foreign
trade continued to grow steadily since the decline in 1991.  For 1995, 
traffic totaled 980.1 million metric tons valued at $619.7 billion.  
This represents a 4.5 percent increase in tonnage and a 9.5 percent gain in
dollar value over the previous year.  For the year, imports declined 
by 4.6 percent to 570.6 million metric tons with a value of $391.5 
billion (up 4 percent), while exports rose by 20.5 percent to 409.5 
million metric tons valued at $228.2 billion.
Table 9 provides a comparison of foreign trade by coastal region for 
1995 and 1994.  On a tonnage basis, all coastal regions showed increases 
over 1994 with the North Pacific region
showing the largest gain--18.2 percent.  All regions except the Great 
Lakes had increases in trade value.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>U.S. Waterborne Trade - Commodities and Trading Partners</b>
<p>
Figure 1 depicts the principal 1994 U.S. waterborne trade commodities on 
a tonnage basis. For total trade, petroleum products remains as the 
dominant commodity with over 43 percent
of the market.  Other key commodities include crude materials, such 
as nonmetallic minerals, ore, and forest products (16.7 percent), 
coal (14.2 percent), andfood and farm products (11.6 percent).  Within 
the foreign and domestic trade segments, petroleum remains the leading
commodity with 48.5 percent and 38.4 percent of the respective trades.  
Other significant foreign trade commodities are food and farm 
products (14.6 percent) and crude materials (13.3 percent).  On the 
domestic side, coal and crude materials each account for approximately
20 percent of the domestic sector.  Table 10 provides additional
 commodity information for
total trade and each of the foreign and domestic trade components. 
<p>
Table 11 highlights the leading trading partners by tonnage and value and 
by direction of trade flow for 1995.  The U.S. foreign trade is highly 
concentrated both in terms of tonnage and value.  The top 5 trading 
partners account for approximately 39 percent of the tonnage and 45
percent of the value.  For the top 25 trading partners, the percentages 
grow to 80 percent in both cases.  Venezuela is the leading trading 
partner by tonnage. Japan is the clear leader in all trade areas based 
on value.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Foreign Trade Forecast</b>
<p>
The following table (Table 12) provides a 5-year forecast of U.S. foreign
 trade for the period 1996 to
2000.  The forecast projects a steady growth rate for this trade 
annualized at 3.8 percent.  A
similar growth pattern is expected for both imports and exports.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>U.S. Port Tonnages</b>
<p>
The movement of waterborne commerce through the U.S. port system 
remains highly concentrated.  Table 13 shows that 50 coastal and 
inland ports handled 89.2 percent of the
total waterborne trade in 1994.  The top five ports total 28.3 percent 
and the top 20 account for 63 percent.  The percentage distribution 
(based on tonnage) among the top 50 ports remains consistent with the 
results shown in previous reports.  In 1994, there were 3 ports that
handled over 100 million metric tons.  Even with this high degree of 
concentration, there were 142 ports that handle over 1 million 
metric tons of cargo.  This indicates the broad base on
which the U.S. port system is built.
<p>

Table 14 shows the tonnage distribution for the top 150 ports for 1994.  
The port distribution is categorized for each of the three principal 
trade segments--total, domestic, and foreign. The concentration of 
activity among the leading U.S. containerports is reflected in Table 15. 
The top 25 ports handled 97.3 percent of U.S. foreign container cargo 
based on twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) in 1995.  The first 10 ports 
accounted for 77 percent of the total with 4 west coast ports among 
the top 5.  For 1995, container traffic increased by 7.8 percent--nearly
one million TEUs--over 1994.  The top three ports captured approximately 
42 percent of the 1995 traffic increase.

<h4>MARINE TERMINAL FACILITIES</h4>
<p>
<b>Deep-Draft Seaport and Great Lakes Port Facilities</b>
<p>
Table 16 provides a comparison of the major U.S. seaport facilities 
by coastal region.  As shown, there are a total of 1,940 terminals 
comprising 3,179 berths.  These figures include
both privately and publicly owned facilities.  Overall, privately 
owned facilities account for 75 percent of the deep-draft terminals.  
The distribution of terminals among the four seacoasts is
fairly even with the east coast having the largest share at 31.1 percent. 
The gulf coast follows
at 25.4 percent with the west coast at 24.8 percent, and the Great 
Lakes at 18.7 percent.  The
coastal distribution pattern of berths is similar to that for the 
terminals with the east coast
region accounting for 34.6 percent of the total.

<p>
Table 17 examines distribution of deep-draft facilities at the 
berth level by type of berth and
coastal region.  Berth types are grouped into five general classes. 
Within each class, there are
a number of related single-purpose and multipurpose berth types.
<p>
The general cargo class represents the largest berth segment with 
37.7 percent of the total. 
Within this class, the predominate single use type is general cargo 
with 48.2 percent followed
by container with 12.2 percent.
<p>
The bulk segments are approximately equal in size with dry bulk 
accounting for 22.3 percent
and liquid bulk for 19.8 percent.  The distribution of dry bulk berth 
types shows a fairly wide
distribution pattern among the commodity specific berth types.  On 
the other hand, liquid bulk
is highly concentrated with 83.1 percent of the berths associated 
with the handling of various
types of petroleum products.
<p>
Figure 2 depicts the berth distribution by coastal region for 
general cargo, dry bulk, and liquid
bulk facilities.  For general cargo berths, there is a fairly even
regions with the gulf region leading at 22.6 percent followed by 
the North Atlantic region at
22.1 percent.  In the dry bulk category, the Great Lakes region 
accounts for 38.9 percent of
this berth segment with the gulf coast second at 23.8 percent. 
Liquid bulk facilities are
equally concentrated in the North Atlantic and gulf regions with
29.3 percent, each.  Over half
of the passenger berths nationwide are located in the South and 
North Atlantic regions.
<p>
Figure 3 depicts the mix of berth classes within each coastal region.  
For all regions except the
Great Lakes, the general cargo class is the predominate type.  Dry 
bulk facilities account for
the majority of the Great Lakes facilities.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Inland River and Intracoastal Waterways Port Facilities</b>
<p>
The U.S. inland waterway ports and terminals possess unique 
characteristics that distinguish
them from the coastal seaports.  Aside from shallow water depths of 
14 feet or less, the inland
system is less concentrated geographically and provides almost 
limitless access points to the waterways.  Overall, there are more 
inland facilities locatedoutside traditional port boundaries
than within.  Terminal siting on the waterways is less constrained 
than coastal ports providing greater flexibility to the users 
in determining the location of plants requiring water access.
<p>
Table 18 provides a profile of the terminal facilities located on 
the U.S. inland waterway system, which consists of over 25,000 miles 
of navigable inland rivers and intracoastal waterways.  The information 
is categorized by state and terminal type.  As shown, there are
approximately 1,800 river terminals located in 21 states.  Dry bulk 
facilities account for the majority with 57.9 percent of the terminals.  
Within dry bulk, grain and coal terminals are the
leading types at 26 percent and 22.9 percent, respectively.  Liquid 
bulk terminals are the second largest category comprising 27.1 percent.  
Within this category, petroleum facilities account for 57.1 percent.  
Multipurpose and general cargo terminals account for the balance of
the terminals with 10.9 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively. 
Private ownership of inland waterway facilities is more pronounced 
than the ownership of coastal facilities with 89 percent 
compared to 75 percent.

<h4>CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT AND FUNDING <br>BY U.S. PUBLIC PORTS</h4>
<p>
<b>Capital Expenditures</b>
<p>
For the period from 1946 through 1994, the U.S. public port industry 
invested $14.1 billion in capital improvements to its port facilities.  
This investment covers expenditures for the construction of new 
facilities and the modernization and rehabilitation of existing ones.   
Table 19 summarizes the historical expenditures by coastal region.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Capital Expenditures for 1994</b>
<p>
Table 20 compares the annual expenditures for 1991 through 1994 
broken down by coastal region.  For 1994, total capital expenditures 
amounted to $929.6 million--up 42.2 percent over 1993.  The sharp 
increase resulted from the purchase of a large tract of land for current
and future port development by a South Pacific region port.  The 
South Pacific region led the
nation with $533.9 million (57.4 percent) in capital expenditures 
followed by the South Atlantic region at $124.8 million (13.4 percent) 
and the gulf region at $109.2 million (11.8 percent).
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Capital Expenditures by Facility Type</b>
<p>
Table 21 analyzes the public port industry's capital expenditures 
by type of facility.  The industry's emphasis continues to focus on 
specialized and conventional general cargo facilities.
As shown in the table, specialized general cargo facilities account 
for 34.8 percent of the 1994 expenditures.  The South Pacific region 
totals 63.5 percent of these expenditures with the
South Atlantic region following with 24.5 percent.
<p>
General cargo investment represents 22.8 percent of the total 
expenditures with the gulf region accounting for 34.4 percent followed 
closely by the South Pacific region with 33.4 percent. 
South Pacific region is the focus of the dry bulk expenditures at 
75.6 percent with the South Atlantic region accounting for 54.3 percent 
of the liquid bulk expenditures.  The passenger segment captured 
4.7 percent with the South Atlantic and gulf regions totaling 60.5 percent
and 36 percent of these investments, respectively.  "Other" 
expenditures amount to 7.3
percent with activity centered in Gulf and North Pacific regions.
<p>
Port infrastructure improvements represent 21.1 percent of the 1994 
expenditures.  The off-terminal segment totaled 71.6 percent of the 
infrastructure investments.  The North Atlantic region accounts for 
47.1 percent of the off-terminal expenditures followed by the South Pacific
at 24.9 percent.  The west coast regions' investments account for 
88.1 percent of total on-terminal improvements followed by the gulf 
(8.1 percent) and the east coast (3.8 percent).
Dredging expenditures amounted to 3.4 percent of the total with the 
majority occurring on the east and gulf coasts--South Atlantic 
(32.3 percent), gulf (27.9percent), and North Atlantic (25
percent) regions.
<p>
Expenditures for new construction represent 75 percent of the 1994 
capital expenditures. Specialized general cargo facilities account for 
40.3 percent of the new construction expenditures with conventional 
general cargo at 26.6 percent and infrastructure at 12.3 percent.  
For modernization and rehabilitation (M&R) expenditures, infrastructure 
is the leading category with 43.6 percent.  Other significant M&R 
categories include specialized general cargo (19.9 percent) and 
conventional general cargo (12.1 percent).
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Projected Capital Expenditures for 1995 to 1999</b>
<p>
The public port industry's projected capital expenditures for 1995
through 1999 are summarized in Table 22 by coastal region.  These 
expenditures are forecasted to total $4.6
billion during this 5-year period.
<p>
The South Pacific region remains the center of investment activity 
with proposed expenditures of $2.2 billion (47.2 percent).  Two other 
regions have significant projected investments--the South Atlantic 
at $910.9 million (19.4 percent) and the gulf at $788.1 million 
(16.8 percent).
From a coastwise perspective, the west coast is projecting to invest
over $2.4 billion (51.9 percent) with east coast expenditures 
at $1.2 billion (26.7 percent) and 
the gulf at $788.1 million (16.8 percent).
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>Capital Expenditures by Facility Type</b>
<p>
Table 23 shows the proposed expenditures by type of facility. 
Specialized general cargo
continues as the leading sector with $1.8 billion (38.4 percent) of 
the expenditures.  The South Pacific and South Atlantic regions account 
for 83.1 percent of the proposed expenditures in
this category of facility expenditure--South Pacific with 59.1 percent 
and the South Atlantic with 24 percent.  The North Pacific region is 
projecting expenditures of $139 million (7.7 percent).
<p>
General cargo expenditures account for $775.4 million (16.5percent) of 
the proposed investments with the focus of this activity in the South 
Pacific (33 percent) and gulf (32.5 percent) regions.  Dry and liquid bulk 
facility expenditures represented 6.3 percent of
future investments with dry bulk representing over 97 percent of 
the bulk category.  The gulf
and South Pacific regions account for 88.1 percent of the total 
projected bulk expenditures--gulf with 51 percent and the South 
Pacific with 37.1 percent.  Passenger facility investment is
3.2 percent of the total with the majority of the investment in the 
South Atlantic (60.6 percent) and gulf (32.1 percent) regions.
<p>
Projections for infrastructure investments approach $1 billion 
(20.8 percent) with on-terminal
expenditures accounting for 58 percent of the total.  The South 
Pacific region is projected to
capture 55.7 percent of these investments with the North Atlantic 
region at 15.7 percent and
the South Atlantic at 11.8 percent.  Dredging expenditures 
represent 8.4 percent of the total
with projected expenditures concentrated in the South Pacific 
(49.6 percent) and South Atlantic (23.7 percent) regions.

<b>Funding Sources</b>
<p>
This section describes the financing methods used to fund the 1994 
expenditures and the
proposed methods for the projected 1995-1999 expenditures.  Table 24 
provides a basis for comparing the changes in the primary financing 
methods used by the public port industry. 
The table (Table 24) highlights the shift in financing methods from 
general obligation (GO) bonds to port
revenues that occurred between the 1973-1978 and 1979-1989.  The 
funding pattern in the 1990s remains consistent with this shift.  
During the 1990s, the relative use of "all other" 
methods has increased steadily.  This suggests that ports are 
seeking alternatives or supplements to port revenues through increased 
usage of loans, grants, special trust funds, and
appropriations.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>Funding Sources for 1994</b>
<p>
A comparative summary of financing methods used during the 
1994-1990 period is shown in Table 25.  The combination of port revenues 
and revenue bonds continues to account for half
of all forms of funding.  For the first time in recent years, the 
use of "other" and loan financing methods were among the top three 
sources of funding. There has been a steady
decline in the combined use of port revenues and revenue bonds from 
a high of 88.3 percent in 1988 (not shown in table) to a low of 
50.2 percent in 1994.
<p>
For 1994, port revenues was the principal funding source accounting 
for $309.7 million or 35.3 percent of the public port financing.  
This represents a significant decrease from 1993 when port revenues 
financed 50.6 percent of the expenditures, although the dollar volume
increased by about 4 percent.  "Other" and loans showed sharp 
percentage and dollar volume increases in 1994.  "Other" grew from 10.2 
percent to 20.7 percent, while loans increased
from 0.8 percent to 16 percent.  Revenue bonds declined from 22.8 
percent in 1993 to 14.9 percent in 1994.  The relative usage of GO bonds 
and grants remains largely unchanged from their 1993 levels. 
<p>
Table 26 examines the distribution of 1994 funding sources within 
the coastal regions.  Port revenues are the primary financing method 
in three coastal regions with GO bonds leading in
two regions and revenue bonds, loans, and grants leading in one of 
the remaining regions. 
<p>
The South Pacific region was the principal user of port revenues
with $197.5 million (63.8 percent) followed by the South Atlantic 
region at $40.7million (13.2 percent).  The
South Atlantic region was the primary user of GO bonds with $60.9 
million (67.7 percent).  
<p>
Revenue bonds were the most evenly distributed funding source.  The 
South Pacific region accounted for 58 million (44.4 percent) with 
the non-contiguous at $33.6 million (25.7 percent) and the gulf 
at $28.9 million (22.2 percent).
<p>
The South Pacific region accounted for most of the  loan funding 
with $125.8 million (89.6 percent).  The gulf region was the principal 
grant beneficiary with $10.3 million (42.8 percent).  
The South Pacific region was the primary user of "other"sources with $147.5
million (81.5 percent).
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>Projected Funding Sources for 1995 to 1999</b>
<p>
Table 27 shows the anticipated funding sources for the U.S. public 
port industry's projected 1995-1999 capital expenditure program.  
Revenue bonds and port revenues are the chief 
sources accounting for 71.6 percent of the overall funding. 
Revenue bonds are the primary 
source of funding with 49.1 percent followed by port revenues with 
22.5 percent.  Revenue
bonds are projected to be the leading funding source in three 
coastal regions with port revenues in two regions and GO bonds, loans, 
and grants each leading in one of the remaining regions.
<p>
The South Pacific region is projected to be the primary user of 
port revenues with $308.4
million (30.5%) followed closely by the gulf region with $279.6 
million (27.7 percent).  The South Pacific is also a principal user 
of revenue bonds with $1,624.3 million (73.8 percent). 
The South Atlantic region is the leading user of GO bonds with 
$257.3 million (76.6 percent).
<p>
The South Atlantic region accounts for $48.4 million (48.1 percent) 
of the loan category.  The
gulf region is the projected leader in the use of grants with $82.8 
million (36.8 percent) with
the South Atlantic at $75.5 million (33.6 percent).  The "other" 
funding category is concentrated in the South Pacific with $260.3 million 
(42.5 percent) and the gulf with $244.5 million (36.7 percent).

<h4>FINANCIAL STATUS OF PUBLIC PORTS</h4>
<p>
<b>Income Statement</b>
<p>
Table 28 shows the 1994 consolidated income statement for the U.S. 
public port industry by coastal region.  Appendix B contains the 55 
ports responding to the survey.
The combined net income for the 55 public ports was $190.1 million. 
Of that amount, 38 percent ($71.6 million) came from tax levies and 
direct state and local appropriations. 
<p>
o The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach accounted for 76 percent 
( $144.7 million) of the public port industry's combined net income 
and 96 percent of the South Pacific region's net income.
<p>
o The Gulf ports received the largest portion of the tax levies and 
state and local appropriations with $39 million followed by the 
South Atlantic at $17 million and the North Pacific at $13.5million.
<p>
Table 29 shows the distribution of net income for 1994.  These 
survey results continue to indicate narrow profit margins within 
the public port industry.
<p>
o Over 75 percent of the surveyed ports (43) reported positive net 
income, compared to 67 percent (38 ports) in 1992.  Profits ranged 
from break-even to $92.4 million.
<p>
o Of the 43 ports reporting a profit, 37 percent (16 ports) had net 
incomes below $1 million, while 35 percent (15 ports) reported 
profits between $1 million and $5 million.
<p>
o Twelve ports (22 percent) reported net losses, compared to 19 
(33 percent) in 1992.  Losses ranged from $213,000 to $34.5 million.
<p>
o Among the 12 ports operating at a loss, three (25 percent) had 
net losses of less than $1 million, while seven ports (58 percent) 
fell into the $1 million to $5 million loss range.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Balance Sheet</b>
<p>
Table 30 displays the 1994 U.S. public port consolidated balance 
sheet.  Appendix B lists the 49 public ports responding to AAPA's 
survey. 
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Port Profitability</b>
<p>
The following are the preliminary results of an upcoming MARAD 
report on U.S. public port profitability and self-sufficiency.
<pre><b>
     o    With some exceptions, the study (based on annual port
          finance surveys) finds a steady decline in the average 
          number ofprofitable ports during the ten years studied 
          (1985-1994).  This is not surprising in view of 
          transportation deregulation, vessel sharing agreements, 
          load centering, and the intense competition in pricing 
          port services and facilities.

     o    Despite the declining trend in profitability, in 1994 
          there were more self-sufficient U.S. public ports (31) 
          than those not self-sufficient (25) responding to the 
          port finance surveys. It is estimated that tax receipts 
          and other contributions, grants, and subsidies were 
          sufficient to enable all but four of the responding ports 
          to have a positive cash flow.

     o    In today's economic climate, it is doubtful that there 
          will be any change in the port management philosophy of 
          maximizing economic activity in the region served by the 
          port.

     o    Many ports will continue to follow past practices of 
          (1) cross-subsidizing marine terminal operations, 
          (2) receiving state or local government assistance for  
          developmental costs, and (3) using the local port ad valorem 
          tax base to obtain new funds for the development of new 
          port facilities and, in some cases, for port operations 
          and maintenance expenses.

     o    As long as port operations and facility development can 
          be cross-subsidized, funded by state or local governments, 
          or local tax payers, ports having such financial assistance 
          will continue to compete with other regional ports by 
          pricing their services below what they need to cover port 
          costs and produce a reasonable rate of return.

     o    Each U.S. public port has a state or local constituency. 
          Ports must satisfy their constituents that the economic 
          impact generated by port activities is sufficient to 
          warrant continued legislative or taxpayer support.

     o    Those ports having tax support, or other contributions
          and subsidies, must build and operate facilities to 
          produce a reasonable rate of return in order to justify 
          the continued support by their constituents.

     o    Effective regional marine terminal conference pricing 
          maybe recognized as important, and utilized, if outside 
          financial assistance enjoyed by ports in some regions 
          is reduced or eliminated.

<a><center><b>Department of Energy</b></center></a> 
<a><center><b>May Mandate ISO 14001 for its Contractors</b></center></a> 
<p>
A new law signed by President Clinton in March 1996 could set the
way for the DOE to require ISO 14001 certification of its
suppliers and contractors.   The law could also pave the way for
similar edicts from Department of Defense, The Environmental
Protection Agency and other government agencies.  The National
Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 could require
federal agencies and their respective contractors to implement
and seek third party certification to ISO 14001 in lieu of
agency-specific or departmental standards.
<p>
The Department of Energy has not determined exactly how it will
address the law, but just resently it postponded plans to release
a high-level policy statement signed by Secrearty Hazel O'Leary
that would advise contractors to implement an energy management
system (EMS) such as  ISO 14001 as part of the procurement
process.    DOE is now considering using stronger wording to the
document.
<p>
While the act does not specifically mention ISO 14001, the ISO
9000 quality system standard, or any other voluntary standard, it
does make it clear that federal agenies will use consensus
standards during procurement or whenever possible.   The National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) within the
Departmrnt of Commerce will spearhead implementing the law amonge
federal agencies. 
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a><center><b>The Environmental Protection Agency</b></center></a> 
<p>
The US Environmental Protection Agency has announced plans to
implement a new environmental reporting system called Key
Identifier.  The project will be modeled after the income tax
filing procedure.   The reporting facility would fill out a one
or two page form requiring basic information.  Each individual
compliance report would then become an attachment much like a tax
schedule.
<p>
Each facility included in the database would be assigned an ID
number, contact name, facility name and address, and industry
code.  Eventually the EPA wants to implement a "one-stop" process
by puttingf all of the information about each company on-line. 
This system would give the Environmental Health Safety managers
the ability to access each other's information.  The goal of the
Key Identifiers is to make the information more useful.  The EPA
is calling for comments dealing with how the information should
be gathered in the Key Identifiers project.

     "As we honor the heroes of D-Day and World War II, it is  fitting
      to include among them the  civilian  American  merchant  mariners 
      who sailed in harm's way to supply the needs of our Allied fighting   
      forces...Their sacrifices were crucial to victory, as were the 
      unparalleled efforts of American shipbuilding."

                                -- President William J. Clinton 
                                   May 19, 1994


     In February, 1944 the American merchant ship  SS  AUDACIOUS  with
its crew of civilian seafarers sailed in a  convoy  across  the  North
Atlantic, carrying American troops and supplies to England.

     After discharging its cargo in Liverpool, the ship was  taken  to
an anchorage where large holes were cut between the  cargo  holds  and
explosive charges were set in the double  bottoms  beneath  them.  The
ship sailed to Scotland, where it waited for its mission.

     Then, after about two months, 2,000 armed U.S. Army combat troops
came on board. The ship sailed with American and  British  Navy  ships
and arrived just after midnight on  June  6,  1944,  at  the  Normandy
beachhead.

     As one participant reported,

     "Gunfire filled the air. We  were  positioned  close  to  a  Navy
cruiser that was firing at Normandy beach. Many Navy ships were firing
into and beyond the beach and a large number of Allied planes were  in
the sky as cover protection for the invasion convoy. I saw some planes
(I do not know from which side) explode on fire."

     Landing nets were dropped from  the  deck  of  the  AUDACIOUS  as
military landing craft came alongside and the troops left the ships to
join the invading forces.

     Merchant seamen remained onboard while the ship  was  towed  into
position and final arrangements were made to scuttle  her.  They  left
the ship on a landing craft,  heard  the  explosions  and  watched  it
settle on the bottom.

     With Army gunners onboard, the ship served as both  a  breakwater
and an offshore anti- aircraft gun  platform  to  protect  the  Allied
forces.

     Overall, 32 American merchant ships were  purposefully  sunk  off
the coast of Normandy to support Allied forces. They  were  crewed  by
more than 1,000 civilian seafarers.

     On June 6, 1994, I will have the honor of standing with a  number
of merchant marine war veterans on the deck of an American cargo  ship
which participated in the invasion, but which has survived these  many
years.

     During World War II, the Liberty Ship JEREMIAH  O'BRIEN  operated
in both the  Atlantic  and  Pacific  theaters,  from  Omaha  Beach  to
Calcutta. It had been built in East Portland, Maine, in just 57  days,
part of the incredible American war time shipbuilding  effort.  Today,
the O'BRIEN serves as a memorial  to  all  who  built  and  sailed  on
Liberty ships in service to the nation.

     Our records show that 5,601 cargo ships  were  built  during  the
war. This includes some 2,751  Liberty  Ships  built  by  18  American
shipyards between 1941 and 1945.

     Over a quarter of a million men were trained  to  be  seamen  and
officers of merchant ships.

     Many ships and many lives were lost.  A  total  of  733  American
cargo ships were lost to enemy action and  more  than  6,000  civilian
American seafarers were killed.

     Thousands were injured during attacks. Many were forced  to  wait
aboard lifeboats and rafts, hoping for rescue after their vessels were
lost. Nearly 600 were held as prisoners of war.

     As dangerous  as  D-Day  was,  for  merchant  mariners  the  most
hazardous duty was on the infamous trip across the North  Atlantic  to
the Russian port of Murmansk.

     In the words of the War Shipping  Administration  in  a  post-war
report to President Truman:

     "Our merchant ships ran innumerable gauntlets of air, surface and
submarine attacks ranging from the early danger zones in the  Red  Sea
and the Indian Ocean to mid-Atlantic and the  Mediterranean,  and  the
kamikaze attacks off the islands of the Pacific.  But  none  of  these
combined all elements of danger from man and nature alike, such as did
the Murmansk run  ...  "Through  icy,  fog-bound  seas,  their  flanks
exposed to the dive bombers, surface raiders,  and  submarines  moving
out from the Nazi-held fjords of Norway the slow gray convoys moved --
and kept moving. Nor was their sanctuary  at  their  destination,  for
every hour on the hour, it was said, the  black-cross  planes  of  the
Luftwaffe  blasted  heartbreaking  delays  in  the  grim  business  of
unloading the ships in the ice-cluttered harbor of Murmansk.  Yet  the
cargoes were delivered."

     There were many merchant marine heroes during World War II.

     Joseph Squires was aboard a ship that ran into heavy weather  and
suffered considerable damage. Before repairs could be made,  a  second
storm of greater intensity hit. The vessel began to  sink  and  orders
were given to abandon ship.

     Squires and an able seaman volunteered to  lower  the  lifeboats.
Both had the opportunity to leave the ship but chose to remain  behind
to help their shipmates. Both perished with their vessel.

     Albert Boe, a chief engineer, disregarded his own safety when the
starboard engine on his ship exploded.  He  ordered  the  engine  room
cleared. He successfully cut off the main generators,  preventing  the
chance of an electrical fire, but lost his life in the process.

     There were many other heroes and it will be with great pride that
I will join merchant marine  veterans  of  World  War  II  aboard  the
JEREMIAH O'BRIEN to commemorate the 50th anniversary of D-Day. I  plan
to remind them of the words of Gen. Dwight D.  Eisenhower,  spoken  in
London in 1944:

     "Every man in  this  Allied  Command  is  quick  to  express  his
admiration for the loyalty, courage, and fortitude of the officers and
men of the Merchant Marine. We count upon their efficiency  and  their
utter devotion to duty as we do our own; they have never failed us yet
and in all the struggles yet to come we know that they will  never  be
deterred by any danger, hardship, or privation.

     "When final victory is ours there is no  organization  that  will
share its credit more deservedly than the Merchant Marine."

     Gen. Douglas MacArthur:

     "I wish to commend to  you  the  valor  of  the  merchant  seamen
participating with us in the liberation of the  Philippines.  With  us
they have shared the heaviest  enemy  fire.  On  this  island  I  have
ordered them off their ships and  into  fox  holes  when  their  ships
became untenable targets of attack. At our side they have suffered  in
bloodshed and in death. The caliber of efficiency and the courage they
displayed in their part of the  invasion  of  the  Philippines  marked
their conduct throughout the entire campaign in the southwest  Pacific
area. They have contributed tremendously to our  success.  I  hold  no
branch in higher esteem than the Merchant Marine services."


     Lt. Gen. Alexander A.  Vandegrift,  United  States  Marine  Corps
Commandant:

     "The men and ships of the Merchant Marine  have  participated  in
every landing  operation  by  the  United  States  Marine  Corps  from
Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima -- and we know  they  will  be  at  hand  with
supplies and equipment when American amphibious forces hit the beaches
of Japan itself. On Maritime Day we of the Marine Corps salute the men
of the merchant fleet."

     Fleet Adm. Ernest J. King,  Commander  in  Chief  of  the  United
States navy and Chief of Naval Operations:

     "During the past 3 1/2 years, the Navy has  been  dependent  upon
the Merchant Marine to supply our far-flung fleet and  bases.  Without
this support, the  navy  could  not  have  accomplished  its  mission.
Consequently, it is fitting that the  Merchant  Marine  share  in  our
success as it shared in our trials.

     "The Merchant Marine is a strong bulwark of national  defense  in
peace and war, and a buttress to a sound  national  economy.  A  large
Merchant Marine is not only an important national resource; it is,  in
being, an integral part of the country's armed might  during  time  of
crisis. During World War II, this precept has been proven.

     "As the Merchant Marine returns to its peacetime pursuits, I take
pleasure in expressing the Navy's heartfelt thanks to you and  through
you to  the  officers  and  men  of  the  Merchant  Marine  for  their
magnificent support during World War II. All hands can feel pride of
accomplishment in a job well done.

     "We wish the Merchant Marine every success during the years ahead
and sincerely hope that it remains strong and continues as a vital  an
integral part of our national economy and defense."

           3.        <A NAME="FACT SHEET">FACT SHEET</A>
                   MARITIME DAY, MAY 22, 1945 


     Prepared by Division of Public Relations  of  the  UNITED  STATES
            MARITIME COMMISSION and WAR SHIPPING ADMINISTRATION

     The  following  facts  concerning  the  United  States   Maritime
Commission  and  War  Shipping  Administration  are  for  the  use  of
magazines, newspapers, writers, cartoonists,  speakers,  and  editors.
Though prepared in connection with the  1945  observance  of  Maritime
Day, they may be used at any time.

     The oceangoing ships built by the Maritime Commission since  1937
are 30 to 40 percent larger than those built during the previous war.

     Ten to twelve  months  were  required  in  1917-18  to  build  an
oceangoing ship. Liberty ships, though a third larger, were  built  in
1943 in as little as 16 days in regular production in one of the  most
efficient  yards.  America's   wartime   shipbuilding   capacity   for
oceangoing vessels is 2,000 or more annually,  provided  manpower  and
materials are available.

     A Liberty ship can carry an amount of cargo equal to four  trains
75 cars each.

     Twenty-eight  oceangoing  cargo   ships   were   the   total   of
construction by the Maritime Commission in 1939. Sixty-four times that
many were built in 1943, in addition to more than 100 military vessels
and numerous small craft.

     More than 78 million long tons of cargo left United States  ports
In 1944. About 50 per cent was for the Army, 10 per cent for the Navy,
30 per cent for lend-lease  goods  and  the  remainder  was  essential
civilian cargo,

     Twelve of every 100 American ships taking supplies to  Russia  in
1943 were sunk by enemy action. In March, 1944, the rate of loss  fell
to one in every hundred.

     All-concrete refrigerated barges built by the Maritime Commission
for the Army, each capable of holding a thousand tons of  fresh  meat,
fruit, ice, and ice cream  are  used  as  food  depots  in  the  South
Pacific,

     Fast vessels built by the Maritime Commission  and  converted  to
hospital ships have around a dozen  completely  equipped  wards,  diet
pantry, recreation room, library, sun decks and other facilities of  a
first-class hospital.

     Despite  generally  higher  average  pay   scales   in   Maritime
Commission shipyards over those of the previous war, the average  cost
per deadweight ton in recent years has been $160 compared to  $210  in
1918-1919.

     Though several ships of the American Merchant Marine  in  service
are older, 20 years is considered  the  usual  service  period  of  an
oceangoing vessel.

     Propulsion  machinery  aggregating  more   than   seven   million
horsepower was installed in seagoing merchant ships in 1944. This  was
almost twice the total power of the pre-Pearl Harbor merchant fleet of
the United States.

     The United States Merchant Marine Cadet Corps was established  in
1938, to train young men for  ships'  Officers.  The  Merchant  Marine
Academy to at Kings Point, Long Island, N.Y.

     Five  state  academies,  in  New   York,   Pennsylvania,   Maine,
Massachusetts, and California train young men for  Officer  berths  in
the Merchant Marine. For the duration, they are  partly  supported  by
the War Shipping Administration.

     A shipyard with  50  ways  built  69  riveted  ships  aggregating
517,000 deadweight tons in 1919. In 1943 a 12- way Maritime Commission
yard turned out 205 wended ships totaling 2,150,000 tons.

     United States shipyards, responding to a  Presidential  directive
to build 16 million deadweight tons of shipping in 1943, exceeded  the
goal by 20 per cent, building a total of 19.2 million tons.  Only  1.1
million tons wore built in 1941, and 8.0 million in 1942.

     Strategic  control  of  Allied  shipping   is   vested   in   the
American-British Combined Shipping  Adjustment  Board,  which  directs
operations from Washington and London.

     Control of United Nations ocean shipping after VE-day will remain
with the United Maritime Authority, composed of representatives of the
United States, United Kingdom, Belgium, Greece,  Norway,  Canada,  The
Netherlands and Poland. Its authority extends to six months after  the
fall of Japan.

     The SS AMERICA, largest passenger vessel ever built in the United
States, was put in service in July, 1940, and is now a Navy  transport
under the name USS WEST POINT.

     The first Liberty  ship,  the  PATRICK  HENRY,  was  launched  in
September, 1941, at Baltimore, Md. She is still in  war  service.  The
sponsor was Mrs. Henry A. Wallace, wife of the then Vice President.

     The War Shipping Administration was created by Executive Order in
February, 1942. It has  complete  control  over  United  States  ocean
shipping for the duration of the war.

     The Merchant Marine  Distinguished  Service  Medal,  awarded  for
outstanding acts of heroism by merchant seamen, has been presented  to
more than one hundred men for actions after September 3, 1939.

     The Liberty ship ROBERT E. PEARY, built in a West Coast  shipyard
in the world's record time of one week flat, is now In her third  year
of war service.

     The speed and efficiency  of  the  Maritime  Commission's  C-type
cargo vessels is exemplified by the performance of the SS CRAILENGE, a
C-2 type, which left New York for the Orient 30 days after  the  CROWN
CITY, an older ship. The ships followed the same itinerary and arrived
back in New York on the same day.

     Thirty-six thousand dwelling units have been built  in  congested
shipbuilding  centers  by  the  Maritime  Commission,  at  a  cost  of
$40,000,000. They have been turned over to the control of the National
Housing Agency.

     Services of more than 40 skilled trades are required to  build  a
Liberty ship.

     Every Liberty ship has its own distillation system  to  make  sea
water drinkable.

     More  than  6,000  American  merchant  seamen   have   been   war
casualties; 5492 were dead or missing and 537 were prisoners of war as
of March, 1945.

     There are more than 4,000 merchant vessels under control  of  the
War Shipping Administration for duration of the war.

     Thirty thousand  men  experienced  in  sailing  oceangoing  ships
returned to sea in 1944, recruited  by  the  Recruitment  and  Manning
Organization of the War Shipping Administration.

     The Merchant Marine Cadet Corps  Academy  at  Kings  Point,  Long
Island, N.Y. is on the former estate  of  the  late  Walter  Chrysler,
automobile tycoon.

     The Victory ship, designed by the Maritime Commission,  like  its
predecessor, the Liberty ship, can be built  more  rapidly  than  most
vessels and is 50 per cent faster.

     Expenditures of the Maritime Commission since 1936 for ships  and
shipbuilding facilities will reach about 18 billion dollars by July 1,
1945.

     Forty-one per cent of  all  of  the  oceangoing  shipbuilding  in
United States merchant shipyards in the last 30 years was done in  the
single year of 1943, when 1,896 vessels were built.

     The Maritime Commission in 1937 embarked on a ten-year program to
build 500 cargo ships. The cargo ships built  between  that  time  and
March 1, 1945 include more than 2,500 Liberty ships, about 450  C-type
cargo vessels, 550 oceangoing tankers, 175 Victory cargo ships  and  a
variety of military, coastal, and smaller craft.

     In 1939 the British Empire  controlled  about  one-third  of  the
world's ocean shipping and the United States  about  one-seventh.  The
United States now has more than the rest of the world combined.

     Maritime Day,  May  22,  was  created  by  Congress  in  1933  to
commemorate annually the departure of the SS SAVANNAH  from  Savannah,
Georgia  in  1819  on  the  first  transocean  crossing  using   steam
propulsion.

     Trained personnel of the American Merchant Marine  has  increased
from about 55,000 at Pearl Harbor to 215,000 in March, 1945.

     The Department of Commerce estimates that United  States  foreign
trade after the war may reach to six or seven billion dollars in  each
direction, in terms of 1942 prices.

     Two-thirds of the world's merchant fleet now  files  the  African
flag.

     The Maritime Commission is now devoting a  considerable  part  of
its shipbuilding facilities to special types of combat vessels for use
in the Pacific theater of war.

     The Liberty ship construction program of the Maritime Commission,
after producing more than 2,500 ships in 3.5 years, will end in  1945.
Faster and more Modern vessels  are  now  being  built  in  Commission
yards.

     Women workers were 13 per cent of the 700,000  merchant  shipyard
employees in 1943, and 18 per cent of the 585,000 in October, 1944.

     Despite the tremendous wartime merchant shipping losses  suffered
by the United Nations, they had been replaced in the aggregate  before
the end of 1943 by production in American shipyards.

     To effect delivery of three badly needed cargo vessels that  were
ice-bound in Maritime Commission yards on the Great lakes in  January,
a new $10,000,000 ice breaker was given a successful trial. A  70-foot
path was cut through heavy ice in the Soo Canal and  St.  Marys  river
districts. The three vessels made the trip from Duluth to Chicago with
ease, opening the definite possibility of all-winter traffic  on  that
route.

     The Nation's wartime  merchant  shipbuilding  capacity  has  been
increased considerably by building ocean vessels on the  Great  Lakes.
The only way of getting these large vessels to salt water is  via  the
Chicago drainage canal and Illinois-Mississippi river  system  to  New
Orleans. Superstructures are removed to get under Chicago bridges, and
steel pontoons are attached to the sterns for the river trip, to  lift
them out of shallow water.

     Some yards building Liberty ships have delivered  these  441-foot
vessels in 16 days in regular production.

     The first Liberty ship required 244 days to build. By the end  of
1945, the average building time for all Liberty shipyards was under 40
days.

     The first Liberty ship was named after Patrick  Henry.  The  last
100 have been named for merchant seamen who died in wartime service.

     The first 35 of the  Maritime  Commission's  Victory  ships  were
named for the United Nations.

     One hundred and fourteen Liberty ships carry the names of  women,
eighteen Liberty ships have been named for Negroes.

     The American merchant seaman is a civilian, serving  voluntarily,
and though often under enemy action has no military status.

     There are 121,000 board feet of lumber  in  a  Liberty  ship  and
72,000 square feet of plywood. Merchant  seamen  are  insured  by  the
government in amounts up to $5,000 for death, and  up  to  $7,000  for
disability from war or marine risks. Coverage within these  limits  is
without charge and additional life insurance may be  purchased  up  to
$15,000 at low rates.

     The United States Maritime Service was established  in  1958,  to
provide basic training for merchant seamen and for their upgrading.

     More than 7,500 manufacturers have processed and  shipped  vessel
parts to Maritime Commission shipyards.

     Electric power for Maritime Commission shipyards cost $15,000,000
per year.

     Edwin O'Hara, a United States  Merchant  Marine  Cadet  aboard  a
vessel under enemy attack, rushed to a gun  emplacement  where  a  gun
crew had been killed and single handedly fired the last five available
shells into an Axis surface  raider  before  he  was  killed.  He  was
posthumously awarded the Merchant Marine Distinguished  service  Medal
and a building at the Merchant Marine Academy at King's  Point,  L.I.,
N.Y. is named for him.

     New construction accounts for more than 75 per cent of the  ships
under control of the War Shipping Administration. Almost 20  per  cent
were requisitioned from shipping companies and the rest were  acquired
from foreign nations.

     When control of the Mediterranean was regained by the Allies, the
round-about ship routings by which essential materials from some areas
were brought to America were cut in point of  time  by  about  50  per
cent.

     The  Victory  cargo  vessel  has  two  and  a  half   times   the
refrigeration capacity of the Liberty Ship.

     About half the fast dry cargo vessels built in the last  half  of
1944 and the first part of 1945 are for  ultimate  use  or  the  armed
services, as special combat vessels, troop transports, hospital  ships
and other types.

     Propulsion machinery of the geared turbine  Victory  ships  range
from, 6,000 to 8,500 horsepower and will provide  speeds  up  to  17.5
knots, com-pared to the Liberty's 11 knots.

     One of the breath-taking innovations of the war was  creation  of
artificial harbors on the Normandy coast to permit unloading of troops
and supplies for the invasion of France. Thirty-two obsolete or  badly
damaged vessels were sunk to form breakwaters, buttressed by  concrete
piers constructed especially for the  purpose  in  England  and  towed
across the Channel by tugs. One thousand merchant  seamen  volunteered
for the task. The artificial harbors replaced some of  the  advantages
of the natural facilities destroyed by the Germans and gave the Allies
the choice of landing beaches.

     Tonnage production in United States merchant  shipyards  In  1943
was 67 times that of 1938, 52 times that of 1939,  28  times  that  of
1940, 17 times that of 1941 and 2.3 times that of 1942.

     Giant oceangoing tankers, which in pre-war days required 10 to 12
months for completion, are now built for the  Maritime  Commission  in
three months.

     A Liberty or Victory ship can carry to battle  fronts  440  light
tanks, or 2,840  Jeeps.  A  standard  tanker  built  by  the  Maritime
Commission carries enough -gasoline on one voyage to supply the holder
of an "A" ration book with gas for 35,000 years.  Some  lifeboats  are
now equipped with radio equipment permitting inter-boat  conversation.
It is operable by a hand-powered generator  and  requires  no  special
skill.

     In one month of 1944, dry cargo carried to war zones on decks  of
out-bound tankers equalled the capacity of 55 ships.

     Improved loading methods and speedup  of  turn-around  added  the
equivalent of about 125 ships to the East Coast merchant fleet in each
of the three months before D-day in France.

     In the last half of 1942, construction of dry cargo ship  tonnage
in United States shipyards was three times that lost by  sinkings.  In
the first half of 1943, construction outstripped sinkings 5 to  1  and
in the last half of the year the ratio was 10 to 1

     Kings Point -- the U. S. Merchant Marine Academy and the nation's
newest Federal service academy -- has graduated more than 6,000  young
men as officers for the United States Merchant  Marine.  Kings  Point,
now in its seventh year of operation, is a permanent institution.

     More than 110,000  unlicensed  seamen  for  our  immense  wartime
merchant fleet have been recruited and trained since 1938 by the U. S.
Maritime Service, a unit of  the  Training  Organization  of  the  War
Shipping Administration.

     The United States Merchant Marine has been a participant in every
major, invasion and operation of this war. About  700  merchant  ships
were in the invasions of France.

     Since its establishment in 1938, all  branches  of  the  Training
Organization of the War Shipping Administration have trained more than
160,000 Americans as Officers and seamen to man our  wartime  merchant
fleet.

     Three to five new ships are added each day to America's  Merchant
Marine, calling for 150 to 250 new men daily. Officers and  seamen  to

     SUBJECT: Service Medals for Civilian Merchant Seafarers

     On May 19, 1992, the U.S. Department of Transportation  announced
the availability of  new  medals  for  civilian  merchant  seamen,  in
recognition of their service in World War II, Korea and  Vietnam.  The
medals are being issued to supplement war zone ribbon bars  previously
awarded to civilian mariners who supported the nation's  armed  forces
in these wars.

     Merchant marine medals  approved  for  distribution  to  eligible
merchant mariners for World War II merchant marine service are:

     o Atlantic War  Zone  Medal,  for  mariners  who  served  in  the
Atlantic War Zone including the North Atlantic, South  Atlantic,  Gulf
of Mexico, Caribbean, Barents Sea,  and  the  Greenland  Sea,  between
December 7, 1941 and November 8, 1945. Design:  The  compass  rose  is
traditionally associated with maritime navigation and the superimposed
triangle with duty and service other than in  the  Armed  Forces.  The
eagle symbolizes the United States and freedom.

     o Pacific War Zone Medal, for  merchant  marine  service  in  the
Pacific War Zone, which included the North Pacific, South Pacific, and
the Indian Ocean east of 80 degrees east longitude, during the  period
December 7, 1941, to March 2, 1946. Design: The trident, a  symbol  of
naval prowess, rests upon a  shaft  of  bamboo  denoting  the  Pacific
theatre of operations. The sea scape suggests maritime activities  and
service.

     o Mediterranean-Middle East War Zone  Medal,  for  seafarers  who
served in the zone including the Mediterranean Sea, Red  Sea,  Arabian
Sea, and Indian Ocean west  of  80  degrees  east  longitude,  between
December 7, 1941 and November 8, 1945. Design: The shield  and  anchor
symbolize  a  strong  maritime  service.   The   palms   suggest   the
Mediterranean-Middle East area while denoting victory and achievement.

     o Merchant Marine Defense Medal, honoring civilian seafarers  who
served on merchant vessels between September 8, 1939 and  December  7,
1941. Design: The shield and anchor, from the United  States  Maritime
Service Seal, are superimposed in a ship's wheel, denoting control and
maritime  service.  The  laurel  branches  symbolize  achievement  and
excellence.

     The other new medals are:

     o Korean Service  Medal,  recognizing  service  in  the  American
merchant marine during the Korean Conflict. It is awarded for  service
between June 30, 1950, and September 30, 1953, in waters  adjacent  to
Korea. Design: The tori gate and taeguk are  traditionally  associated
with Korea. The ship's chain alludes to maritime service.

     o Vietnam Service Medal, for maritime  service  between  July  4,
1965, and August 15, 1973, in waters adjacent to Vietnam. Design:  The
dragon is traditionally associated with Vietnam, the shoreline denotes
service in the coastal waters adjacent  to  Vietnam,  and  the  anchor
symbolizes maritime service.

     The previously announced Merchant Marine Expeditionary  Medal  is
authorized for merchant mariners who served on vessels in the  Persian
Gulf in direct support of Operations DESERT SHIELD and  DESERT  STORM.
Design:  The  anchor,  symbolizing  naval  prowess,  is  flanked   and
supported by two seahorses, suggesting maritime service in support  of
the United States Armed Forces.

     The reverse of all new medals is a shield adapted from  the  Seal
of the U.S. Maritime Service.

     According  to  Maritime  Administration  records,   over   12,400
mariners  were  awarded  the  Merchant  Marine  Defense  Bar;  143,000
mariners were awarded the Atlantic War Zone Bar; 111,000  Pacific  War
Zone Bars were distributed;  and,  94,000  bars  for  service  in  the
Mediterranean-Middle East War Zone were presented. In  addition,  over
2,000 mariners received the Korean Service Bar, and 5,000  were  given
the Vietnam Service Bar.

     All of these recipients of the war  zone  bars  are  eligible  to
obtain the new corresponding medal. The immediate families of deceased
mariners are also eligible.

     Some mariners who sailed in these wars never applied for the  war
zone ribbon bars. MARAD's authority to process  applications  for  the
original issuance of war zone bars expired  in  1954.  Under  the  new
authority of  Public  Law  100-324,  enacted  in  1988,  the  Maritime
Administration  may  again  accept  original  applications   for   the
decorations listed above.

     Applicants must provide proper documentation  of  their  merchant
marine service in order to be considered for the  medals.  In  general
such documentation must include the mariner's full name, "Z"  or  book
number, and copies of voyage discharge certificates. Inquiries  should
be directed to the Office  of  Maritime  Labor  &  Training,  Maritime
Administration, Room 7302, 400 7th Street, SW, Washington,  DC  20590,
Attn: Awards.

     To accommodate the expected demand, the Maritime  Administration
has entered into agreements with four companies to supply these medals
and decorations to eligible mariners at cost. Orders  for  the  medals
should be directed to any of the following vendors:

     SUBJECT: U.S. MERCHANT MARINE FLAG

     On May 24,  1994,  Maritime  Administrator  Albert  J.  Herberger
unveiled a flag designed to honor  America's  civilian  seafarers  who
have supported the Nation's armed forces in times of war  and  carried
its commerce in peacetime.

     The commemorative flag was first displayed  at  the  annual  U.S.
Merchant  Marine  Memorial  Service  at  the   Nation's   Capitol   in
Washington, D.C. The event honors the thousands of merchant  seafarers
killed during wartime.

     Key components of the flag's design are an eagle,  perched  on  a
red, white and blue shield, and a fouled anchor. The eagle's wing tips
follow the contour of the U. S. Merchant Marine emblem below the words
"In Peace and War." The year 1775 is also included in  the  design  in
recognition of the early contributions of the U.S. merchant marine  to
the Nation's history.

     "America's  merchant  marine  and  civilian  seafarers  have  put
themselves  at  risk  to  support  our  armed  forces  throughout  our
history," Herberger said. "It is most appropriate that this symbol  of
America's appreciation to  American  merchant  mariners  be  presented
today."

     A total of 733 American cargo ships were  lost  to  enemy  action
during World War II and more than 6,000  civilian  American  seafarers
lost their lives as the result of enemy action.

     The American merchant marine also provided strong support to  the
Nation's armed forces during subsequent conflicts, including those  in
Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf.

     Most recently, the merchant marine and armed forces  combined  in
support of humanitarian efforts to relieve  the  suffering  people  of
Somalia, and to restore democracy in Haiti.

     The flag was designed by the U.S. Army's Institute  of  Heraldry.
It may be purchased through, the National Capital Flag Company,  Inc.,
100 S.  Quaker  Lane,  Alexandria,  Va  22314-4596.  (Contact:  Claude
Haynes, Jr., 703/751-2411 or 1 800/368-3524.)

     UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

     A PROCLAMATION

     Soon, our Nation and much of the world  will  pause  to  remember
events that took place 50 years ago -- events that secured the freedom
we have long enjoyed. As we honor the heroes of D-Day  and  World  War
II, it is fitting to include among them the civilian American merchant
mariners who sailed in harm's way to supply the needs  of  our  Allied
fighting forces. More than 700 cargo ships and  6,000  seafarers  were
lost to enemy action. Their sacrifices were  crucial  to  victory,  as
were the unparalleled efforts of American shipbuilding.

     The world has changed in many ways in the last half century,  but
America remains a maritime Nation. We depend  upon  ocean  vessels  to
transport the vast majority of our  huge  international  trade,  which
continues to expand. We also consistently rely on sea power to support
our military forces.

     As we look to the future, it is vital  to  maintain  an  American
presence in the movement of our international commerce and  to  retain
the  capability  of  building  ships.  During  the  past  year,   this
Administration has proposed, and is implementing programs  to  ensure,
the future of America's maritime industries.

     Last October, we announced a five-step  plan  to  strengthen  the
American shipbuilding industry and to make it more competitive in  the
international market. Our plan promotes innovative, standardized  ship
designs which will reduce costs  through  state-of-the-art  technology
and series production methods.

     In March, we sent the Congress the Maritime  Security  and  Trade
Act of 1994.  Its  enactment  will  ensure  that  United  States  flag
merchant ships will maintain their  role  in  carrying  a  significant
portion of our  vast  trade  and  that  American  ships  and  American
seafarers continue to provide reliable  sealift  support  in  national
emergencies.

     Our Nation is charting a new course reinforcing our heritage as a
great maritime power and  supporting  our  interests  as  the  world's
leading international trader.

     In recognition of the importance of the U.S. Merchant Marine, the
Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has  designated
May 22 of each year as "National  Maritime  Day"  and  authorized  and
requested the President to issue annually a proclamation  calling  for
its appropriate observance.

     NOW THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON,  President  of  the  United
States of America, do  hereby  proclaim  May  22,  1994,  as  National
Maritime Day. I urge the people of the United States to  observe  this
day with appropriate  programs,  ceremonies,  and  activities  and  by
displaying the flag of the United States  at  their  homes  and  other
suitable places. I also request  that  all  ships  sailing  under  the
American flag dress ship on that day.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand  this  nineteenth
day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety  four,
and of the independence of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two
hundred and eighteenth.

Office of War Information

     Enemy action has failed to stop either the PATRICK HENRY  or  the
UNITED  VICTORY,  first-built   Liberty   ship   and   Victory   ship,
respectively and both are still carrying war cargoes, the War Shipping
Administration announced today in  connection  with  the  approach  of
National Maritime Day, May 22. The Liberty is rounding out four  years
of almost continuous service to the fighting front, and the Victory is
on her fifth voyage in little more than a year after her delivery.

     As the pioneer of 2,700 Liberty  ships,  the  PATRICK  HENRY  was
launched at Baltimore, Md., September 27,  1941,  and  delivered  soon
after Pearl  Harbor  Day.  Since  then  she  has  been  in  continuous
operation, traversing 90,000 miles of blue water and carrying  110,000
tons of war cargo. She has traveled  to  all  war  theaters  save  the
Asiatic.

     Numerous attempts have been made from the  air  and  undersea  to
sink the PATRICK HENRY, but all have failed. While on the  convoy  run
to Murmansk, Russia, she was the target of sustained attack by bombers
and U-boat, but escaped. Later, off North Africa, she  suffered  minor
damage from bomb explosions and machine-gun bullets.

     The first voyage of the flagship of the Liberty-ship fleet was to
Aden, in Arabia. thereafter, with occasional return  voyages  to  this
country, she plowed to Mombasa, Durban, Cape Trinidad, Natal and other
African ports; to the Red Sea, the United Kingdom,  North  Russia  and
Casablanca; shuttled the Mediterranean, sailed again to South and East
Africa and back again to the Mediterranean. During the last  year  her
war service has taken her to Kakoradi, West Africa,  Freetown,  Dakar,
Gibraltar, Naples, Leghorn, Oran and not long ago  she  completed  her
eighth voyage home.

     In spite of the wear and tear of the LIBERTY'S arduous  four-year
job and combat  action,  the  PATRICK  HENRY  has  required  no  major
overhauling of hull or machinery.

     The  UNITED  VICTORY,  first  of  the  more  than  300   speedier
war-freighters, that have been built, got her  baptism  of  fire  last
autumn off Peleliu. the master's report says:

     "At about 0320 (3.20  a.m.  EWT)  vessel  was  violently  shaken,
practically lifted out of the water, by an underwater explosion. Spray
of water was observed about 150 yards off No.  2  hatch  on  starboard
side. At about 0440 an odd-looking craft was  observed  crossing  from
starboard to port about 100 yards ahead of a vessel.  At  0450  vessel
was strafed along port side by above mentioned craft with  machine-gun
fire of.45 caliber.

     A number of  shells  pierced  the  hull  and  midship  house.  No
injuries to merchant or Navy gun  drew  nor  to  stevedores  who  were
discharging three hatches. Shortly after sunrise  two  torpedoes  were
observed on the beach, directly abreast of vessel." All of the  UNITED
VICTORY's voyages have been in the Pacific and among her ports of call
have been San Francisco, Pearl Harbor,  Hilo,  Noumea,  Gray's  Harbor
Finschaven,   Langemak,   Manus   Island,   Kassal   roads,   Peleliu,
Guadalcanal,  Russell  Islands,  Tulagi,  Esperito  Santo,  Leyte  and
Ulithi. The PATRICK HENRY was built for the U.S.  Maritime  Commission
in the Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, Baltimore. She  is  operated  for
the WSA by Lykes Bros. Steamship co., Inc., New Orleans.  Her  present
master is Capt. J. H. C. Ward, of south Merchantville, N.J.  the  only
member of her original crew remaining aboard is Chief Engineer Leonard
C. Whaley, of Houston, texas. The UNITED  VICTORY  was  built  in  the
Portland  yard  of  the  Oregon  Shipbuilding  Corporation.  She   was
delivered February 29, 1944, and  is  operated  for  the  WSA  by  the
American President Lines, San Francisco. She is under command of Capt.
Eugene H. Peterson, of Newark, N.J.

Release: 7 AM, EWT, Friday, May 18

     Maritime Day tributes from the leaders of American  armed  forces
to the men of the Merchant Marine for  delivering  the  goods  to  the
battlefronts have  beer  received,  the  War  Shipping  Administration
announced today. sand

     These include statements from General George  C.  Marshall,  U.S.
Army Chief of Staff; Admiral E. J. King, Commander  in  Chief,  United
States  Fleet,  and  Chief  of  Naval  Operations;  General  Dwight  D
Eisenhower, Supreme  Allied  Commander;  Admiral  Chester  W.  Nimitz,
Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet  and  Commander  in  Chief,  Pacific
Ocean Areas; and Lieutenant General Alexander  A.  Vandegrift,  United
States Marine Corps Commandant.

     General Marshall commented on the Merchant Marines  participation
in war:

     "America's Merchant Marine has carried out its war  mission  with
great distinction, and  has  demonstrated  its  ability  to  meet  the
challenge of redeploying our full power to the Pacific."


     The Job being done by the Merchant Marine was praised by  Admiral
King who said:

     The Armed Forces, with the help  of  the  Merchant  Marine,  have
pushed the fighting 5,000 miles west. Together, they'll go the rest of
the way."

     Devotion to duty by  the  men  at  sea  was  praised  by  General
Eisenhower:

     "The officers and men of the Merchant Marine, by  their  devotion
to duty in the face of enemy action, as well as natural dangers of the
sea, have brought us the tools to finish the job.  Their  contribution
to final victory will be long remembered."

     The role played by merchant mariners over the globe was described
by Admiral Nimitz as follows:

     "The United States Merchant Marine played an  important  part  in
the achievement of victory in Europe, and it is destined  to  play  an
even more important role in helping to finish  off  the  Japanese.  To
move great quantities of  war  materials  from  principal  sources  of
supply across 6,000 miles of ocean to battlefronts in the Far East  is
the formidable  task  now  confronting  our  merchant  fleet.  We  are
confident it will be done quickly and efficiently in keeping with  the
high standards of accomplishment set by the Merchant Marine  in  every
war in our history."

     General Vandegrift pointed out how  the  Marine  Corps  has  been
aided in its invasions by the Merchant Marine in saying:

     "The men and ships of the Merchant Marine  have  participated  in
every landing  operation  by  the  United  States  Marine  Corps  from
Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima -- and we know  they  will  be  at  hand  with

     ADVANCE RELEASE Sunday Papers May 20, 1945 Cleared  and  Released
Radio Release: 7 PM, EWT, Saturdays May 19 Office of War Information


     Following the last  official  proclamation  signed  by  the  late
President Franklin Roosevelt, governors of  many  states  have  issued
National Maritime Day, May 22, proclamations or statements. Mayors  of
many cities'have also joined in the observance throughout the land.

     Through these  proclamations  and  statements,  citizens  of  the
United States  have  been  asked  to  join  civic  organizations,  the
shipping industry, and other groups in paying tribute to  the  225,000
men of the American Merchant Marine,  more  than  6,000  of  whom  are
missing, dead, or prisoners of war, and  the  men  and  women  in  the
nation's shipayrds who are toiling to construct the vessels needed  to
carry the war to other shores.

     Churches of all denominations have been asked to devote  part  of
their services on Sunday, May 20, to a proper memorial observance.

     Raymond E. Baldwin, Governor of Connecticut, said:  "In  war  and
peace our Merchant Marine has performed a distinguished service to our
country.  In  the  days  that  will  follow  peace  we  will  need   a
well-developed Merchant Marine."

     Maurice J. Tobin,  Governor  of  Massachusetts,  stated:  "As  we
recall with satisfaction the accomplishments of the past  and  of  the
present, let us look forward with hope to the days of  lasting  peace,
when our maritime strength will again be devoted to the development of
seaborne commerce, upon which will  be  based  in  great  measure  the
future prosperity of our people."

     The Governor of Nevada, E. P. Carville,  proclaimed:  "Since  the
advent of the first voyage our ships, manned  by  courageous  officers
and seamen, have been sailing every ocean.  In  the  present  conflict
thousands of our men and women are using their  best  efforts  in  the
construction of great fleets  of  vessels  that  will  carry  supplies
necessary for victory to every battlefront of the Allied  Nations  and
are contributing to the cause of a lasting peace."

     Morris F. de Castro, Acting Governor of the Virgin Islands of the
United  States  in  the  absence  of  Rexford  Gull  Tugwell,  stated:
"Normally, our Merchant Marine carries  on  our  peaceful  intercourse
with other nations. In times of war, it becomes a fearful  weapon  for
taking our conflict to the homeland of our enemies,  and  far  removed
from our own sacred  shores.  Day  in  and  day  out  these  sea-going
'delivery wagons,' as they have been called, carry to the bettlefronts
the mighty potential we have for  waging  war  and,  in  wake  of  its
desolation, the hundreds of thousands of tons  of  provisions  to  the
Earth's destitute, without which they the must ievitably perish."


     Seven ships used at the War  Shipping  Administration's  training
stations for practical instruction are on exhibit to  the  public,  in
connection with sale of bonds for the Seventh War Loan Drive. The  are
the AMERICAN NAVIGATOR in Boston, AMERICAN SEAMAN in Wahsington, D.C.,
AMERICAN MARINER in New York City,  CAPE  FRIO  in  Brooklyn  Heights,
AMERICAN ENGINEER in Baltimore, AMERICAN SAILIR in  New  Orleans,  and
the AMERICAN SEAFARER IN San Francisco.

     Churches of all denominations were asked to devote part of  their
services ont he Sunday preceding  Maritime  Day  to  prayers  for  the
shipbuilders and merchant seamen, more than 6,000 of whom  have  given
their lives, are missing, or are prisoners of war.

     The observance of Maritime Day will close as  the  sun  recrosses
the 180th Meridan in mid-Pacific where  our  merchant  ships  will  be
moving westward the tools of war for the attack on Japan.

Release: 7 PM, EWT, Sunday, May 20


     World-wide ceremonies will mark the tenth observance of  Maritime
Day on May 22, the United States Maritime Commission announced today.

     Commemorating the first ocean crossing by steam power  126  years
ago, the late President Roosevelt proclaimed the date of  this  year's
observance. State  and  local  government  followed  his  lead.  Civic
organizations, the shipping industry  and  maritime  unions  will  pay
tribute on Tuesday to America's merchant seapower, including  the  men
who build and man the 4,000 vessel fleet.

     The observance of the day will start when  the  sun  crosses  the
international date line  someplace  in  the  Pacific,  where  merchant
ships, war conditions permitting, will "dress ship"  with  the  rising
sun. Other  merchant  ships  round  the  world  will  follow  sit,  if
possible, as the morning such reaches them.

     Along  America's  East  Coast,  the  Maritime  Service   Training
Stations will observe Maritime Day with morning ceremonies.  Later  in
the morning, ship launching ceremonies will be held  in  a  number  of
Maritime Commission shipyards. Other launchings on  the  great  Lakes,
Gulf  and  Pacific  Coasts  will  follow.  by  noontime,   civic   and
organizational  ceremonies  will  start,  continuing  over  a  15-hour
period.

     Guests at luncheons, dinners and afternoon  ceremonies  sponsored
by Propeller Clubs and  civic  organizations  will  hear  speeches  by
Representatives of the United States Maritime commission and  the  War
Shipping Administration, Congressmen and Senators, and  administrative
officials from the U.S.  Merchant  Marine  Cadet  Corps  and  Maritime
Service Training Organizations will speak to these gatherings.

     MARINE.

                       U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION NEWS

   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Friday, March 17,1995

   Contact: John Swank

   Tel.: (202) 366-5807
   

     Secretary of  Transportation  Federico  Pena  has  sent  Congress
legislation that would ensure the continued existence of  an  American
merchant marine.

     "The Clinton  Administration  proposes  to  reform  the  nation's
maritime programs to ensure that the United States  will  continue  to
have a fleet of privately owned  merchant  ships  crewed  by  American
seafarers," Pena said.

     "The American merchant marine provides vital and cost-  effective
national security sealift, and ensures a competitive presence  in  our
own vast commercial trade," Pena added.

     "Unless a maritime bill is enacted this year, in  all  likelihood
our U.S.-flag presence in international trade will vanish, along  with
civilian  sealift  support,  seafaring  jobs  and  the   technological
leadership of our American ship operators."

     Last year, Congress adjourned before completing action on similar
legislation. President Clinton  has  pledged  to  work  with  the  new
Congress to enact legislation to revitalize the merchant marine.

     The Administration's proposed Maritime Security Act of 1995 would
phase out an existing subsidy  program,  revove  restrictions  on  the
foreign  commercial  activities  of  U.S.-flag  merchant   ships   and
encourage the use of modern vessels by U.S.-flag ship operators.

     It would create a  new,  lower-cost,  10-year  Maritime  Security
Program (MSP). Ship operators in the new program would be enrolled  in
an emergency preparedness program established  to  provide  intermodal
sealift support in time of war or national emergency.

     The legislation authorizes payments of up  to  $2.5  million  per
ship for each of the first three years of the program, and up to  $2.0
million per ship per year thereafter.

     Funding  would  be   through   the   annual   authorization   and
appropriations process, rather than through a tonnage fee as  proposed
previously.

     The Administration proposes to fund the program at  $100  million
per year. At that level, up to 50 liner vessels could participate.

     "American ships and American seafarers have always  come  through
for us during times of war or  national  emergency,"  said  Albert  J.
Herberger, the Transportation Department's Maritime Administrator.

     "The Administration's proposal recognizes both the  military  and
economic value of having a fleet of private commercial  vessels  owned
by American citizens,  crewed  by  American  civilian  seafarers,  and
operated  in  compliance  with  American  safety   and   environmental
standards."

<title>Maritime Security Act of 1995</title>
<CENTER><h1>Maritime Security Act of 1995</h></CENTER>
<font size=4><p>

The U.S. House of Representatives on December 6, 1995, approved
the
Administration's proposed Maritime Security Act of 1995, 
H.R. 1350.   Following are statements released by Secretary of
Transportation Federico Pena and Maritime Administrator Albert J.
Herberger.</p>

<center>
<h2>STATEMENT BY SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION FEDERICO PENA</h2>
<h2>                  MARITIME SECURITY ACT OF 1995</h2></center>
<!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->

<p>     I welcome the bipartisan action in the U.S. House of 

Representatives today to help ensure America's future as a 

maritime nation.</p>

<P>     The Maritime Security Act of 1995 will phase out an
existing
subsidy program, deregulate the foreign commercial activities of
U.S.-flag merchant ships and encourage the use of modern vessels
by U.S.-flag ship operators.  </P>
<P>
     The program makes good sense for America strategically and
economically.  It ensures that the world's greatest trading
nation will continue to participate in the ocean transportation
of its international commerce.  It also ensures that U.S.-flag
merchant ships and skilled American civilian seafarers will
continue to be available to support our armed forces, whether in
times of conflict or in support of humanitarian and peacekeeping
efforts.</>

<p>     On behalf of the President, I thank Members of the House
from both sides of the aisle for their cooperation and for their
support for this measure, which truly is in the best interests of
our nation.   In the very near future, we look forward to similar
action in the Senate, and stand ready to work with members of
both parties toward that end.</P>

<h2>STATEMENT BY MARITIME ADMINISTRATOR ALBERT J. HERBERGER
</h2>
<h2>                  MARITIME SECURITY ACT OF 1995</h2></center>
<!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->


<p>     I am pleased to join Secretary Pena in applauding the 

bipartisan vote in the U.S. House of Representatives approving 

the Maritime Security Act of 1995.  I hope the Senate will act 

shortly to send the legislation to the President for his 

signature.</p>

<p>     The United States depends upon oceangoing ships to carry
the
vast majority of our exports and imports.  The House has wisely
acted to maintain a U.S.-flag presence in the transportation of
those cargoes.  U.S.-flag carriers have been the innovators in
developing modern intermodal transportation systems, and our
nation will benefit from their continued leadership.  In
addition, U.S.-flag ships crewed by American merchant mariners
continue to be a cost-effective source of sealift for our armed
forces.</P>

<p>     We in the Maritime Administration and the U.S. Department
of
Transportation look forward to the opportunity to implement this
significant new approach to maritime policy.</P>

<P>The Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration 
(MARAD) maintains cargo ships in the Ready Reserve Force (RRF) to

provide prompt sealift support in the event they are needed for 
the rapid deployment of military forces.  
</P>




<P>When activated, the ships are crewed by skilled civilian
American 
seafarers whose normal jobs are aboard the tankers, grain 
carriers, containerships and other U.S.-flag merchant ships 
serving the nation's domestic and foreign commerce.
</P>



<P>
RRF ships are kept in a high state of readiness, enabling them to

be activated in 4, 5, 10 or 20 days to meet surge military 
sealift requirements in the event of war.
</P>




<P>Currently, there are 93 ships in MARAD's Ready Reserve Force. 

Three others will join the force this year.  MARAD maintains two 
additional ships in similar readiness status.  More than 3,100 
merchant mariners would be required to crew all 98 ships.</P>





<P>The RRF was established by MARAD and the Navy in 1976.
</P>



<H3>Activations</H3>



<P>The first large-scale activation of RRF ships came in support
of 
operations in the Persian Gulf in 1990 and 1991.  On short 
notice, 3,000 civilians seafarers volunteered to crew the 79 RRF 
ships activated.  Merchant mariners who served in the Persian 
Gulf war zone were awarded the Merchant Marine Expeditionary 
Medal.
</P>




<P>In all, U.S.-flag ships with civilian American crews carried 
about 80 percent of the supplies needed by American and Allied 
forces in that conflict.  In addition to RRF ships, this included

U.S.-flag ships in commercial service and commercial ships under 
charter to the military, as well as cargo ships dedicated to 
military service.</P>





<P>In 1992, several RRF ships operated in support of humanitarian

efforts in Somalia.  </P>



                                     
<P>In 1994, 14 RRF ships were activated to support America's
armed 
forces in Haiti.  More than 400 civilian American seafarers were 
required to crew them.  All were activated ahead of schedule, 
with an average activation time of 3.1 days.</P>

<A HREF="OCPArise.JPG">CAPE RISE</A></H3>
                                     


<P>The CAPE RACE and CAPE RISE are roll on-roll off (RO/RO)
vessels 
with stern and side ramps, permitting wheeled vehicles to be 
loaded and discharged without cranes.  Each has a total of 
138,890 square feet of deck space, and four elevators to move 
cargo between decks.  The vessels are 648 feet long (longer than 
two football fields) and 105 feet wide.  Operating draft 
(depending on cargo load) is 25 - 28 feet.</P>





<P>With a service speed of 18 knots, the vessels have an
operating 
range of 21,000 nautical miles.</P>





<P>MARAD maintains the ships in reduced operating status with a 
10-person crews, ready for sailing within four days notice.  They

are operated for MARAD by OMI Ship Management, Inc., and are 
homeported at Moon Engineering Co., Portsmouth, Va.</P>





<P>In deployed operations, these ships are crewed by 28 skilled 
American civilian seafarers belonging to the American Maritime 
Officers union and the Seafarers International Union.
</P>


<H3>Operation QUICK LIFT</H3>



<P>In support of the deployment of NATO's Rapid Reaction Force 
intervention in the Bosnia conflict, President Clinton committed 
the United States to supply sealift capability to move vehicles, 
ammunition and support equipment to Croatia.  Two MARAD RRF 
ships, the CAPE RACE and CAPE DIAMOND (homeported in 
Jacksonville) were called upon to carry NATO's cargo in support 
of Britain's 24th Air Mobile Brigade.</P>





<P>The CAPE RACE and CAPE DIAMOND carried more than 92 percent of

the total cargo transferred from the UK to Croatia.  Included 
were 2,015 military vehicles, 232 containers and 3,629 pallets of

breakbulk cargo.
</P>




<P>Upon completion of the final delivery, the CAPE RACE was
released 
for  return to the United States, stopping briefly at Rota, 
Spain, to pick up a load of U.S. military cargo on its way to 
Norfolk.</P>

to support NATO forces in Bosnia.  </P>





<P>  Berthed in Portsmouth, Va., the CAPE RACE and CAPE RISE were
intended for activation within 4 days' notice but were fully
crewed and underway within 48 hours.
</P>




<P>  All 35 crew members of each ship are American merchant
mariners, civilian seafarers who normally sail U.S.flag cargo
ships carrying domestic and international commerce.</P>




<P>
     "Once again, America's maritime industry and merchant
mariners have answered the call to duty," said Secretary of
Transportation Federico Pe&ntilde;a.  "America's skilled merchant
mariners and the entire maritime industry remain vital to our
national defense, peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts."</P>





<P>  The Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration
(MARAD) owns and maintains ships in the RRF to provide prompt
sealift support in the event they are needed for the rapid
deployment of military forces.</P>





<P>  Maritime Administrator Albert J. Herberger praised the
maritime company which manages the CAPE RACE and CAPE RISE for
MARAD, and the seafaring unions which provided the crews.
</P>




<P>  "These activations demonstrate how government, private
industry and labor can work together to serve the national
interest," he said.
</P>



<P>
     OMI Ship Management, Inc. manages the two ships for MARAD. 
In deployed operations, they are crewed by skilled American
civilian seafarers belonging to the American Maritime Officers
union and the Seafarers International Union.</P>



     

<P>This is the second activation for the CAPE RACE to support
NATO efforts in Bosnia.  It also was activated to carry supplies
to Bosnia this summer, along with the RRF ship CAPE DIAMOND,
normally berthed in Jacksonville.
</P>



<P>
     The RRF was established by MARAD and the Navy in 1976.  The
first large-scale activation of RRF ships came in support of
operations in the Persian Gulf in 1990 and 1991.  That breakout
of 79 ships required 3,000 civilian seafarers to crew them.  RRF
ships also have operated in support of humanitarian operations in
Somalia and in Haiti.</P>

RELATED DEVELOPMENTS</h4></center></a>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
NORTH AMERICAN INTERMODAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
<p>
Trade within the Americas is the fastest growing of all U.S.commerce.  The water mode
complements rail and truck, as well as providing an alternative to 
handle the increased traffic. 
Water transportation is low-cost, safe, and energy efficient and is 
ideally suited to carry
products among Canada, Mexico, and the United States.  Maritime 
ports are also alternatives to relieve the congested land border crossings.  
<p>
The Maritime Administration's (MARAD) research program, the 
Maritime System of the Americas (MSA), provides a comprehensive analysis 
of potential market and technological
opportunities for water transportation in the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico trades.  This
program focuses on the commercial waterbridge linking Canada, the 
mid-United States, and Mexico via the St. Lawrence Seaway, the Great Lakes, 
the Mississippi River System, the
Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and 
the Gulf of Mexico. 
Through the Caribbean Sea, this waterbridge extends to eastern 
Central America, the northern
rim of South America, and the Caribbean Islands.
<p>
Phase I of the MSA study addresses the potential for small river/ocean vessels on the
waterways and rivers linking the central portions of the U.S. andCanada to Mexico.  The study
determines that such vessels are viable in niche markets carrying general cargoes, containers,
and some bulk commodities between the South Central United States and Eastern Mexico.
<p>
Phases II and III of MSA research examines the potential for conventional and short sea
shipping, as well as intermodal operations in the MSA region.  The analyses suggest that the
intermodal movement of domestic trailers using a roll-on/roll-off (ro/ro) ferry type vessel has
cost and logistical advantages over other transport options in serving the eastern/central regions
of both the U.S. and Mexico.
<p>
Phase IV of MSA consists of two components.  First, outreach meetings to discuss research
groups, shippers, and other maritime interests.  The meetings were held in Houston, TX;
Tampa, FL; Memphis, TN; Baton Rouge, LA; Jackson, MS; Birmingham, AL; and Merida,
Mexico.  
<p>
The second component includes research and analysis of cargo movements with
origins/destinations in the northern portion of the MSA waterway system.  This includes
investigation and use of existing or new vessels capable of navigating the Great Lakes, St.
Lawrence River, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Upper Mississippi River and its tributaries, and the
New York State Barge Canal.  Release of this study is expected in Fall 1996.
<p>
The Maritime System of the Americas is truly a North American intermodal transportation
system, linking cargo origins and destinations to the waterways by rail and/or truck.  It is a
north/south transportation corridor that provides shippers with an opportunity to move their
international cargoes via water as a complement to current service.

GREAT LAKES  - NEW SHIPPING VENTURES
<p>     
<b>Expanded Use of River Barges in Lake Michigan</b>
<p>
The expanded use of river barges with U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Great Lakes Limited
Load-Line designation created new trades in commodities, such as decorative landscape stone,
cotton seed, lumber, scrap iron, road salt and grain.  Since the success of the Milwaukee barge
movement, other ports on Lake Michigan have requested similar USCG barge approval. 
During the last three years, the use of river barges between Chicago and Milwaukee, WI,
generated over 400,000 tons of traffic.  The USCG recently (Spring 96) approved barge
operations between Chicago and Benton Harbor/St. Joseph, MI. Applications for the Michigan
Ports of Muskegon, Holland, and Grand Haven were approved in August 1996.  The barge
approvals have provided new opportunities for small shallow-draft port operators who can now
take advantage of the barge industry's low cost transportation and environmental benefits.  The
Secretary of Transportation has given Michigan ports his support in this effort with safety of
<p>

<b>Lakes Vessel to Barge Transfer Operation</b>
<p>
During the 1995-1996 Great Lakes shipping season, several shipments were made using
existing Lakes vessels in a new cargo transfer operation.  Lakes vessels with self-unloader
booms transferred dry bulk cargoes directly to river barges off-shore near the Port of Chicago. 
Both U.S. and Canadian self-unloaders participated in the new transfer operation. 
Commodities, such as grain, fertilizer and salt were moved from various Great Lakes ports and
loaded into barges at Chicago for shipment to destinations throughout the U.S. inland waterway
system.  The Calumet Safety Committee and the USCG Marine Safety Office in Chicago
cooperated in developing safe procedures for transferring cargo in the busy waterway.  This
new approach reduced transportation costs that in the past included unloading to shore and
reloading the barge from the shore-side facility.
<p>

<b>New U.S.-Flag Service in the Great Lakes</b>
<p>
During the 1995 Great Lakes shipping season, the U.S.-flag ITB (integrated tug barge) DIXIE
COMMANDER tank vessel made three trips into Toledo, OH, with 
liquid urea fertilizer from
Mexico.  Outbound voyages with liquid calcium chloride and other liquids from Ludington,
MI, and Canadian ports to the U.S. gulf coast provided a well balanced new trade for the
vessel.  This was the first incident of recent record for a U.S.-flag vessel combining an import
foreign trade movement with a U.S. domestic trade movement in the same voyage.  The Saint
Lawrence Seaway Authority/St. Lawrence Development Corporation gave the vessel reduced
incentive tolls since this was a new trade opportunity into the region.  Plans call for the ITB
DIXIE COMMANDER to return for the 1996 shipping season.  Dixie Carriers may introduce a
second ITB capable of handing dry bulk, container and general cargo for the 1996 season.
<p>

<p>
CARGO THEFT
<p>
Cargo theft has become a serious problem in the port cities and hinterland areas throughout the
works cooperatively with government, has estimated that losses due to cargo theft in the United
States exceed $10 billion annually.  Cargo theft is being committed by highly organized and
sophisticated criminal groups with the ability to export stolen merchandise out of the U.S. to
countries where the demand for Western consumer goods is high.

The average value of a single cargo theft loss now stands at about $500,000.  The insurance
industry has begun to require more accountability for cargo security from firms shipping and
transporting cargo.  The insurance industry has forecast increases in premiums and difficulty in
obtaining insurance for those firms that do not reduce losses by deterring the opportunities for
criminal exploitation.

The absence of consistent cargo theft reporting and record keeping procedures has been an
obstacle over the years to marshaling effective strategies against this crime.  However, the
transportation, shipping, and insurance industries are beginning to work cooperatively with
Federal, state, and local government agencies to document the scope of the cargo theft problem
and implement strategies to reduce losses.  Efforts are focused on the full range of expected
outcomes, including prevention, deterrence, cargo recovery, criminal apprehension, and
successful prosecution.  As an example of this cooperation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
and the NCSC cosponsored the Interstate Theft and Strategic Initiatives Cargo Theft
Conference in Miami (April 1996).  The Maritime Administration is working cooperatively
with industry and other Federal agencies to counter the problem of cargo theft occurring during
intermodal phases of transport. 
<p>

<p>
NATIONAL DEFENSE - NATIONAL PORT READINESS NETWORK
<p>
The National Port Readiness Network was formed in 1984 and wascomposed of six Federal
agencies involved in port activities during a military deployment. The number of agencies in
the Network has grown over time and it is now composed of nine agencies.  In addition to the
Maritime Administration, the current members are HQ, Forces Command (FORSCOM), U.S.
Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), U.S. Army Military Traffic 
Command (MTMC), U.S. Navy Military Sealift Command (MSC), U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG),  U.S. Naval Control of Shipping
Organization (NCSORG), and U.S. Maritime Defense Zone (MDZ).
<p>
The chairmanship of the National Port Readiness Network Steering Group and the National
Port Readiness Network Working Group rotates on an annual basis among the member
agencies.  MARAD is the current chair of these groups.  As the Chair, MARAD has the lead in
the creation of new initiatives to ensure port readiness.  Improved communication between
Network members, ports and terminal operators is being addressed. Training needs are being
examined in light of the awareness of on-going personnel reassignments and changes.  
<p>
For the past several years, selected ports which the military plans to use during a deployment
have been issued planning orders.  These are non-binding letters of intent which provide the
ports with deployment information for planning purposes.  Planning orders are now issued for
only a one year period in another effort to encourage communication among ports, terminal
operators, and the military. The Network instituted a program of semi-annual visits to ports
with planning orders to improve the deployment process.  Efforts are being made to have ports
participate in FORSCOM's Key Asset Protection Program.
<p>
The Network is encouraging the exchange of deployment data between the military personnel
responsible for the logistics of a unit move and the unit itself. This information can be used to
identify and discuss lift requirements, port capabilities and commercial disruption impacts.  The
identification of industrial property near ports which could be used as cargo staging areas is
being examined as a means to alleviate potential problems associated with surge movements of
military cargo through commercial port facilities.  Other initiatives include increased emphasis
and support of local Port Readiness Committees, enhancements inport readiness exercises, and
the updating of various publications.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

SUPPORT OF DEFENSE INTERMODAL TRANSPORTATION
<p>
MARAD is required by law to act as the intermediary between the 
military on container issues in connection with deployment of U.S.Armed Forces, or other
national defense requirements.  Under 46 CFR 340, the Maritime Administrator is to identify
container and/or chassis suppliers that can furnish DOD with the required number of containers
and/or chassis needed for a contingency and to minimize the disruption of the commercial
sector.
<p>
The commercial transportation sector invests in new equipment and technology to enhance its
systems to become more competitive and reduce overall costs. These transportation advantages
can be put to use in the defense sector.  With recent changes in the national defense strategy
and the downsizing of the U.S. military establishment, an increased emphasis is placed on the
need for a more effective deployment of forces in times of national emergency using the
commercial intermodal transportation system.  The benefits that the military can derive from
containerization and intermodal transportation are the same as in the commercial sector: lower 
costs, decreased transit times and lower rates of damage.  The common thread is the use of the
intermodal freight container.  This package has the same standards worldwide, and it is
apparent that its use will continue and increase in the foreseeable future.
<p>
Various means are being used to explore ways for the military to take advantage of the
commercial intermodal system.  MARAD has increased its coordination with the commercial
and military sectors to explore ways that the existing system can be used for military purposes. 
Programs such the United States Transportation Command's Center for the Commercial
Deployment of Transportation Technology are reviewing existing and emerging technologies
that may be of benefit to military deployments.  MARAD's Voluntary Intermodal Sealift
Agreement has been established to prepare the commercial shipping industry for possible future
deployment contingencies.  The Cargo Handling Cooperative Program assists member
companies to explore ways to increase productivity and enhance competitiveness.
<p>
New directives within the Department of Defense reinforce the concepts of intermodalism and
containerization.  A new Joint Chiefs of Staff publication 
and Procedures for Use of Intermodal Containers in Joint Operations, states "Intermodal
transportation that is flexible and fast is used by the Department of Defense to prepare, deploy,
support, and sustain forces assigned or committed to  a theater of operations or objective area." 
Other directives within DOD require specific minimum containerization requirements for
specific military cargoes.
<p>
<hr>
<p>

PORT FACILITY CONVEYANCE PROGRAM
<p>
The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160) authorizes
the Secretary of Transportation to convey needed surplus Federal real property to non-Federal
public entities without monetary compensation for use in the development or operation of a port
facility.  This authority was subsequently delegated to the Maritime Administration (MARAD).
<p>
The program requires MARAD to receive, evaluate, and approve applications after consultation
with the Departments of Labor and Commerce and recommend assignment of surplus property
to MARAD for final conveyance to an applicant.  Final assignment decisions are made by a
disposal agency--military service or General Services Administration.  All conveyances are in
perpetuity by a MARAD Quitclaim Deed which contains the terms, conditions, reservations
and restrictions of the conveyance.
<p>
MARAD is responsible for enforcing compliance with the provisions in the deed.  The program
is designed to create jobs, encourage economic development and assure adequate port capacity
to meet future trade and national defense needs.

implications for every community, student, and educator in Vermont,
<A
HREF="http://dol.state.vt.us/gopher_root3/000000/supct/a-e/brigham_v_state.96-502">the
Vermont Supreme Court has ruled</A> that the state's current system of funding
education is unconstitutional.</P>
<P><B><I>This message for Vermont-NEA local Association leaders was delivered
on February 11...</I></B></P>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Vermont Supreme Court decision mandates BIG changes
</FONT></H2>
<P>February 5th was a red letter day for local property tax payers whose burden
has been unfair and for kids in towns without the wealth to equal what's
available in other communities for education. The Vermont Supreme Court ruled
last Wednesday that the current system for funding education in Vermont is
unconstitutional. The decision is momentous for two reasons: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>It establishes a right to &quot;equal educational opportunity&quot; for
every child in Vermont.</LI>
<LI>It ends immediately the decades-long debate over property tax reform.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Vermont-NEA has fought long and hard for both equal educational opportunity
and property tax reform. Now we must catch our collective breath and help shape
the very dramatic changes to come.
</P>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Equality AND Quality</FONT>
</H2>
<P>Equal educational opportunity must not be perverted to result in equal but
mediocre education. Rather, Vermonters who care about quality education must
work to ensure that the State of Vermont achieves equity in spending by
(finally!) generating adequate revenues to support the system.  It would be
wrong -- and educationally unsound -- to bring up spending in some districts
while undermining other districts. Instead of robbing Peter to pay Paul, the
legislature must understand that new revenues are necessary. A fair statewide
property tax, a tiered income tax, and other taxes all must be on the table for
consideration. 
</P>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Local control and participation
</FONT></H2>
<P>Speaking of pitfalls: A major strength of Vermont school systems which we
must strive to preserve is local community control and participation. Each one
of us who has worked to pass a school budget or save a school program
understands that people care about a school that BELONGS to them. If decisions
about local education and how to spend school funds are made in Montpelier, the
special support that many schools enjoy may well evaporate. </P>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Statewide Teachers' Contract?</FONT>
</H2>
<P>The world is different now. The Supreme Court says that it is the state's
responsibility to guarantee substantially equal educational spending among local
communities. A so-called statewide teachers' contract -- like the one we fought
against three years ago -- has been mentioned in the press, but now may be
irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>A new system mandated by the Supreme Court could give the state
responsibility for all education funding, not just for the funds for teachers'
salaries. The state may well decide how much schools can spend in total. 
</P>
<P>How might the state determine how much to allocate to school districts? The
simplest way to do this might be to allocate funds on a per pupil basis. This
could guarantee spending equity while preserving local community decision
making. </P>

<TITLE>Vermont-NEA History</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#C0DCC0">
<H1><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Vermont-NEA origins and milestones
</FONT></H1>
<P>Thanks to the influence of Horace Mann, the late 1840s saw Vermont's
isolated local schools emerge as a statewide system backed by a state encouraged
educational policy.
</P>
<P>In 1850, Hiram Orcutt of Thetford, writing in the <I>Vermont Chronicle</I>,
called for the formation of a State Teachers' Association. On October 16, 1850,
teachers and friends of education met in Montpelier to organize a State
Association of Teachers and &quot;to discuss and adopt such Resolutions as
express their views upon the subject of Education in Vermont.&quot;
</P>
<P>The new organization met for the first time in Waterbury on August 26, 27,
and 28, 1851. The first Association president, Reverend Worthington Smith,
president of the University of Vermont, emphasized the need for a unified system
of education within the state. The Association resolved to publish a journal
devoted to matters of interest to educators.</P>
<P>By 1859 the Journal was being published for an Association of 400 members,
260 of them teachers. Women were allowed only honorary membership, although they
paid the full membership fee.</P>
<P>In 1863 the passive female members became active, and began to serve on
committees. But it was 1871 before the first woman teacher addressed a
convention, and 1914 before the Association had its first woman president &#151;
<A HREF="hist-1.htm">Caroline S. Woodruff</A>, who later became president of
the National Education Association.
</P>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Educational Reform</FONT></H2>
<P>Most of Vermont's early educational reform was first proposed by, or
received its first organized support from the Vermont Teachers' Association.
Association accomplishments include the establishment of a state board of
education, the enactment of a compulsory school attendance law, permissive
legislation for the establishment of graded schools, and the inauguration of a
system of state aid to public schools. </P>
<P>The annual convention put its weight behind other issues as well: the 1851
convention listened to an address on &quot;The Liberal Education of Females&quot;;
the 1852 convention not only resolved to see the establishment of Teachers' and
Parents' Associations in each county, but also went on record as recommending
single desks as preferable to any other; the 1862 convention advocated the study
of  Physical Culture in the schools. </P>
<P>During the 1920s, the Association worked for two goals of great importance:
the program for the standardization of rural schools and the campaign against
illiteracy. </P>
<P>On August 15, 1960 the Association resolved &quot;That when qualifications
are equal, and when equal services are rendered, male and female teachers should
receive equal compensation.&quot; </P>
<P>Further milestones in Vermont-NEA (a.k.a. Vermont Teachers' Association,
then Vermont Education Association)  history include: the passage of the
Supervisory Law in 1906; the establishment of the Vermont Teachers' Retirement
Fund Association in 1910; the first voluntary Teachers' Retirement Law in 1919;
the compulsory Teachers' Retirement Law in 1947; the Sick Leave Benefit of 1957;
and the first mandated minimum Salary Schedule Law, including increments for
experience, which was passed in the same year; a Fair Dismissal Law in 1963; the
Collective Bargaining Law for Teachers in 1969; the first <A HREF="hist-6.htm">teachers'
strike</A> in 1978; and the defeat of the proposal for a statewide teachers'
contract in 1994.
</P>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Big Changes for the Association</FONT></H2>
<P>Since total membership activity in conducting the business of the
Association became impossible as the membership grew, a Representative Assembly
was established and convened for the first time in 1947. Each local Association
was represented. Vermont-NEA has since achieved a steady growth in membership,
and the Association's effectiveness and influence has increased. </P>
<P>In 1961 the Association moved from cramped rented quarters to its own
building at 5 Baldwin Street in Montpelier. In 1967, when the State of Vermont
purchased the Baldwin Street property, the Association bought the Brock house at
138 Main Street for an educational center. The Vermont Congress of Parents and
Teachers maintained its office in the VEA Center.</P>
<P>The years at the Main Street Headquarters saw big changes for the
Association. In 1972, the Vermont Education Association approved unification
with the National Education Association, agreeing that educators must join all
three levels of the Association: local, state and national. VEA joined  NEA's
UniServ service program, adding UniServ Directors to the staff: two in 1972, a
third in 1974, a fourth in 1976, a fifth in 1979, and a sixth in 1989. A
communications director was added to the staff in 1976, a general counsel in
1979. </P>
<P>In 1978, the position of full-time, paid, elected president was approved by
the VEA Representative Assembly. <A HREF="hist-2.htm">Association presidents
since 1851</A> were elected and had served as part time volunteers. </P>
<P>The Association voted at its Corporation Meeting in 1982 to change its name
from Vermont Education Association to Vermont-National Education Association.
</P>
<P>Vermont-NEA sold the Brock House in 1980 and moved to rented office space in
the old East State Street Elementary School. The Association built its current
headquarters building at 10 Wheelock Street in Montpelier in 1985. Association
membership increased to its current 8,500, including Education Support Staff. An
organizer joined the staff in 1986, an associate general counsel in 1989, and a
director of benefit programs in 1993. </P>
<P>Beginning in 1960, annual Leadership Conferences were inaugurated during
August bringing together local Association leaders from all parts of the state.
In addition, conferences are held to address member interests in contract
negotiations, grievance, instruction, professional development, community
relations, legislation, education issues, and leadership. Schools close for two
days each October for the Vermont-NEA Educators' Convention, a meeting where
teachers and school support staff collaborate, get professional training, and
keep current on education materials and technology. </P>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Association Governance and Leadership</FONT></H2>
<P>Bylaws adopted in 1966 provide for an annual meeting of the Representative
Assembly each spring, as well as delegate meetings each fall. The bylaws also
specify that directors be elected from the UniServ Districts. Standing
committees cover areas of membership concern: Teaching and Learning; In-Service;
Elections; Partnerships &amp; Sponsorships; Human and Civil Rights; Convention
Planning; Professional Security; Publishing; Resolutions; and Bylaws. </P>
<P>The first Association executive secretary, Joseph Wiggin, was appointed in
1949. He was succeeded by Erwin Coons in 1956. Weston A. Cate, Jr.served as
executive secretary from 1959 till 1974. Charles Ochmanski served as executive
director from 1974 through 1980. Richard D. Lang has held the position since.

<H1><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">We have incredibly important work to do</FONT></B></H1>
<P><B>By Angelo J. Dorta, Vermont-NEA President</B></P>
<P>There is something undeniably exciting, invigorating, and even magical about
the start of a new school year. Everyone feels it: students, educators, parents,
citizens. The reminders and symbols are everywhere. Department store aisles
overflow with school supplies and gleaming lunchboxes sporting the most popular
cartoon or movie characters and real-life young celebrities. Shoppers for school
clothes inevitably debate fashionable versus practical, costly versus reasonably
priced, &quot;I'm not gonna' wear it!&quot; versus &quot;You'll wear it or else!&quot;
Yellow school buses again lead parades of slow-moving traffic heading to work. 
</P>
<P>The human spirit of hope, of renewed opportunity, perhaps even a bit of
personal redemption is what powers our eager anticipation of school in late
August. There aren't many experiences in this life that allow individuals to
start afresh, to make a new beginning. Thankfully, the school experience is one
of them! 
</P>
<P>In a very real way, everyone connected with schools can begin the first day
with a clean slate. The shackles of the past can be broken. Former failings,
transgressions, and deficiencies can be forgotten and forgiven. Great
possibilities exist for all if we can adopt this mindset. Every boy and girl in
your class now can be a star student regardless of last year's academic or
behavioral problems. Despite past power struggles and personality conflicts,
every child now can be that special student and young friend long remembered
even after your retirement. The company president, the policeman or fireman, the
professional artist, the plumber or travel agent, the teacher, principal, or
instructional assistant of tomorrow all are seated in your class. What is
required at this moment is only the allowance of a new beginning. 
</P>
<P>Every lesson plan, instructional activity, and unit of study now potentially
abounds with student learning and  motivation, with those precious &quot;teachable
moments&quot; that later in the year can seem as rare as black pearls. Perhaps
the 1996-97 school year will yield improved relations with a troublesome
colleague, or deeper trust and camaraderie within your teacher-team, or even
smoother contract negotiations and beneficial media reportage. 
</P>
<P>Why do I advocate such positive thinking and optimism? Two reasons, the
first a highly personal one: thirty five or forty years ago, I was that
elementary and middle-grade student who desperately wanted a clean slate to
begin the year and a caring relationship with my teacher. My home environment
was economically and emotionally difficult. I needed to know that my teacher
valued me as a person, that I could learn and achieve in the classroom, and that
I had true friends among my peers. Fortunately for me, I had a succession of
educators and other school employees who provided such support. A happy and
productive school life kept me going when troubles were brewing at home. 
</P>
<P>The second reason is a practical one that -- for many of us -- acknowledges
a sad reality about our jobs: there is a part of ourselves that resists and even
dreads our return to the classroom. It is natural and really has nothing to do
with our students, nor with the practice of teaching itself, nor with our
co-workers and contracts. Simply put, working in schools in the 1990's takes a
tremendous toll on our personal lives and well-being. 
</P>
<P>Many of us grow increasingly weary and emotionally drained as planning and
corrections paperwork mount, as the serious student discipline problems
dramatically surface, as the challenges of learning dysfunction and family
instability become more recognizable and severe within our classrooms while the
support services and resources dwindle. We are burdened by those well-known
impossible-to-please citizens in our communities, by the reporters, legislators,
and candidates who want to criticize directly or obliquely our best efforts, by
the constant negativity of some colleagues in our own building, by the strains
of working together within a SYSTEM -- teachers, students, administrators,
support staff, parents, taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>This tangible downside to public school work, this personal toll, must be
recognized and resisted rather than ignored. Acknowledging its existence and its
impact helps to contain it and to compensate for it. That's why every school day
must be a new day and a fresh beginning for every school employee and student.
We always must carry at least a remnant of today's hope and energy and high mood
into our classrooms on each successive day. We need to draw from it when our
minds and bodies and enthusiasm for the work begin to sink, as they will at
times. If each day really is new in our hearts and in our minds, then we also
possess a limitless array of the best opportunities for ourselves,  our

<P>You see, we have two very special elements in our favor: One, we are strong
individuals, and even stronger when working together. We would not still be
working in schools if we weren't strong people. And two, we have incredibly
important work to do. In the words of Marge Piercy's 1973 poem entitled &quot;To

<H1><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&quot;No one wins alone... We need to devise a
community strategy for school improvement&quot;
</FONT></H1>
<P><B>By Angelo J. Dorta, Vermont-NEA President</B></P>
<P>It's not a pretty sight when citizens begin to turn against their schools. I
know. It's happening right now in my own community, the Mount Mansfield Union
Supervisory School District. A springtime rescind petition and a switch to
Australian balloting helped to defeat the $10 million 1996-97 school budget. A
recent 3-hour information meeting for the public revealed harsh disdain of the
school board's decision to trim only $60,000 (.6%) from the original proposal.
It also produced a cacophony of related school criticisms. 
</P>
<P>My neighbors are hopping mad about high property taxes. They're frustrated
that 80% of  school costs -- such as negotiated teacher contracts, special
education, administration, and out-of-district high school tuition for
technical/vocational education -- are expenses still  beyond their control
despite the budget defeat. They talk of an NEA &quot;stranglehold&quot; on
school boards around the state. 
</P>
<P>They also recite a seemingly endless litany of personal school anecdotes
that decry a lack of student academic prowess and that question the proficiency
of our teachers. Few speak positively and publicly about our two middle schools
and the high school. They ignore comparatively low costs-per-pupil, already high
teacher-student ratios, and levels of student achievement judged better than
merely acceptable by all available measures. Approval of the slightly revised
budget at the September re-vote may or may not occur. A local budget-slashing
group calling itself Enough Is Enough again is spearheading the drive to reject
the budget. I worry about the possibility of larger budget cuts in the future
and their impact on the education of my 15-year-old and 12-year-old sons. 
</P>
<P>I realize that I am not alone in my concern. Educators, parents, and school
supporters of all kinds have had good reason to fret in recent weeks and months.
In communities such as Colchester, Newport, Milton, Benson, St. Albans, and
Shelburne, serious questions are being raised by vocal citizen groups about
fundamental school issues: how Vermonters pay for education; how to accurately
gauge student progress; how to balance real school costs against &quot;opportunities
to learn&quot; for all students; evaluation practices and judgments of teacher
competence; the validity of various instructional methods, goals, and
philosophies identified either as &quot;the basics&quot; or as &quot;education
reform&quot;; the meaning and relevance of vouchers, school &quot;choice,&quot;
and merit pay; and the role of teachers' unions in facilitating or impeding
necessary school improvement. Easy explanations and sound-byte answers do not
exist for these substantive school matters. 
</P>
<P>Certainly, a burdensome and unfair system of local property taxation
inflames the ongoing debate about our schools. It represents a compelling
problem for Vermont-NEA members and their neighbors. However, let us not be
mistaken: if school funding in Vermont suddenly became equitable, adequate, and
progressive overnight, issues of school quality and of teachers unions still
would be on the minds and lips of citizens at school meetings, in supermarkets,
on radio and television, in cyberspace, and at all types of social and business
gatherings in our communities. Our society now realizes full well that the
desired paths to national economic security and to an individually satisfying
quality of life both must pass directly through our schoolhouse doors.
Unfortunately, a national drumbeat of unremitting criticism and denigration of 
public education for a dozen years has shaken community support for our local
schools. 
</P>
<P>What is the proper stance and course of action for our local Associations? I
believe that we must directly engage our severest critics, our marginal
supporters, and the undecideds on their own local turf, on the issues of
greatest concern: property taxes, school quality, and teachers' unions. We must
initiate no-holds-barred discussion forums that are open to everyone in the
community and that acknowledge the issue of confidence in our local public
schools. 
</P>
<P>First, we will have to LISTEN. We must listen without defensiveness, without
justifications and self-satisfactions. Without bruised egos and a sense of
underappreciation. Without meek explanations that can be taken by skeptics as
only rationalizations and excuses. As difficult as it will be, we first must
allow them to express the common complaints, allegations, biases, and
misconceptions -- as well as the honest questions and doubts --  that are
undermining confidence in public education today. Try first to understand, then
to be understood. 
</P>
<P>Next, we must RESPOND. In simple, clear, jargon-free language, we must
communicate the complexities of daily teaching and the fact that we are working
harder than ever before. We need to explain the new education challenges
presented by children, families, and American culture in the '90s. And we must
state -- in no uncertain terms, with unquestionable data -- that public school
teachers have never done a better job of providing educational excellence and
equity for all students than we are doing today. All of the traditional
indicators of student achievement support this assertion, and we must use them.

</P>
<P>Finally, we must SEEK CONSENSUS. In a series of several meetings, we must
join with all willing community members to develop a shared vision for our
students and for our local schools. That guiding vision must focus on our common
future instead of on the differences of the past. We need community goals for
what our students should know and be able to do based on high expectations for
all children. We need to devise a community strategy for school improvement. 
</P>
<P>No one wins alone. All community groups must meet the challenge together.
Vermont-NEA members must help to weave together a broad network of support for
teachers and schools, a community-wide partnership of educators, parents and
non-parents, business people, senior citizens, professionals and blue-collar
workers, labor leaders and clergy. Only these community partnerships will assure
that necessary services and resources are provided to schools to produce the
highest academic achievement possible for all of our students. 
</P>
<P>These are troublesome times for public education and for unionism. We need
faith that we can move beyond the disagreements with our neighbors to work
together cooperatively for the benefit of the children in our communities.
Without such faith, nothing will change. Schools and their communities will go
down grappling with each other until the bitter end, while public education
crumbles before our very eyes. 
</P>
<P>I need that faith now to bridge the gap with school critics in my own home
school district in the shadow of Mount Mansfield. Perhaps you need it, too. We
will make the resources of this Association available to you in your efforts.
Our Vermont communities must become the nurturing fields for our schools and for
our common future.

</H1>
<H2><I>&quot;Educate the best, forget the rest&quot; is unacceptable </I>
</H2>
<P><B>By Angelo J. Dorta, Vermont-NEA President</B></P>
<P>Whether you know it or not, whether you are ready and willing or not, you
now are a front-line soldier in the battle for public education. The struggle is
beginning to rage full-throttle throughout Vermont and the United States. Its
final outcome will determine the parameters of &quot;public&quot; schooling in
the 21st century. The issue is called &quot;school choice.&quot; Republican
candidate for president Bob Dole made it a high-profile topic recently, but it
already had been embraced across-the-board by other GOP candidates in Vermont
and elsewhere: gubernatorial candidate John Gropper, Lieutenant Governor running
mate John Carroll, and U.S. House challenger Susan Sweetser have reserved seats
on the bandwagon.  They seem to be reading from the same national script: public
schools have failed, they are inferior when compared to our international
counterparts, and it's time to &quot;blow the system wide open&quot; (Carroll)
by providing public tax dollars to any and every private religious and
non-sectarian school. An unrestricted marketplace of competing public and
private schools is their vision for better education and for school improvement
in Vermont's cities, towns, and villages of the future. 
</P>
<P>Let's be clear about a crucial point: Vermont-NEA does not oppose all forms
of school choice. Schools must be highly responsive to their local communities
and must accommodate explicit, strong desires for sound instructional options.
But we believe that choices for students and their parents can be expanded and
incorporated immediately into existing local public schools in several ways:
</P>
<P>1) Small schools and single-school districts must use their hiring powers to
secure the services of individual teachers with specific styles and philosophies
that result in a more instructionally diverse teaching staff. Also, voluntary
consolidation of the very smallest schools for greater economy and for greater
classroom variety would be helpful. 
</P>
<P>2) Large schools can develop &quot;school-within-a-school&quot;
organizational plans. This concept allows teams of teachers to more precisely
define and implement distinct teaching and learning methodologies, curriculum
innovations or emphases, systems for delivery of student special services,
alternatives for grouping students and for organizing grade levels, sets of
unique educational experiences, and access to various types of education
technology, resources, and learning materials. Classrooms with teaming teachers
usually are located together within the school building.      
</P>
<P>3) Multi-school single districts and supervisory unions could establish one
or more designated &quot;magnet school(s)&quot; that can attract and enroll
students from anywhere in the district or supervisory union who want education
based on an attribute of instruction described in (2).  
</P>
<P>However, Vermont-NEA will vigorously oppose school choice plans that give
public tax dollars to private non-sectarian and religious schools and that
simply abandon  low-performing schools. Uncontrolled school choice and voucher
programs are likely to intensify educational stratification and inequity when
advantaged schools cream the best students and the most funding, while
struggling schools are further depleted. Public accountability and traditional
community control over school governance and use of funds  would become obsolete
or meaningless, especially for 75% of our taxpaying citizens who do not have
children in schools. Re-segregation of many students according to wealth and
social class, to ethnic or racial or religious group, and to intellectual or
physical ability and disability is probable. The role of our local public
schools as the laboratories of democracy for school-age children in a culturally
heterogenous society will be lost or diminished. School advertising and
marketing to increase enrollments will be elevated above the substance of school
performance and student achievement. Tuition fees will rise for schools in
demand. Time and additional funds will be needed for state and local officials
to administer and monitor choice programs. A practical solution to the
formidable problems of equal access to transportation and of transportation
costs have not yet been suggested. Parents will regularly require information
and counseling about school options. What happens when a student is rejected by
their school of choice, which occurs 66% of the time now among private schools?

</P>
<P>We must acknowledge that there is not yet any significant, consistent,
unambiguous data which supports school choice as the primary means to better
schools and to greater student achievement. Indeed, a comprehensive and
scientifically rigorous study of this issue never has been done. School choice
only can become a meaningful factor when internal school improvement efforts
produce more high performance, 21st century -style schools from which to choose.
To reach that goal, we must establish a prior and a steadfast commitment at the
national, state, and local levels to reasonably equal educational opportunities
for all students and to sufficient funding for our schools. Choice plans must
attack the truly difficult problem: stimulating improvement in schools operating
at lower levels of effectiveness rather than simply reinforce today's adequate
and outstanding schools. Ineffective schools will not improve if currently
touted choice plans deprive them of needed fiscal and human resources. 
</P>
<P>Virtually every school must become a school of choice, perhaps some with
distinctive programs that are developed in complementary and collaborative ways
rather than competitively. Together, we need to pursue positive developments
such as higher academic standards, more technology, finer and more varied school
report data and student assessments, and school-based decision-making. As
independent education researcher Ann Bastian suggests, we must ask ourselves
these questions: Is public education irredeemable? Does equity matter? Who
should govern education? How well does the unrestricted marketplace fulfill
human needs? 
</P>
<P>Education in Vermont and in the United States always has been viewed as
serving the public good, not a purely personal or private interest. Our system
of public education has served this country far too well for over 300 years for
us to jeopardize it now with radical, unproven experimentation. Vermont-NEA
cannot support plans which result in policies that intentionally or
inadvertently promote an &quot;educate the best and forget the rest&quot;
philosophy. We can and will, however, work with all citizens to achieve and
support choice aimed at providing an excellent education for all children.

<H1><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Vermont-NEA will participate in Rutland area public
school choice study
</FONT></H1>
<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1">Vermont-NEA President Angelo Dorta delivered these
remarks at a news conference October 24, 1996 at the Vermont-NEA Convention...
</FONT></I></B></P>
<P>The 145th Annual Vermont-NEA Educators' Convention is an occasion for
celebrating the tremendous professionalism and the tireless dedication of our
teachers and school support staff from Bennington to Richford, from St. Albans
to St. Johnsbury. And there are many achievements to celebrate:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The number of Vermont high school students taking a core curriculum of four
years of English, and three years each of math, science, and social studies has
more than tripled since 1982.</LI>
<LI>Vermont SAT scores have increased each year since 1993 despite the fifth
highest participation rate in the country &#151; 70 percent &#151; compared to a
national average participation of 41 percent.</LI>
<LI>Vermont's high school completion rate has remained steady for the past 10
years at about 85 percent despite profound changes in family structure, work,
and general society. By contrast, in the 50s, nearly half of all high school
students quit before graduating. Most handicapped and disabled Vermont students
were taught at home or in institutions, rather than experiencing the equal
education opportunities that exist today in Vermont's very inclusive public
school classrooms.</LI>
<LI>More than 50 percent of Vermont students continue with post-secondary
education, over 20 percent more than three decades ago.</LI>
<LI>Recent College Board citations for Vermont students included
better-than-national average performance on most Advanced Placement tests and
English and Math achievement tests.</LI></UL>
<P>The data goes on and on, and the message is clear: Most Vermont students who
care about learning receive a high quality education. That does not mean we are
complacent. Vermont-NEA members realize that the new world order of global
markets and international production centers require a high skilled U.S.
workforce that knows how to use technology and teamwork and solid academic
skills to design efficient solutions to every-changing problems. 
</P>
<P>Ironically, at a time when student achievement results and teacher
qualifications have never been higher, the effectiveness of Vermont's public
schools are at the center of a swirling debate.
</P>
<P>1996 has been the year of the school choice issue in Vermont. Speculation on
the value, the costs, and the utter practicality of allowing parents to choose
their children's schools has surfaced strongly in candidate speeches, in
editorial columns, at school board meetings and community forums, and in casual
conversations between average citizens across this state. However, at this very
moment, there is only one certainty about school choice: its long-term impact on
student achievement, on the sustainability of our local schools and local school
governance, and indeed on the very spirit that enlivens our communities is
unknown.
</P>
<P>Some candidates and vocal citizens make much of the fact that parents in 90
Vermont communities already have public school choice options because their
towns lack local elementary or high schools. This unique tradition exists solely
because of the preponderance of small, rural communities in Vermont. It is
vitally important to note that choosing between public schools and
state-approved independent school in other communities does not jeopardize
school enrollment in the towns of residence for these students.
</P>
<P>Vermont-NEA believes that it is time to get some likely answers to some
serious and specific questions about prospective public school choice plans in
our great state:</P>
<UL>
<LI>questions about access that focus on transportation capability, enrollments
limits, and admissions procedures for various classes and education programs;</LI>
<LI>questions about costs and funding that consider town financial resources
and more equalized tax rates and State Aid;</LI>
<LI>questions about school governance that examine existing state statutes,
State Board of Education regulations, and accountability to taxpayers who do not
use the schools or who live in towns away from the school programs;</LI>
<LI>questions about special education services and school commitment to
providing equal education opportunities for all students;</LI>
<LI>questions about costs and procedures to regularly inform and counsel
parents about school options and about the rights, responsibilities, and
limitations that may accompany their decision;</LI>
<LI>questions about the impact of school choice, competition, and marketplace
principles such as supply-and-demand on school tuition fees, advertising,
schools with declining enrollments, and student diversity.</LI></UL>
<P>If parents, students, and taxpayers truly believe that they need more
choices in education, then 350 years of U.S. public education demands that our
public schools provide those choices to ensure academic excellence and equity
for all of our children. Vermont's public schools belong to the citizens of this
state. They have the ultimate authority and responsibility necessary to work
alongside local educators and other school employees to create the 21st Century
schools that are needed. Citizens must help improve their schools, not fall into
the trap of negativism and scapegoating that simply leads to school abandonment.
</P>
<P>Therefore, today Vermont-NEA announces its acceptance of Rutland
Superintendent David Wolk's invitation to participate in the Public School
Choice Collaborative Study Group. The Study Group will examine the essential
issues related to the possible establishment of a countywide, Rutland region
choice plan among public schools. Vermont-NEA's Board of Directors has
authorized me to attend meetings of the Study Group beginning on October 29th at
Rutland's Stafford Technical Center along with fellow local Association
representatives from the six area superintendencies. I thank Superintendent Wolk
for his invitation and salute him for his vision and timing in calling for a
thorough, grassroots-level study of public school choice before any new
legislation is contemplated. Vermont-NEA can and will work with all citizens to
achieve and support education options aimed at proving excellent schooling for
all children, regardless of their family's personal wealth or geographic
location.
</P>
<P>On a closing note, it is important to underscore again the fact that the
Study Group only will be examining public school options. Nearly 70 percent of
Vermont House candidates and 55 percent of Senate candidates stated forthrightly
their opposition to the use of public tax dollars for non-approved private or
parochial schools, when they were interviewed in August by over 400 Vermont-NEA
members who voluntarily staffed our district and county candidate screening
committees.

<H1><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">President Dorta answers Free Press attack</FONT></H1>
<P><B><I><FONT SIZE="+1">Editorialists at Vermont's largest daily newspaper
unleashed a barrage of mean commentary against Vermont-NEA last month in
response to the Association's decision to accept an invitation to join in a
study of public school choice in the Rutland area. This was President Angelo
Dorta's &quot;It's My Turn&quot; answer to the Free Press attack: 
</FONT></I></B></P>
<P>Your November 2 editorial, &quot;The Last Player,&quot; recycles trashy,
time-worn, anti-Vermont-NEA propaganda. Teachers across this state rarely become
disgusted any longer, or even disappointed, at your criticisms. For the past 10
years, we've come to expect Free Press disrespect and negativity towards us and
our organizations. </P>
<P>The editorial is noteworthy only for its venomous and derogatory undertone. 
Your backhanded compliment to Vermont-NEA for joining the Rutland-area public
school choice study is a veil. Your real purpose is to dredge up and to
perpetuate a meanspirited characterization of Association goals and
perspectives. Like Bob Dole, you assert an artificial division between teachers
and Vermont-NEA by claiming that &quot;Vermonters tend to love individual
teachers...&quot; and then proceeding to castigate their state union. 
</P>
<P>You accuse us of dragging our heels on school choice. Then, displaying an
abysmal lack of awareness, you ironically list the very questions that
Vermont-NEA has publicly and oft-repeatedly stated must be answered by a
grassroots study before any statewide or regional interdistrict choice plan
should be implemented: costs, governance, transportation, special education,
admissions, student resegregation, and parent information. Somehow, you
myopically overlook Vermont-NEA's espousal of current intradistrict school
choice options that appeared on your own September 12 editorial page. 
</P>
<P>Vermont-NEA &quot;is giving the profession a bad name?&quot; We &quot;grind
to dust proposals for improving education?&quot; Most teachers today would give
you a failing grade for research &#151; if indeed any actual research was done &#151;
and for journalistic fairmindedness. Check your facts, please. Have you
forgotten the annual Vermont-NEA Educators' Convention, with nearly 200
education exhibitors, two dozen workshops, and eight Scholars' Bowl academic
competitions for high school teams? What about the 20 different subject
affiliates that are partially subsidized by Vermont-NEA, such as the Vermont
Council of Teachers of Math or the Vermont Foreign Languages Association or the
Vermont Council on Reading? Have you visited our web site at www.vtnea.org and
seen the &quot;Advice for Parents and Support for Kids&quot; pages and our
suggested book list for K-12 readers? Did you decide to ignore the information I
sent you regarding the Vermont-NEA Teaching and Learning Programs and the
Listening to Parents initiative? Do you recall our participatory community
forums that were reported in your newspaper on October 2? Aren't you aware that
our members and elected Association leaders provided straightforward testimony
and endorsement of regular, frequent, and rigorous teacher evaluation at a joint
hearing of the House and Senate Education Committees in Montpelier last March?
Have you spoken with individual and educational organization policymakers
(Governor Howard Dean, Education Commissioner Marc Hull, Vermont PTA, State
Department of Education, etc.) to gauge Vermont-NEA's strong support of higher
academic standards, more comprehensive statewide student assessment, and greater
parental involvement? 
</P>
<P>Similarly, unbiased research also clearly shows that Vermont-NEA has
advocated fairer and less burdensome education financing for over a decade, not
opposed it, as the Free Press contends. In 1994, we worked with the Vermont
Superintendents Association, the Vermont Principals Association, the Vermont
Coalition of Disability Rights, and three other groups to jointly develop six
principles for funding Vermont public education and used them to evaluate
legislative proposals and to lobby for acceptable bills together at the
Statehouse. In the 1990 Legislature, a Vermont-NEA property tax reform bill was
introduced that asked for a $50,000 homestead exemption, full funding of the
Current Use Program, a tax on second homes and some commercial properties, and
decoupling the state income tax from the federal. Go back four years earlier to
1986 and dig out our Fair Tax Initiative that suggested a $25,000 homestead
exemption, statewide property tax classifications with variable tax rates, and a
decoupled state income tax. 
</P>
<P>Individuals may agree or disagree with our specific proposals, but
Vermont-NEA is not obstructionist. We fought alongside the Vermont School Boards
Association and other allies against former Speaker Ralph Wright's statewide
teachers' contract in '93 and '94 because it was detrimental to local school
governance and policy matters, negated 25 years of collective bargaining rights
for our members, and couldn't deliver on its economic promises of state
affordability and equalized teacher salaries. 
</P>
<P>We are ethically obligated to our members, to their students, and to all
Vermonters to express serious concerns and to advocate for a strong, high
quality, equitable public school system. The views of many Vermont citizens are
influenced by your columns. In this instance, you betrayed your public
responsibility to consider positive facts in your possession about the
Association. Unlike the newspaper's reckless diatribe, Vermont-NEA states
explicitly what we support and what we oppose, and we back our stances with
clear rationales. When new data and conditions and member viewpoints evolve,
then we adjust our positions on the issues accordingly. That's hardly a &quot;rigid
organization,&quot; in my view. 
</P>
<P>Your comfortable, second-floor editorial office certainly has great views of
College and Church Streets. I've visited you three times for discussions since
May, 1995. However, I suggest that you come down to the street level more often.
That's where teachers and students reside each day. That's where you can find
Vermont-NEA, too. So far, you've chosen not to see nor hear who we really are. 

</P>

<H1><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&quot;We must ensure that our common voices are
heard above the surrounding cacophony...&quot;  </FONT></H1>
<P><B>By Angelo J. Dorta, Vermont-NEA President</B></P>
<P>For a decade or more in Vermont, a virtual din of broadcast media reports,
reams of newspaper text, and plentiful public forums around the state have
analyzed and debated the core policy issues of teaching and learning. Vermonters
have had constant exposure and ready access to the education viewpoints of
elected government officials, media pundits, business interests, community
groups, policy and research centers, other advocacy organizations, aspiring
political leaders, consultants, experts, and study teams, and polling firms.
Even loose networks of less-than-serious education dilettantes, entrepreneurs,
and wannabes easily gain a share of the education spotlight for their opinions
and pronouncements. 
</P>
<P>The only collective, organizational voice that has been mostly silent is
Vermont-NEA&#146;s -- at least up until now. Occasionally, we have been vocal in
the past on some non-contractual education quality issues, such as the struggle
to achieve a teacher-majority professional standards board and classroom special
services integration under Act 230. However, Vermont-NEA never before has
attempted to stake out a comprehensive set of principles and recommendations
that define our public positions on a broad array of classroom- and school-level
teaching and learning issues: qualifications for teaching, use of instructional
time, school standards for student decorum, curricular balance between academic
content and methodology, rigorous academic programs for all students and
remediation for any child who needs it, annual academic and career planning
advice to students and their parents beginning in the 7th grade, and others.
These daily professional concerns most directly and most consistently affect our
Association members and our student/parent/community clients. 
</P>
<P>Finally, a major effort has begun to chronicle educator perspectives on such
issues based on  repeated statements to Vermont-NEA leaders and staff, and then
to develop a clear, common, formal Association voice that speaks honestly and
positively from classrooms across Vermont. The results to date are compiled in a
draft report entitled &#147;Schools That Work: Keys to Improving Learning in
Vermont&#146;s Schools.&#148; The draft report&#146;s full text is published in
this edition of Vermont-NEA Today and also is available on Vermont-NEA&#146;s
website (www.vtnea.org). 
</P>
<P>Publication of the report in print and electronic draft form has one vital
purpose: to solicit as many member comments and suggestions for revisions as
possible in the weeks ahead. A statewide open hearing on the contents and
drafting process of &#147;Schools That Work&#148; is scheduled for Saturday,
January 25 in the Montpelier area. 
</P>
<P>The Vermont-NEA Board of Directors could take official action on the draft
report as early as their February 8 meeting. Over 1,000 copies of the draft
report already have been sent out from Vermont-NEA headquarters on request. At
least 200 Association members have participated in some type of focussed
discussion led by Association Board members, local leaders, and UniServ staff
and have provided immediate, face-to-face feedback. Six regional UniServ
District meetings lead by me in November and December included give-and-take
over the substance and process of the report&#146;s initial public draft.
Suggested revisions in notes and letters arrive at the Association&#146;s office
each day and carefully are added to the cumulative catalogue of responses. 
</P>
<P>Sparked by the well-substantiated critiques of frank and assertive members,
15 significant changes -- in total, over 75 improvements -- already have been
incorporated into the original document by the committee writing team and
subsequently approved by the Board of Directors on December 7. Now, all
Association members have the most up-to-date version of &#147;Schools That Work&#148;
in their hands for personal, independent review and for dialogue with their
colleagues. And the latest principles, recommendations, and accompanying
discussion text still are bound to change further.
</P>
<P>&#147;Schools That Work&#148; has spawned exactly the kind of rigorous,
democratic debate on relevant teaching and learning issues that Vermont-NEA has
needed for so long. It has elicited overall praise from the vast majority of
responding members, and some generally harsh but instructive criticism from a
few others. 
</P>
<P>Sanctioning probationary periods for new teachers, establishing a 200-day
school year, requiring teachers to achieve a master&#146;s degree or equivalent
college-level coursework, and examining the balance between concerns for
academic achievement and student self-esteem have been particularly
controversial so far. However, encountering diverse member viewpoints naturally
occurs when venturing into previously uncharted policy areas. I&#146;m confident
that a more participatory and organizationally healthy Association will emerge.
Ultimately, our internal rough-and-tumble will hone a document that will be more
representative of our entire constituency. A stronger Association voice
consequently will be heard on these school matters of daily importance. </P>
<P>Few of us may end up agreeing with every single point in the report, but
does it, we must ask ourselves, on balance accurately reflect our collective
thinking? The absolutely most crucial statement in the report perhaps is an
implicit one: Vermont-NEA now intends to become fully engaged with members, with
citizens, and with officials and leaders of every type on all aspects of
teaching and learning.    
</P>
<P>Each passing day adds even greater urgency to our task. Others clamor for
recognition and approval of their own specific recommendations and agendas for
public school improvement. Many of them have experiences far removed from the
daily realities of Vermont classrooms that we have known for years. Therefore,
they can offer little advice of practical value and much that can inadvertently
undermine and be harmful to our schools and students. Widespread support for
public school education now seems more tenuous than ever due to a rising tide of
clashing political ideologies, perplexing international comparisons of student
achievement levels, and crushing economic disparities. 
</P>
<P>The &#147;Schools That Work&#148; report, however, can become a powerful
catalyst and a platform under constant construction to support future
Association actions which more precisely and more effectively serve the changing
instructional leadership and advocacy needs of the members. The draft report&#146;s
introduction sounds a reasoned call for &#147;a renewed and enhanced commitment
to high intellectual and behavioral standards in Vermont&#146;s public schools.&#148;
We must ensure that our common voices are heard above the surrounding cacophony,
and they must be heard soon, before it is too late. 
</P>
<P>In a letter written by me and published in the June, 1995 Vermont-NEA Today,
 I thanked members for my election and promised to &#147;tell it like it is.&#148;
I thought that my own 22 years in public school classrooms was sufficient
experience. It is not. I need your help because it is our collective experience
and vision that now is essential. </P>

<H1><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&quot;Let&#146;s hope that the bloom of spring at
the Statehouse brings the legislation that we need...&quot; 
</FONT></H1>
<P><B>By Angelo J. Dorta, Vermont-NEA President</B></P>
<P>A time-honored ritual now is underway. Throughout our state, the political
attention of Vermonters has begun to turn towards the golden dome of the
Statehouse in Montpelier. What will be the real achievements of Vermont&#146;s
citizen-legislature this year? That question is posed rhetorically during winter
snow and cold, but the answers will emerge with spring&#146;s warming crocuses
and daffodils. 
</P>
<P>Last year, Vermont-NEA figuratively turned several major corners amid the
hallways and committee rooms of the Statehouse. We sought to challenge
legislator perceptions of the Association and its members and to cultivate a
more accurate view of Vermont-NEA. Offering to give up the right to strike in
exchange for mandatory binding interest arbitration and the removal of school
board imposition powers surprised and intrigued lawmakers.  State Representative
and State Senators also discovered from testifying Association members that we
do not fear or avoid performance evaluation. On the contrary, we told them,
teachers and support staff insist that evaluations be rigorous, fair, and
frequent because that&#146;s how we prove our competence to the community and
how we help to raise the overall quality of the education workforce. In fact, we
consider it downright demeaning to us and to our profession that so many school
district evaluation instruments and procedures are weak and haphazard, when used
at all. 
</P>
<P>Your Association lobbyists &#151;Executive Director Dick Lang, General
Counsel Joel Cook, and myself&#151; were always calm, courteous, and informative
in our frequent individual conversations with legislators and government
officials. Our testimony in committee meetings and at hearings was factual and
well-prepared. We listened carefully and were proactive and positive in
expressing the Association&#146;s viewpoints.  We spoke authoritatively and
persistently for higher student academic standards and for reasonable statewide
student assessment and testing strategies; for structural improvements and
greater equity in the property tax system of school funding; for the
establishment of acceptable indoor air quality measures in schools; for
consistent use of objective data in education decision-making; for early
diagnosis and intervention in reading; for enhanced access to computer
technology to support classroom learning; for use of existing, appropriate
discipline guidelines in special education law to control disruptive and
dangerous student misbehavior; for increasing the State&#146;s share in the cost
of public education; and for ensuring the fiscal integrity of the State Teachers&#146;
Retirement System. 
</P>
<P>We accomplished our objectives or made progress in some of these areas.
Other proposals fell by the wayside when property tax reform efforts failed
again. Many will be revived in the days and weeks ahead as Vermont-NEA and its
allies refuse to simply abandon worthy, unfinished legislative business.   
</P>
<P>We also provided the critical analyses that stoked opposition to Rutland&#146;s
plan to use public tax vouchers to help pay student tuition at non-approved
private and religious schools; to a flawed charter schools provision that also
ultimately would have diverted funding from existing public schools; to the
shifting of responsibility for teacher retirement costs to local school
districts; and to a bevy of GOP notions that were ill-conceived and damaging:
increased class sizes through reductions in teaching staff, wholesale waiving of
the teacher license requirement, de facto elimination of just and sufficient
cause for teacher dismissals, allowance for retroactive and multi-year contract
impositions by school boards, and others. In conjunction with many like-minded
education organizations and private citizens, we helped expose the dangers in
these proposals that resulted in their demise.   
</P>
<P>By adjournment in early May last year, many lawmakers viewed Vermont-NEA
more favorably than at any time since the days preceding the 1993 statewide
teachers&#146; contract proposal. Occasionally, some simply complimented us on
our presentations or respectfully acknowledged a clearer understanding of
Association goals and positions. Others, however, praised us in private for
exhibiting a renewed or heightened sense of education professionalism and
earnestly urged us to continue this brand of vigorous legislative involvement.
They recognized Vermont-NEA&#146;s deep commitment to instructional leadership
and support issues as well as to traditional labor union matters. 
</P>
<P>It is time now to build further on this solid foundation for successful
legislative and political engagement. General Counsel Joel Cook has crafted the
most comprehensive compilation yet of Association public positions on a broad
range of education policy issues that significantly affect our members: Agenda
for Public School Education and Educators. 
</P>
<P>Our most effective potential Association lobbyists, however, are the
400-plus members who served last summer and fall on the House district, county,
and statewide political action committees to assess several hundred candidates
for public office. Once mobilized again on specific House and Senate legislative
proposals, they can have direct and widespread Association impact on legislative
activity. Without doubt, legislators pay closest attention to the comments and
letters of their own constituents and are most likely to be swayed by the
sentiments of their voters. Statehouse accountability to our members, to our
students, and to our schools may depend largely on targeted and timely contacts
with legislators by these willing, grassroots, Association political activists. 
        Together, we will continue to push for the necessary resources, the
promising instructional reforms, and the employment conditions of educators that
can produce real and lasting student achievement and school improvement in
Vermont. We will stand firm against State-imposed limitations on local education
funding, privatization of school services, siphoning financial support  from
existing public schools, Retirement System underfunding, and school district
actions that presume guilt and that punish teachers accused of child abuse
before valid local investigations are concluded. It is an ambitious legislative
agenda in challenging times for public school educators. 
</P>
<P>Several months from now, let&#146;s hope that the bloom of spring at the
Statehouse brings the legislation that we need. Your help and support are
essential.     </P>

of the Year

<TABLE BORDER="0">
<TR>
<TD>
<P><B><I>&quot;These days it is easy to get caught up in the rhetoric and
negative images that surround public education... But we need to work together
to accentuate the positive...&quot;
</I></B></P></TD>
<TD><IMG SRC="peggy.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="180"></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>UNDERHILL -- Peggy Dorta, a 27-year veteran teacher and multiage 1-4
classroom teacher at Underhill Central School, has been named Vermont's 1997
Teacher of the Year by the Vermont State Department of Education. She will
represent Vermont in the National Teacher of the Year competition, which is
sponsored by the Council of Chief State School Officers and Scholastic, Inc.
</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Peggy Dorta is well known and respected among Vermont
educators. She is an adjunct professor for Trinity College, the University of
Vermont, and St. Michael's Prevel Graduate School. She works as a consultant in
Vermont and nationally and presents workshops in multiage education and
curricular issues. UVM videotaped her classroom to help preservice teachers with
ideas for setting up a classroom environment. Her presentation was the most
popular at the 1995 Educators' Convention, with the room filled to overflowing.
All this is in addition to a successful, full time career as a multiage
elementary school teacher, including nine years at Williston and going-on nine
in Underhill.  </P>
<P><B>This is a representative award
</B></P>
<P>Dorta says she was &quot;shocked, flattered, honored&quot; to be named
Vermont Teacher of the Year. She is very proud of her professional achievements,
but her pride extends beyond personal success: &quot;This is a representative
award,&quot; she says. &quot;I am not 'the best teacher in the state.' I simply
exemplify some of the wonderful things going on in education in Vermont. This
award tells me I'm on the right track.&quot;
</P>
<P>Dorta says that the reaction of her colleagues has been the best personal
award for being named Teacher of the Year. Teachers at her school threw her a
surprise party and gave her a  rosebush from Nantucket (a place she loves). &quot;They
really surprised me. It's the first time I've ever been speechless.&quot; And,
typically for Peggy Dorta, she learned something from the experience. &quot;It
is really important,&quot; she says, &quot;to turn to someone when you're
thinking it or feeling it and say:  'I appreciate you. I like what you do.'&quot;
</P>
<P>Dorta learns from every aspect of her life, beginning with her years as a
student in elementary school. &quot;The important message I learned way back
then was that each and every person is special. Each and every person has the
right and the need to be educated. That in school, skills and knowledge are
important objectives, but students' feelings and dispositions are equally so. We
need to listen and watch well enough to find ways to reach each student.&quot;
</P>
<P><B>Community and service</B>
</P>
<P>The parents gave Dorta a party, too, with flowers and a Miss America-style
sash decorated with the notes she has sent home to kids. 
</P>
<P>Community is important to Peggy Dorta. &quot;Ten years ago I made a
conscious decision to apply for a teaching job within the community where I
live,&quot; she explains in one of her National Teacher of the Year essays. &quot;It
has been wonderful to live and to work with families I know well. I appreciate
that I have been able to integrate service to my community within and through my
teaching program.&quot;
</P>
<P>Parent and community involvement are basic to Dorta's philosophy of
teaching. &quot;The student, the parent, and the teacher are the triad that make
success happen in school. Communication and involvement are key elements for
parents and the larger community,&quot; she says. &quot;It is my job to draw
them in and to inform them of what is happening. It is my goal to find a way for
each parent to participate in some way with the classroom activities.
Volunteering, spending a day with us, chaperoning field trips, giving a special
presentation, showing us their work or workplace. There are so many ways to
invite participation and it is such an important part of my program.&quot;
</P>
<P><B>Her message</B>
</P>
<P>Asked what advice she would offer to fellow educators, Dorta makes three
suggestions: Don't get overwhelmed. Take the time to reflect. Keep researching.
&quot;It's easy to get lost,&quot; she says, &quot;because we're so busy and
there is so much work to do. But we need to read and discuss and research. We
need to ask: 'What am I doing?' 'How am I doing it?' and most important, 'Why?'&quot;
</P>
<P>Dorta has a message, as well, for educators and the general public: &quot;Let's
work together... Let's make our focus the students... These days it is easy to
get caught up in the rhetoric and negative images that surround public
education... we need to work together to accentuate the positive and focus on
what we can do to continue to improve public education.&quot;</P>

<TITLE>Vermont-NEA Scholarship</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<H1><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Scholarships available to sons and daughters of
Vermont-NEA members
</FONT></H1>
<P><I><B>Scholarship applicants will describe how they would revitalize
community interest in public education</B></I></P>
<P>The sons and daughters of Vermont-NEA members -- twelfth graders,
undergraduates, and graduate students -- are eligible to apply for
Vermont-NEA/Maida F. Townsend scholarships. The $1000 scholarships, established
in 1991, are awarded annually at the Vermont-NEA Representative Assembly. 
</P>
<P>The scholarship awards are based on merit, not financial need. Students
majoring in any discipline are eligible to apply, but preference may be given to
those majoring in education, or having that intention. Awards are made directly
to the students, not to their colleges. Students may reapply for the award, but
may receive an award only once.
</P>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">How to Apply</FONT>
</H2>
<P>The scholarship application requires the submission of transcripts and two
letters of recommendation. Twelfth graders must have one recommendation from a
counselor/administrator, and one from a classroom teacher. College students 
must have one recommendation from a professor in his/her major area and one from
a professor who can be outside of the major area. 
</P>
<P>Each applicant must submit an essay with a maximum of 400 words. The theme
is decided by the scholarship committee on an annual basis. The 1997 theme is: 
<B>&quot;How I would revitalize community interest in public education.&quot;
</B>
</P>
<P>The scholarship application cover letter must include the student's
educational and professional plans, as well as a brief statement which
highlights those qualities which make the applicant unique. Along with the other
materials, applicants should submit a listing of extra curricular and community
activities.
</P>
<P>An official Cover Sheet must be filled out and must accompany all
scholarship application material. Contact Vermont-NEA for a copy of the Cover
Sheet. Phone: 1-800-649-6375   E-mail: scholar@vtnea.org
</P>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The Judges</FONT>
</H2>
<P>The scholarship fund is governed by a board of trustees, which is the same
as the entire Vermont-NEA Board of Directors. The Vermont-NEA president appoints
two board members and an at-large-member to the committee annually. A
chairperson is appointed for a two year term.  These are the members of the 1997
Scholarship Committee: Judy Allard, chair; Cherrie Torrey; and Barbara O'Neil,
member-at-large.
</P>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Deadline
</FONT></H2>
<P>Applications with an official Cover Sheet must be received at Vermont-NEA
Headquarters by the end of the business day on February 14, 1997. The address: 
Vermont-NEA, 10 Wheelock, Street Montpelier, Vermont 05602-3737</P>

<H2 ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR="#000040"><FONT COLOR="#800000">Schools That
Work:  Introduction</FONT>  
</FONT></H2>
<P>The social, political, and economic welfare of our state and nation depends
on the quality of our public schools. All children, irrespective of class,
gender, ethnicity or disability, need access to a high quality public education.
We must not permit our public schools to wither from within or close their doors
for lack of public support.</P>
<P>We know that some of our schools are in trouble, from within and without. 
</P>
<P>Inside education, we speak too often a language alien to the very people who
want most to support our schools. In plain talk, &quot;high standards&quot;
should reflect what the public generally means by that phrase.</P>
<P>Outside our schools, a host of social ills &#151; hunger and poverty, abuse
and family conflicts, alcoholism and drug addiction, depression and suicide &#151;
can cause a crippling effect on our classrooms. They eat up already limited time
and resources teachers have in which to hold together their schools and their
professional lives. Our schools have had to confront an ever-growing number of
young people simply not ready for a rigorous academic experience. </P>
<P>One self-defeating byproduct of all this: the teaching profession itself has
increasing difficulty attracting and retaining many of the most talented and
best educated college graduates.</P>
<P>While our loudest detrators come from the fringes, concern also comes from
our neighbors, our friends, our children's teachers, people who have been public
education's strongest advocates. They are weary of and frustrated by seemingly
declining standards and decorum in too many Vermont schools. They are tired of
being pitted against each other, and of seeing their communities suffer for it.
We cannot ignore heartfelt frustrations:  </P>
<UL>
<LI>&quot;My child never has any homework; he only read one book in English
last quarter.&quot;
</LI>
<LI>&quot;There's no support from administrators and parents.&quot;
</LI>
<LI>&quot;Why is my daughter always being put in groups to teach other kids who
are fooling around?&quot; 
</LI>
<LI>&quot;John's math teacher spends all her time trying to control one or two
disruptive students &#151; there's not much time left to teach Algebra.&quot; 
</LI>
<LI>&quot;I'm tired of watering down my curriculum. Every year I have to do
less or lower my expectations ... and I'm talking about kids headed for college.&quot;</LI></UL>
<P>It is time we all embraced a common sense response to these complaints. All
public schools should be safe, orderly places where each child learns at an
academically challenging level. Students should be respectful towards their
education, and they should be required to conduct themselves respectfully. If we
adhere to these simple rules, we will get good educational results:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Teachers will teach. 
</LI>
<LI>Parents will nurture.
</LI>
<LI>Administrators will support.
</LI>
<LI>Students will work hard and pursue scholastic achievement.
</LI>
<LI>Boards will set clear, high expectations.
</LI>
<LI>Everybody else will help where they can.</LI></UL>
<P>What people want from their public schools is safety, order, and instruction
in basic and advanced skills. They do not want to dismantle or abandon the
public school system &#151; because it can provide good educational results. We
need to address certain problems, starting now.</P>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Where do we go from here?  </FONT></H2>
<P>Our challenge as Vermont-NEA members is to build a ground swell of support
with other concerned citizens and community groups to demand forcefully, without
equivocation, a renewed and enhanced commitment to  high intellectual and
behavioral standards in Vermont's public schools.</P>
<P>As teachers, we cannot afford to have &quot;standards&quot; become &#151; or
remain &#151; meaningless education jargon. We must insist that every classroom
be a place where learning goes on regularly, without interruption or disruption,
and we must ally ourselves with those parents and community members who share
this goal.</P>
<P>The Vermont Standard we advocate is one that imbues our schools with
excellence, order, and academic rigor. To begin, we must acknowledge and
confront practices in our schools that, even when successful, do not win broad
public support and are frequently misunderstood or inconsequential. No amount of
&quot;learning how to learn&quot; justifies diminished emphasis on mathematics,
writing, history, science, literature, or the arts.</P>
<P>Let us begin with honesty and substance. We must accept heartfelt, valid
criticism and respond by turning all our attention toward the substance of
education. We can do that only by focusing on safety, order, and respect for
real learning and the real work it requires.</P>
<P>As a result, Vermont-NEA will advocate for those changes we know will make
our public schools work better. We will continue to support complementary
principles which promote safety, order, and substance &#151; in short, a sound
educational program worthy of public support. In many communities in Vermont,
these principles are in place. In a disturbing number, however, not all are.
Unless they all are present, uniformly excellent education will always be a goal
rather than a reality.  
</P>
<P>In this document are compiled the thoughts and proposals of our members
about improving learning in Vermont's public schools. On their behalf, we now
bring them to the public. We ask you to join us in having every community adopt
them as its own.

<TITLE>Vermont-NEA: Parent-Teacher Conferences</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<H1><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Making Parent-Teacher Conferences <I>Work</I> for
Your Child</FONT></H1>
<H2><IMG SRC="ptconf.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="502">It's
conference time! </H2>
<P>Parents and teachers like to meet from time to time to discuss how to help
students do their best in school.  Children develop in different ways. They have
their own individual personalities, and their own listening and work habits. 
</P>
<H2>You are important </H2>
<P>To help their students learn, teachers must know as much as they can about
each child. No one knows more about your child than you, the parent. And no one
has more influence over your child than you. This is why teachers need your help
to do a first-class job. Working together, you and the teacher can help your
child have a successful school year.    </P>
<H2><B>Here are some things to keep in mind...</B></H2>
<UL>
<LI><B>Be there on time.</B>  Start the conference right: Be there on time,
and plan not to run over the short amount of time that has been set aside. 
</LI>
<LI><B>Work together.</B> Conferences are successful when both teachers and
parents work as partners to help children make progress. </LI>
<LI><B>Talk to your children.</B> Talk to your children before the conference.
Find out what they think are their best subjects, and what subjects they like
the least. Find out why. Also, ask your children if there is anything they would
like you to talk about with their teachers. </LI>
<LI><B>Reschedule, if necessary.</B> Notify the teacher ahead of time if you
cannot attend, and reschedule. If you are a working parent who can't arrange to
meet during regular hours, make this clear to the teacher and try to set up a
time that is good for both of you. </LI>
<LI><B>Come prepared.</B> Teachers will be prepared, perhaps with samples of
your child's work. And they will have ideas to help your child do even better in
school. You should get ready for each conference, too.     </LI>
<LI><B>Write notes to yourself:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Things about your child's life at home, personality, problems, habits, and
hobbies you feel it's important for the teacher to know. </LI>
<LI>	Your concerns about the school's programs or policies, as they affect your
child and family. </LI>
<LI>Questions about your child's progress. 	</LI>
<LI>How you and your school can work as partners to help your child. </LI>
<LI>Include the concerns and questions of other family members who may not be
able to attend the conference.</LI></UL></LI></UL>
<H2> At the Conference... </H2>
<UL>
<LI><B>Get right to the point.</B> It's a good idea to ask your most important
questions first, just in case time runs out before you and the teacher have a
chance to discuss them all. </LI>
<LI><B>Ask good questions.</B> 	These are good questions to ask your child's
teacher at conference time:
<UL>
<LI>What are the children studying this year?</LI>
<LI>What are the children doing in specific subject areas?</LI>
<LI>What do you include in social studies? What kind of mathematics will the
children learn? How do you teach reading and spelling?</LI>
<LI>	I see equipment with which I am unfamiliar (computer, video, etc.). What
is it used for?</LI>
<LI>How is the class organized? When are children taught in groups rather than
as a class? How much learning do you require be done independently? What do you
do to accommodate the individual differences among children? </LI>
<LI>How do you evaluate the children's progress? What tests are used? What do
your grades mean? </LI>
<LI>What are the school rules? How much homework do you give? What kind of
discipline do you use?</LI>
<LI>What can I do at home to reinforce what you are teaching at school? What
materials do you suggest I keep at home to enrich my child's education and
recreational time? </LI>
<LI>Should we set some goals?</LI></UL></LI>
<LI><B>Find out what you can do.</B> 	Be sure to ask the teacher for specific
suggestions on ways to help your child do well. This is an important part of the
meeting. It can become your action plan. 	If the teacher says something you
don't quite understand, don't be shy about asking for an explanation. 	It's a
good idea to end the conference by summing up decisions you've made together. If
needed, ask to meet again. </LI></UL>
<H2>After the conference... 
</H2>
<UL>
<LI><B>Share with your child.</B> Discuss the conference with your child,
including any action plan you have agreed to with the teacher. Make sure your
child knows that you and the teacher care about his/her progress. Watch your
child's behavior and check your child's classwork and homework. </LI>
<LI><B>Keep working with the teacher.</B> Stay in regular touch with the
teacher to discuss the progress your child is making.  Meeting with your child's
teachers should help build strong parent-teacher partnerships --  partnerships
that are needed if you and your child's teachers are to reach your common goal:
helping your child get the best education possible. </LI></UL>

<H1><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Suggested Reading Lists for Kids</FONT></H1>
<P>Each year in December and again in May, Vermont-NEA publishes and
distributes lists of books that Vermont librarians recommend as good reading for
children and young adults. Each of the lists includes recommendations for
students at three levels: primary, middle grade, and high school. These very
excellent book lists are developed in cooperation with the Vermont Educational
Media Association -- an affiliate of Vermont-NEA -- and Leda Schubert of the
Vermont State Department of Education. Enjoy...</P>

<P>* History does record one other teachers' strike in Vermont. This article
appeared in the Friday, June 9, 1911 edition of <I>The Vermont Journal</I>:</P>
<P><B>TEACHERS ON STRIKE</B></P>
<P>All the grade teachers, six in number, of the Swanton High and Graded School
have tendered their resignation to the superintendent, Mrs. Harriet M. Ide, on
the ground of inadequate salaries and the unwillingness of the Board to allow
them a small increase asked. Those who resigned were Miss Celia Corbett, Miss
Pearl Butterfield, Miss Elsbeth Neibel, Miss Grace Fitzsimmons, Miss Blanche
Blake and Miss Hazel Stone. All are teachers of experience, three having taught
over 10 years, one over six years and two for shorter terms in the grade
departments.</P>

<TITLE>Vermont-NEA Resolution A</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<H2><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">A.	SERVE AS THE NATIONAL VOICE FOR EDUCATION</FONT></H2>
<P>A-1. EDUCATIONAL FINANCE 	Vermont-NEA believes that the funding of education
is the shared responsibility of federal, state, and local governments, with the
state's share at least fifty percent. State aid funds should be allocated
directly for educational purposes. In union school districts, the high school
should share equitably in those funds. 	The Association strongly supports the
concept of providing equal educational opportunity for all Vermont children in
the public schools. 	Vermont-NEA promotes and supports teacher participation in
the acquisition and use of Chapter II block grants. 	The Association urges
support for school reorganization for Vermont in efforts to find a better
organizational pattern for schools. 	The Association strongly urges the
retention of funds received from teachers in payment for licensure and
relicensure for the purpose of supporting the activities of a professional
standards board. The Association opposes the transferal of such funds to the
State General Fund. (1987) (1988) (1989)
</P>
<P>A-2. VOUCHER PLAN 	Vermont-NEA opposes the Voucher Plan. Education which is
financed by federal, state, or local grants to parents could lead to economic
and social isolation of children and weaken or destroy the public school system.
</P>
<P>A-3. MEDIA UTILIZATION 	Vermont-NEA believes that teachers should have the
legal right to use off-air programming up to the time that it becomes
commercially available. (1989)
</P>
<P>A-4. PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING 	Vermont-NEA believes that professional
associations must promote public understanding of education and encourage wide
public and parental participation in solving education's problems. 	Vermont-NEA
urges that local Associations, with the assistance of Vermont-NEA staff, make
production and distribution of community newsletters a priority activity.
</P>
<P>A-5. BILINGUAL EDUCATION 	Vermont-NEA urges the implementation of a
comprehensive bilingual program for the entire state where it can be clearly
established that a need for such a program exists. The financial resources of
the local, state, and federal governments shall be utilized to achieve adequate
funding for the bilingual program. (1992)
</P>
<P>A-6. COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE 	Vermont-NEA believes that access to
comprehensive health care is a right of every citizen and urges the state of
Vermont to implement a comprehensive health care plan. (1990)

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<H2><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">B. ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF EDUCATION FOR ALL
INDIVIDUALS</FONT>  </H2>
<P>B-1. MULTI-CULTURAL EDUCATION 	Vermont-NEA believes the goal of
multicultural education is the recognition of individual and group differences
and similarities. It is a way of helping students perceive cultural diversity so
they may develop pride in their own cultural legacy, awaken to the ideals
embodied in the cultures of neighbors, and develop an appreciation of languages
and the common humanity shared by all people. (1992) (1993) </P>
<P>B-2. SEXISM IN EDUCATION 	Vermont-NEA believes that sexism and sex
discrimination must be eliminated from instructional environments. 	The
Association: 	A.	Believes that educational materials and processes should
accurately portray women and their contributions throughout history: 	B.	Urges
educators to use instructional materials that portray various careers and
personal roles as acceptable and attainable for all individuals regardless of
gender or sexual orientation: 	C.	Endorses the use of non-sexist language. 	To
attain these goals, Vermont-NEA believes training is necessary for all
educational employees. (1993) </P>
<P>B-3. EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE, AND TECHNOLOGY
EDUCATION 	Vermont-NEA believes mathematics, science and technology education
are means of helping women and minorities enjoy equal opportunities and
equitable treatment for employment and full participation in society. 	The
Association supports development and maintenance of gender-free and culturally
unbiased mathematics, science, and technology programs that meet the needs of
women and ethnic groups. (1993) (1994) </P>
<P>B-4. DISCRIMINATORY ACADEMIC TRACKING 	Vermont-NEA believes academic
tracking based on socioeconomic status, race, or gender must be eliminated in
all public school settings. (1993) </P>
<P>B-5. STUDENT ASSESSMENT PORTFOLIOS 	Vermont-NEA believes that many forms of
evaluation can be useful in the assessment of students. The Association further
believes that authentic measures of student knowledge and performance, as
demonstrated by examples of their work, be used whenever possible to help
evaluate student progress. (1991) (1992) </P>
<P>B-6. METRIC SYSTEM 	Vermont-NEA urges that the International System of Units
(SI Metric System) or weights and measures be taught at all educational levels.

<TITLE>Vermont-NEA Resolution C</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<H2><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">C. PROMOTE THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF CHILDREN AND/OR
STUDENTS  </FONT></H2>
<P><B>I. Health, Welfare and Safety</B></P>
<P>C-1. HEALTH OF CHILDREN 	Vermont-NEA recognizes that the total environment
including home, school, and community affects the mental, emotional, and
physical health of children. 	The Association supports the promotion of a
greater awareness of nutrition education and nutrition related problems.
	Vermont-NEA encourages special preventative services in the schools for the
early detection of impending difficulties. 	The Association promotes an
awareness of wellness and the establishment of programs for the development and
maintenance of lifelong, positive, health habits. (1989) (1990) (1992) (1994)
</P>
<P>C-2. HEALTH CARE FOR ALL CHILDREN 	Vermont-NEA believes that every child
should have direct and confidential access to comprehensive health care. The
Association believes that such health care should be provided by properly
licensed physicians and by other properly licensed health professionals. The
Association urges its affiliates to support legislation to provide comprehensive
health care to all children.  (1995) </P>
<P>C-3. HIV/AIDS 	Vermont-NEA recommends that educational institutions
establish comprehensive HIV/AIDS education programs. These programs must include
education about all means of transmission, including sex and intravenous (IV)
drug use. Information on prevention options must include abstinence and
medically accepted protective devices. 	Furthermore, the Association believes
that proper implementation of these programs requires employee training and
input. The Association further believes that these programs should be presented
by properly licensed/trained personnel. (1993) (1995) </P>
<P>C-4. PROTECTION OF CHILDREN 	Vermont-NEA recognizes the need to protect the
safety and well-being of all children from any form of abuse, exploitation, and
abduction. 	The Association urges school districts to: 	A.	Establish a system
whereby the parents of absent children are notified immediately; 	B.	conduct a
voluntary fingerprinting of children in a non-threatening environment and give
the completed fingerprint cards to parents and/or guardians; 	C.	Cooperate with
community organizations to increase public awareness of the problems of abuse,
exploitation, and abduction; 	D.	Utilize all available means to locate missing
children. 	The Association further urges legislative action be taken to
implement these goals. (1988) (1992) </P>
<P>C-5. CHILD ABUSE 	Vermont-NEA recognizes that teachers are in a key position
to detect suspected cases of child abuse and are mandated to report them to the
proper authorities. Teachers must have immunity from legal action in fulfilling
this obligation. (1990) (1991) (1994)
</P>
<P>C-6. SUBSTANCE ABUSE EDUCATION PROGRAMS 	Vermont-NEA recommends that
educational institutions establish comprehensive substance abuse education
programs. These programs must include education about individual and societal
problems which may result in physiological and psychological drug dependency.
Substance abuse education should also include information about short and long
term effects of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs as they relate to the health,
safety, and well-being of individuals.  </P>
<P><B>II. STUDENT RIGHTS AND CONCERNS  </B></P>
<P>C-7. CONFIDENTIALITY 	Vermont-NEA believes personal information regarding
students and their families is confidential. This information should be shared
only with educational personnel and other caregivers who are currently involved
in providing services to the student. (1993) </P>
<P>C-8. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION 	Vermont-NEA believes that positive and
comprehensive early childhood education is the basis for successful school and
life experiences and believes that preschool through primary age children should
receive sufficient financial and educational resources from the state. </P>
<P>C-9.	MIDDLE SCHOOL PROGRAMS 	Vermont-NEA recognizes the special needs of the
early adolescent. 	The Association encourages the development of middle school
curriculum, guidance and counseling programs, health services, and preservice
and professional development programs for these levels. 	The Association
believes this should be accomplished through the establishment of middle school
teacher preparation programs at accredited institutions of higher education and
through middle school inservice programs. (1988) </P>
<P>C-10. HUMAN SEXUALITY EDUCATION 	Vermont-NEA supports human sexuality
education for all students including knowledge of all reproductive choices.
(1991) </P>
<P>C-11. TIME TO LEARN	 	Vermont-NEA believes that time to learn is essential
in promoting optimum achievement in school. The Association believes that
student absences have adverse effects on program continuity and academic
achievement. Furthermore, excessive or unusual working hours are detrimental to
a student's attention span and academic achievement. The child labor laws, as
structured by the Fair Labor Standards Act, must be monitored, enforced, and
strengthened by local state, and national governing bodies. (1989) (1992) </P>
<P>C-12. HOME SCHOOLING 	Vermont-NEA believes that all children must have an
equitable and quality education. The Association strongly recommends that home
education programs meet state requirements. (1989) </P>
<P>C-13. HIV TESTING OF STUDENTS 	Vermont-NEA opposes mandatory/involuntary HIV
testing of students except where legally defined probable cause exists. (1988)
(1990) (1992) (1993) (1995) </P>
<P>C-14. DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING OF STUDENTS 	Vermont-NEA believes that
mandatory drug and alcohol testing of students is an unwarranted and
unconstitutional invasion of privacy and opposes such testing.  </P>
<P><B>III. EQUAL ACCESS  </B></P>
<P>C-15. JUVENILE CORRECTIONS 	Vermont-NEA favors the maintaining of a Vermont
juvenile correction facility. 	The Association supports a full continuum of
services for children convicted of (or at risk of) committing crimes. This
continuum should include preventative and rehabilitative services, inter-agency
collaboration, family support and intervention, school counseling services, and
alternative education options. 	The Association advocates options that provide a
healthy educational environment conducive to positive change. (1988) (1990) </P>
<P>C-16. EDUCATION OF THE EXCEPTIONAL 	Vermont-NEA recognizes that there must
be increased development of educational programs to meet the needs of all
students (K-12) who have been identified as being exceptional in the creative
arts, intellectual ability, leadership, and/or the psychomotor domain.
	Vermont-NEA supports the multisensory identification of these students through
both formal and informal methods which are developed by a committee, the
majority of which is teachers. Inservice training of educators is needed with
provisions for program development at the local, state, and national level.
	Vermont-NEA supports the formation of a policy by the State Department of
Education for distribution of federal aid for the education of the exceptional.
Financial support should be given to a greater variety of instructional
approaches, thus making more options available to the local schools. (1988)
(1990) (1991) (1992) </P>
<P>C-17. EDUCATION FOR ALL HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 	Vermont-NEA supports a free
appropriate public education for all handicapped students. However, the
Association recognizes that to implement Public Law 94-142 and Vermont Act 230
effectively: 	A.	A favorable learning experience must be created both for
handicapped and nonhandicapped students; 	B.	Regular and special education
teachers, pupil personnel staff, administrators, and parents must share in
planning and implementing programs for the handicapped and must receive a copy
of the I.E.P.;  	C.	All staff must be adequately prepared for their roles
through inservice training and retraining; 	D.	All students must be adequately
prepared for the program; 	E.	The appropriateness of educational methods,
materials, and support services must be determined in cooperation with classroom
teachers; 	F.	The classroom teacher(s) must have an appeal procedure regarding
the implementation of the program, especially in terms of student placement;
	G.	Modification must be made in class size, using a weighted formula,
scheduling, and curriculum design to accommodate the demands of the program;
	H.	Adequate funding must be provided and then used exclusively for this
program; 	I.	Adequate release time must be made available for teachers, so that
they may carry out the increased demands upon them; 	J.	Individual educational
programs should provide appropriate services for the handicapped students and
not be a criterion used for the evaluation of teachers; 	K.	A change in the
State Department of Education's policy for distribution of federal aid to
special education should be effected with financial support given to a greater
variety of instructional approaches, thus making more options available to the
local schools. (1987) (1990) (1992) </P>
<P>C-18. PLACEMENT OF STUDENTS WITH HIV/AIDS 	Vermont-NEA supports a free,
appropriate public education in a least-restrictive environment for all students
with AIDS or infected with HIV. 	The Association believes that the placement of
children in school should be made on a case-by-case basis by a team composed of
qualified health care professionals, school officials, representatives of the
local Association, the child's physician, and the child's parent or guardian.
(1988) (1990) (1992) (1993) </P>
<P>C-19. PASSIVE RESTRAINT 	Vermont-NEA believes that the technique of passive
restraint as a means of controlling the actions of a student is appropriate only
when all other means of control have failed. The Association believes that this
technique should be implemented by persons trained in its use. Vermont-NEA
further believes this policy should include plans, developed with parental
input, that will address not only the child's needs but also implementation of
the policy. (1994) (1995)  </P>

<TITLE>Vermont-NEA Resolution D</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<H2><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">D. PROMOTE PROFESSIONAL EXCELLENCE AMONG EDUCATORS</FONT>
</H2>
<P>D-1. CLASS SIZE 	Vermont-NEA believes that excellence in the classroom can
best be attained by small class size, particularly in grades K-12, which allows
for the optimum development of a student's potential. 	The Association urges
school districts to seek an optimum class size of 15 students. 	The Association
believes that class size maximums must be established based on the type of
students, subject area content, and physical facilities. 	The Association
endorses the limitation of 10 students per class during labs or field activities
in the hazardous occupational programs defined by the Department of Labor, Child
Labor Bulletin 101. Furthermore, the Association should seek the implementation
of a weighted class size formula to reflect the inclusion of special needs
children. 	The Association resists efforts to circumvent laws, regulations, and
policies that mandate maximum class size and maximum teaching loads. (1992) </P>
<P>D-2. TEACHER PREPARATION: ENTRY 	Vermont-NEA believes immediate steps should
be taken to improve standards for entrance into the teaching professional
through cooperative interactions with teacher training institutions. Entrance
requirements should be rigorous, yet flexible enough, to attract candidates who
demonstrate the potential to become effective teachers. 	The Association urges
appropriate state agencies inform teacher preparation institutions of projected
needs. Teacher preparation institutions should prepare prospective teachers in
fields consistent with those needs. (1992) </P>
<P>D-3. TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS: CONTENT 	Vermont-NEA believes that a
sound teacher preparation program must be equitably funded and must: 	A.	Involve
practicing K-12 teachers in the design, implementation, evaluation, and
systematic change of the program; 	B.	Include required courses in the liberal
arts, subject or grade level specialty, reading, writing, research and
information skills, and professional studies; 	C.	Include training in student
assessment, classroom management, discipline, group processes, the dynamics of
intergroup communications, human growth and development, the changing role of
the family, exceptional behaviors, and human relations; 	D.	Include a variety of
field experiences culminating in a one-year internship. (1992) </P>
<P>D-4. TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS: STUDENT TEACHING 	Vermont-NEA believes
that student teachers should be provided with legal status and liability
protection. 	The Association believes that supervising or cooperating classroom
teachers should be compensated monetarily and by reduced teaching assignments
and responsibilities. The recommendation of the supervising or cooperating
classroom teacher should weigh heavily in the decision regarding readiness to
enter the teaching profession. 	Vermont-NEA further believes that the acceptance
of student teachers should be on a voluntary basis. (1992) </P>
<P>D-5.	TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS: PROFESSIONAL PARTICIPATION 	Vermont-NEA
urges licensed educators with teaching experience to become involved in college
and university committees that control teacher education programs. 	The
Association supports placing these teachers in decision making roles in
departments of education, and sharing in the responsibility for practicum
experience with the public schools and teacher preparation institutions.
	Vermont-NEA encourages students to join the Association. (1992) </P>
<P>D-6. CONTINUING EDUCATION 	Vermont-NEA recognizes the need for continuing
education in the career-long development of educators. The Association believes
that federal and state governments, as well as local school systems, have a
responsibility to fund expenses for continuing education programs, courses, and
conferences which benefit the professional development of all staff. 	The
Association encourages its affiliates to develop strategies for the
implementation of educator-governed professional development programs. These
programs must reflect the needs of local educators and students; therefore,
educators must have the decisive voice at every stage of planning,
implementation, and evaluation. 	The Association supports increased federal
funding and the appropriation of state and local funds to ensure the existence
of teacher centers in sufficient numbers to serve all the educators of Vermont.
(1992) (1994) </P>
<P>D-7. ACCOUNTABILITY AND ASSESSMENT 	Vermont-NEA believes in accountability.
	The Association believes that school employees can be accountable only to the
degree that they share responsibility in educational decision-making and to the
degree that other parties who share this responsibility &#151; legislators,
other government officials, school boards, administrators, parents, students,
and taxpayers &#151; are also held accountable. 	Vermont-NEA believes there
should be no single local, regional, or statewide assessment system. The
Association will resist any attempt to transform assessment results into a state
testing program that would seek to measure all students, teachers, or school
systems by a single standard. (1988) (1990) (1991) </P>
<P>D-8. TEACHER COMPETENCY TESTING 	Vermont-NEA believes that competency
testing must not be used as a condition of employment, relicensing, evaluation,
placement, ranking, or promotion of licensed teachers. The Association also
opposes the use of pupil progress, standardized achievement test, or student
assessment tests for purposes of teacher evaluation. (1988)
</P>
<P>D-9. EVALUATION OF EDUCATIONAL EMPLOYEES 	Vermont-NEA advocates a formal
evaluation system for every educational employee in every local school district
because consistent evaluations of on-the-job performance are the only
appropriate way to assess and assure the competency of practicing educational
employees. 	An effective evaluation procedure, supported by well-developed,
continued professional growth programs, will enable all educational employees to
keep abreast of developments in their area of specialization and to continue
professional growth. Such procedures also can identify educational employees
with instructional deficiencies and provide them with remedial options,
counseling, sufficient resources, and opportunities to observe other educational
employees. Regular assessment and supportive resources will ensure that those
who continue in this capacity are competent. If, after an evaluation process
that follows all the above provisions of this resolution, and if, after being
given sufficient time and opportunity for improvement, an educational employee
is formally re-evaluated and there is documentation of incompetence, dismissal
proceedings with guaranteed due process should be instituted. Therefore, it is
essential that administrators and/or mutually agreed upon evaluators be properly
trained and held accountable for the implementation of appropriate and fair
evaluation systems. 	A school district's evaluation procedure will be developed
and maintained in conjunction with representatives selected by the local
Association	and will include: 	A.	Clear performance expectations: 	B.	Regular
observation of classroom performance, with advance notice and discussion of
evaluation visits and a timely consultation after each visit; 	C.	A written
evaluation report provided to the educational employee; 	D. 	Opportunity for a
written response prior to the placement of the evaluation in the personnel file.
Participation in an evaluation process shall not waive an educational employee's
right to due process in any subsequent contractual or legal proceeding. (1992)
(1994) </P>
<P>D-10. ADMINISTRATOR TRAINING AND EVALUATION 	Vermont-NEA believes that
administrators and staff are partners in the total school program.
Administrators must maintain valid administrator licensure and have annual
teaching experience. Areas of training should include participatory
decision-making, interpersonal skills, personnel selection, staff evaluation,
curriculum, and school management techniques. 	The Association believes that
procedures for evaluation of administrators should include evaluations by the
school employees with their direct supervision. (1988) </P>
<P>D-11. CONSULTANTS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 	Vermont-NEA supports the
full staffing and full funding of the State Department of Education to attract
and keep professional consultants in all positions.  </P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<H2><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">E. GAIN RECOGNITION OF THE BASIC IMPORTANCE OF THE
TEACHER IN THE LEARNING PROCESS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES IN THE EDUCATIONAL EFFORT
</FONT> </H2>
<P>E-1. IMPROVEMENT OF INSTRUCTION 	Vermont-NEA believes that a prime
responsibility of professional associations is to stimulate significant
improvements in the quality of instruction. Much of the responsibility to make
educational changes lies with the teachers through their influence and
involvement in democratic decision-making, in and out of school. 	Local school
systems shall be urged to provide classroom teachers with support staff to free
the teacher from nonteaching duties. Support staff may be either
paraprofessionals or auxiliary personnel. (1988) (1989) </P>
<P>E-2. SCHOOL RESTRUCTURING 	Vermont-NEA believes in school restructuring that
is flexible, locally defined, and responsive to the needs and interests of
teachers, students, and the broader educational community. 	The Association
believes in a school restructuring process which ensures teachers share in
leadership, authority, and governance. (1992) </P>
<P>E-3. FREEDOM OF CHOICE IN READING 	Vermont-NEA strongly supports the right
to read and believes that licensed professionals within the school are best
equipped to choose material to be used in the classroom or to be available in
the school library. In instances where a move toward censorship occurs, a review
procedure, similar to that of the American Library Association, should be
implemented. (1988) </P>
<P>E-4. VOLUNTEERS 	Vermont-NEA recognizes and encourages business and
community involvement through volunteerism. However, the work performed by
volunteers shall not result in any violation of the applicable bargaining unit
agreement nor jeopardize any educational employee's position. (1990) (1993)

<TITLE>Vermont-NEA Resolution F</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<H2><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">F. PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF EDUCATIONAL EMPLOYEES AND
ADVANCE THEIR INTEREST AND WELFARE</FONT>  </H2>
<P>F-1. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYEES 	Vermont-NEA shall insist upon development and
enforcement of laws, regulations, policies, and procedures that guarantee the
safety of educators and other school personnel from verbal and physical attacks
on their persons or property. The Association further believes that when school
personnel are victims of physical attack, verbal abuse, theft, vandalism, or
harassment, they should receive full support of their employer in pursuing legal
and other remedies.  (1994) (1995) </P>
<P>F-2. EMPLOYEE RIGHTS PENDING COURT ACTIONS 	Vermont-NEA believes when
criminal charges or civil lawsuits are filed against a school employee, the
right of due process must be guaranteed. If an employee is removed from student
contact or suspended from a position due to pending court action, all employment
rights of the employee shall remain in force, including full compensation and
job security. 	The Association urges its locals to negotiate contract provisions
covering procedures to be followed until final disposition of the case. (1993)
</P>
<P>F-3. DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING OF EMPLOYEES AND JOB APPLICANTS 	Vermont-NEA
believes that mandatory drug and alcohol testing of employees and job applicants
is an unwarranted and unconstitutional invasion of privacy and opposes such
testing. (1991) </P>
<P>F-4. CONFIDENTIALITY 	Vermont-NEA supports professionalism in the
educational environment. 	The Association believes that the rights to
confidentiality of all educational employees should be respected by the
educational community. (1994) </P>
<P>F-5. DUTIES IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS	 	Vermont-NEA believes that in emergency
situations, such as fires and bomb threats, the duty of the teachers is to
escort students from the buildings and to remain with these students. 	The
Association believes that requests by the administration, even on a voluntary
basis, for teachers to serve on bomb search squads and the like are construed as
clearly outside normal teaching duties. 	Vermont-NEA urges local Associations to
become aware of existing local guidelines, and, in the absence of such, to
participate in the immediate development of a written procedure. </P>
<P>F-6. TRANSPORTATION	 	Vermont-NEA urges enactment of legislation that would
require local school systems to provide and to incur the expense of
transportation liability insurance for school employees who are requested or
required to transport students by private vehicle for any school related
function. </P>
<P>F-7. UNDERUTILIZATION OF TEACHERS 	Vermont-NEA condemns the underutilization
of teachers in Vermont's and the nation's schools which has resulted in
unemployment among professional educators at a time when the need for
intensifying public education and reeducation has increased greatly. </P>
<P>F-8. LICENSED PARAPROFESSIONALS 	Vermont-NEA believes paraprofessionals
holding teacher licenses who are assigned professional duties should receive
professional salaries during the time they are performing these duties. 	The
Association urges local affiliates to oppose efforts by school boards to use the
employment of paraprofessionals in replacing professionals or increasing class
size. (1991) (1992) (1993)</P>
<P>F-9. ASSIGNMENT OF SUBSTITUTES 	Vermont-NEA condemns the practice of
assigning substitute teachers to regular positions. Such positions should be
filled by available licensed teachers who are eligible to be placed on
contractual status by the school district. The Association condemns the practice
of utilizing licensed teachers to substitute for personnel on extended leave
without providing full pay for the substitutes. (1988) (1992) </P>
<P>F-10. HIV TESTING OF EMPLOYEES 	Vermont-NEA opposes mandatory/involuntary
testing of school employees for HIV. (1988) (1990) (1991 (1992) (1993) (1994)
(1995) </P>
<P>F-11. EMPLOYEES WITH HIV/AIDS 	Vermont-NEA believes that educational
employees shall not be fired, nonrenewed, suspended (with or without pay),
transferred, or subjected to any other adverse employment action solely because
they have tested positive for HIV antibody or have been diagnosed as having AIDS
or AIDS-Related Complex (ARC). (1988) (1990) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995)  </P>
<P><B>II. CONTRACT ISSUES  </B></P>
<P>F-12. EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT PERSONNEL 	Vermont-NEA believes that greater
emphasis must be placed upon securing and maintaining the most capable
educational support personnel. The Association recognizes that educational
support personnel share the same community interest with the professional staff.
The Association urges that salaries and benefits for educational support
personnel be competitive with those similar positions in private industry and
business within the geographic area. 	Furthermore, the Association believes that
paraprofessionals should be licensed and urges teachers to become involved in
the orientation and training of paraprofessionals and other educational support
personnel. (1991) (1992) (1993) </P>
<P>F-13. UNIFORM PAY STRUCTURE 	Vermont-NEA and its affiliates believe that
school employees should be adequately compensated by a uniform pay structure as
bargained with local school districts. The Association opposes &quot;merit pay&quot;
or any other compensation plan based on preferential, subjective, or politically
motivated criteria. </P>
<P>F-14. REDUCTION IN FORCE 	Vermont-NEA urges its affiliates to negotiate in
master contracts criteria to be utilized should reduction in force occur.
Criteria should include seniority, objectivity, nondiscrimination, uniformity of
application, and affirmative action. </P>
<P>F-15. STAFF WELLNESS 	Vermont-NEA believes that the physical, emotional, and
mental health of staff has an impact on performance, students, and associates.
The Association urges school districts to promote an awareness of wellness among
all personnel and establish programs for the development and maintenance of
positive health habits. 	Vermont-NEA advocates Employee Assistance Programs as a
voluntary resource that would assist school employees who are experiencing
significant professional or personal problems. These programs would provide
confidential, professional counseling leading to improved health and job
effectiveness. (1989) (1990) </P>
<P>F-16. BASIC CONTRACT STANDARDS 	Vermont-NEA and its affiliates believe that
school employee/school board collective bargaining agreements should contain
certain standard contractual concepts. Therefore, Vermont-NEA and its affiliates
will pursue agreements which provide for the following concepts: 	A.	A grievance
procedure that terminates with final and binding arbitration; 	B.	All
discipline, including suspension, dismissal and nonrenewal, subject to due
process and just cause through final and binding arbitration; 	C.	Contractually
defined procedures that provide for a published seniority list and layoff and
recall based on seniority as bargaining unit members and licensure;
	D.	Employer-paid fringe benefits that fully cover bargaining unit members and
their families; 	E. 	Employer-paid insurance packages which incorporate the
benefits of wellness care including comprehensive health, life and dental
insurance, and employee assistance programs; 	F.	Membership in the Association
or the payment of a service fee as a condition of employment; 	G.	Required
posting of all vacant or newly created positions along with binding rights based
upon seniority and licensure where licensure is applicable; 	H.	Preparation and
planning time for all members of the bargaining unit at a minimum of 45
consecutive minutes within each school day; 	I. 	Enforceable class size and
teaching load maximums; 	J.	Duty-free lunch periods for all members of the
bargaining unit; 	K.	Income protection for long-term illnesses and disabilities;
	L.	Nondiscriminatory treatment of bargaining unit members with regard to their
gender, sexual orientation, race, creed, religion, residence, physical
characteristics, handicap, age, marital status, or grade/subject taught;
	M.	Contractually defined evaluation procedures; 	N.	Any school employee
disabled by pregnancy entitled to all contract benefits available to school
employees for other causes and illnesses; 	O.	Paid parental/child rearing leave
for males or females to provide care for natural or adopted children;
	P.	Release time for Association business will full pay and fringe benefits;
	Q.	Contractually defined procedures for ensuring school employee
decision-making in curriculum design and related instructional areas as well as
instructional management and reporting systems; 	R.	Salary schedules based upon
preparation, professional growth, and length of service; 	S.	All extracurricular
and extra duty assignments to be filled on a voluntary basis with provision for
adequate compensation for school employees who accept such assignments; 	T.	The
recognized bargaining unit to include continuing education teachers, part-time
teachers, school nurses, school social workers, librarians, school
psychologists, counselors, department heads, vocational education teachers,
teachers of extracurricular activities, therapists, and other professional
special education personnel as well as regular classroom teachers, and all other
nonsupervisory school employees of the school district; 	U.	A provision for fair
and equitable treatment of all bargaining unit members; 	V.	Placement of newly
appointed faculty on step according to their teaching experience, with full
credit on salary scale for previous experience; 	W.	Part-time faculty, working
half time or more, shall advance on the salary schedule a full step each year.
They shall receive the same salary and fringe benefits as full-time faculty,
pro-rated according to the work load. 	</P>
<P>Vermont-NEA and its affiliates further believe that school employee/school
board collective bargaining agreements should define the salaries, hours, and
other terms and conditions of employment of educational employees. Such
agreements should not include provisions which restrict or demean the dignity of
school employees. Therefore, Vermont-NEA and its affiliates will resist
agreements which provide the following concepts: 	A.	A so-called &quot;penalty&quot;
or liquidated damage clause that deprives a school employee of employment
mobility or compensation earned for services provided; 	B.	Merit pay or any
other compensation scheme which substitutes preferential, subjectively granted,
or politically vulnerable salaries for services rendered. (1988) (1989) (1992) 
</P>
<P><B>III. RETIREMENT AND SOCIAL SECURITY </B>
</P>
<P>F-17. RETIREMENT	 	Vermont-NEA shall provide leadership to ensure that the
State Teachers' Retirement System should: 	A.	Be soundly financed,
professionally managed, and responsively administered, with social
responsibility; 	B.	Include retirement benefits that accrue at the rate of 2.0
percent for each year of service credit, of a teacher's mean salary of the
highest three years, with full benefits to be realized after twenty-five years
of service. 	C.	Include a legal minimum average compensation to be determined
and established annually as the current teacher average salary for the State of
Vermont. Upon normal retirement, no teacher will receive less than one-half of
the legal minimum average compensation, subject to the normal discounts for
early retirement; 	D.	Include automatic and realistic benefit increments to
reflect increases in the cost of living; 	E.	Include comprehensive and
meaningful disability and survivor benefits; 	F.	Include a Group Health
Insurance Plan to be provided upon retirement; 	G.	Provide for full vesting at
the age of 55 or after five years of service; 	H.	Provide for early retirement
benefits after the completion of five years of service and the attainment of
fifty-five years of age; 	I.	Include a provision for service credit for those
teachers who chose not to join the retirement system until required to do so;
	J.	Include a provision for service credit to educators with service in
post-secondary educational institutions; 	K.	Provide for a pre-tax savings plan
toward which teachers may contribute and whose contributions will be matched by
the employer and the State. 	Retiring teachers who are not eligible for medicare
benefits due to their age at retirement will be able to remain in the school
district's health insurance plan. Until the retiree is eligible for social
security and medicare benefits, school districts will be encouraged to pay for
these premiums. (1989) (1990) (1992)  </P>
<P><B>IV. ASSOCIATION ISSUES FOR EMPLOYEE WELFARE  </B></P>
<P>F-18. STAFF MERGERS 	Vermont-NEA supports and encourages the merging of
teacher and educational support personnel units. (1992) </P>
<P>F-19. PROFESSIONAL RESOURCES 	Vermont-NEA believes in professionalism among
its members. To that end, the Association encourages its members to become as
informed as possible on educational issues. 	Vermont-NEA further believes that
one of its functions as a professional organization is to serve as an
educational issues resource center for its members. (1994) </P>
<P>F-20. REGIONAL TRAINING	 	Vermont-NEA strongly supports regional training in
Association skills for its members. (1988) </P>
<P>F-21. REGIONAL BARGAINING 	Vermont-NEA strongly supports regional bargaining
and regional consolidation of locals as the direction to be followed in
collective bargaining, with the ultimate objective to be coordinated contract
bargaining consistent with current collective bargaining laws. 	The Association
believes that active participation by local affiliates in the Regional
Bargaining Councils will improve the economic status of Vermont educators.
(1994) </P>
<P>F-22. UNIFORM SCHOOL CALENDAR 	Vermont-NEA supports legislation that allows
negotiation between Vermont-NEA and the Vermont Superintendents' Association and
the Vermont Department of Education to develop a uniform school calendar. 	Until
a uniform calendar can be developed in this manner, Vermont-NEA supports the
efforts of Regional Bargaining Councils to propose and negotiate regional
calendars. (1988) (1995)
</P>
<P>F-23. SUMMER SCHOOL AND MODIFIED CALENDARS 	Vermont-NEA believes that
affected local affiliates must participate fully in the design, authorization,
implementation, evaluation, and continuation of summer school, the extended
school year, year-round schools, and/or a modified calendar. Governing policies
must take into consideration the impact on the community and be in accordance
with the Association's principles for professional salaries and class size.
Employment in summer school or other school programs outside the contracted days
must be on a voluntary basis.  (1995) </P>
<P>F-24. UNISERV COUNCILS 	Vermont-NEA encourages participation in UniServ
Councils. Such councils provide an opportunity for all locals within their
UniServ districts to meet, share ideas, solve problems, and set the direction
for their districts. </P>
<P>F-25. VERMONT-NEA MEETINGS 	Vermont-NEA shall not hold its state convention
or its Representative Assembly in any city where any local affiliate is on
strike at the time of its convention. </P>
<P>F-26. MANDATORY BINDING INTEREST ARBITRATION 	Vermont-NEA supports the use
of mandatory binding interest arbitration for final settlement of contract
disputes between local Associations and school boards if the parties cannot
mutually resolve their differing positions within the legally mandated time
limits.  Furthermore, the Association believes that mandatory binding interest
arbitration should replace the legal right of teachers to strike only if the
right of school boards to impose terms and conditions of employment is
eliminated.  </P>

<TITLE>Vermont-NEA Resolution G</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<H2><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">G. SECURE PROFESSIONAL AUTONOMY</FONT>  </H2>
<P>G-1. LICENSURE 	Vermont-NEA advocates rigorous state standards for entry
into the teaching profession. These standards shall include above-average
college grades, field training experience that includes successful completion of
student teaching, and demonstration of proficiency on appropriate pedagogical
and subject matter tests. Tests should be valid and unbiased and should be
included as one element of comprehensive assessment for completion of a teacher
preparation program as well as for licensure into the profession. 	The
Association asserts that a teaching license should signify that an individual
entering the teaching profession is competent to teach. A teaching license must
be legally recognized as the primary requirement for employment in every public
and private school (K-12). No license should be issued unless an individual
possesses the entry-level knowledge and skills required for teaching. No
temporary or emergency licenses should be issued. No assignments should be
permitted outside the teacher's area of licensure without appropriate concurrent
retraining supported by the local district. Revocation of a teaching license
must be for just cause and consistent with an equitable due process procedure.
	The Association supports regulations that would put licensed educators with
teaching experience in decision-making roles in licensing agencies. 	The
Association believes that all substitutes employed in the State of Vermont
should be licensed to teach in Vermont. Beyond fifteen days in one level of
assignment, a substitute should be licensed in that area. (1988) </P>
<P>G-2. PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS BOARD 	Vermont-NEA believes that the profession
must govern itself. The Association also believes that each state should have a
professional standards board, composed of a majority of practicing public school
teachers. 	Professional standards boards should have exclusive authority to
license and to determine criteria for how a state certificate will be recognized
for professional educators. Further, these boards should have the exclusive
authority to establish the standards regarding licensure, including procedures
for suspension and revocation. The Association opposes legislation that
compromises the authority of state standards boards and urges the elimination of
state statutes that conflict with this authority.  (1995) </P>
<P>G-3  NEW AND EMERGING LICENSURE 	Vermont-NEA recognizes that education is
ever changing.  Licensure requirements must be clarified and delineated to keep
pace with developing educational initiatives.  The Association believes that it
is the duty and responsibility of the Professional Standards Board to redefine
these licensure requirements. (1996)  </P>

<P>H-1. ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC POLICYMAKING 	Vermont-NEA believes that
every educator has the right and obligation to be an informed and politically
active person. 	The Association urges educators to register and vote,
participate in party organizations, discuss political issues publicly, campaign
for candidates, contribute to campaigns of candidates, lobby, organize political
action groups, and run for and serve in public office without curtailment of
annual increments, tenure, retirement, or seniority rights. 	Major decisions
affecting public schools are made by elected officials or their appointees.
Therefore, the Association believes that it is the duty and responsibility or
educators to involve themselves in the selection, election, and reelection of
qualified committed candidates who support goals that provide quality
education.	  </P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<H2><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">I. PROMOTE AND PROTECT HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS</FONT>
 </H2>
<P>I-1. CIVIL RIGHTS 	Vermont-NEA is committed to the achievement of a totally
integrated society and calls for the elimination of barriers of race, color,
national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, size,
marital status, and economic status which prevent individuals from exercising
their rights including liberties decreed in common law, the Constitution, and
statutes of the state of Vermont and the United States. (1993) </P>
<P>I-2. SEX DISCRIMINATION AND EQUAL RIGHTS 	Vermont-NEA urges the full
compliance of Title IX of the Educational Amendment of 1972. The Association
urges that the Equal Rights Amendment be passed as soon as feasible. </P>
<P>I-3.  PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS 	Vermont-NEA believes people living with
HIV/AIDS should be ensured fair and equitable treatment in our communities,
allowing equal access to education, employment, living conditions, and all
rights guaranteed by law. (1994) </P>
<P>I-4. SEXUAL HARASSMENT 	Vermont-NEA believes that sexual harassment is a
form of sex discrimination or abuse. 	The Association further believes that
educational employees and students should be protected from sexual harassment. 
The Association encourages its locals to work with educational institutions to:
	A. 	Establish strong policies defining and prohibiting sexual harassment; 	B.
	Develop and institute educational programs designed to help people recognize,
understand, prevent, combat and eliminate sexual harassment; 	C. 	Develop and
publicize a grievance procedure that encourages the reporting of incidents of
sexual harassment, resolves complaints promptly, and protects the rights of all
parties. 	Vermont-NEA also believes that counseling services must be provided
for all parties involved in sexual harassment cases. (1994) </P>
<P>I-5. SEXUAL ASSAULT 	Vermont-NEA supports efforts that will prevent and
protect all individuals from becoming victims of sexual assault. 	The
Association encourages its locals to work with educational institutions to
develop and institute educational programs designed to help people recognize,
understand, prevent, combat, and eliminate sexual assault. 	The Association
believes that counseling services must be provided for students and school
personnel who are victims of sexual assault.  The Association further believes
that when school personnel are the victims of sexual assault, they should
receive the full support of their employer in pursuing legal and other remedies.
(1994) </P>
<P>I-6. FAMILY PLANNING 	Vermont-NEA supports family planning, including the
right to reproductive freedom. (1990)
</P>
<P>I-7. NUCLEAR WEAPONRY 	Vermont-NEA recognizes that federal spending for
nuclear weaponry is being increased while funds for education and other social
services are being cut. 	The Association supports a mutually verifiable freeze
on nuclear weapons as eighteen Vermont town meetings did in 1981 and one hundred
sixty-one did in 1982. The Association urges that a mutually verifiable freeze
be followed by reductions in every type of nuclear weapon and that these issues
be discussed by all. 	The Association calls for the transfer of funds from
nuclear weaponry to education and other social services, and urges its members
to work with other concerned organizations to have this issue brought before the
public in any appropriate way.  </P>

<H1>U.S. History Debates -- The Progressive Era and the Proper Role of
Government
</H1>
<H4>Submitted by David Schoales, Morristown</H4>
<P>This unit is designed to enable high school students to achieve the Vermont
Framework standard for communication which requires them to &quot;use verbal and
nonverbal skills to express themselves with power and purpose.&quot; It includes
introductory and enabling activities as well as assessment guides and rubrics.
</P>
<P>This week we will be discussing the Progressives and looking for ways we can
continue their work toward making the United States a better country. For the
next two days we will be working in pairs to select an issue from the
Progressive Era and find background information about that issue. On the third
day, each student pair will prepare and engage in a debate about their issue.
Each student will take a side of the issue and play the role of someone
representing that side by presenting arguments in a debate. </P>
<P>Before you begin the research phase, it will be necessary to understand the
answers to the following questions:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>What did the Progressives believe about society?
<UL>
<LI>Do you agree with them?</LI></UL>
</LI>
<LI>Which of the achievements of the Progressives do you believe was the most
important for the United States?
<UL>
<LI>Why do you believe this was an important achievement? </LI>
<LI>How did it help the country?</LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P>A successful debate performance will include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Clear evidence of planning and research</LI>
<LI>Background information which clearly communicates the facts of the issue</LI>
<LI>Effective use of pace, volume, enunciation, and gestures (body language)</LI>
<LI>Correct grammar and word choice</LI>
<LI>Expression of the importance of the issue</LI>
<LI>Clear expression of the presenter's opinion, preferences, feelings</LI></OL>
<P>Once we have concluded the Progressive Era debate, each pair will choose a
problem currently facing our country and prepare a debate presentation arguing
for local, state or federal government action (or inaction) to help solve the
problem.

<H1>International research on food via telecommunications</H1>
<H4>Submitted by Dianne Gross Percy, Milton</H4>
<P>In this seven-week unit, fifth and sixth grade students at School Street
School in Milton learned to communicate via computers. They used
telecommunications to gather data about food from the international community
and to enrich their understanding of the world community through cross-cultural
contacts.
</P>
<P>First, classrooms within the school formed teams and hooked up by e-mail.
They worked out the bugs and learned data gathering skills in school, before
reaching out to the international community. </P>
<P>The teams selected a concept around food -- nutrition, cost, preparation,
eating out, waste disposal, sources of food, etc., and developed questions. 
Then, the students attempted to make contact with schools and kid nets around
the world. </P>
<P>The preparing and the waiting proved to be important lessons. Students and
teachers learned the importance of being flexible and succeeded in linking up
with Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>These Vermont-NEA members worked on the F.O.O.D. (Formulating Options On
Diversity) unit: Dianne Gross Percy, Maggie Stockwell, and Edward Barry. Call
Dianne for more information: 802-878-2744.

<H1>Seventh Grade Geography Project Ecosystems
</H1>
<H4>Submitted by Barbara Barbour, Windsor</H4>
<P>My seventh grade geography classes are given coordinates of an imaginary
island. Students, in groups of three or four, locate the island and describe the
inhabitants, climate and vegetation. They are instructed to develop communities
on the island. Students are to write about what the environment consists of in
order to sustain the inhabitants, as well as the effect each inhabitant has on
the island's environment. </P>
<P>Students study climate, food chains, biomes, adaptation, economy,
government, industry and the effects of each. Simcity is used as one of the
learning tools. Students learn research, outlining, writing, and presentation
skills in their English classes and use these skills to write an essay about
their island and present that information to the class. Instruction in social
studies and science classes support the project, as well.
</P>
<P>Call Barbara Barbour for more information: 802-436-2038.

<H1>Ocean Study/Water Unit
</H1>
<H4>Submitted by Harriet Grenier, Elizabeth Sabens, Mary Mello, Olivia
Salzberg, Lisa Kitchen, Terry Hodgdon, and Ellen Gittelsohn, Montpelier</H4>
<P>A group of teachers at Union Elementary School in Montpelier collaborated on
a thematic unit about water and ocean. </P>
<P>We built constructions from tubing and rain spouts to observe and experiment
with water flow and force. We constructed inflatable structures out of clear
plastic for creating an underwater habitat and a simulated submarine. 
</P>
<P>The projects encompass each field of study: science, math, language arts,
history, music, art and health. There are literature based activities on the
ocean in the following categories: seashore, tides and reefs; the ocean floor;
plants and animals; folklore and myths; ships and pirates; and ecology and
pollution issues. We also created a musical show entitled &quot;Raindrop
Journey,&quot; which showcases the children's knowledge learned from this unit.
</P>
<P>If you are interested in these materials or ideas, contact: Harriet Grenier,
Elizabeth Sabens, Mary Mello, Olivia Salzberg, Lisa Kitchen, Terry Hodgdon, or
Ellen Gittelsohn at Union Elementary, 1 Park Avenue, Montpelier, VT 05602.

<P><I>To Kill a Mockingbird</I>
<B>&quot;There are some men in this world who are born to do our unpleasant
jobs for us.&quot;
</B></P>
<H1>Another framework for understanding Atticus Finch
</H1>
<H4>Submitted by Stephanie Keitel, Union-32</H4>
<P>Quotes were reviewed using the framework of emotional bank accounts from
Steven Covey's book, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. As a class, we
mapped emotional bank account deposits on a circle web of characters. Students
became so adept at this discussion framework that they lead several classes
using teacher prepared materials. Students also personalized the principals of
emotional bank accounts, resulting in many discussions of the qualities of true
friends. These discussions resulted in explicit visual proof of Atticus'
emotional deposits into both individuals and the community of Maycomb which
allowed the town's people to respect/tolerate his defense of Tom Robinson.
</P>
<P>This unit is easy to pull together with your own favorite quotes and Covey's
book. This was originally taught in a low skills English class, successfully
helping students see how one character's behavior influences other characters'
reactions. It easily could be adapted to other ability groups.

<H1>Listening for Emotion</H1>
<H4>Submitted by Tom Walters, Camel's Hump Middle School</H4>
<P>This Music Education lesson is for 5th and/or 6th grade students. 
</P>
<P>The lesson starts out with a general discussion about &#147;active&#148; vs.
 &#147;passive&#148; listening.  I usually use the example &#147;when you&#146;re
doing your homework with the radio on, that&#146;s passive listening. Today, we&#146;ll
practice listening with your whole mind, with no distractions.&#148; I then hand
out the worksheet while explaining the directions.  The students read down the
list of emotions on the right-hand side of the first page.  If there is a word
they don&#146;t understand, I&#146;ll usually ask if anyone else in the class
knows the meaning (there is an element of new vocabulary in this lesson). I try
to add a contextual meaning for the word.  For instance, I&#146;ll say that &#147;mournful&#148;
is usually associated with death or loss.  &#147;Mournful is how you would feel
if you had a pet hamster, and the hamster died.&#148; </P>
<P>We then turn to page two and prepare for listening.  I make a transparency
of the song lyrics, lower the lights and project the lyrics on a screen.  I
insist upon total quiet in the classroom; if anyone talks, I start the music
over again.  The first time I used this lesson, I chose &#147;Tears in Heaven&#148;
as the first listening example.  The song was written by Eric Clapton in
response to the real-life death of his son (most kids know this fact). 
Invariably, when the music starts there is a murmur of recognition.  However,
most children have never truly listened to the song. </P>
<P>As the song plays, the students choose words from the list on side one that
describe how the song makes them feel.  I purposefully placed the words on side
one so that they must hold the word in their mind for a second as they turn the
sheet back and forth.  Also, I chose music with veiled meaning to encourage
critical and abstract thinking.  For example, in &#147;Tears in Heaven&#148; it&#146;s
not clear whether the song is happy or sad.  Mr. Clapton obviously mourns the
death of his son but is also happy as he is sure they&#146;ll meet in heaven. 
These elements of the song always spur lively discussion in the class.  It is in
this discussion phase that students practice using the new vocabulary words and
more importantly, learn language to express their emotions.  Keep in mind that
the lights in the classroom are dimmed at this time creating a rather &#147;safe&#148;
environment.  I saw tears in several students eyes as we listened. </P>
<P>I&#146;ve included lyrics for the second listening selection, &#147;Burlingtown,&#148;
as composed by Todd Thibaud and Jim Wooster of the &#147;Courage Brothers.&#148;
Again, the emotional content of this song can be taken in several ways: the
singer is both happy and sad upon returning to his hometown of Burlington,
Vermont.  The kids in Richmond always get a kick out of hearing &#147;Interstate
89&#148; in a song. 
</P>
<P><B>Resources</B></P>
<P>Photocopied worksheets and pencils, transparencies and overhead projector,
CD player and CD&#146;s. 
</P>
<P><B>Method of assessment </B></P>
<P>The only assessment I give for this lesson is one for behavior; I grade each
class based on their level of involvement and engagement.  Since the goal of the
lesson is to teach children to use emotionally descriptive and appropriate
vocabulary, I feel it would be counter-productive to assign any shade of right
or wrong to a child&#146;s opinion or feelings in this case.

<H1><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">7 ideas to help build students' self-esteem  
</FONT></H1>
<P><I><B>It is likely there will be students in your classroom who come to
school with poor self-esteem. They won't care about their achievements, or
they'll shun your acknowledgment of their worth. They will be afraid, though
they may never say so, that they will never be good at anything.  	Children need
to know that others appreciate them if they are to develop a sense of
self-esteem. Here are some ideas to help build your students' self-esteem:  </B></I></P>
<P><B>l.	Build in success. </B>Create situations where failure is not likely
to occur and structure tasks into a series of easy-to-achieve steps. Help
students build a chain of continuous, unbroken successes.  </P>
<P><B>2. 	Make your expectations realistic.</B> Clearly state what you expect
and explore with your students  whether your expectations resemble theirs.  </P>
<P><B>3.	Find ways to keep interest high!</B>  Empathize a little. Try to keep
lessons interesting, and acknowledge when a task becomes &quot;old.&quot;
Students may appreciate your effort and resist the work less.  </P>
<P><B>4.	State the positive.</B> Stay away from typically judgmental
evaluations like &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong,&quot; &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad.&quot;
Try describing your students' work instead. Emphasize the positive. Tell
students what you see and how you feel about it.  </P>
<P><B>5.	Capitalize on achievements.</B> Use one success to create another.
Share successes with parents by sending notes home. Use &quot;Success Cards.&quot;
Be sure to read the positive message to the child first.  </P>
<P><B>6.	Share evidence of success.</B> Keep a portfolio of children's
writing, drawings, and other work.   </P>
<P><B>7.	Recruit parents and guardians.</B> Encourage parents and guardians to
display their child's work. Suggest that they praise the work in front of
friends and relatives. Tell them to make it a point to compliment some portion
of their child's work and to recognize even a small improvement. And advise that
they treasure their child's work by saving samples from every school year.

<P><B><I>Helping students manage their own behavior in ways that help them
learn is a longstanding goal of all teachers. Here are some ideas to consider:</I></B>
  </P>
<P><B>l.	Be fair.</B> Be the kind of person children trust -- firm, fair,
friendly, respectful, with a sense of humor.  </P>
<P><B>2.	Keep an orderly classroom.</B> Maintaining a cheerful, organized
classroom encourages good student behavior.  </P>
<P><B>3.	Get to know your students.</B> If you do, you'll develop a &quot;sixth
sense&quot; for anticipating trouble before it begins.  </P>
<P><B>4.	Make learning fun!</B> Make students' days in school interesting and
fun, as well as relevant to their lives.  </P>
<P><B>5.	Avoid arguing.</B> Discussions are invaluable, but arguments are not
-- especially in front of the other students.  </P>
<P><B>6.	Keep the rules simple.</B> Establish only a few classroom rules and
state them simply, clearly, and often.  </P>
<P><B>7. 	Don't threaten. Act. </B>Try not to use threats to enforce
discipline, and never humiliate a child in your classroom.  </P>
<P><B>8.	Let your students know you care</B> about them. Determine jointly
with your students what is acceptable in terms of behavior, and what is not. 
</P>
<P><B>9.	Understand your school district's official policies</B> on student
discipline.  </P>
<P><B>10.	Consult your Association representative</B> and the building
principal to learn what procedures you are expected to follow and what support
is available to you.  </P>
<P><B>11.	Consult with parents/guardians</B> -- they can be important allies
and resources as you create a good learning environment for all the students in
your classroom. 
</P>
<P><B>12.	Don't go it alone.</B> Find a colleague to whom you  can go for
advice and direction.

</FONT></H1>
<P><B><I>Good school public relations is not just publicity -- it's a total
program built on the cooperation of all school employees. One of the essential
ingredients is &quot;personal PR&quot; -- doing the things that  promote both
your profession and yourself as a teacher. Some ideas:  </I></B></P>
<P><B>l.</B>	Doctors do it. Lawyers do it. <B>Proudly display your
qualifications to teach</B> -- license, diplomas, awards, honors, and
commendations.  </P>
<P><B>2.	Tell your students about yourself </B>and make them aware of your
life &quot;outside school.&quot;  </P>
<P><B>3.	Surround yourself with personal items</B> that reflect you as an
individual -- family photos, desk ornaments, plants, books.  </P>
<P><B>4.	Bring your family and friends</B> to after-school and community
activities.  </P>
<P><B>5.	Do business in the community</B> in which you teach and patronize
businesses owned or run by your students' families.  </P>
<P><B>6.	Write thank-you notes</B> to students, parents, and colleagues. Use
notepaper or stationery that identifies you as a teacher. 
</P>
<P><B>7.</B>	Use the bulletin board or display case in the front of the
building to
<B>spotlight individual staff members.</B>  </P>
<P><B>8. 	Purchase business cards</B> for use in contacting businesses and
parents.</P>

<P>In summary, these are the responsibilities of teachers with regard to
relicensing:  </P>
<P><B>1.</B>	Know when your educator license expires. If you frame and hang
your license in your classroom, you will always know the expiration date.  </P>
<P><B>2.</B>	Notify the licensing office of the Vermont Standards Board for
Professional Educators (VSBPE) of any address changes.  </P>
<P><B>3.</B>	Have an Individual Professional Development Plan (IPDP) approved
by and on file with the Local Standards Board (LSB) at the appropriate time. 
</P>
<P><B>4.</B>	Receive prior and final approval for professional development
activities for which you wish to receive relicensing credit.  </P>
<P><B>5.</B>	Maintain a portfolio documenting all activities for which you
wish to receive relicensing credit or activities that meet the Five Standards
for Vermont Educators.  </P>
<P><B>6.</B>	Submit to the LSB the portfolio containing a completed IPDP,
including a narrative of how the five standards have been met, approved
activities and credits for the renewal period, and a new IPDP for the next
renewal period. The LSB can then recommend relicensure to the Licensing Office
of the VSBPE.  </P>
<P><B>7.</B>	Submit an approved, completed license renewal form, correct fees,
and any other required forms to the Licensing Office.</P>

<P><I><B>As you develop your own philosophy about homework, consider these
ideas: </B></I> </P>
<P><B>l.</B>	Don't give homework as punishment.  </P>
<P><B>2.</B>	Don't give spur-of-the-moment homework assignments, especially if
you expect students to devote their time and care to the work.  </P>
<P><B>3.</B>	Don't assume because no questions are asked when you give the
assignment that students have no questions about their homework.  </P>
<P><B>4.</B>	Understand that not all kinds of homework assignments are equally
valuable for all students.  </P>
<P><B>5.</B>	Explain the purpose of every assignment. 
</P>
<P><B>6.</B>	Acknowledge and praise students' efforts to complete homework.
</P>
<P><B>7.</B>	Listen to what students say about their experiences with
homework.  </P>
<P><B>8.</B>	Include parents by making your homework expectations clear and
encouraging students to ask their parents for appropriate help with homework. 
</P>
<P><B>9.</B>	Offer to help students before and after school with homework. You
are the best judge about which assignments really must be completed
independently.  </P>
<P><B>10.</B>	Don't confuse excuses for incomplete homework assignments with
legitimate reasons.  </P>
<P><B>11.</B>	Make every effort to acknowledge completed homework assignments
and, if you grade them, grade and return them right away.

<P><I><B>If you want to make a guest speaker effective with your students,
give the speaker this advice well in advance of the visit: </B></I>
</P>
<P><B>l.</B><B>	Bring lots of props.</B> Children, even older ones, learn
best from real objects, photos, models, and stories. Artifacts, souvenirs, and
personal anecdotes help children learn. Mock-ups, experiments, and
demonstrations make big hits, too. 
</P>
<P><B>2.	Talk in a simple, clear manner.</B> Ask kids for feedback frequently
during the presentation, such as, &quot;Have you ever been to....?&quot; or &quot;Who
has ever seen...?&quot; Provide lots of description and examples.  </P>
<P><B>3.	Involve the students in the learning.</B> Tell them a story or use
toys, crafts, games, drama, or other activities to help the students learn. Kids
enjoy &quot;playtime&quot; activities and learn well from them.  </P>
<P><B>4.	Entertain the children </B>with surprises, variety, and  tricks to
keep their attention.  </P>
<P><B>5.	Remember that children see the world from a different perspective
than adults.</B> Be understanding if they ask personal questions or questions
that seem a little off the subject. 
</P>
<P><B>6.	Appreciate the students' excitement</B> and spontaneity. Kids who are
involved in learning are enthusiastic and make spontaneous comments. Sometimes
they may lack decorum, but don't be offended!

<H1><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">15 ideas for successful parent-teacher conferences
</FONT> 	</H1>
<P><B><I>Communicating with parents is one of the most important things
teachers do. When we work together with a student's parents, the atmosphere for
student learning is improved, and when we have parents' support, we do a better
job. Student achievement improves with increased parent interest and
involvement. </I></B></P>
<P><B><I>Here are some tips for getting off on the right foot in parent
conferences:</I></B>  </P>
<P><B>l.	Invite both parents</B> to conferences with you, but be sure to find
out first what your student's living arrangement is. Families may take many
forms -- two-parent, single-parent, guardians, foster care, sibling
head-of-household... make no embarrassing or inappropriate assumptions! &quot;Parents&quot;
on this page refers to a child's adult guardian(s).  </P>
<P><B>2.	Start communicating with parents early</B> in the year with a letter,
newsletter, or telephone call. Outline your curriculum and expectations and let
parents know how they can reach you.  </P>
<P><B>3.	Allow plenty of time for the conference.</B> If you're scheduling
back-to-back conferences, give yourself a short breather in between.  </P>
<P><B>4.	Prepare in advance</B> to answer specific questions parents have
about their child's ability, skill levels, and achievements.  </P>
<P><B>5.	Get organized</B> before the conference. Assemble your grade book,
test scores, student work samples, and attendance records. Have a general, but
flexible timeline in mind for the conference.  </P>
<P><B>6.	You'll help parents feel welcome</B> and relieve their anxiety if you
greet them at the door by name. Check records in advance so you have parents'
(stepparents' or guardians') names correct.  </P>
<P><B>7.	Avoid physical barriers.</B> Don't sit behind your desk or ask
parents to perch on tiny chairs. Arrange conference seating so everyone is
treated equally.  </P>
<P><B>8.	Begin the conference with a positive statement</B> about the child's
ability, work, or interests.  </P>
<P><B>9.	Be specific in your comments.</B> Identify problems and concerns with
examples. Suggest specific things parents can do at home to help and ways you
will proceed at school.  </P>
<P><B>10.	Forget the jargon.</B> Try not to use &quot;educationese&quot;
because it sounds like doubletalk to most parents. 
</P>
<P><B>11.	Ask for parents' opinions.</B> Let parents know that you want to
hear what they have to say. Hear them out, even if the comments are hostile or
negative. 
</P>
<P><B>12.	Focus on the student's strengths.</B> It is easy for parents to be
defensive. You will help if you review the child's strengths and needs without
dwelling on weaknesses or being overly critical.  </P>
<P><B>13.	Use positive body language.</B> Cues like your smile, a nod, eye
contact, and posture let parents know you are interested.  </P>
<P><B>14.</B>	Before the conference ends, <B>summarize the discussion</B> and
the actions you and the parents have decided to take.  </P>
<P><B>15.	Keep a record of the conference.</B> You may find it helpful later
to have a brief record of the comments and plans made during the conference.

<H1><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Help me articulate my love for teaching</FONT></H1>
<P><B>By Stephanie Keitel, Union-32 High School 
</B></P>
<P>Recently two different conversations collided for me and so I seek a forum
for collegial sharing. Please help me name what we do -- in the manner of
Madeline L'Engel, <I>A Wrinkle in Time,</I> your Namer is the only one who
knows you so well they can truly call you by your real name.   </P>
<P>First, my parents and I were discussing a family friend whose company &quot;rightsized&quot;
him into unemployment. As a middle-aged man, he has had very little luck
regaining paid employment.  He is too &quot;experienced,&quot; too likely to
quit if a more suitable offer comes along. My parents, in all sincerity, said
they thought the solution would be for him to take the few Mickey Mouse
education courses needed for a teacher's license, so that he could fall back on
teaching. After all, there always seem to be vacancies in the schools and he has
nice kids and he'd love all the summer freedom.  </P>
<P>I found myself speechless. People I love, people who love me and who have to
plan their time with me around my summer school obligations, were saying that
the work I have done for over 20 years for countless days, evenings and weekends
is a &quot;fall back&quot; job.
</P>
<P>Yet to be honest, is this perception partially my own doing? How many times
have I replied sheepishly, semi-embarrassed to the question of what I do? While
internally I revel in my school work, externally my reply seems to sound almost
apologetic for not being the CEO of a corporation, or at least president of my
own firm.  </P>
<P>How strange. I put in more hours than anyone I know. I am just as educated.
I balance budgets I can't expand. I have to teach everyone (teachers aren't
allowed to &quot;right size, downsize&quot;), even after there are no more desks
or books left. I am more current in my professional research than anyone besides
my family doctor.  I have turned more family trips into continuing education
experiences than anyone I know. My family has graciously accompanied me to
school games and evening activities, and welcomed many unpredictable  guests
into our home for dinner (15 seventh graders for dinner is not without surprises
and breakage!).  I  am still waiting to meet the &quot;private sector&quot;
employee who spends as great a proportion of income as teachers on continuing
education classes, books, journals and basics such as kleenex and holiday
treats. 
</P>
<P>Then on the second day of school while reading Avi's <I>Nothing But the
Truth</I>, I came upon this: &quot;I suppose after doing anything for twenty-one
years a body does get a little tired... All the same I remain steadfast in my
belief that my life was meant to be the bringing of fine literature to young
minds. Is it wrong to speak of the work as a calling? Well, teaching is almost a
religion to me. I will complain from time to time, but it is my life. The truth
is I like it.  I would be lost without my books, my teaching, my students.&quot;
(page 5)  
</P>
<P>So, fellow teachers, help me articulate my love for teaching. Share some
words that show the fire we feel for our profession, for the depth and sparkle
it brings to our lives. </P>

<H1><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Burnout &#151; A Prisoner's Story
</FONT></H1>
<P><B>By Janet Van Fleet, on leave from Union Elementary, Montpelier
</B></P>
<P>I'm a really good teacher &#151; for nine years I've been respectful,
engaged, and creative with kids; open and collaborative with parents; and
cheerfully committed to doing more than my share of the work outside my
classroom with colleagues and administrators. But I won't be showing up in the
classroom this year because I'm taking a year's leave of absence. I've got a
major case of burnout.
</P>
<P>By the end of last year I was feeling imprisoned in my classroom. I began to
think, &quot;There's something wrong with this picture: Nobody could imagine
that one mother could take care of 22 children all day every day. Even if you
had 22 children, some of them would be at least 15 years older than the rest and
be helping out. And of course, once they got to be five or six, you'd be sending
them off to school for most of the waking hours of each day! What kind of
parenting could you do under such circumstances? How would you ever get any
quality time with any of your children? The question is, why do we think
teachers should be able to do this?&quot;
</P>
<P>Any manager in the public sector who is responsible for supervising the work
of 22 employees has impressive amenities and support systems: an office where
focused, uninterrupted work can be accomplished, a personnel manager, an
assistant, at least one secretary, a computer with software designed for making
recordkeeping and communication more efficient, and probably lots of other
goodies that I don't even know about. If this supervisor needs to get some
perspective, there's no law against walking around the block and getting a cup
of coffee. An hour's lunch (or an hour for exercise in the middle of the day) is
standard. If you need more, and the day's schedule allows it, you take it; after
all, you'll be working some evenings or Saturdays &#151; it all works out.
</P>
<P>Teachers, by contrast, have no office; they work in the same room as the 22
people they're supervising. They design all the training programs, create or
find the materials, and do the training for all 22 workers. They oversee all of
the daily work, evaluate the employees and let them know where and how their
performance needs to improve (and emphasize all the things that they're doing
well!), and keep daily records on workers' performance all by themselves.
Teachers do all the filing, all the correspondence, and all the quarterly
reports by themselves. AND they break up fights, help the workers keep track of
their personal belongings, consult with employees' families and their own
supervisors about how the training program is going, and try to maintain an
atmosphere of high morale and community in the workplace.
</P>
<P>Well, if mom-at-home and manager/supervisor don't quite work as analogs for
teaching, what does? In my current frame of mind, factory work &#151; in which
you're tied to your place on the assembly line &#151; seems to come closest. If
you need to go the bathroom you can't unless you can get someone to step into
your spot on the line. You get working people's hours (last year all the
teaching staff at my school were required to report daily at 7:30 a.m.; it
didn't matter how many hours you put in on the other end of the day). You can't
leave the plant for lunch (because there isn't time, or because you need to
supervise lunch period). At least factory workers, or people who stock shelves
at Ames, get a coffee break. Alas, not to teachers.
</P>
<P>Our profession is betwixt and between &#151; it doesn't have the personal
freedom, perks, independence and respect the other professions do; nor does it
have the minimal, blanket protections designed for non-salaried workers. Thank
goodness our union is working to address these issues. And thank goodness the
great joys of teaching compensate for the constraints and unrealistic and
demeaning circumstances under which we sometimes work. But until that glorious
day, when, exhausted, frustrated, and desperately needing some time out, I can
walk down the street and buy a cup of coffee, I worry that I'm going to continue
to feel incarcerated in my classroom.

<H1><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Advice from a retired teacher: &quot;Stick to it --
be the best you can be&quot;</FONT></H1>
<P><B>By Alan Blakeman, retired from Montpelier High School</B></P>
<P>I was interested in reading Janet Van Fleet's &quot;Burnout -- A Prisoner's
Story.&quot; I well understand Janet's situation , as I have been there myself.
Also, I have had the opportunity to work with Janet on some local education
issues and know she is a caring professional.</P>
<P>I taught my last class in June 1995, ending a busy and rewarding 37 years in
the profession. I feel that my last year was my most effective as a teacher.
Burnout during that time? Yes! Kudos to Janet for taking the year off to get
refueled. I never did take a year's absence, but did teach at what was
Montpelier's Junior High School for a year.  For a high school teacher, that was
eye-opening and rewarding in its own right. I went back to Montpelier High
School the next year renewed and with a greater understanding of what middle
school people go through.</P>
<P>I am now involved in substitute teller work at the Chittenden Bank, and the
teaching profession has helped me much in my &quot;second career.&quot; I enjoy
banking. One of the neat things is that over this past year, only seven days
have passed where I have NOT met a former student at the bank. I am proud that I
taught and now, I have had a year to reflect. Teaching was worth it, even though
the money and the personal time for family and self can never be made up.</P>
<P>A few things come to mind that I would like to pass on to my fellow
teachers. One of the things that I resented in the profession was the worship of
&quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; and some of the trends that I have seen come
and go. There is a lot to be said for picking up new ideas and trying out new
methods. However, these PhD's from brand-name institutions do not have the
advantage that you and I have: that of working with kids day-in-day-out. Learn
new methods, but do not go against your grain. Through hard experience (I wish I
could redo some of my mistakes!) I have learned that I have to be ME, and that
is not so bad!</P>
<P>I also encourage teachers to do things NOT in the education field in their
spare time, which I know is not easy. By having separate interests, you can get
to your &quot;grind&quot; better. As teachers, we tend to be masochists or
attempt to be superman/woman. In the big picture, some time for yourself will be
most helpful for your students, as well as yourself. Believe me, I have spent
too many 7-day weeks at my teaching, which eventually became counterproductive.</P>
<P>In the classroom, take charge. Kids appreciate discipline. Unorganized chaos
ends up negatively. Kids will respect you and you can guide them into better
learning.</P>
<P>Make yourself available as much as possible to students. Take advantage of
that one student who is seeking help. You can make a difference.</P>
<P>Teaching is all the negatives that Janet noted in her article, and more so
the joys that she described. Stick to it -- be the best you can be -- and GO
WITH YOUR GUT REACTION. When that retirement day comes, hopefully you will also
say: &quot;It has been a great career.&quot; </P>

<H1><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Teacher bashing keeps me up at night</FONT></H1>
<P><B>By Diane Alberts, French, English and drama teacher at Canaan High
School
</B>
</P>
<P>I didn't sleep well last night. Though I went to bed at 10:00, I wasn't
asleep at 11:45 and I woke up again at 4:10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>Why was I so restless? I had listened to a Republican candidate for governor
of Vermont on Vermont Public Radio's &quot;Switchboard.&quot; Taking cues from
his national mentor, Bob Dole, candidate John Gropper decided to bash teachers
in Vermont's public schools.  
</P>
<P>I called VPR and commented on his remarks about vouchers, public education
funds going to private schools. Mr. Gropper jibed that maybe with vouchers the
public schools would &quot;get off their heels&quot; and do something about the
sad state of education in Vermont. Like his national mentor, Mr. Gropper
described teachers' unions as &quot;terrified&quot; that competition will make
them do their jobs better. I asked him if he would apply the same principle to
the Pentagon: i.e., cut the budget to the point of virtually crippling
operations so they would &quot;get off their heels&quot; and stop buying $7,000
coffee pots and $300 toilet seats. &quot;If everybody scrutinized the schools as
much as they pick on the Pentagon...&quot; he replied. Alas, my line went dead,
but I couldn't forget those words. 
</P>
<P>The American public schools have been under constant assault since the early
days of the Reagan administration, and it has been documented that the Bush
administration would suppress good news about public schools to avoid losing a
favorite whipping boy. I grant you that in 1982 public education was falling far
short of where it should be. Rather than to pitch in and support our public
schools &#151; the backbone of a democracy &#151; politicians have ignored the
spiraling expectations placed on public schools and teachers, parental
indifference, the poor behavior of a large segment of the younger generation,
and the relentless anti-intellectuality rampant in this country which makes a
hero of Jeff Foxworthy's &quot;redneck&quot; while vilifying school educators
and their values. We have spent the last 13 years trying to re-invent the school
and the teacher, as if teachers taught school in a social vacuum. 
</P>
<P>I began to teach in the early eighties. At that time my bachelor's degree in
teaching plus four years experience garnered me roughly $12,000 less per year in
salary &#151; not to mention benefits &#151; than most recent college grads in
any other profession. That gap has narrowed. Thirteen years later I am only $4-8
thousand behind a recent college grad. What progress I've made in being able to
support myself and two children on my teacher's salary, I owe to a teachers'
union. Judging from Mr. Gropper's remarks about how much more cheaply a private
school could educate kids, those unions are just as necessary now as they were
back in the days when teachers were working for $2,000 per year and the women
were forced to quit when they married.  
</P>
<P>How can those private schools operate on so much less money? Check their
teacher salaries and ask yourselves if it's reasonable for the millions of
public school teachers putting in 11-hour days to work for salaries which enable
families to qualify for welfare and food stamps.  
</P>
<P>I do <I>not</I> exaggerate. A single mother who taught with me when I
returned to teaching in 1983 supported three children abandoned by a dead-beat
dad and actually did qualify for food stamps and other low-income programs. She
and I both lived in used trailers and cut every corner we could. Is that what we
want for our teachers?  
</P>
<P>Mr. Gropper is mouthing words sent down to him from the national level, and
I am strongly suspicious about why teachers are being made the &quot;Willy
Horton&quot;s of 1996. Why is it that the improved SAT scores are not in the
public eye? Or the fact that a much broader cross-section of students now take
the SAT from the days when white, prep-school males represented the bulk of the
testing sample? Or the success of American kids, second only to Finland (!) in
reading? I found this statistic in the back pages of the &quot;Sport&quot;
section of <I>The Manchester Union Leader</I>, a paper which routinely backs
the most conservative of Republican candidates.  
</P>
<P>These questions keep nagging at me, sometimes at night when I can't sleep.
Why doesn't it ever get on the front page that today's culturally diverse school
population has a much higher graduation rate than back in those &quot;Good Old
Days&quot; when only white upper-class males (and a few pushy females) were ever
expected to graduate? Where are those sweet, heart-warming stories about all the
good things teachers routinely do for their students which change their lives
for the better? (I could give lots of examples on a personal level, and I know
I'm not the Mother Theresa of education.) And why, why, why does no one ever
question the unfairness of pitting regulation-burdened public schools against
private schools where only a minimum of regulation exists? Does no one care that
these schools can be run by just about anybody with just about any
political-religious agenda?  
</P>
<P>Can it be that the same society which shakes its head in disbelief at
stories of child abuse taking place in unregulated child care centers whose
credentials were never scrutinized can turn around and dump public money into
not just a private school, but any private school the parents choose? This is
supposed to improve our kids and make them competitive with kids on an
international level? Think about it. Under this concept just about anybody can
call himself a teacher, regardless of education and past history. It seems that
what the Doles, Groppers, and Ralph Reeds of the country are saying is that,
despite the regulations placed on schools and teachers, there are slip-ups,
sometimes egregious ones. Therefore, let's start our own schools and we won't
have any of those safeguards and curricular concerns. That's just about as
logical as cutting the funds of an institution that historically is underfunded
so it will work better. 
</P>
<P>I can't help thinking what an inner city school system could do with the
funds for just one B-1 bomber. Maybe we should follow the Republican voucher
concept to its logical conclusion and, indeed, apply it to the Pentagon. That
way those of us who aren't pleased with Pentagon waste and foul-ups can just get
a defense voucher and choose the local militia we think can do a better job.
Imagine that!

<H1><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Rotten apples that spoil the barrel</FONT></H1>
<P><B>By Franci Farnsworth, Parent, Brandon, Vermont
</B>
</P>
<P>I'm a parent, not a public school teacher.   I've read a couple of the
Teacher Exchange essays that were written by people who exemplify what the
profession should be.  </P>
<P>Fortunately my children have had many such teachers and I know that probably
most of the teachers in Vermont have the same professionalism, commitment,
enthusiasm, and caring as the writers of those essays. What concerns me is those
few teachers who don't &#151; and I know that most school systems have a few of
these folks. People who may have been great teachers once but who have &quot;burned
out,&quot; who don't have the energy anymore to adapt and change.  People who
never should have been teachers at all.  People who are in the wrong teaching
situation (a subject they don't love, a school size or environment in which
they're uncomfortable, students to whom they can't relate). People who think of
teaching as a &quot;job&quot; rather than a &quot;profession&quot; (put in your
hours and go home, take courses or go to conferences only because it's required
for re-certification, etc.).   </P>
<P>These teachers are the rotten apples that spoil the barrel.  Parents and
other members of the public will tend judge all teachers by the bad ones they
see.  And those teachers who do not live up to the standards expressed in these
Teacher Exchange essays are not only hurting your cause, they are hurting the
students in their charge. And that's even worse. </P>
<P> I think it is time for the majority, the truly professional teachers, to
figure out a way to rid your profession of the minority, those &quot;teachers&quot;
who are not worthy of the title and whose actions lend credence to the
accusations of the citizens and politicians attacking public education.

<P>I have been teaching for 26 years and have been a member of Vermont-NEA
since 1974.  At no time have I been prouder to be a member of the Association
than in November when I read an earlier draft of Schools That Work.  For too
long have we appeared to be reacting to the criticism that inundates those of us
who have given our lives to this profession.  For too long have we failed to
speak strongly about what our experience and knowledge tell us are the problems
facing schools.  And for too long have we failed to state strongly what are our
recommendations for dealing with the problems we face.  
</P>
<P>I particularly applaud the recommendations that deal with student decorum,
the emphasis on content over process and self-esteem, and the academic training
of prospective teachers.  
</P>
<P>I look forward to the Association's assuming a strong position in any
discussion about the future of education in Vermont. </P>

<H1><FONT COLOR="#004000">Green Up Vermont &#151; Tradition with a History</FONT>
</H1>
<P><B>By Melinda Vieux</B>
</P>
<P>Over a quarter century ago, the people of Vermont lead the rest of the
country in keeping their natural surroundings clean and beautiful by launching
the largest cleanup operation of its kind in the nation -- Green Up Day. This
fine tradition started in 1969, on a clear spring day, when Robert Babcock, Jr.,
became appalled as he drove to work in Montpelier from his home in Waterbury.
The melting snow revealed miles of unsightly litter along the roadside. He went
directly to Governor Deane C. Davis, who readily sanctioned the idea of a
statewide effort to be supported by the State Highway Department and large
groups of volunteer citizens to clean up the highways of the state. 
</P>
<P>As planning began and citizens around the state heard about the project,
mounting interest indicated they had &quot;a bear by the tail,&quot; as
described by Davis. Rather than act in haste, the date for the first Green Up
Day was set for April 18, 1970. As it turned out, this was just prior to the
first Earth Day.</P>
<P><B>The first Green Up
</B></P>
<P>On that first Green Up Day, over 70,000 volunteers (75% of whom were youth)
came out and cleaned up litter on 95% of the 2,400 miles of state and interstate
highways and on 75% of the 8,300 town roads. The interstate was closed to the
traveling public from 9:00 to noon, with state police guarding every access.
Although 240,000, 30-gallon-capacity bags were distributed, by mid-morning more
were needed. Some 12,000 additional bags were airdropped by the Civil Air Patrol
to key airports throughout the state. Results far exceeded expectations. As the
Congressional Record reports in the words of Senator George Aiken, volunteers
collected virtually every glass bottle, metal can and scrap of paper cast on to
the roadsides by careless and unthinking people. Several hundred thousand cans
and bottles, filling five tractor trailer trucks, were taken away for recycling.
This massive effort helped in passing a returnable bottle law in Vermont. In
all, the collected trash totaled 40,000 cubic yards.
</P>
<P>By 1979, Green Up had been so successful that Governor Snelling decided it
should become a private non-profit organization, separate from state government.
All the living governors at the time were among the original incorporators of
Vermont Green Up, Inc., and governors since have served as honorary presidents.
Today, Vermont Green Up depends on donations to continue its work.
</P>
<P><B>Poster Contest</B>
</P>
<P>A poster design contest for Green Up Day -- sponsored by Vermont-NEA since
1994 -- offers students of all ages throughout the state a chance to picture the
message each year. The contest, with entries due late January, is open to all
students and carries a cash award for the design winner and winners in each
grade category. This activity connects students with the community, as well as
raising sensitivity to the importance of caring for Vermont's lovely landscape
environment.
</P>
<P>Green Up Vermont is the Vermont community taking care of its home by
cleaning up road and stream side debris and greening up by planting trees and
flowers and sprucing up public sites. In 1996, an estimated 20,000 Vermonters
kept the green up spirit soaring.  Green Up is more than an activity for a day.
It is an attitude for a lifetime -- an attitude toward our environment and
working together to keep Vermont a clean, safe and beautiful place to live,
visit and enjoy. It culminates on Green Up Day, the first Saturday each May, and
includes Green Up spirited actions throughout the year.</P>
<P>You can protect Vermont's lovely landscape -- be a Vermont Green Up
volunteer. Green Up needs town and county chair people, school organizers,
volunteer workers of all ages, contributions for funding the work, and the
stories about what happens in your community. Please contact Green Up Vermont,
802-229-5686.

<A HREF="index.htm">Home</A></P>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#800000">I - ENVIRONMENT OF LEARNING  </FONT></H2>
<P><B>Key #1  Strengthen student behavior standards  
</B></P>
<P><B>Discussion 
</B></P>
<P>Educators are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain the order and
discipline necessary for them to teach and for students to learn. Student
language, clothing, interpersonal behavior and respect for property should
reflect a level of decorum that promotes learning. Our schools reflect wider
social currents: to the extent there is an erosion of civility in the community,
it will appear in our classrooms. In fact, expectations regarding acceptable
student conduct have declined in many schools.  </P>
<P>All educators and students know that disruptive behavior by just one student
can hurt the learning process for everyone present in a classroom. This is often
the case when a student, whether or not identified as having a behavioral
disorder, disrupts class.   </P>
<P>Our schools have the authority to balance the needs of students with
behavioral disorders against those of other students. Too often, those with such
authority either don't use it or are not sufficiently trained in how to use it.
As a result, some disruptive behavior continues, to the detriment of both the
misbehaving student and other students in the classroom.  </P>
<P><B> Recommendations  </B></P>
<P>a.  Each school district should establish and enforce a policy for student
decorum which: </P>
<OL>
<LI> promotes a safe, orderly, and civil school environment where learning can
take place;  </LI>
<LI>establishes plain expectations for students regarding behavior, language,
clothing, and treatment of property; and   </LI>
<LI>places clear responsibilities on all members of the school community &#151;
educators, administrators, school board members, and parents, as well as
students.</LI></OL>
<P>  b.  The provisions of such a policy relating to members of each group
should address: </P>
<OL>
<LI> their role in developing, enforcing, and/or complying with the decorum
policy; </LI>
<LI>the behavior expected of them; </LI>
<LI>their responsibility to model and promote high quality student behavior;
and </LI>
<LI>their responsibility to hold students and others accountable for high
standards of behavior.  </LI></OL>
<P>c.  Policy provisions for students should balance the principles of
individual responsibility and the good of the community with the rights of
individuals.  </P>
<P><B>Key #2  Enforce classroom attendance expectations</B></P>
<P><B>Discussion  </B></P>
<P>Students are absent from class or school too often, and too often the
absences are not warranted:  </P>
<P>The mission of public schools is educational and revolves around the
curriculum. There are occasions when a student is absent from class or school
for reasons unrelated to health, family emergencies, or other legitimate
purposes.   </P>
<P>There are other occasions when a student is absent from class for school
activities that are non-academic. Most extracurricular programs and events well
serve and complement the mission of the schools. Some activities do not: they
should be weighed carefully against the importance of classroom instruction. 
</P>
<P>Finally, our schools are not equipped and must not be expected to be the
primary providers of social services. Teachers are trained to teach, not to be
social workers. At a time when responsibility for social services is
increasingly pushed onto our schools, it is all the more important that we
protect the educational program from the distractions and disruptions that arise
when students' personal and family problems seize center stage.   </P>
<P><B>Recommendations </B>  </P>
<P>a.  Each school district should adopt and enforce a class and school
attendance policy which: </P>
<OL>
<LI>does not excuse students from attending classes for matters, apart from an
emergency or illness,  not directly linked to their program of curricular and
extracurricular activities and graduation requirements;   </LI>
<LI>distinguishes social from educational services and assures that its social
services enhance its educational services; 
</LI>
<LI>requires school personnel, working with students on matters unrelated to
their curricular and extracurricular program, to schedule time with them in a
way which avoids intruding into their classroom obligations;  </LI>
<LI>restricts the circumstances under which teachers may seek to excuse
students from the classes of other teachers; and   </LI>
<LI>establishes specific consequences for students  whose unexcused absences
from class exceed a specific number.   </LI></OL>
<P><B>Key #3  Improve the use of instructional time</B>   </P>
<P><B>Discussion</B>  </P>
<P>The variety and number of interruptions during presently available
instructional time increasingly damage the ability of teachers to teach. More
and more student extracurricular activities have intruded into instructional
time, and more and more mandated meetings and other additional responsibilities
have been thrust onto teachers and administrators.  </P>
<P>Teachers generally have inadequate time in which to prepare lessons and
attend to professional development needs. In addition, they spend countless
hours at committee meetings, at staff meetings, meeting with students and
parents, taking courses of their own, complying with government mandates, and
preparing for their daily classes.  </P>
<P>The expanded activities of students and staff have intruded into the
essential academic function of our schools. The amount of time in a school year
for all functions has increased in only a minority of school districts. More
academic and professional development time is needed without eroding the more
recent additional responsibilities placed on students and staff alike. As a
result, our schools need to make better use of instructional time and, perhaps,
to make more time for schooling available.  </P>
<P>Finally, virtually all reputable research concludes that limiting class size
enables teachers to provide more personal attention to individual students and
that individual attention contributes to greater learning.   </P>
<P><B>Recommendations   </B></P>
<P>a.  Each school district should adopt a policy to optimize the teaching time
in the present school day by scheduling those activities not related to teaching
and learning to occur after school hours.   </P>
<P>b.  Each school district, in cooperation with its local teachers
association, should study the actual amount of time its teachers are involved in
non-instructional activities. This study should examine:  </P>
<OL>
<LI>the extent to which those activities, such as planning lessons, are
directly or indirectly related to instruction; </LI>
<LI>the extent to which they occur during or before and after regular school
hours (whether or not paid); </LI>
<LI>the appropriateness of that use of time; and  </LI>
<LI>ways to address any uncovered imbalance.  </LI></OL>
<P>c.  Each school district, in cooperation with its local teachers
association, should develop a formal plan to improve the use of existing school
time for teaching. Once that improvement has occurred, they should determine
together if the amount of available instructional time is insufficient and, if
so, how to increase it and how to afford any increase.  </P>
<P>d.  Each school district should  establish class size policies which assure
that teachers can provide an appropriate amount of individual attention to all
students.  </P>
<P><B>Key #4  Assure all students enter school each day ready to learn    
</B></P>
<P><B>Discussion  </B></P>
<P>Parents are the first and most important life-long teachers of their
children. Some parents need help to make sure that their children are socially,
intellectually, and physically ready to begin schooling or are ready for school
from day to day. Communities have an obligation to their children to help
parents fulfill the basic components of child-rearing. In our society, that
includes readying their children for school. At the same time, all adults should
exhibit for children respect for learning and their schools.  </P>
<P>The most important issue generally unspoken in discussions of finance reform
and education quality is the degree of poverty affecting our students. It
affects, of course, those who themselves are poor. It also affects the fabric
and culture of our schools, whether reflected in the increased provision of
social services within our school buildings or the impaired emotional and
physical ability of students to focus on learning and study. While we may not be
able to have an effect directly on how policy makers at the State and federal
levels act, we can state for them what we know to be true:  </P>
<OL>
<LI>Children who are developmentally ready for formal schooling are more
attentive students than children who are not, and </LI>
<LI>Children who are well-rested, appropriately clothed, and adequately
nourished are more attentive students than children who are not.</LI></OL>
<P><B>Recommendations   </B></P>
<P>a.  Each community should assist its schools by offering  parent education,
information, and training programs for parents needing assistance meeting the
basic needs of their children so that, when they arrive at school, they are
socially, intellectually, and physically prepared. </P>
<P>b.  All parents should demonstrate respect for their children's schooling by
discussing with them school events on a daily basis, becoming involved through
parent conferences, initiating contact with teachers about their children, and
attending and participating in school activities, including school board
meetings.  </P>
<P>c.  In addition to private community and religious agencies such as Girl and
Boy Scouts, 4-H, and churches, such programs as Healthy Babies, Head Start,
Essential Early Education, Child Nutrition Programs, and pre-school and
after-school programs have all contributed to the capacity of our children to be
attentive students. They should be the focus of increased and sustained societal
and financial support.

<P><B>Key #1  Raise the professional qualifications required to obtain a
teaching license  
</B></P>
<P><B>Discussion 
</B></P>
<P>One important way to assure teacher competence is to establish clear and
substantial entry level professional qualifications. To enter the teaching
profession, whether directly from college or from another profession,
individuals logically should be expected to possess sufficiently high levels of
expertise in their content area as well as in the areas of pedagogy and child
development and psychology. 
</P>
<P>While teachers themselves typically bear the brunt of criticism for &quot;bad
apples&quot; in the classrooms, they often are not given a role either in
determining how teachers are prepared for the content and pedagogical demands of
their profession or in teacher hiring and evaluation. 
</P>
<P>We sometimes confront an attitude that &quot;anyone can teach.&quot; We do
not believe just anyone can teach. Most would scoff at an experienced paralegal
who presumes competence to manage litigation. So, too, with the seasoned EMT who
suggests filling in for a physician for a year or two. Yet, we regularly listen
straight-faced to suggestions that those skilled in &quot;the private sector&quot;
ought to be afforded an easy transition from the board room to the classroom.
The quality of instruction we seek cannot be attained by lowering licensing
requirements.  
</P>
<P><B>Recommendations </B> 
</P>
<P>a.  The State Board of Education should raise teacher licensing standards to
assure that individuals wishing to enter the teaching profession have the
following qualifications: 
</P>
<OL>
<LI>a bachelor of arts or science degree from an accredited college or
university, which, for secondary teachers, shall be in a field of concentration
other than education; 
</LI>
<LI>a grade point average of no less than 3.0 or other indication of superior
undergraduate academic performance; 
</LI>
<LI>undergraduate or graduate training in pedagogy and child development and
psychology; 
</LI>
<LI>successful completion of a student teaching or internship experience at
least one school year in duration; and  
</LI>
<LI>a passing score, established by the Board, on the National Teacher
Examination. 
</LI></OL>
<P>The Department of Education should assure that the National Teacher
Examination is administered at  convenient times and places.  
</P>
<P><B>Key #2  Establish a two-year probationary period for newly licensed
teachers  
</B></P>
<P><B>Discussion 
</B></P>
<P>Persons new to a profession generally do not know if they are cut out for a
career in that profession until they have spent a period of time testing their
career choice. The members of most professions in Vermont serve a probationary
period before their license becomes permanent, and teachers in most other states
serve a probationary period as well. Vermont should provide its permanent
teaching certificate to those persons who successfully demonstrate through an
initial period of employment that they are well-suited for a career in teaching.
 
</P>
<P>We expect any person new to a profession to require guidance and oversight
for an initial period. Vermont should assure that individuals new to teaching
receive professional attention to develop their skills. 
</P>
<P>Whether an experienced teacher should serve a probationary period with a new
employer has been and should remain a matter negotiated by local school
districts with their local teachers association.       </P>
<P><B>Recommendations 
</B></P>
<P>a.  The Legislature should establish for newly licensed teachers a two-year
period of probation with the following characteristics: 
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Successful completion is affirmed by the local superintendent (or school
board, if there is no superintendent); 
</LI>
<LI>A qualified individual will provide formal evaluations to the teacher no
fewer than four times;  
</LI>
<LI>An employing school district which has complied with its responsibilities
to provide the teacher formal evaluations and any required notice may, without
being required to provide a statutory hearing, decide for performance reasons
not to renew the teacher's contract; and 
</LI>
<LI>A teacher who, for alleged performance reasons,  does not successfully
complete an initial two-year period of employment, may extend probation for one
additional two-year period, during which he or she is subject again to the
requirements of a teacher with an initial probationary license.  
</LI></OL>
<P><B>Key #3  Conduct frequent performance evaluations of education personnel
throughout their careers   
</B></P>
<P><B>Discussion 
</B></P>
<P>Useful evaluation of education personnel contributes to high caliber
performance. A school's evaluation system should reflect its education goals,
management style, general philosophy of instruction, and the values of its
community.  
</P>
<P>Rarely are teachers and other school personnel evaluated regularly or well
enough. Most evaluation systems are not developed with sufficient staff
involvement. It is unusual as well for evaluators, who may be well-versed in
theories of child development and learning, to have adequate knowledge of the
subjects or specialty areas taught by the teachers they evaluate. Almost nowhere
are the training, time, and resources necessary to develop and implement a good
evaluation system recognized.      
</P>
<P><B>Recommendations 
</B></P>
<P>a.  By February 15, 1997, Vermont-NEA should call upon the Vermont School
Boards Association, the Vermont Superintendents Association, the Vermont
Principals Association, and the Vermont Parent-Teacher Association to appoint a
delegation to work jointly with Vermont-NEA in conducting a study, without
unneeded legislation, regarding: 
</P>
<OL>
<LI>the training, time, and resources needed to conduct high quality
evaluations of administrators, teachers, and support staff;  
</LI>
<LI>aspects of school administration which might be reduced to free the time of
supervisory personnel to conduct high quality evaluations; and 
</LI>
<LI>various methods and processes for use by school districts in conducting
personnel evaluations. </LI></OL>
<P>Those engaged in this study should consult with, among others, persons from
the private sector who have expertise in human resources generally and personnel
evaluation specifically. They should present their joint findings and
recommendations to their governing bodies, local school districts, the
Department of Education and the General Assembly, as appropriate.    
</P>
<P><B>Key #4  Provide educators career-long professional development
emphasizing subject matter knowledge and student learning  
</B></P>
<P><B>Discussion 
</B></P>
<P>An educator's professional development is primarily the educator's own
responsibility. In order to attain a high level of proficiency early in their
careers, all teachers should engage in sufficient professional development to
attain an advanced degree (or equivalent) within a reasonable period of time.
Teachers' daily work schedules should be arranged so that more professional
interaction is possible.   
</P>
<P>A good professional development program should have the following
characteristics: 
</P>
<OL>
<LI>the primary objective is improved student learning; its structure and
substance survive administrative turnover; 
</LI>
<LI>its substance flows from the school district's curriculum and long-term
plan for the education of its community's children;
</LI>
<LI>it focuses on content and curricular needs as well as on methodology;  
</LI>
<LI>it is directed by a standing committee of professional educators who are
encouraged to subject it to open and critical analysis;  
</LI>
<LI>it has access to sufficient resources; and</LI>
<LI>it addresses the needs of support staff as well as teachers. 
</LI></OL>
<P>The usual in-service programs commonly in place in our schools do not meet
these standards.    
</P>
<P><B>Recommendations  
</B></P>
<P>a.  All teachers should acquire a masters degree, or its equivalent in
additional course work,* within 7 years of receiving a permanent license. For
this purpose, each school district should enhance its efforts to make
appropriate course work and necessary payment for it accessible to its own
staff.     
</P>
<P>b.  Each school district should arrange the schedules of its teachers to
enable them to interact during the course of the school day, through such
mechanisms as shared preparation periods.    
</P>
<P>c.  In all school districts, local professional development committees
should develop and oversee professional development programs, which should: 
</P>
<OL>
<LI>extend over 5-year periods;
</LI>
<LI>reflect the priorities and curriculum developed by the school district; 
</LI>
<LI>encourage ongoing and open critical analysis of it by district staff; and 
</LI>
<LI>provide incentives to teachers and support staff to engage in those
professional development activities which assist the district in the attainment
of its educational goals.

<P><B>Key #1  Elevate the importance of academic content  
</B></P>
<P><B>Discussion 
</B></P>
<P>The curriculum of each public school should emphasize content and skills
that have shaped or defined our culture, are essential to the well-being of our
communities, and are fundamental to the development of thoughtful, principled
and hardworking citizens. Parents and taxpayers should have regular access to
the content and goals of the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>The method of learning makes academic content accessible. The best teaching
and the best learning occur where a proper balance is struck between the
substance of lessons and the method through which that substance is learned. A
teacher's primary role should balance imparting knowledge and facilitating
learning.   
</P>
<P>Self-esteem is a necessary ingredient in enhancing student academic and
intellectual growth. Self-esteem, however, is not an end in itself but rather a
by-product of mastery of intellectual and social challenges.     
</P>
<P><B>Recommendations 
</B></P>
<P>a.  Each school district should routinely schedule programs for parents
describing its curriculum and prepare for public distribution the contents and
planned schedule it uses in presenting that curriculum to its students. 
</P>
<P>b.  Each school district should publicly examine the balance in its
curriculum between method and content. To the extent that it determines there is
too great a focus on method, it should take steps to restore academic content to
its proper standing. 
</P>
<P>c.  Each school district should assess the extent, if any, to which
otherwise well-founded concern for the self-esteem of our students has
supplanted concern for their academic attainments. To the extent it has, the
school district should take steps to re-establish the primacy of academic
learning in ways which foster the long-term self-esteem provided by attainment
and knowledge.  
</P>
<P><B>Key #2  Provide rigorous academic program choices   
</B></P>
<P><B>Discussion 
</B></P>
<P>Students entering Vermont's public schools are endowed with different
intellects, abilities, interests, and family and other support. Not all students
can master &#151; nor should they be expected to master &#151; the same kinds or
amounts of knowledge. Yet, school boards are expected to respond to the growing
number of parents and students in Vermont demanding a greater number of
instructional programs and academic choices within the curriculum:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Students have different learning styles. Schools are expected to and should
attempt to accommodate legitimate interest in different teaching approaches.
</LI>
<LI>Students have different learning abilities. Schools are expected to and
should attempt to provide courses that impose differing demands on students to
reflect this fact. 
</LI></OL>
<P>It is extremely difficult, however, for a school district to meet the widely
disparate expectations of all members of its community. Nevertheless, while the
public must temper the demands it would place on schools with a recognition of
the limit of both money and other resources, our schools cannot turn deaf ears
to whole constituencies. They must be more open to providing several alternative
curricular paths of equal rigor. The availability of resources to accomplish
even this does vary across school districts and is a particular problem in small
schools in low wealth districts.  
</P>
<P><B>Recommendations  
</B></P>
<P>a.  Each school district should establish, for secondary education, grades 7
- 12, multiple programs of study within each grade that: 
</P>
<OL>
<LI>enforce clear academic and behavioral standards students must meet to enter
a program and performance objectives for students to remain in it; 
</LI>
<LI>provide parents and students information to help them understand the
varying skills, intellectual development, and workload each course requires;
</LI>
<LI>allow students with a demonstrated high commitment to learning and a record
of high achievement to be taught more demanding subject matter at an accelerated
pace; 
</LI>
<LI>provide a rigorous and appropriate academic program for all students;
</LI>
<LI>assure that all student work, regardless of  the depth taught, demonstrates
high academic standards regarding content and skill development;
</LI>
<LI>provide ongoing and comprehensive remediation to any child who needs it,
especially in the areas of literacy and math computation; and
</LI>
<LI>where there is clear community interest, offer distinct instructional
programs reflecting differing approaches to education and different learning
styles.</LI></OL>
<P> b.  Each school district should investigate ways to join with other public
school districts to allow a wider choice of educational options. 
</P>
<P><B>Key #3  Uphold grade advancement and graduation requirements   
</B></P>
<P><B>Discussion 
</B></P>
<P>The traditional graded approach to schooling, to some analysts, is outdated
and can impede high level learning. The graded system, however, is the one in
which educators function. Teachers face incredible pressures, for a variety of
reasons, to allow students to advance from one grade to the next whether they
have mastered the curriculum or not.  
</P>
<P>Despite inadequate resources, public school educators have an unparalleled
commitment to retaining students who, in earlier times or in other countries,
would have dropped out of or been dropped from school programs. That commitment
to universal retention makes it appear to some observers that programs and
standards are somehow watered down.  
</P>
<P>Public schools, nevertheless, should permit students to advance from one
grade to the next, or to graduate, only if they master the skills and content
required by their school district's curriculum. It is the mission of the public
school system to provide the resources needed to make that possible.  
</P>
<P>If students can learn to read, for example, they should be expected to, and
we must not permit them, after a certain point, to pass through grade after
grade unless they do learn to read. To the extent that we are not providing a
sufficient range and depth of services to achieve this basic objective, we must
do so.    
</P>
<P><B>Recommendations 
</B></P>
<P>a.  <B>Assessment.</B> Each school district should provide to all students
comprehensive assessments, including reliable standardized tests, at regular
intervals to:</P>
<OL>
<LI>measure their academic achievement;
</LI>
<LI>identify any need for remediation; and
</LI>
<LI>determine their eligibility for grade advancement and graduation.
</LI></OL>
<P> b. <B><B> Elementary school programs. </B></B>Each school district should
establish, as a condition of successful completion of 4th grade, that each
student not diagnosed with a disability which inhibits the capacity to learn to
read must be able to read at no lower than a 4th grade reading level. Each
school district should add services needed for this end and establish comparable
performance requirements in other curricular areas for all grade levels.    
</P>
<P>c.  <B>Secondary school programs.</B> All middle and secondary school
programs should have in place rigorous academic programs through which their
students advance toward graduation as a result of their academic performance.
Secondary school programs should be characterized by:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>course offerings with uniformly high academic standards;
</LI>
<LI>emphasis on reading, writing, math, history, science, and other components
of the State minimum course of study; and
</LI>
<LI>clear standards for any student's admission and retention.
</LI></OL>
<P><B>Key #4  Provide regular planning and guidance for all students  
</B></P>
<P><B>Discussion 
</B></P>
<P>We believe students' performance improves when they understand their role
and the expectations being placed upon them.  
</P>
<P>In elementary schools, it is important that all students and their parents
have a clear understanding of the behavioral and performance expectations
teachers and their schools have for their students. 
</P>
<P>It is also important for the curricula of elementary schools to be
coordinated with their middle and high schools. 
</P>
<P>In secondary schools, it is important for students to have a clear
understanding, not just of their school's expectations, but also of the
fundamental role secondary education has on their future.  
</P>
<P><B>Recommendations  
</B></P>
<P>a.  Within the first several weeks of each school year, all parents of
primary school students should attend parent conferences for the purpose of
obtaining a clear understanding of the expectations classroom and other teachers
have for their children, with respect to both behavior and academic performance.

</P>
<P>b.  All school boards should establish as an objective the integration of
their curricula with that of their designated high school, so as to assure their
school children are prepared for the substance as well as increased rigor
associated with secondary school. 
</P>
<P>c.  Each school district should assure that, beginning in the 7th grade, all
students annually are provided academic and career planning guidance which
involves them and their parents and which is designed: 
</P>
<OL>
<LI>to ensure that students and their parents are aware of educational
opportunities, programs and graduation requirements;
</LI>
<LI>to assist students and their parents in monitoring and planning academic
development and social growth in a consistent and comprehensive fashion from the
7th through the 12th grade; and
</LI>
<LI>to support students and their parents in making career planning and
post-secondary decisions.

President Angelo J. Dorta</FONT></H1>
<P>As your representative organization, Vermont-NEA is keenly aware of the
monumental obstacles which you and your colleagues must overcome every day as
you strive to make Vermont schools work. We hear about the discipline problems,
the erosion of support for your high academic standards, the increasing demands
on your time for non-instructional tasks, and on top of it all, the constant
barrage of negative publicity about education and teachers.  	</P>
<P>We know that Vermont-NEA members want to be in the forefront of the debate
regarding change in our schools. You have told us that you do not want to be in
the position of simply reacting to each and every quick fix that politicians or
others dream up. You have told us that you want to shape the discussion, that
you want to be heard and respected. You have told us that you are tired of
assuming responsibility for the social problems we face as a community, state
and nation.  	</P>
<P>Now, Vermont-NEA has drafted a report, called <I><A HREF="sw.htm">Schools
That Work</A></I>, that speaks to educators' expectations of our schools,
administrators, parents and communities. The report includes the messages we
hear consistently from Association members throughout the state.  
</P>
<P>Every Vermont-NEA member must have an opportunity to help shape what could
be a very important document. To that end:</P>
<OL>
<LI>	The draft document was mailed to every local elected leader in the state.</LI>
<LI>The draft document was revised by the Vermont-NEA Board on December 7,
1996, and  was reprinted in the January 1997 issue of <I>Vermont-NEA Today</I>,
mailed to every Association member. </LI>
<LI>The Vermont-NEA Board approved more changes at their January meeting.</LI>
<LI>Any member may call 1-800-649-6375 for copies of <I>Schools That Work</I>.</LI>
<LI>Any group of Association members may add their collective wisdom to the
document by compiling and submitting their views.</LI>
<LI>Members of the Vermont-NEA Board of Directors or the Vermont-NEA staff have
been available to help facilitate a discussion about <I>Schools That Work</I>.
</LI>
<LI>	Members submitted their views about the document to me at Vermont-NEA
through January.</LI>
<LI>	Finally, a meeting was held on Saturday, January 25, at the Capitol Plaza
in Montpelier to discuss the revised version of <I>Schools That Work</I>. </LI></OL>

</FONT></H1>
<P><IMG SRC="devcal1.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="316"></P>
<P><I><B>This is the time in your baby's life when what's important is
touching, rubbing, closeness, affection, talking, patting, nuzzling, and looking
into your eyes. Your baby is learning even before birth. Your baby knows your
voice and other sounds from your house and family. Your baby is listening and
watching the world, soaking in new experiences like a sponge, quietly and
completely. Even a little baby has a personality. Before words, your baby uses
his/her body to talk to you. Keep the conversation going on your baby's level. 
Try these ideas:
</B></I></P>
<UL>
<LI>Imitate your baby's cooing and babbling.
</LI>
<LI>Talk to your baby in a pleasant voice.</LI>
<LI>Be exciting &#151; use your face to show what you are saying.</LI>
<LI>Provide sounds for your baby &#151; music, singing, noisy toys.</LI>
<LI>Talk about all the house sounds, like water and pet noises.</LI>
<LI> Use variety and expression in your voice.</LI>
<LI>Hang shiny, colorful, safe things above the crib and out of reach.</LI>
<LI>Show the baby objects around the house; remember that what is ordinary to
you is fascinating to this tiny new person.</LI>
<LI>Look in the mirror with baby and talk about what you see.</LI>
<LI> Talk as you are changing diapers, feeding, or bathing your baby. Talk the
storyline for your daily activities: &quot;Now it is time to go to bed.&quot;
Shorten your sentences and repeat a lot; this is great for your little one.</LI>
<LI>Sing in the car to your child, who is securely buckled in the car safety
seat.</LI>
<LI>Peek-a-boo is a great first game.</LI>
<LI> Dance with your young partner. Holding your child while dancing to
different types of music develops rhythmic responses and can be great exercise
for you.
</LI>
<LI>Read books aloud to your child, even your own book. Your voice is a source
of learning and security to your little one.
</LI>
<LI> Child proof your house now. Crawling will start sooner than you
anticipate. If you have questions about &quot;baby proofing&quot; your house,
your local school nurse is a knowledgeable resource.</LI></UL>
<H2><FONT COLOR="#008000">It's never too early to read with your child...</FONT></H2>
<P> Recite the stories and rhymes you remember from your childhood &#151;
nursery rhymes, lullabies, poems, stories.

<P> <B><I> When your baby sits, the world changes. Watching is not enough.
Your baby uses hands as well as eyes to explore. Your child will want to explore
his/her new world. You'll need to be one step ahead, always watching for danger,
as well as chances to share.</I></B></P>
<P>  <I><B>Mothers joke that this time in a baby's life should be called &quot;in-the-mouth&quot;
because babies try to put everything in the mouth. It is important to give your
baby objects without sharp edges that are too large to swallow for holding,
exploring, and playing.</B></I></P>
<P><I><B>Here are activities to consider:</B></I></P>
<UL>
<LI> Remember that everything is new to your baby, so measuring cups and spoons
are as much fun to hold and play with as expensive, complicated toys.</LI>
<LI>All day long, talk and listen, talk and listen.</LI>
<LI> Your baby loves repetition. It is reassuring in a strange world, and it
helps your baby learn &#151; so sing the same songs, tell the same stories, and
tell your baby again and again about things you are doing.</LI>
<LI> Carrying your baby is important for your baby's learning. Many more things
come into view when a baby is higher. From the floor, your baby's world is chair
legs and feet. In your arms, your baby can wonder at the many things you see and
talk about. Baby backpacks can be delightful for parents and baby.</LI>
<LI>Praise your little friend. Your baby wants to make you happy, so your
delight delights your baby. What you say isn't as important as the happiness and
pride in your voice and on your face. Anything, even &quot;you're so smart&quot;
or &quot;your song is so pretty,&quot; will make your baby feel special.</LI>
<LI>Your baby will begin to love and play along with baby games like &quot;Where's
your mouth,&quot; Hide and Seek, and Patty Cake.</LI>
<LI>Give your baby children's books that are OK to play with. Your baby will
learn to turn pages and concentrate on pictures.</LI>
<LI> Set aside specific times in the day to &quot;read&quot; with your baby.</LI></UL>

them, without the fear of damage.
</LI>
<LI>Repeat a new word over and over and use gestures to help your child build
his/her listening and understanding.</LI>
<LI> Learning bye-bye waves and kisses are fun for everyone. </LI>
<LI>Watch for your child's own hand-words, like pointing to a refrigerator when
hungry.</LI>
<LI> Bang on pots to make music; dance to your songs. Your pre-toddler loves
movement and noise.
</LI>
<LI>Sing in the car, too. Treat yourself and share your favorite songs with
your child. Your pre-toddler doesn't love only nursery rhymes.</LI>
<LI> Your busy, busy, busy child loves to experiment, touch, and make &quot;messes.&quot;
Help meet that desire on your terms: finger paint with pudding on a cookie
sheet; play with shaving cream in the bathtub; put a plastic table cloth on the
floor, then play with play-dough or eat a popsicle with fingers.</LI>
<LI>Your pre-toddler will have some &quot;words.&quot; These words might not
sound the way our words do, but praise your child and enjoy this sign of early
learning and achievement &#151; even if your pre-toddler's favorite words are &quot;no,
more, mine.&quot;</LI>
<LI> Make animal noises when you read animal books. Pretend to be animals by
making noises and crawling together.</LI>
<LI>Water is fascinating to your pre-toddler. Bathtub play with plastic cups
and scoops will delight and amuse your child. You must always be there to watch,
no matter how little water is in the tub.</LI></UL>

<P><B><I>Your child is off and running, building knowledge of the world. Your
toddler's block towers, climbing skills, and longer sentences are signs of
independence.</I></B></P>
<P><I><B>Hang on! Your toddler won't stay this busy forever. Here are some
activities to try:</B></I></P>
<UL>
<LI>Make life easier for yourself &#151; if you don't want something touched or
broken, put it away for awhile.</LI>
<LI>Don't set yourself up for a hassle &#151; supervise messy stuff and put
those crayons and the play-dough away when you aren't around so you won't have
toddler-decorated walls. Keep stools and chairs away from higher areas you don't
want bothered. Toddlers become expert climbers at the most unexpected times.</LI>
<LI>During nap times, treat yourself to a break. Do something you really enjoy
before you start catching up on household chores. Also try to remember your
morning: Did your toddler say a new word? Stack more blocks? Help with a chore?
Toddlers learn and change so quickly that every day brings growth. Find time to
recognize and enjoy it. Maybe you will want to write in a journal or tape record
some of the more exciting changes you see.</LI>
<LI>Expand your child's sentences. Say what your toddler says, but add a few
extra words. Talk about everything you do, and encourage your toddler to talk,
too.</LI>
<LI>Build with blocks and other toys. For toddlers, mowing down a tower is as
fun and instructive as building it. Try it with your toddler; it really is fun.</LI>
<LI>Narrate your toddler's play, but don't question and quiz. Your toddler
doesn't have the words to answer yet.</LI>
<LI>To help build skill following directions, give your toddler one or two
simple tasks and praise him/her for being a wonderful helper.</LI>
<LI>Homemade puppets are a treat &#151; a white sock with a colored magic
marker face will delight your toddler.</LI>
<LI>Start pretend games like &quot;feed the baby&quot; &#151; teach your
toddler to be a caring person, like you!</LI>
<LI>Dress-up fun in mommy's hat and daddy's boots will entertain your toddler
and help give him/her practice with dressing.</LI>
<LI>Talk with your child. Take time to listen as you tell your child about your
world. </LI>
<LI>Bedtime is a special time. Talk in the dark, tell stories.</LI>
<LI>Kids are starting to play with each other. Look for play groups or start
your own. Kid to kid, parent to parent, we both need folks our own age.</LI>
<LI>Your toddler's favorite words will be &quot;no, want it, me, mine,&quot;
but action words will be coming soon.</LI></UL>

<P><B><I>&quot;The world is me,&quot; says your toddler.</I></B></P>
<P><B><I>You will spend more time listening. It takes a lot of time for
toddlers to share all the wonderful things they are discovering. Your older
toddler is still busy but will spend longer amounts of time playing at one
thing. Your toddler has explored the world with eyes, mouth, hands, and legs;
now comes exploring by thinking. Here are some fun things to try:</I></B></P>
<UL>
<LI>Learn about colors: sort blocks, socks, clothes by color, saying the color
word many times.</LI>
<LI>Show your toddler different uses for the same thing: dig with a spoon, eat
with a spoon.</LI>
<LI>Make stories longer, and try different books more often.</LI>
<LI>Knob puzzles with 1-5 pieces are fun, but so is dropping buttons or dry
macaroni into small plastic bottles.</LI>
<LI>Your toddler is using short sentences like, &quot;my shirt, mommy eat, want
now,&quot; and, of course, knows the name of everyone in the family.</LI>
<LI>Finger painting and fat crayons are treats and good learning tools.</LI>
<LI> Make everything an adventure; your toddler loves enthusiasm.</LI>
<LI>Do exercises together, with or without TV help.</LI>
<LI>Begin to tell your toddler about plans for the day, such as shopping and
doctors' visits, before you go.</LI>
<LI> Your toddler thinks chores are a game. Enjoy it and praise lavishly when
your toddler picks up toys, puts clothes in the basket, or puts things in the
trash for you.</LI>
<LI>Make faces in the mirror together and describe how the two of you look.</LI>
<LI>Roll big balls while sitting on the floor.</LI>
<LI>Explore with hands: half fill a dishpan with beans, rice or snow and
practice shoveling, pouring, dumping and funneling.</LI></UL>

to try:</I></B></P>
<UL>
<LI>Begin the public library habit. There are tape stories and books for check
out. There are also story hours which delight the children and allow parents
time to browse the books or just listen and rest.</LI>
<LI>Act out songs, learn songs with actions, and make up your own songs.</LI>
<LI> Build things with blocks, duplo, pillows, or pencils.</LI>
<LI>Pretend to be an animal and live under the table.</LI>
<LI>Crayons or fat magic markers on old newspaper make wonderful pictures.</LI>
<LI>Puzzles with 5-10 pieces are about right.</LI>
<LI> Go on a walk and look at bugs, sticks, or interesting rocks. Talk about
everything you see.</LI>
<LI>Play copy cat with your body and your words.</LI>
<LI> String cheerios or fruit loops on a string for a beautiful good-tasting
necklace.</LI>
<LI>Play with bubbles and plastic dishes in the sink.</LI>
<LI>Put down the plastic tablecloth and play with dry rice and beans with
scoops and cups.</LI>
<LI>Say-sing nursery rhymes and counting songs.</LI>
<LI>Read your favorite stories; let your child fill in frequent words of the
story.</LI>
<LI>Make up your own songs to match whatever you are doing.</LI>
<LI>Identify and sing songs about parts of the body: eyes, knees, nose, feet,
hands, ears.</LI>
<LI>Talk about time passage, things that are past and things that are in the
future.</LI>
<LI> Play action games with hopping and skipping.</LI>
<LI>Ripping and tearing is a fun natural desire at this age, so provide scrap
paper and old newspaper to avoid having books and magazines shredded.</LI>
<LI>Attend your local school's pre-school screening. Your child will enjoy the
different activities, and you will get to share your child with his/her future
teachers. You will also find out about playgrounds and story hours.</LI>
<LI>Make sure your child sees you read. Don't always save your own books and
reading for when your child sleeps.</LI>
<LI>Tell your child you're reading when you use the phone book, a cook book,
shopping guides, newspapers, and magazines.</LI></UL>

<LI>Help your child share with others, but allow him/her to have one thing
he/she doesn't have to share with his/her friends.   </LI>
<LI>Since fantasy is more elaborate, puppets and stuffed animals can be animals
in the jungle, in the zoo, or kings at a tea party.   </LI>

office.   </LI>

glue-on art projects, and counting.   </LI>
<LI>Encourage your child to have a friend over to play, with a parent; then
encourage your child to visit a friend without you. Keep the visits short and
positive.   </LI>

</H1>
<P><IMG SRC="devcal8.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="254"><I><B>As
you watch your young preschooler move, talk, play, and work, you are amazed at
how much your child has learned and accomplished in so little time. The &quot;expert&quot;
will remind you frequently of these accomplishments.
</B></I></P>
<P><I><B>Your child is ready for the challenges of complicated toys, books,
and adventures, but still can tire easily from the excitement. Your preschooler
needs your help in setting limits and finding quiet time to unwind.
</B></I></P>
<P><B><I>These are the accomplishments of your preschooler: identifying the
eight basic colors and four basic shapes; counting things up to four; counting
from memory to 10; speaking in sentences of 4-5 words; expressing complicated
ideas; making up wonderful stories (but sometimes having trouble telling make
believe from truth); speaking clearly, except for some hard sounds like z, th,
v, l, s, sh, ch, and r.
</I></B></P>
<P><I><B>Your young preschooler still asks many questions but doesn't always
wait for the answer, or will even argue that your answer isn't right. Your child
is beginning to reason things out, but like everything, reasoning takes
practice, so be patient with some of the strange notions your child insists are
right. Here are some fun things to try:
</B></I></P>
<UL>
<LI>Write out made-up stories, then act them out with mom and dad as audience.
</LI>
<LI>Cooperative play is great fun for your child, so provide times to spend
with other children the same age. Develop a baby care co-op. Find a mother or
two with children your child's age and set up a play schedule. Your child will
have a chance for fun and learning with others, and you will get some time for
yourself to talk to the other mothers.
</LI>
<LI>Explore all the playgrounds in local parks and schools. Your child will
love the variety of places for physical activities.
</LI>
<LI>Play with elaborate puzzles with 18 to 25 pieces. 
</LI>
<LI>Legos are good additions to your basic wood blocks. Encourage your child to
name and make up a story about everything that is built.
</LI>
<LI>Make a list and then take a trip to the grocery store. Talk about the
groups of foods, and let your preschooler hold the coupons. Show your child
which items to cross off the shopping list.
</LI>
<LI>Sort through clothes. Talk about how small your child was when wearing the
things that are too small, and how much bigger your child will be next year.
</LI>

the Association through the successful battle against the proposal to establish
a statewide teachers' contract. (The contract would have sacrificed hard won
local Association contracts and many teacher rights and protections.) After
leaving office, Molly returned to teaching history at Rutland's new high school.

<P><B><font size="+1"> Why implement Quality Management Education? </font></b><p>

"Employers including those that hire the largest numbers of our
graduates, are telling us that in this century, nothing more
fundamental and pervasive than TQM has transformed the practices
of management. They are pleading with business and engineering
colleges to integrate TQM into their curricula. But to teach it,
we must practice it."<p>

<font size="+1"><B> How are the Faculty involved in the change?</b></font><p>

"In 1991, faculty conducted an extensive review in preparation
for a complete revision of the curriculum. Though not every
course calls for complete revision, TQM affects most courses and
every business discipline. In September 1991, faculty were formed
into curricular teams and began the revision. As the process
evolved, the focus of the college shifted from the
discipline-centered curriculum teams. This led, in the spring of
1992, to abolition of the academic departments as a natural step
in the transformation of the college into a customer-oriented
college."<p>

<font size="+1"><B> TQM implies qualities of both cooperation and leadership.
How are these treated in the business curriculum?</b></font><p>
"Throughout the program, students work in teams and cooperate
with one another in learning. They are taught the skills of
leadership: how to present their ideas effectively, orally and in
writing, and how to interact well with others. These qualities are
essential in today's work place.<p>

RIT business students practice these skills throughout the
program".<p>

<font size="+1"><B>How does business at RIT differ from other universities
that offer courses and programs in TQM?</b></font><p>

"The key word is 'pervasive.' TQM affects everything we do. The
concepts of TQM are incorporated into everything we teach.
Teaching, itself, is a systematic process, to which the
principles of TQM can be applied. Process control applied to
teaching means that professors receive continuous feedback from
their students, allowing the professor to monitor students'
progress and equally important to correct and improve his or her
own approach to teaching. In the RIT College of Business, we expect every faculty member to make excellent teaching the primary goal."<p>

<font size="+1"><B>What can students expect in a TQM environment?</b></font>
<p>
" Quality Management Education means that students and faculty work together toward the goal of giving every student complete mastery of the knowledge and skills required for Total Quality Management. We want Malcolm Baldrige winners and contenders to be 
eager to hire our graduates. To achieve that, we need constant, immediate feedback from our students. Our students need our immediate response. We need to know when they require help. Academia can no longer assume that every failure to learn is a student 
failure. We need to know when we are doing something wrong. We need to know immediately so that we can get it right."

<p>
Often referred to as the language of business, accounting is the art of measuring, communicating, and interpreting financial activity. Modern businesses must have accurate, timely and dependable financial information in order to remain competitive.
<p>
RIT's accounting major is designed to prepare students to meet the financial information needs of the ever-changing business world.  Students learn how to interact with other business disciplines and the business community in order to interpret and provide the informational needs of profit-making, non-profit and governmental business operations and regulatory agencies.
<p>
Successful accountants are those who serve their clients with both competence and integrity. Total Quality Management, the foundation of the accounting program at RIT, emphasizes the mastery of the subject, ethical behavior and quality client service.

<P>
The goal of the finance program is to produce graduates who will seek
solutions to the challenges and problems of modern business and who will
assume leadership in the ever-widening global environment.  Students are
taught the principles of financial decision making and given an
understanding of the complex economic, legal and financial environment in
which they operate.
<p>
Business leaders tell us that there us a need for managers with both
technical knowledge and communications skills.  Our curriculum trains
future managers who satisfy this need with a comprehensive understanding
of the world of business and its focus on Total Quality Management.
<p>
RIT's finance program provides a high level of technical professional
development through a comprehensive program of liberal arts,
communication and presentation skills, a solid business core and work in
the student's professional concentration.

<P>
With the growing complexity of organizations and the increase in global
markets, information has become an extremely valuable asset.  Information
systems specialists create and manage the information resources required
for the success of today's organization.  As companies have learned to
make strategic use of such information to gain competitive advantage in
the marketplace, demand has grown dramatically for those who are trained
to design such systems.
<P>
RIT's information systems students receive an education in business,
computer programming and systems analysis with Total Quality Management
integrated throughout the curriculum.  Students also have a thorough
understanding of data processing fundamentals, including the ability to
write properly documented programs.  This combination ideally prepares
them to help design and create the types of computerized systems
businesses need.

International competition in a global society has made passports
practically a necessity for U.S. business professionals.  Because
technology makes crossing international borders as easy as crossing the
street companies are becoming more international in focus.  Tomorrow's
corporate leaders will be those with expertise beyond the American
market.
<p>
With its theme of Total Quality Management, the international business
program at RIT prepares highly motivated students who want careers with an
international focus.  Our graduates satisfy the growing need for
managers, marketing specialists and financial analysts who understand the

With the growing emphasis on quality management and customer
satisfaction, the role of marketing is crucial to the goals of business

product/service development, advertising and professional selling,
channel management and pricing.  RIT's marketing program excels in
teaching the future marketing professional to listen to the voice of the
customer.

More than 90% of employees recently surveyed indicated that an
understanding of quality principles is needed for success in business
today.  RIT's College of Business has received honors and national

To give students the background essential in today's business
environment, faculty and staff have dedicated themselves to incorporating
the concepts, models, and processes of Total Quality Management
into the college's curriculum and operations. RIT's
College of Business has been recognized for its efforts in this
area and was one of eight universities nationwide chosen to participate in
the TQM University Challenge.
This program was developed by Motorola, Xerox, Proctor &amp; Gamble,
IBM, and Milliken to assist universities with the integration
of Total Quality Management into curricula. RIT's College
of Business also received a TQM grant of $1.28 million from IBM.

industries. This team developed an Executive MBA educational experience
that is cross functional, dynamic, and relevant for organizational leaders
of the 21st century.

The backbone of RIT's Executive MBA are the curricular topics relating to
strategic decision making, total quality and leadership. The integrity of
the MBA is maintained, while the content delivered is unique. Traditional
MBA topics, such as marketing, finance, and production management, are
designed to be delivered and discussed in an inter-disciplinary format.

<p>

Today's global manufacturing and service environments require executives
who possess skills different from those needed a few years ago. A stronger
focus on leadership, customer satisfaction, productivity, and a
world-class approach are essential to success.

Our Executive MBA was designed, by a team of RIT faculty and executives
from all sectors, for professionals with <EM>substantial career

<P>

Quality Management Education transforms talented organizational
specialists into leaders for the 21st century. This program is ideal for
emerging executives in organizations serious about improving customer
satisfaction and product quality.

The traditional functional areas of business are not taught as distinct,
separate courses. Instead, they are integrated throughout the curriculum
as critical skills supporting effective implementation of quality-oriented
strategies.
<p>

The Executive MBA has been distinguished as a national "hands-on"
educational experience. It is a unique combination of the best theoretical
approaches stressing issues of implementation and utilization. It is a
"general management" approach to graduate business learning.

<p>
The four breadth of field courses for the MS in International Business are
often concentrated in marketing, Finance, information systems, management,
accounting or technology management. This breadth is necessary since most
MS in International Business graduates obtain professional employment in a
functional area with an international assignment.
<p>
The two research courses typically include Statistical Analysis for
Decision Making, Customer Satisfaction Research, Business Forecasting or
Design of Experiment I.
<p>
A thesis or practicum related to International Business issues and
concerns will be required of each candidate.
<p>
<hr> 
<B><H3>Curriculum</H3></b>
<p>
The graduate program of study consists of 48 credits or 12 courses, which
can be completed in one academic year of full-time study or in six
quarters of part-time study. 
<p>
<H4><b>Program Design</b></h4>

<b> 4 courses in the  breadth of field</b> (16 quarter hours)
<p>
The breadth of field courses comprise four courses from the College of
Business functional course offerings, i.e., accounting, finance,
marketing, management, information systems, as well as a course from
outside the College of Business.
<p>
<b> 2 courses in  research</b> (8 quarter hours)
<p>
These courses are designed to expose the candidate to procedures of
research methodology, data gathering and data analysis:
<p>
<b> Thesis</b>
<p>
The thesis is a conceptual and theoretical research project designed by
the candidate and a member of the graduate international business faculty.
In addition, the director of the program can aid the candidate in
selecting a thesis topic that has current international business relevance.
This is done to explore a salient international business oriented issue. 
<P>
<b>Practicum</b>
<p>
When the practicum option is selected, the candidate must complete an
applied corporate-oriented research project designed by the candidate and
international business faculty to explore an applied international
business issue.

<h4> Admission Requirements</h4>
RIT operates on a quarter system calendar, thus part-time students may
apply for entry into the MBA program in the fall, winter, spring, or
summer. However, applicants planning full-time study must begin their
studies in the fall quarter. Completed applications for admission should
be on file in the Office of Admissions five weeks prior to registration
day for the upcoming academic quarter to ensure adequate time for
consideration by the Graduate Review Committee.
<P>
Admission to the MBA program will be granted to graduates of accredited
baccalaureate degree programs who, in the opinion of the Graduate Review
Committee of the College of Business, have demonstrated their potential to
successfully complete graduate business studies through their achievements
in their undergraduate program and professional career development.
<P>
All applicants who are admitted prior to the conclusion of their
baccalaureate programs are required to submit their final transcripts by
the end of the first quarter of graduate work. Students who have been
accepted into a program are allowed to defer their enrollment (admission)
for up to one year. If a student wishes to defer enrollment beyond one
year, a new application must be submitted, and credentials will be
reevaluated on the basis of current admission standards.

Richard N. Rosett, President of the U.S. Business School, also is dean
of the Rochester  Institute Of Technology's College of Business. Rosett
and Jack H. Purnell, chairman and chief executive officer of
Anheuser-Busch International, Inc., teamed with others to found the
school. The U.S. School of Business was established with the consent of
Milan Adam, former Czech minister of education, and with the support of
Vaclav Klaus, prime minister of the Czech Republic and former minister of
finance for Czechoslovakia. Prime Minister Klaus has served as an academic
adviser to the school since its inception.
<p>
In April 1995, the AACSB reaffirmed its accreditation of RIT's College of
Business and here is how they described RIT in their report:
<p>
<blockquote>"The College of Business is to be highly commended for its
dedication to quality.  It is undoubtedly one of the nation's leaders in
bringing Total Quality principles to the university."</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>"In effect, the college's approach to continuous improvement
is the embodiment of the spirit of the AACSB standards."</blockquote>
<p>
Most western MBA programs begin their advanced business studies already
familiar with how a free market economy works. But students at the
U.S.Business school at Prague first needed to be taught the fundamentals
of a free-market economy and then be taught how to succeed in the new
marketplace. U.S.Business School professors focus on teaching the
underlying factors that lead to an efficient, innovative, adaptable and
prosperous free-market economy. In essence, The U.S. Business School
offers Western-style advanced Graduate study of business, trade and
economics, customized to meet the needs of Central and Eastern European
students.
<p>
<hr>
