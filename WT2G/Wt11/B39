CAPITAL, a German monthly specialized in financial aspects of economy, had a
story, in it's July edition, about a phone phreak "Kimble" who offers an
AMIGA-based program with built-in frequencies to switch your telecom connection
over more than 20 countries. In June, he demonstrated this program in CAPITAL's
office in Duesseldorf, in the presence of some experts from a criminal agency
and an IT security experts. German Telecom was informed days ahead the
presentation but could not trace his dialling experiments which lead him from
Duesseldorf to Canada (known as normal entry of European Phreaks to the New
World), and so on. Kimble said that non-traceability be a major new feature of
this blue-boy program "Unlimited Assess (Multi-Frequency Dialler)".

Phreaking was practiced, for some time, also in Hamburg's Chaos Club. In last
year's Chaos Congress, they once more held a seminar on Phreaking (given by
the Dutch Hac-Tic group; the German report on this part is available, with the
Chaos Congress' documentation, either from CCC or from Virus Test Center's ftp
site).  CCC and Hac-Tic freely distributed information on blue box programs 
for PCs and 68000 systems. Due to this action, the price of a blue box program
went down significantly (from about 500 DM to about 100 DM), and one can 
upload blue box programs together with games from ordinary BBS. But German 
Telecom said that the holes which these programs exploit have been patched. 

When CAPITAL first contacted me (before the experiment), I was not very
impressed. But the the experiment continued, and some really shocking results
were reported: when German Telecom could also neither trace nor intercept a
second experiment, they reportedly asked some Canadian experts for assistance.
When they watched and tried to close the hole, they observed that somebody just
worked in their "system" to implant some Trojan horse (don't ask me how,
because if I believe Telecom, there is ***no connection to the outside*** When
they patched the holes in changing some frequencies, this evidently was
immediately "mediated" (path unknown) to the phreaks (organised in a group
"Dope", evidently working internationally). Unlimited Access comes with a
1-year guarantee of free updates of frequencies: this is different from other
blue-boy programs and may verify the unusual price (15,000 DM, about 10,000 $),
but remember that this program excludes being traced by Telecoms!  And the
group evidently "received" the updated frequencies immediately and distributed
them to their "clients".

Just for *caution and clarification*: due to the stress of end-of-semester, I
couldnot personally observe the experiment. My report is based on some
telephone discussions (not bluebox-dialled) with the journalist, on the
assessment of a participating colleague which I trust, as well as on some
discussions which I had with Telecom on related matters, and with some phreaks
in my neighbourhood *:)

  Articles in the NY Times, Washington Post, and elsewhere on 9 July 1992 gave
details of federal grand jury indictments on 8 July of five New York City area
computer ``hackers''.  The five, who call themselves ``Masters of Disaster''
and ``Masters of Deception'' (MOD), are Julio Fernandez, 18 (``Outlaw'' --
Bronx), John Lee, 21 (``Corrupt'' -- Brooklyn), Mark Abene, 20 (``Phiber
Optik'' -- Queens), Elias Ladopoulos, 22 (``Acid Phreak'' -- Queens), and Paul
Stira, 22 (``Scorpion'' -- Queens).  The 11-count indictment accuses the
defendants of computer tampering, computer fraud, wire fraud, illegal
wiretapping and conspiracy -- including system disruptions and stealing data,
including 176 confidential reports on consumers' credit ratings (which they
sold), and breaking into computer-communication systems (e.g., a Southwestern
Bell 5ESS switch in El Paso, ITT, and TYMNET, Bank of America,
Martin-Marietta), credit reporting services (TRW), databases (Trans Union Corp,
Information America), and universities (NYU, U.Washington).  On Nov. 28, 1989,
they allegedly wiped out nearly all of the information in a computer used by
the Educational Broadcasting Corp., public television station WNET, Channel 13
in New York.  They face up to 5 years in prison for each count, or 55 years in
total, plus a maximum fine of $250,000 for each count.  Court-ordered wire-taps
were used (apparently the first time for data transfers).

The Times article included this: 

   In the 11-count indictment, the men were accused of holding a conversation
   on Nov. 6, 1991, in which they discussed obtaining information on how to
   alter TRW credit reports adding or removing credit delinquency statements,
   for example to ``destroy peoples lives or make them look like saints.'' 

   They are also accused of a conversation on Nov. 14, 1991, of discussing a
   lengthy list of institutions with computers that one of them said, ``We've
   just got to start hitting these left and right.'' These institutions
   included government offices, private companies and an Air Force base.

   The federal indictment was handed down in Manhattan and was the result of a
   joint investigation by the U.S. attorney's office, the Secret Service and
   the FBI.

Source:  St Petersburg Times, 7/11/92, pg B1, Jane Meinhardt

A Time Inc. employee offered detectives computer records on thousands
of credit cards - for a price...on the street for $1 each

Pinellas County sheriffs detectives on Thursday arrested a Time employee who
they said had information on more than 3,000 credit cards, including account
numbers, expiration dates...A tipster reported the fraud scheme mid-June to
detectives who met the man 4 times...to buy computer discs and lists of credit
card numbers...Detectives found additional computer discs and other credit card
information in Ferguson's apartment...the data in his apartment would yield
information on 80,000 more credit cardholders, Ferguson told Pinellas County's
Lt. Rick Wilfong.

"There were credit cards numbers from people all over the country.  The
detectives made certain requests for credit card numbers from certain regions.
He told us he had to manipulate the Time system to get them, and he was able to
produce them.  He's not a polished criminal in this type of activity.  But from
what he sold us, he had unusual access to a lot of information he used
fraudulently", Marianne Pasha, sheriffs office [...?].

Thomas Ferguson was charged with 4 counts of trafficking in credit cards.
"We're reasonably sure he didn't sell to anyone else.  He was making attempts
to sell to others but we believe we were the first to buy."  Wilfong Ferguson
had no record of credit card [fraud].  He had been convicted of aggravated
assault in 1988...and sentenced to 3 years in prison and one year probation.

Peter Costiglio, Time VP and spokesman:

- Ferguson was a computer analyst for Time for 1.5 years.
- He's been suspended pending the outcome of the criminal investigation.
- Costiglio refused to discuss Fergusons job or Time's security system.
  "Any company property has been recovered.
  There's been no breach of the security system."

That's a reassuring statement?  Sigh.

Recently I found the following quotation that may be of interest to RISKS
readers:

  "To err is human but to really foul things up requires a computer."
             -- Farmers' Almanac for 1978 (1977) `Capsules of Wisdom'

This is the only quotation on computers to have made it to `The Oxford
Dictionary of Modern Quotations', Oxford University Press, 1991.

	In the modern battlefield, be it on land or at sea, there is little to
no time for a positive visual ID of the incoming.  A likely RISK is matching
a flight profile or radar pattern to a known threat and firing before being
fired upon.  In this case, few real details have emerged for armchair analysis.
I seem to remember the attacking Japanese flight at Pearl Harbor being
dismissed as a flight of friendly, and unarmed, B-17's when spotted on radar.
One wonders if the system designer remembered this incident when he wrote the
software for the AEGIS system.  When there are billions of warship to protect,
and civilian lives in the area, which do you choose to protect at all costs?

&gt;One is the image of a technician madly scanning through a dog-eared issue of
&gt;the OAG (the article didn't mention a brand name) to find the Iranian flight.
&gt;It's hard enough to not miss an entry when in a quiet airport in a single time
&gt;zone.  I realize that tracking civilian flights was not part of the normal
&gt;battle plan, but I presume that the system has still not been updated to link
&gt;to the civilian airline reservation systems or other such sources of
&gt;information.  One change in warfare, which I think the Gulf War illustrated,
&gt;is how the commercial technology has, in many ways, surpassed the military.
&gt;Of course, the online airline info might not be accurate which means a delayed
&gt;flight could still have been missed.

	Do not forget that an F-14 or even a B-2 can be listed as a civilian
727 in normal civilian reservation logs.  If it was my ship, I wouldn't trust
that logbook farther than I could throw it.  If it was on an attack profile,
I'd open fire.  Note that this profile was under investigation for quite a
few days, but I don't remember any conclusive findings being published.

&gt;The other is that the tagging of the plane as an F-14 provided for no level 
&gt;of ambiguity.  Even in the heat of battle, can the system cope with multiple 
&gt;interpretations of data or does it mindless lock in on a worst case and then 
&gt;present it to the befuddled user as fact?

	In a military environment, I would hope so, given the caveat that the
user knows it's a worst-case scenario.  I always assume a worst-case scenario
in my daily network maintainence; would you do less when a warship is at stake?

	NOTE: my experience in the Navy has not given me any knowledge of the
AEGIS system beyond the general that may be found in Janes.  Do not interpret
my comments as being those of a technical expert in the AEGIS system.

Below is an excerpt from an article that I posted to rec.aviation, with a 
cross posting to rec.travel.air, which I didn't notice.  The text explains
why I am forwarding it to you.  Thanks.
 
BTW the single &gt; are me, and the doubles are [Mark Brader].

&gt;From msb@sq.com Thu Jul  9 16:33:37 1992
To: barrk@tramp.Colorado.EDU
Subject: A-320

&gt; &gt; I find it rather disappointing -- one has only to read comp.risks for
&gt; &gt; a while to gain a distrust of the A-320, or at least its overdose of
&gt; &gt; computerization.  Starting in November of 1993, when UA's first A-320
&gt; &gt; will be delivered, I'll be watching more closely over just what they
&gt; &gt; want to put me in.

I think comp.risks readers would be interested in the message you posted in
response to the above.  I enclose a copy below in case you didn't keep one.
You can post to comp.risks by mailing to risks@csl.sri.com.

&gt; As someone who is hoping and praying for a job with UAL someday, I too
&gt; am rather disappointed that United will soon be flying these computerized
&gt; aircraft.  I much prefer the Boeing concept of let the computer fly, but
&gt; give the pilot the override capability.  I was speaking with a UAL pilot
&gt; Tuesday night about the acquisition, and we chatted about the problems
&gt; of putting all of your eggs in one basket.  He told me about two
&gt; Airbus occurences that were interesting, and since I haven't seen them
&gt; mentioned here before, I  will post them.  I apologize if they are repeats.
&gt; 
&gt; #1  A Pan Am Airbus A300 or A310 (I don't remember which) was on final
&gt; approach in VMC conditions.  All was looking well until the airplane
&gt; reached minimums.  At that point the aircraft executed a go-around, and
&gt; flew the entire missed approach procedure.  The pilots were not able 
&gt; to disengage the autopilot until they were well established in the
&gt; hold.
&gt; 
&gt; #2  Apparently as a safety feature derived from the crash of the
&gt; Air Florida flight into the Potomac, a feature was installed on Airbusses
&gt; to minimize/eliminate (hah!) the possibility of taking off without full
&gt; takeoff thrust.  The system automatically pushes the throttles the
&gt; rest of the way forward if they are not already there when the nose-wheel
&gt; strut decompresses.   One time (type and whereabouts unknown to me) an
&gt; Airbus was being pushed back from the gate after the pilots had started
&gt; both engines.  As luck would have it the tow-bar snapped, and the airplane
&gt; coasted backwards.  When the pilots realized they were just rolling backwards
&gt; they stomped on the brakes.  The airplane of course, with its aft center of 
&gt; gravity, tipped back onto it's tail, thus decompressing the nose gear.  The
&gt; computer took over, and jammed the throttles forward, sending the airplane
&gt; racing towards the concourse.  The pilots realized what was happening just
&gt; in time to avoid a nasty collision with the tug, and terminal building.

Suppose the Federal Government doesn't have trouble decoding encrypted
messages, but wants people to think it does.  If so, what's to stop the U.S.
from _loosening_ restrictions on cryptography?  Imagine the risk to privacy in
a world where encryption was legal, unrestricted, and widely used in the belief
that not even the U.S. government could decipher encrypted messages.  In the
land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.

&gt;Perhaps what the Feds are looking for is a new weapon of prosecution; use of
                                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                          persecution?

&gt;cryptography is by definition a felony, and widespread use of cryptography
&gt;is then by definition racketeering as defined by RICO.  It's like bagging
&gt;Capone for tax evasion, when he was too slippery to be caught breaking the
&gt;law.  I find this sloppiness unacceptable as a taxpayer.

Second Thoughts On New York Computer Crime Indictments 7/13/92 NEW YORK, N.Y.,
U.S.A., 1992 JULY 13 (NB) -- On Wednesday, July 9th, I sat at a press briefing
in New York City's Federal Court Building during which law enforcement
officials presented details relating to the indictment of 5 young computer
"hackers". In describing the alleged transgressions of the indicted, United
States Assistant Attorney Stephen Fishbein wove a tale of a conspiracy in which
members of an evil sounding group called the "Masters of Destruction" (MOD)
attempted to wreck havoc with the telecommunications system of the country.

The accused were charged with infiltrating computer systems belonging to
telephone companies, credit bureaus, colleges and defense contractors --
Southwestern Bell, BT North America, New York Telephone, ITT, Information
America, TRW, Trans Union, Pacific Bell, the University of Washington, New York
University, U.S. West, Learning Link, Tymnet and Martin Marietta Electronics
Information, and Missile Group. They were charged with causing injury to the
telephone systems, charging long distance calls to the universities, copying
private credit information and selling it to third parties -- a long list of
heinous activities.

The immediate reaction to the indictments were predictably knee-jerk.  Those
who support any so-called "hacker"-activities mocked the government and the
charges that were presented, forgetting, it seems to me, that these charges are
serious -- one of the accused could face up to 40 years in prison and $2
million in fines; another - 35 years in prison and $1.5 million in fines. In
view of that possibility, it further seems to me that it is a wasteful
diversion of effort to get all excited that the government insists on misusing
the word "hacker"  (The indictment defines computer hacker as "someone who
uses a computer or a telephone to obtain unauthorized access to other
computers.")  or that the government used wiretapping evidence to obtain the
indictment (I think that, for at least the time being that the wiretapping was
carried out under a valid court order; if it were not, the defendants'
attorneys will have a course of action.).

On the other hand, those who traditionally take the government and corporate
line were publicly grateful that this threat to our communications life had
been removed -- they do not in my judgement properly consider that some of
these charges may have been ill-conceived and a result of political
considerations.

Both groups, I think, oversimplify and do not give proper consideration to the
wide spectrum of issues raised by the indictment document. The issues range
from a simple black-and-white case of fraudulently obtaining free telephone
time to the much broader question of the appropriate interaction of technology
and law enforcement.

The most clear cut cases are the charges such as the ones which allege that two
of the indicted, Julio Fernandez a/k/a "Outlaw" and John Lee a/k/a "Corrupt"
fraudulently used the computers of New York University to avoid paying long
distance charges for calls to computer systems in El Paso Texas and Seattle,
Washington. The individuals named either did or did not commit the acts alleged
and, if it is proven that they did, they should receive the appropriate penalty
(it may be argued that the 5 year, $250,000 fine maximum for each of the counts
in this area is excessive but that is a sentencing issue not an indictment
issue.).

Other charges of this black-and-white are those that allege that Fernandez
and/or Lee intercepted electronic communications over networks belonging to
Tymnet and the Bank of America. Similarly, the charge that Fernandez, on
December 4, 1991 possessed hundreds of user id's and passwords of Soutwestern
Bell, BT North America and TRW fits in the category of "either he did it or he
didn't."

A more troubling count is the charge that the indicted 5 were all part of a
conspiracy to "gain access to and control of computer systems in order to
enhance their image and prestige among other computer hackers; to harass and
intimidate rival hackers and people they did not like; to obtain telephone,
credit, information, and other services without paying for them; and to obtain.
passwords, account numbers and other things of value which they could sell to
others."

To support this allegation, the indictment lists 26, lettered A through Z,
"Overt Acts" to support the conspiracy. While this section of the indictment
lists numerous telephone calls between some of the individuals, it mentions the
ame Paul Stira a/k/a "Scorpion" only twice with both allegations dated "on or
about" January 24, 1990, a full 16 months before the next chronological
incident. Additionally, Stira is never mentioned as joining in any of the
wiretapped conversation -- in fact, he is never mentioned again!  I find it
hard to believe that he could be considered, from these charges, to have
engaged in a criminal conspiracy with any of the other defendants.

Additionally, some of the allegations made under the conspiracy count seem
disproportionate to some of the others. Mark Abene a/k/a "Phiber Optik" is of
possessing proprietary technical manuals belonging to BT North America while it
is charged that Lee and Fernandez, in exchange for several hundred dollars,
provided both information on how to illegally access credit reporting bureaus
and an actual TRW account and password to a person, Morton Rosenfeld, who later
illegally accessed TRW, obtained credit reports on 176 individuals and sold the
reports to private detective (Rosenfeld, indicted separately, pled guilty to
obtaining and selling the credit reports and named "Julio" and "John" as those
who provided him with the information). I did not see anywhere in the charges
any indication that Abene, Stira or Elias Lapodoulos conspired with or likewise
encouraged Lee or Fernandez to sell information involving the credit bureaus to
a third party

Another troubling point is the allegation that Fernandez, Lee, Abene and
"others whom they aided and abetted" performed various computer activities
"that caused losses to Southwestern Bell of approximately $370,000." The
$370,000 figure, according to Assistant United States Attorney Stephen
Fishbein, was developed by Southwestern Bell and is based on "expenses to
locate and replace computer programs and other information that had been
modified or otherwise corrupted, expenses to determine the source of the
unauthorized intrusions, and expenses for new computers and security devices
that were necessary to prevent continued unauthorized access by the defendants
and others whom they aided and abetted."

While there is precedent in assigning damages for such things as "expenses for
new computers and security devices that were necessary to prevent continued
unauthorized access by the defendants and others whom they aided and abetted."
(the Riggs, Darden &amp; Grant case in Atlanta found that the defendants were
liable for such expenses), many feel that such action is totally wrong. If a
person is found uninvited in someone's house, they are appropriately charge
with unlawful entry, trespassing, burglary -- whatever the statute is for the
transgression; he or she is, however, not charged with the cost of the
installation of an alarm system or enhanced locks to insure that no other
person unlawfully enters the house.

When I discussed this point with a New York MIS manager, prone to take a strong
anti-intruder position, he said that an outbreak of new crimes often results in
the use of new technological devices such as the nationwide installation of
metal detectors in airports in the 1970's. While he meant this as a
justification for liability, the analogy seems rather to support the contrary
position. Air line hijackers were prosecuted for all sorts of major crimes;
they were, however, never made to pay for the installation of the metal
detectors or absorb the salary of the additional air marshalls hired to combat
hijacking.

I think the airline analogy also brings out the point that one may both support
justifiable penalties for proven crimes and oppose unreasonable ones -- too
often, when discussing these issues, observers choose one valid position to the
unnecessary exclusion of another valid one. There is nothing contradictory, in
my view, to holding both that credit agencies must be required to provide the
highest possible level of security for data they have collected AND that
persons invading the credit data bases, no matter how secure they are, be held
liable for their intrusions. We are long past accepting the rationale that the
intruders "are showing how insecure these repositories of our information are."
We all know that the lack of security is scandalous; this fact, however, does
not excuse criminal behavior (and it should seem evident that the selling of
electronic burglar tools so that someone may copy and sell credit reports is
not a public service).

The final point that requires serious scrutiny is the use of the indictment as
a tool in the on-going political debate over the FBI Digital Telephony
proposal. Announcing the indictments, Otto G. Obermaier, United States Attorney
for the Southern District of New York, said that this investigation was "the
first investigative use of court-authorized wiretaps to obtain conversations
and data transmissions of computer hackers." He said that this procedure was
essential to the investigation and that "It demonstrates, I think, the federal
government's ability to deal with criminal conduct as it moves into new
technological areas." He added that the interception of data was possible only
because the material was in analog form and added "Most of the new technology
is in digital form and there is a pending statute in Congress which seeks the
support of telecommunications companies to allow the federal government, under
court authorization, to intercept digital transmission. Many of you may have
read the newspaper about the laser transmission which go through fiber optics
as a method of the coming telecommunications method. The federal government
needs the help of Congress and, indeed, the telecommunications companies to
able to intercept digital communications."

The FBI proposal has been strongly attacked by the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU), the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) as an attempt to
institutionalize, for the first time, criminal investigations as a
responsibility of the communications companies; a responsibility that they feel
belongs solely to law-enforcement. Critics further claim that the proposal will
impede the development of technology and cause developers to have to
"dumb-down" their technologies to include the requested interception
facilities. The FBI, on the other hand, maintains that the request is simply an
attempt to maintain its present capabilities in the face of advancing
technology.

Whatever the merits of the FBI position, it seems that the indictments either
would not have been made at this time or, at a minimum, would not have been
done with such fanfare if it were not for the desire to attempt to drum up
support for the pending legislation. The press conference was the biggest thing
of this type since the May 1990 "Operation Sun Devil" press conference in
Phoenix, Arizona and, while that conference, wowed us with charges of "hackers"
endangering lives by disrupting hospital procedures and being engaged in a
nationwide, 13 state conspiracy, this one told us about a bunch of New York
kids supposedly engaged in petty theft, using university computers without
authorization and performing a number of other acts referred to by Obermaier as
"anti-social behavior" -- not quite as heady stuff!

It is not to belittle these charges -- they are quite serious -- to question
the fanfare. The conference was attended by a variety of high level Justice
Department, FBI and Secret Service personnel and veteran New York City crime
reporters tell me that the amount of alleged damages in this case would
normally not call for such a production -- New York Daily News reporter Alex
Michelini publicly told Obermaier "What you've outlined, basically, except for
the sales of credit information, this sounds like a big prank, most of it"
(Obermaier's response -- "Well, I suppose, if you can characterize that as a
prank but it's really a federal crime allowing people without authorization to
rummage through the data of other people to which they do not have access and,
as I point out to you again, the burglar cannot be your safety expert. He may
be inside and laugh at you when you come home and say that your lock is not
particularly good but I think you, if you were affected by that contact, would
be somewhat miffed"). One hopes that it is only the fanfare surrounding the
indictments that is tied in with the FBI initiative and not the indictments
themselves.

As an aside, two law enforcement people that I have spoken to have said that
while the statement that the case is "the first investigative use of
court-authorized wiretaps to obtain conversations and data transmissions of
computer hackers.", while probably true, seems to give the impression that the
case is the first one in which data transmission was intercepted.  According to
these sources, that is far from the case -- there have been many instances of
inception of data and fax information by law enforcement officials in recent
years.

I know each of the accused in varying degrees. The one that I know the best,
Phiber Optik, has participated in panels with myself and law enforcement
officials discussing issues relating to so-called "hacker" crime.  He has also
appeared on various radio and television shows discussing the same issues.
These high profile activities have made him an annoyance to some in law
enforcement. One hopes that this annoyance played no part in the indictment.

I have found Phiber's presence extremely valuable in these discussions both for
the content and for the fact that his very presence attracts an audience that
might never otherwise get to hear the voices of Donald Delaney, Mike Godwin,
Dorothy Denning and others addressing these issues from quite different vantage
points. While he has, in these appearances, said that he has "taken chances to
learn things", he has always denied that he has engaged in vandalous behavior
and criticized those who do. He has also called those who engage in "carding"
and the like as criminals (These statements have been made not only in the
panel discussion but also on the occasions that he has guest lectured to my
class in "Connectivity" at the New School For Social Research in New York City.
In those classes, he has discussed the history of telephone communications in a
way that has held a class of professionals enthralled by over two hours.

While my impressions of Phiber or any of the others are certainly not a
guarantee of innocence on these charges, they should be taken as my personal
statement that we re not dealing with a ring of hardened criminals that one
would fear on a dark knight.

In summary, knee-jerk reactions should be out and thoughtful analysis in!  We
should be insisting on appropriate punishment for lawbreakers -- this means
neither winking at "exploration" nor allowing inordinate punishment. We should
be insisting that companies that have collected data about us properly protect
-- and are liable for penalties when they do not.  We should not be deflected
from this analysis by support or opposition to the FBI proposal before Congress
-- that requires separate analysis and has nothing to do with the guilt or
innocence of these young men or the appropriate punishment should any guilt be
established.

From the Computer Weekly for Thursday July 16 1992, with full permission (so
long as I forward copies of all public responses to the newspaper).  The story
once again raises the issue of the appropriate use of software on systems that
must fail safely.

A couple of background notes:
1   Sizewell B is Britain's first PWR (Pressurised Water Reactor), which is
    currently under construction.  A major argument at the planning inquiry
    in favour of this reactor type was that the design was modern and had a
    proven track record in the US and elsewhere.
2   Nuclear Electric is the rump of the national electricity generating
    company, the rest was split into two companies and floated on the stock
    exchange.  My understanding is that it owns/operates all British civil
    nuclear power stations, of various British designs.

I have joined short paragraphs for readability, and all typos are mine.


    SAFETY OFFICIALS DOUBT SIZEWELL B SOFTWARE

    Tony Collins

        Safety inspectors have questioned the ability of computer protection
    systems to prevent a major accident at the Sizewell B nuclear power
    station.  They want more reliance on older and trusted solid-state
    systems without software as a secondary fallback.

        But Nuclear Electric, Sizewell's operator, is unhappy at the request
    as it would increase costs - which have already risen from 1,700 million
    pounds to 2,000 million [times by 2 for US $]- and could delay Sizewell's
    launch, set for 1994.

        The issue was raised at a recent meeting at the Sizewell site of the
    Advisory Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations.  It was also
    discussed at a British Computer Society safety critical systems task
    force meeting last week.

        It is understood that the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII),
    part of the Government's Health and Safety watchdog, has asked Nuclear
    Electric to widen its dependence on magnetic core technology for
    protection systems.  Magnetic core systems, supplied by GEC, have been
    used for years in UK nuclear power stations and have no programmable
    software.  [Presumably a magnetic core is a device where failure of a
    current through the core causes control mechanisms to revert to a safe
    state.]

        The move by the NII is a partial victory for computer industry
    campaigners, who have long argued that public safety should not be
    entrusted to complex software.  Under Nuclear Electric proposals,
    Sizewell B will be the first nuclear power station in the UK to rely
    heavily on computers in its primary protection system (PPS), which
    detects a major failure, and, in the event of an incident, automatically
    shuts down the power station in a controlled fashion.

        But the BCS and other safety-critical software experts say the PPS
    systems, supplied by US firm Westinghouse, are too complex to test for
    dependability.  The PPS is based on between 300 and 400 Eagle-series
    microprocessors and 100,000 lines of code.

        The NII says it is up to Nuclear Electric to prove that its
    protection and other systems are safe.  Until now inspectors have taken
    a neutral line, saying they are waiting for all the documentation from
    Nuclear Electric before deciding on whether the software is safe.

        However, officials now indicate that they may refuse to give Nuclear
    Electric consent to operate Sizewell B, unless the secondary non-
    computerised systems provide back-up to all aspects of the computerised
    PPS.

        Nuclear Electric admits that the GEC secondary circuits back-up most,
    but not all, the computer protection systems.  A spokesman for the NII
    said it has requested, rather than stipulated, that the secondary systems
    be strengthened.  "We have asked them (Nuclear Electric) to consider
    extending the secondary systems as a prudent measure."

  [I'm not sure about the degree of computer influence here, but I thought it
  would fit with the discussion here about the Vincennes attack on the Iranian
  airliner.  The following item appeared on page 11 (International News) of the
  British national newspaper The Guardian, on Wednesday July 15 1992,
  attributed to Reuters in Canberra.]

QANTAS AIRLINER THREATENED BY US NAVY WARSHIP

A US warship threatened yesterday to shoot down an Australian airliner with
more than 300 passengers over the Pacific.  The pilot of Qantas flight QF12, an
hour out of Los Angeles on its way to Sydney, was jolted by a call from the
warship saying he faced "hostile action" if the aircraft did not leave the
area, a Qantas spokesman said.

The US Navy's Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbour later identified the ship as the
USS Cowpens, the same class of Aegis missile cruiser as the USS Vincennes which
shot down an Iranian civilian airliner in the Gulf in July 1988, killing 290
people.

The Qantas pilot radioed the Federal Aviation Authority in Los Angeles which
put him on a frequency to the warship.  [Why was this necessary?]  The FAA
resolved the crisis by putting the Qantas flight on a path bypassing the
Cowpens which was taking part in a military exercise.

Elly Brekke, a spokeswoman for the FAA in Los Angeles, confirmed that the
airliner, following its predetermined flight path, was told it risked risked
facing hostile action.  Ms Brekke said the Qantas flight was "where it should
have been", and the FAA had not been told that the US Navy was conducting
manoeuvres that would require any restriction of airspace.

The Pacific Fleet spokesman said the Cowpens had inadvertently [!]  used "an
international distress frequency" in trying to contact planes taking part in
the exercise.

"We're looking into how it happened", Commander Jim Kudla said.  He also said
the exercise commander had taken measures to ensure the incident would not
happen again.  [How do you prevent something from recurring if you don't know
how it happened before?]

About $70,000 worth of computers used in the Persian Gulf operations turned up
for sale in Ventura County, CA.  An unidentified computer hobbyist reported
observing `Welcome to Saudi Arabia' on the screen of one computer, along with a
map and locations of unit deployments.  He reported it to the Crime Stoppers
hotline.  Subsequent Army investigators have now led to the conviction of a
serviceman for multiple counts of larceny and wrongful disposition of
government property.  [There was some residual military information in some of
the computers, although no indication was given as to whether any of it was
sensitive.]  [Los Angeles Daily News item, in San Francisco Chronicle, 17 July
1992, p.E6]

The Bush administration has agreed to ease export controls on encryption-based
software somewhat.  In the battle between NSA's desires to be able to intercept
international communications and software vendors' desires to be able to
compete in international markets, this decision transfers control of encryption
software to the Commerce Department (from the State Department).  Evidently,
systems that work with up to 40-digit RSA keys will now be eligible for export,
although one can already buy much better stuff on the streets of in Europe --
for example, Cryptos, which uses both DES and RSA, is available in Moscow!  In
addition, the administration will now meet with industry representatives up to
twice a year.  [Source: Don Clark, San Francisco Chronicle, 18 July 1992, p.B1]

In this morning's Ventura County Star/Free Press newspaper (Sat 92jul17)
appears an article headlined "Woman calls for help, lands in jail." Here
is my own summary of their story (cross-posted to comp.society.privacy):

Oxnard, CA resident Helene Golemon called 911 to report (twice) a loud teenage
street party in the wee hours.  Later, at 6:00am, an officer arrived and
arrested her on a (subsequently learned-to-be) erroneous misdemeanor traffic
warrant.

Golemon expressed outrage at the 911 records check, and that the warrant even
existed at all.  "Those kids were out there drinking and driving drunk.
Nothing happened to them and I got arrested." After booking, including
fingerprints and mug shots, she was detained in a holding cell until her
husband posted $188 bond later that morning.

Assistant police chief William Cady claimed that dispatchers often check
available records, even on a reporting person, to know as much as possible
about the people involved when responding to 911 calls.  "Procedurally, our
people did nothing wrong" he said.

The arrest warrant, dated from an illegal left turn from May, 1988.  Golemon
fought the ticket and lost, then attended state-sponsored driver's education (a
CA alternative to fines available for first-time offenders) in August 1988.
The court has a copy of Golemon's driver education certificate on file, and
Linda Finn, deputy executive officer for Ventura County Superior and Municipal
Courts, couldn't explain why a warrant was later issued in 1989.  Golemon was
never notified of the warrant.

Goleman felt the incident was vindictive, because the dispatcher was annoyed
with her.  "When I tried to explain the continuing problems we're having, she
was very short with me," she said.  Golemon then asked for the dispatchers
name, and the dispatcher in turn demanded Golemon's full name.  After Golemon
complied, the dispatcher only told Golemon her badge number.  The dispatcher
remains unidentified in the news report, and an Oxnard police sergeant who
reviewed the tape said the dispatcher was "absolutely professional."

The privacy and computer risk concerns here seems to me three fold. 

First, the police often act with inappropriate gravity on erroneous, and 
apparently unverifiable, data.  Under what circumstances does a misdemeanor
warrant demand a 6:00am public arrest?  Certainly more time could have been
expended verifying the data, as an at-large illegal left-turner hardly 
threatens public safety.

Second, apparently innocuous -- even beneficial -- contacts with government can
result in record searches for unrelated information.  Not only may this result
in egregious seizures, as in this case, but such an atmosphere can only
stultify public/government relations.  Crime and corruption thrive in such an
environment.

Third, although individuals have the right to know most information the
government retains on them (FOIA), that right becomes meaningless if the
government can, at any time, decided to integrate facts from disjoint data
bases and then act without notice on resulting conclusions.  One cannot submit
an FOI request on the union of multiple far-flung data sets!

 &gt; "Magnetic core systems, supplied by GEC, have been used for years in UK ...

I think rather that "magnetic core systems" probably refers to a early type of
electrical signal amplification device -- the magnetic core amplifier or MCA.
They have been used since at least the 1950s in the highly-critical control
systems of U.S. nuclear submarines, and, I suppose, in nuclear power plants as
well.  They are little-known and somewhat "old-fashioned" devices now, much
like fluidic devices -- remember them?  Much faster, smaller, lighter, more
efficient and less expensive semiconductor devices are widely available these
days that are reliable enough for many critical uses.

An MCA is super-reliable because it is simple: just two coils of wire on an
iron core, like a transformer.  The ancient Romans could have made one.  It has
no moving parts, no connections that open and close sputtering arcs of metal
vapor as do relays, and no semiconductors to fail when their part per billion
impurities finally migrate far enough to cause a short or reduce gain.  As long
as the insulation on its wires holds up, an MCA can't do anything *but* work
correctly.  Don't make smoke come out of it and it'll literally last forever.

Simplified Theory of MCA Operation:

One of the coils in an MCA has many turns, is driven with direct current (DC),
and is the input, or controlling coil.  The other, output coil has relatively
few turns, and is placed in series with an alternating-current (AC) load to be
controlled, such as an AC motor.  With no current through the controlling coil,
a rapidly-varying magnetic field produced by the iron core induces a "bucking"
voltage in the output coil that that opposes any current that tries to flow
through the load, turning it "off."

To turn on the load, put a relatively weak DC current through the controlling
coil.  This drives the magnetization of the iron so far in one direction that
it "saturates" (all magnetic domains are aligned in the same direction and the
iron is fully magnetized).  Although the magnetic field in the iron is still
very strong, it is now constant instead of varying, so it no longer induces any
bucking voltage, and current can flow almost unimpeded through the load,
turning it "on."  The larger number of turns in the input coil allows a small
current through it to overcome any demagnetizing forces produced by the load
current flowing through the output coil.

By combining MCAs with solid-state rectifiers (though not necessarily
semiconductor ones -- the Romans could have made them, too), and by wiring them
in cascade, large amplifications are possible.  MCAs can also exert
proportional control over the power to a load.  Bridge circuits enable
bidirectional control.

Individual MCAs in a control system may be very reliable, but that does not
mean the system will fail safe if one of the MCAs fails.  A classic dilemma
from robotics is, "Should the robot freeze or go limp if something fails?"  If
it freezes while it is reaching inside a car body going by on a conveyor belt,
the car body will collide with the arm.  But if the arm goes limp, it can fall
(or sag down) onto something breakable, or drop something heavy.

Moral: Look at the whole system.  Murphy will.

Here is another story from the AP wires about health service computers and name
collisions.  (There is also an article in this month's Scientific American,
"Achieving Electronic Privacy," by David Chaum, about encryption and smart card
transactions to ensure privacy _and_ verify each side to the transaction.)  I
don't feel qualified to comment, but I'd like to hear other people's thoughts.

      Computer Confuses Babies With Same Name, Denies Benefits to One

PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) - A Pensacola woman says her 5-month-old daughter cannot
get state social service benefits because a computer has her child confused
with a St. Petersburg baby with the same name.	The children, both named
Samantha Marie Morris, were born only eight days apart but are linked by a maze
of computer glitches haunting the Florida Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services.  The Pensacola baby isn't getting food stamps or
Medicaid benefits, her mother, Tina Morris, said Monday.  "If my daughter had
an emergency, got sick or something, some places might take it, but they
wouldn't pay for it," she said.  "I've been real lucky. She hasn't been sick."
	The HRS' balky new $104.2 million computer thinks she is the St.
Petersburg Samantha, eligible for the same benefits and listed with the same
Social Security number, the Pensacola mother said.  HRS District Administrator
Chelly Schembera said she was unfamiliar with the case. She said the computer
problems that have been affecting the agency across the state exceeded normal
start-up glitches for a new system.  
        Ms. Morris said she spent two days at the local HRS office trying to
clear up her daughter's problem without success and that her case worker has
been trying since April.  The computer problems have caused Ms. Morris and
other HRS clients to wait in long lines.  She said she waited 20 minutes
outside under a hot sun to get food stamps last week for the rest of her family
and once in the building was told it would take another hour.
	Schembera said the agency is considering lemonade stands, extra chairs,
awnings, baby changing tables and play rooms to help clients bear the long
waits.
	One man already has capitalized by setting up a snack stand outside an
HRS building in Pensacola, accepting food stamps as payment.  "This guy could
be fairly wealthy by the time the crisis is over," Schembera said.

    County, Ohio, near Akron.]

	The story suggests that there is an especial risk to having 
computers in a very small, Midwestern town.
        According to the story, the Munroe Falls police received a
complaint that a local electronic bulletin board "containing sexually
explicit material might be accessible to children."
        So the police set up a sting operation, using a local 15
year-old boy as their agent.  The story goes on to say:  "After the
youth was able to hook into the bulletin board, police arrested Mark
Lehrer, 22, owner and operator of Akron Anomaly, a 1,000 member bulletin
board."  And the police also seized all of Lehrer's computer--apparently
on the ground that it was "criminal tools."
        [From talking to the reporter and Lehrer's lawyer, I found out 
that Lehrer was indicted today "of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles 
and possession of criminal tools,"  with the criminal tools being the 
computer.]
        It seems that Lehrer's bulletin board included some gif files
containing pictures of James Bond and Captain Kirk and subjects like that,
which could be downloaded by subscribers.  There were also some gif files that
were supposed to be accessible only by adults over the age of 18.  The article
reports, however, that: "when police seized Lehrer's records they found that
even the `clean' files contained images that were not entirely wholesome."
[Lehrer's attorney told me that these were files that had been uploaded to the
bulletin board and had not yet been seen by Lehrer.]
        The article then quotes the Munroe Falls Police Chief as saying
of these "not entirely wholesome files":  "One was Bugs Bunny eating a
carrot, one was Bart Simpson riding a skateboard and one was called (a
slang term for oral sex), and that was in the clean file."  There were
apparently also some pictures of naked women and of "naked women engaging
in sexual acts" that were not in the adult category.
        According to the article, the Police Chief also said that "it's
possible that some of the games and movies are being accessed in
violation of copy right laws."
        And then there is a final direct quote from the Police Chief: "I'm not
saying it's obscene because I'm not getting into that battle, but it's
certainly not appropriate for kids, especially without parental permission."

                   Software nightmare comes alive for airline
     American finds the pieces of new reservation system do not fit together

[Dallas Morning News]
DALLAS -- AMR Corp. for decades sliced up competition with its Sabre computer
system for making airline reservations.  Last week, the parent of American
Airlines, Inc. said it fell on its sword trying to develop a state-of-the-art,
industry-wide system that could also handle car and hotel reservations.

AMR cut off development of its new Confirm reservation system only weeks after
it was supposed to start taking care of transactions for partners Budget
Rent-A-Car, Hilton Hotels Corp. and Marriott Corp.  Suspension of the $125
million, 4-year-old project translated into a $165 million pre-tax charge
against AMR's earnings in the second quarter and fractured the company's
reputation as a pacesetter in travel technology.

"In an area where we arguably are one of the world's leading companies, it's
particularly disappointing to us when we have to recognize a loss of that
magnitude on that kind of activity," said ARM senior vice president and
treasurer Michael J. Durham.  The disappointment comes after a series of
technical and management missteps that surprised not only AMR, but the entire
industry.  As far back as January, the leaders of Confirm discovered that the
labors of more than 200 programmers, systems analysts and engineers had
apparently been for naught.  The main pieces of the massive project --
requiring 47,000 pages to describe -- had been developed separately, by
different methods.  When put together, they did not work with each other.

The system was based on twin IBM mainframes that stored the two main pieces of
the reservation system, according to project leaders.  One IBM 3090 computer
stored customer records, pricing information, and other "decision support"
data.  The other IBM 3090 kept track of available rooms and cars, managing the
actual transaction.  But the two pieces were developed on different operating
systems.  When the developers attempted to plug the parts together, they could
not.  Different "modules" could not pull the information needed from the other
side of the bridge.  Response times were slow on other requests.

Not until April did officials begin to "recognize the magnitude of the
situation" and begin to realize that the problems might not be under control.
Warnings of lengthy delays -- as much as two years -- began to surface.
"Somewhere in there, you've got a management problem," said Donald Tatzin,
director of Arthur D. Little's travel consulting practice.

AMR Information Services fired eight senior project members, including team
leader John Mott, saying it had "determined that information about the true
status of the project appears to have been suppressed by certain management
personnel."  In late June, Budget and Hilton said they were dropping out.

For the record, AMR said it was not giving up hope of salvaging Confirm, 
although a Coopers &amp; Lybrand market study for AMR is believed to cast doubt
on its viability.

The 15 July 1992 Washington Post has an article about one side effect of
Antilock Braking Systems (ABS).

Accident investigators typically estimate how fast the various vehicles
involved in a collision were going by looking at the skid marks left behind.
However, with ABS systems, the skid marks are faint, intermittent, and not as
durable as conventional skidmarks.  (ABS works by releasing the brakes whenever
the tires start skidding.  Therefore, the tires never get a chance to cook a
strip of rubber into the asphalt.)

The skid marks are visible, if you look carefully and get to the
accident site before they've been worn away by rain and other traffic.

Thus, the new technology makes it harder to reconstruct accidents.

The article did, however, quote one investigator as saying (paraphrased
from memory) that he'd rather see faint skid marks for 45 feet than dark
skid marks for 55 feet ending at a wall.

In [the 21 July 1992] Cleveland Plain Dealer, it was reported that a 22-year
old male got arrested for distributing pornography, and possibly for
contributing to the delinquency of a minor.  His "crime" was running a bulletin
board out of his home ... the cops found out that minors were able to get ahold
of pornographic gif files.  The arrestee had apparently set things up so that
"adult" files were supposed to be restricted, but either the files weren't
restricted after all, or someone else had "unrestricted" them.  The paper
reports that this type of arrest is one of the first of its kind in the state.
The cops used a "cooperative" 15 year old -- after the kid accessed the adult
files, the cops grabbed the alleged criminal.

If any Ohio law enforcement types are reading this, I am an Ohio attorney,
and I think this sucks.

This note is a call for argued opinions about the effect of technological
advances on the value of people's expertise and qualifications.  In particular
it would be interesting to hear views about the relative merits of the
following two opposite conjectures:

  A. The introduction of a new technology gives the highest advantage to people
  who are already the most advanced experts, as they are in the best position
  to understand the new developments, and thus will benefit the most from them.
  The advances will in face increase the lead that the best people already had
  over the others.

  B. Introducing a new technology makes it possible for many people to do what
  was previously the exclusive specialty of a few experts.  So it levels off
  the field, putting everyone at the same position.

I can see serious arguments and examples supporting both conjectures.  To keep
this note short, I have selected just two widely different examples, one for
each. Only the second is computer-related. (My personal interest in this
discussion is with respect to advances in software engineering, but the problem
is more general.)

A. In his book ``Tristes Tropiques'', the ethnologist Claude Levi-Strauss
recounts how he visited a South American tribe that didn't know writing. He
introduced it to them; writing was immediately put to good use by the tribe's
chief, who could see how the ability to record and retrieve his decisions would
increase his power.

B. It used to be quite hard to get a taxi in Paris. The situation has
considerably improved thanks to the installation by the biggest taxi company of
a computer-based system. This might at first seem to be an argument for A since
this system has (at least temporarily) given the company a big lead over its
competitors, but here is the other side. In a recent stay in Paris in which I
frequently needed taxis to pick me up, I was able almost every time to obtain
one in about five minutes.  I once complimented a driver on this efficiency. He
responded by heaping tons of abuse on the system. After a period of
astonishment, I understood the reason for his anger. He has been in the
business for twenty years or so, and knows every street and lane in the city;
he also knows the best itineraries, and where he should and should not be at
each time of day and year to get good business (go to the Gare d'Austerlitz at
certain times, to the airports at certain others and so on).  But now the new
system puts every upstart driver, who has just passed his exam and paid for his
license, at the same level as him! You just key in a certain code to indicate
where you are, and get queued for customers' requests in that area. Then when
your turn comes you get the next customer. The computer system apparently also
indicates where the hottest areas are at any time of day. Very little advantage
remains for an experienced professional driver. He was looking with even more
horror to a future (apparently promised) extension of the system, whereby ``the
computer'' would show recommended itineraries!

Please note that the discussion is not about people whose job is simply made
obsolete by the new advances (as craftsmen at the time of the industrial
revolution, or draughtsmen at the time of the introduction of computer-aided
design). Assuming people are experts in a field, and remain in that field, is
new technology a way to increase their lead or should they fear losing their
advantage?

Subject:      Telephone wiretapping [Cross-posted to privacy@cv.vortex.com]

NRC Handelsblad, a Dutch newspaper, of 20 July has two articles concerning
telephone wiretapping.

The first article describes several cases of alleged unauthorized wiretaps
performed by PTT Telecon, the Dutch telephone company.  The PTT is accused of
establishing wiretaps on telephone lines without the required court order, on
request of the police and legal authorities (district attorney).  In one case,
a PTT employee has allegedly passed on information obtained from illegally
bugging a phone line, to a criminal (drug dealer). The employee has been fired.
A PTT spokesperson says that "according to current procedure", the police
cannot request a wiretap directly. The request is to be submitted through the
proper legal channels.  From a technical point of view, the article suggests,
without giving much detail, that it is very easy to establish a wiretap, and
that the only control is through procedures, relying on "highly trusted
personnel".  Further, it is said that the PTT never performs wiretapping
itself, it only establishes the tap to a line going to the police office. It is
not said that the PTT CANNOT do wiretapping, and I would assume that they can,
e.g.  for technical monitoring of line quality.

The other article describes how an on-hook telephone set can be used for
bugging the room in which it is installed. The trick can be performed by
anybody who can gain access, legally or illegally, to any point of the wire
pair connecting the telephone set to the exchange.  A high frequency signal is
injected into the line. This signal bypasses the hook switch of the set
(capacitive coupling, I suppose). The microphone modulates the signal
(technical details not given), and the intruder can demodulate, and listen to
the conversation in the room.  When this trick was published in the press, PTT
says it will shortly be offering a telephone plug with a built-in capacitor to
short the HF signal.  The plug will sell for about Dfl.5 (USD 3). Consumer
organizations urge that the plug should be available free of charge to anybody
asking for it.  It is not said whether the trick will work on all current types
of phones, or only on particular brands.

&gt;The Qantas pilot radioed the Federal Aviation Authority in Los Angeles which
&gt;put him on a frequency to the warship.  [Why was this necessary?]  The FAA
&gt;resolved the crisis by putting the Qantas flight on a path bypassing the
&gt;Cowpens which was taking part in a military exercise.

It was probably necessary to use such a roundabout means of communication
because the airliner had no idea what frequencies the ship was using, and
likely *couldn't* respond on many of them if it wanted to!

&gt;Elly Brekke, a spokeswoman for the FAA in Los Angeles, confirmed that the
&gt;airliner, following its predetermined flight path, was told it risked risked
&gt;facing hostile action.  Ms Brekke said the Qantas flight was "where it should
&gt;have been", and the FAA had not been told that the US Navy was conducting
&gt;manoeuvres that would require any restriction of airspace.

Somebody goofed. My guess is the military *should* have warned the ATC center!

&gt;The Pacific Fleet spokesman said the Cowpens had inadvertently [!]  used "an
&gt;international distress frequency" in trying to contact planes taking part in
&gt;the exercise.

The inadvertently part is all too simple. And it has bearing on my comment
above about why the airliner may not have been able to directly contact the
ship.

All those nice agreements about which frequencies are used for what have
a *large* loophole. All governments are allowed to ignore the international
frequency allocations when it comes to *military* use. 

Most military gear can tune all sort of civilian (and other) frequencies.  And
for peacetime operations, they do have the civilian frequncies set up. Somebody
may have done something as simple as punch the wrong "general frequency"
button!

There are two risks here. First, from the pictures that I've seen of military
radio gear, the "user interface" is lacking in a few areas.  Mainly in that the
user has no idea that some of the "channels" are not strictly military.

The second risk is the usual one of what happens when folks that are allowed to
"ignore the standards" get to share the operating environment with folks that
*do* have to follow them...

	I suspect that, given the context in which they were mentioned, that
Bill is correct.  However, what I first think of when the phrase "magnetic core
systems" comes up in discussions of reactor safety is something rather
different.  It is the practice in many PWR reactors to have the cadmium control
rods, which must be withdrawn partly from the reactor core for substantial
fission to take place, lifted vertically up and out of the core by
electromagnets, which are themselves powered by the output of the generators
driven by the reactor.  If there is a sudden drop in reactor output for some
reason, the magnets cut out, and the rods drop back into the core.  Gravitic
passive safety! However, this does not help at all in cases where the reactor
is running out of control but still producing steam and power, nor will it do
any good if something has happened to prevent the reinsertion of the damper
rods themselves...

Our local (Tulsa, OK) television news reported today about how a telco problem
proved fatal.  A retired Doctor [Homer Hardy] tried to call 911 when his wife
[Phyllis Joan Love Hardy, 67] started having a heart attack.  His 7-8 attempts
always resulted in a busy signal.  He finally dialed 0 for the operator, but
when the ambulance arrived, his wife was already dead.  It seems the telco was
overloaded with over 320,000 calls in one hour by persons trying to buy tickets
to a concert by country musician, Garth Brooks.

One of the persons in the story commented, "I guess Garth Brooks tickets are
more important than 911 service."

Art Corcoran, University of Tulsa, corcoran@tusun2.mcs.utulsa.edu

  [Also noted by Phil Karn &lt;karn@thumper.bellcore.com&gt;.  An AP story noted
  that the number of calls exceeded the previous record for Tulsa BY A FACTOR
  OF TWO.  Promoters sold out 23,000 tickets within three hours in Tulsa and
  Oklahoma City to two Brooks' concerts.  Now they will have to do
  Garthroscopic surgery on the phone system.  PGN]

Mel Beckman reports that "CA resident Helene Golemon called 911 to report
(twice) a loud teenage street party in the wee hours."  The risk being
identified is the police looking up the resident's criminal record.  How about
the much more serious risk of tying up 911 with a non-life threatening call?

Would it be safe to assume that the 15-year-old had his parents' permission to
participate in the sting and access the adult files?  His parents might have
known that he could encounter adult pictures during the sting.  If so, then
perhaps their permission means that no crime actually occurred during the
sting, and the case could be thrown out.

Here is an excerpt from a SnailMail letter from Henry G. Baker:

  I have recently been trying with only moderate success to correct my credit
file at the Equifax credit reporting organization based in Atlanta.  As you may
have seen on the news, they have settled with a number of states' attorneys
general over their sloppy data.
  After getting a copy of my report, and noticing a large number of entries
that looked suspiciously as if they belonged to someone else, and seeing one of
my previous addresses as ``25 Roycroft Dr.'' (I never lived on that street, nor
do I even know where it is), I asked Equifax to remove the entry.  The first
letter to Equifax didn't work, but a combination of a second letter from me and
one from my lawyer finally produced a correction to my file: I am now listed as
having previously lived on ``25 Cancel Dr.''!!
  By the way, Equifax also listed my marital status as ``single'', even though
it (correctly) listed my wife's name in the ``spouse'' section, along with her
(correct!) social security number.
  I think that I have now been sensitized to the problem of unfettered national
databases, and words like ``radicalized'' and ``click'' come to mind.  (Am I
dating myself?)
                           [I hope you are not dating yourself, 
                           especially as you are married.  PGN]

There has been much discussion recently on RISKS about the FBI's demands to be
allowed to tap phones, etc. and about the restrictions, proposed and
implemented, on the export from the USA of cryptological apparatus, whether
hardware or software.

If one wants - as a bank might - to encipher all of a large volume of
transmissions then this is certainly an important issue; the security and
'exportability' of systems like DES and RSA would clearly be mission-critical
in these circumstances.

However, the justification for these restrictive measures is said to be to
facilitate policing. It is said, for example that phone-taps are vital to the
'war on [untaxed] drugs', and encryption restrictions to the fight against
terrorism.

Any competent criminal or terrorist obliged to use his own telephone would
naturally expect it to be tapped, whatever Constitutional 'rights' he might
believe himself to have, and act accordingly; if he were obliged to send a
co-conspirator a note about their conspiracies then they would doubtless
arrange beforehand a secure cipher system.

The Foreign Office one-time pad system is said never to have been broken, and
those who know far more about cryptology than I do seem to think that it never
will be. It is easy to generate its key, and relatively easy to use it for
short messages. A simple modification of the system does not rely on the
physical transfer of key, eliminating the possibility of detection in transit.

The FBI therefore seem to have little chance of catching anyone competent,
since they will probably not intercept meaningful conversations between serious
crooks, and will be unable to break FO one-time pad cipher should the villains
choose to use it.

All they will do is hasten the natural selection of criminals and terrorists
until only those who are really professional (and therefore dangerous) will
still be in business, filling the prisons meanwhile with small fry and amateurs
who have, perhaps, been foolish enough to trust their telephones and their
expensive, but crippled, commercial cipher systems.

What, then, is the true purpose of demanding new phone-taps and restrictions on
encryption technology?

This for me is merely a matter of curiousity, since I am British, and therefore
prohibited by the criminal law from attempting to transmit any form of code or
secret writing (our spooks got this sorted out in the time of the *first* Queen
Elizabeth).

This is in partial response to a posting by Mr David Cohen (bx953@cleveland.
freenet.edu) concerning the recent Akron-area BBS bust.

Put your money where your mouth is.  Not just Mr. Cohen, but anyone who thinks
that arrests of this sort are anything less than savory.  If you are an
attorney, donate some time to write an Amicus brief for the court, if such
things are allowed for criminal prosecutions.  Even better, if the miscarriage
of justice is so great that it makes you want to scream, donate some time to
help defend the case.  If you have some knowledge, share it with elected
officials who are making the laws without the benefit of technical expertise.

Remember that the government never willingly grants a right, or even a
privilege, to its citizens.  And in these days of the "War on Crime", we must
protect what rights we have.

We have had at least two cases of BBS Porn here in Tulsa.  The local news even
had a three part "expose" on the subject last summer.  I attended a sysop
meeting at the time.  "People in the know" said (i.e., rumored) that the
sysop's computer equipment is impounded for over six months and that it is
often "dropped" or otherwise damaged by the authorities.

Computers cannot sue for "Police brutality".

In one of the cases, a woman was reading a message and called police when "foul
language was uncontrollably displayed on her screen".  (That is, she was
offended by the contents of the message.)

As someone who has also been involved in of 2600's dubious reprints, I feel
reasonably qualified to respond. In the September 1987 issue, 2600 printed a
facsimile of an internal technical document I wrote while employed as an IBM
systems developer. The document explained how to decrypt password security on
the IBM S/36 (the encryption is trivial although not obvious). The document was
intended as a "worksheet" for accessing systems where the original "security
officer" (superuser) password has been lost or forgotten. With this article,
anybody could gain superuser access to a S/36. I still don't know how 2600 got
the thing, but my copyright (the series of technical notes is personally
copyrighted by me; not a work-for-hire) was stripped off (according to 2600,
before they received the document), although my name was still on the thing.

At the time of reprinting, I had left the original job and was working at
another company (NEWS 34-38 magazine, a technical journal covering the IBM
S/34/36/38 systems). I found out about the problem when a lawyer from IBM's
Rochester, MN development lab called me, quite irate, wanting to know why I had
publicized this document. The way 2600 presented my document -- with no
explanation how it was received -- it looked like I had submitted the thing for
publication!

The noise being made by IBM was causing all kinds of problems for me. My
current employer was concerned about possible adverse publicity accruing to one
of its regular authors and editors; the original firm doing IBM systems
programming was none too happy and let it be known that the problem was all
mine; my already tentative relationship with IBM's Rochester lab certainly
didn't improve (some relationships were definitely cut off by this incident)
and I had to spend a huge amount of time talking with everybody, including the
lawyers, trying to convince them I hadn't instigating the incident.

2600 was, in my opinion, irresponsible in printing something with a persons
name on it, without making any attempt to contact me (I'm in many online
directories, including nic &amp; Compuserve). If they couldn't contact the author,
the ethical thing to do is not publish. 2600 apparently couldn't resists such a
"juicy" tidbit though, whatever the cost to somebody else.  As this was a
titled document -- and obviously part of a series -- 2600 reasonably could
deduce that somebody owned the thing and that permission should be obtained. At
that time, presumption of copyright wasn't a legal doctrine (although now,
thankfully, it is), however, 2600 should know that lack of a copyright notice
doesn't mean that the notice wasn't illegally removed. Their claim to be able
to publish the contents as a news item anyway is academic, as they published a
photographic facimile of my work.

I also thought 2600 should have withheld the document on the simple grounds
that public disclosure would put a good deal of small business systems at
exposure to attack. We all know that 2600 revels in making public information
that can compromise security, to the great embarassment of system manufacturers
(hopefully coercing mfrs into improving their products).  Somewhere, though, in
a democratic society, there is a line that separates mature activism from
juvenile vandalism. 2600 crossed that line in my situation.

I had little legal recourse against 2600, and the editor (at that time, Eric
Corley), insisted in phone discussions that I was greatly exaggerating my
problems. He never apologized, although I did get from him a promise to not
further publish anything with my name without permission.

I think there is a place for publications such as 2600 (I regularly pick up a
copy at Reiters Technical Books in Washington, DC), but 2600 goes over the line
periodically, as they did in my case and possibly in the Bellcore case at hand
(I haven't seen '91 winter issue). Since Emmanuel asked for comments on his
Bellcore lawyer letter, I figured some history from "one of us" could help
provide perspective. I consider myself a open-minded member of the Internet
community, on the CPSR/EFF side of privacy and information freedom issues, but
I nevertheless take exception to some of 2600's practices.

2600 MAGAZINE
Middle Island, NY

Dear Sirs:

I have been asked to contact you on behalf of Mel Beckman and his employer,
NEWS 34-38 magazine. It is my understanding that your publication, 2600
Magazine, for the month of September 1987, included the publication of
confidential memorandum written by Mr. Beckman while he was an employee of
another company. The name of the article was "Decrypting Password Security."

We do not know how the memorandum came into your possession, but its
unauthorized use may do serious damage to Mr. Beckman's reputation and to that
of his current employer. No determination has yet been made as to what steps
may be taken to protect the interests of Mr. Beckman and NEWS 34-38.  In the
meantime, demand is hereby made that you desist from any further unauthorized
use of any articles or documents produced by Mr. Beckman.

Please confirm in writing that you will comply with this demand.

Very truly yours,

  [attorney's signature]

May 31, 1988

Dear [attorney's name]

These are the facts as I know them regarding the acquisition by 2600 Magazine
of the article entitled "Decrypting Password Security" written by Mel Beckman.

In August of 1987 we received a copy of the article on a single sheet of paper.
There was no indication of a copyright or clues to the article being a
"confidential memorandum". No company name was evident and there was no
publication from which to ask permission for reprinting. The only
identification mark on the entire page was the name "Mel Beckman" which was
unknown to us.

Our magazine is in the habit of printing interesting and humorous pages from
telephone books, non-copyrighted manuals, and books that we happen to be
reviewing. We do not print personal memos or anything else that would invade
the privacy of any one person. Given the facts as they were presented to us at
the time we believe no wrongful action was taken on our part. I might also
point out that had we indeed managed to track down the author and been refused
permission to reprint the article, we would still be able to reveal the
contents as a news item, since the article had been leaked to us. But let us
not delude ourselves--the article was not all that earth-shattering.

We strongly doubt any harm will come to Mr. Beckman's reputation as a result of
this incident. Obviously some other person is responsible for sending the
article to us. Mr. Beckman cannot and should not be held accountable for
another person's actions.

You can rest assured that any future articles we may receive with Mr. Beckman's
name on them will not be reprinted in our magazine.

Sincerely,

Eric Corley, Editor, 2600 Magazine

Dear Mr. Suchyta:

We are sorry that the information published in the Winter 1991-92 issue of 2600
disturbs you. Since you do not specify which article you take exception to, we
must assume that you're referring to our revelation of built-in privacy holes
in the telephone infrastructure which appeared on Page 42. In that piece, we
quoted from an internal Bellcore memo as well as Bell Operating Company
documents. This is not the first time we have done this. It will not be the
last.

We recognize that it must be troubling to you when a journal like ours
publishes potentially embarrassing information of the sort described above. But
as journalists, we have a certain obligation that cannot be cast aside every
time a large and powerful entity gets annoyed. That obligation compels us to
report the facts as we know them to our readers, who have a keen interest in
this subject matter. If, as is often the case, documents, memoranda, and/or
bits of information in other forms are leaked to us, we have every right to
report on the contents therein. If you find fault with this logic, your
argument lies not with us, but with the general concept of a free press.

And, as a lawyer specializing in intellectual property law, you know that you
cannot in good faith claim that merely stamping "proprietary" or "secret" on a
document establishes that document as a trade secret or as proprietary
information. In the absence of a specific explanation to the contrary, we must
assume that information about the publicly supported telephone system and
infrastructure is of public importance, and that Bellcore will have difficulty
establishing in court that any information in our magazine can benefit
Bellcore's competitors, if indeed Bellcore has any competitors.

If in fact you choose to challenge our First Amendment rights to disseminate
important information about the telephone infrastructure, we will be compelled
to respond by seeking all legal remedies against you, which may include
sanctions provided for in Federal and state statutes and rules of civil
procedure. We will also be compelled to publicize your use of lawsuits and the
threat of legal action to harass and intimidate.

Sincerely, Emmanuel Goldstein

My particular reply is to the statement:

&gt; However, this does not help at all in cases where the reactor
&gt; is running out of control but still producing steam and power, nor will it do
&gt; any good if something has happened to prevent the reinsertion of the damper
&gt; rods themselves...

While I am not even close to an expert in the nuclear power industry, I did
work for a firm that made security systems for nuclear power plants  and had an
opportunity to learn something about the operations of the industry. 

Based on my acquired knowledge, the reason why operators and computer systems
monitor the reaction is to prevent a run-away reaction such as cited above. The
computer systems are sophisticated enough to be able to SCRAM (or drop the
control rods for those that don't know what SCRAMing is) the reactor when the
reaction goes out of control. The human monitors also have this control in case
the computer fails.

BTW, for you trivia buffs, SCRAM stands for Secondary Control Rod Axe Man. In
the days before all of the sophisticated control, a person would have to
physically cut the control rod cable with an axe when a reaction went run-away.

Excerpts from an article in the August 2, 1992 Boston _Globe_:

	"Judges Not Quick to Punch; Computer KO's Griffin"

  BADALONA, Spain -- Science lied yesterday.

  Five judges watching American light flyweight Eric Griffin fight Spaniard
Rafael Lozano ... said the gold medal favorite had advanced as expected into
the quarterfinals.  Three said he did it by a wide margin. ...
  A computer said differently.
  The computer lied.
  What the computer insisted ... was that Eric Griffin was a 6-5 loser.  And
for the moment at least, that decision will stand, regardless of the opinion of
the five men who actually watched the fight.  ...
  Actually, after a review of the scorecards, it seemed more like some kind of
computer glitch, but the result was the same.  Elimination of a fighter.
Destruction of a dream.  Sorry about that.  ...
  Under the scoring system, at least two judges must hit a button that
registers a scoring point within a second after the first judge does.  If the
do not, the point is not awarded by the main frame computer, even though each
point will be recorded individually.
  The individual judges scored the match 10-9, 26-17, 18-9, 19-10, and 8-5.

The article said the system was installed after a Korean fighter won a victory
at the 1988 olympics even though general opinion was that he lost the fight.
[Later stories indicate the appeal failed.  PGN]

[AP excerpts by Joe, from an article by W. Dale Nelson, 30 Jul 1992]

Changes in wiretapping laws proposed by the FBI need further work, said Rep.
Edward J. Markey, D-Mass, Chairman of the House subcommittee on
telecommunications and finance.  (In May, the FBI called for legislative
changes to enable it to tap into new technologies such as cellular and ISDN.)
Markey said a report by GAO "shows that more work needs to be done before the
FBI's proposals can be seriously considered by the Congress.  ...  Before we
impose wholesale changes on the communications industry, we must understand the
details of what the FBI needs for each technology, and how those needs can be
met with minimal costs to consumers and minimal threat to the telephone
network."

The GAO said it could not answer questions about the impact of the FBI
proposals on costs, benefits and alternatives until the FBI had more clearly
defined its specific needs. It also said the least intrusive alternatives could
not be determined until the telecommunications industry had received and
analyzed information on the FBI's needs.  It said the correct solutions "will
vary with the technology" but its analysis of the technological alternatives
had been classified by the FBI and could not be disclosed.

The budget submitted to Congress by the FBI in February included $26.6 million
to update eavesdropping techniques.

I heard on Radio 4 today that the UK government is considering farming out the
Inland Revenue's computer operations to a private company.  Currently the IR
spend 250M pounds per year on computing and hold some 40M files.  5 possible
contractors are being approached, including IBM, DEC and ICL.

A union representative gave a long list of reasons why this was a bad idea,
starting with confidentiality.  He claimed that the IR has a good reputation on
this, and worried that a commercial company might not be as honest.  The
government either was not represented or did not comment.

&gt;From "World Press Review" quoting "China Daily", Beijing [!]:

The government of Singapore has announced a plan to link all households 
through grids of fiber-optic cables that will allow high-speed exchanges of 
text, sound, video and other media.  The project called the National 
Information Infrastructure (NI), will also include a wireless communications 
network to give mobile-computer users access to information services.  The 
NII is part of Singapore's drive to become a world leader in information and 
communications technology, which officials see as the backbone of 
21st-century economies.  Towards this end, all citizens 18 and older have 
been issued identity cards that allow government ministries and other bodies 
to cross-index information about them.

To bank to make deposits and withdrawal for lunch money.  Chat with neighbour
while Sweet Old Thing (i.e., my age) dithers with machine.  Murmur from SOT:
"Oh, dear.  I have to make a deposit."  Neighbour points out "deposit" key.
More chat with neighbour.  Murmur from SOT: "Does the stripe go up?"  Neighbour
points out picture of card (showing orientation) above slot.  More chat with
neighbour.  Murmur from SOT: "It's still not going it."  (ATM has by this time,
shut down.)

(Still need to deposit and withdraw.  Look at lineup for tellers.  Recall last
time I used "manual" cashier: no lineup at cashier, five people in line for
ATM.  Thought I was really smart until realized that all five people at ATM
have completed transactions before I got my money.  Decide to eat at "golden
arches".)

Go to Skytrain station.  Couple (of SOTs) at next ticket machine looking very
worried.  Take bill from wallet.  Accidentally tear bill.  Replace bill in
wallet, take other.  Complete transaction with ticket machine.  Couple at
next machine: "How do you work this?"  Point out large legend at top.  A:
look at map, check how many zones to cross; B: push button for number of
zones (machine displays price); C: put money in (pictures of acceptable coins
over coin slot, acceptable bills over bill slot); D: take ticket.  Point
out large A by map, B by buttons, etc.  Couple goes back to worrying in
front of next ticket machine.

Recall study on data base interface.  Experimental systems: two commercial
systems, three diverse experimental interfaces, one super-deluxe-easy-to-
use-never-meant-to-be-implemented-because-*too*-easy-and-takes-too-much-

Results show no benefit from any system.  Further (frantic) investigation
reveals subjects, normal data base users, cannot consistently make query in own
native language.

&gt; The HRS' balky new $104.2 million computer thinks she is the St.Petersburg

It looks to me like there is another risk here. HRS paid $104.2 million dollars
for that system! There is simply no excuse for spending this much money on such
a system. This is the risk of letting government agencies buy computer
systems... not only do they not work.... they also cost too much!

In <A HREF="/Risks/13.68.html">RISKS-13.68</A>, &lt;SATRE@cisco.nosc.mil&gt; implies that the "risk of tying up 911
with a non-life threatening call" is much more serious than the jailing of a
woman who called 911 to complain about a loud street party.  Alas, in many big
cities, if you want a police officer to appear at the scene, you MUST dial 911.
Let's take New York City as an example --

Here's what happens if I call 911 about an incident: the 911 operator types in
the address where I am reporting an emergency, then types in my description of
the problem.  The report is then sent onward ( as a computer message) to the
dispatcher for the police precinct in question.  The report appears on the
dispatcher's screen, who finds an available police car and reads the report
over the radio to the police officers who will handle the "job".

If any person in this chain of events screws up -- if the police officer never
shows up, if the dispatcher never calls a police car, etc., the responsible
party can usually be determined by following the computer audit trail.  The
computer system also tracks the status of the report and I've often heard
dispatchers radioing police officers asking them about the status of "jobs"
that were resolved hours ago but were not cleared in the computer.  When there
are too many reports that have not had officers sent to them, the dispatcher
announces an "alert" in the precinct and the officers race to finish up their
current "jobs" and get to the new ones.

The result is that there is a fair amount of machinery keeping track of a call
to the police.  But if I call my local precinct directly with a non-life
threatening situation, a bedraggled desk officer will answer the phone, take my
complaint, and then, if he or she feels like it, call 911 in order to get a car
dispatched.  If the desk officer doesn't feel like sending a car right away,
they might type the complaint into the dispatch system as a "past complaint"
job, and someone MAY get around to acting upon it much later that evening.
Worst of all, the desk officer has the option of simply ignoring my complaint,
and there is no mechanism (apart from me calling back again when I see no one
has acted upon my call) to detect that he has done so.  I've found that if I
want the police to respond to nuisances like car alarms or street disputes, I
have to call 911.

The computer-human interface that is at the core of so many emergency dispatch
systems has other quirks, too.  In New York City, one sad side-effect of the
"alert" mechanism described above is that the dispatcher will start assigning
multiple jobs to the same patrol car in order to convince the computer that the
precinct is no longer in "alert" status.  Never mind that officers in the same
car cannot be in two places at once, or that they might be diverted before they
can handle the second "job" -- it keeps the computer happy.

RGB Technology/703-556-0667 &lt;SATRE@cisco.nosc.mil&gt; (...) asks about the "much
more serious risk of tying up 911 with a non-life threatening call."  This
points out another risk: that of using systems in ways not originally intended.
9-1-1 service was originally for emergencies only (or so I believe).  But it
turns out that the *only* way to have a police car dispatched in Pittsburgh is
to call 911.  Calling the neighborhood police station (5 blocks away!) doesn't
work---they direct you to call 911.  I suppose there's also a risk here that a
distributed system (local police stations) has been replaced by one with a
single point of failure.  I also wonder whether if I called the local station
about an imminent threat whether they'd respond, or just say "call 911."

CPSR Recommends NREN Privacy Principles (24 Jul 1992)

   WASHINGTON, DC -- Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), a
national public interest organization, has recommended privacy guidelines for
the nation's computer network.  At a hearing this week before the National
Commission on Library and Information Science, CPSR recommended a privacy
policy for the National Research and Education Network or "NREN."  Marc
Rotenberg, Washington Director of CPSR, said "We hope this proposal will get
the ball rolling.  The failure to develop a good policy for the computer
network could be very costly in the long term."
  
   The National Commission is currently reviewing comments for a report to the
Office of Science and Technology Policy on the future of the NREN.  Mr.
Rotenberg said there are several reasons that the Commission should address the
privacy issue.  "First, the move toward commercialization of the network is
certain to exacerbate privacy concerns.  Second, current law does not do a very
good job of protecting computer messages.  Third, technology won't solve all
the problems."
  
   The CPSR principles are (1) protect confidentiality, (2) identify privacy
implications in new services, (3) limit collection of personal data, (4)
restrict transfer of personal information,(5) do not charge for routine privacy
protection, (6) incorporate technical safeguards, (7) develop appropriate
security policies, and (8) create an enforcement mechanism.

   Professor David Flaherty, an expert in telecommunications privacy law, said
"The CPSR principles fit squarely in the middle of similar efforts in other
countries to promote network services.  This looks like a good approach."

   Evan Hendricks, the chair of the United States Privacy Council and editor of
Privacy Times, said that the United States is "behind the curve" on privacy and
needs to catch up with other countries who are already developing privacy
guidelines.  "The Europeans are racing forward, and we've been left with dust
on our face."

   The CPSR privacy guidelines are similar to a set of principles developed
almost 20 years ago called The Code of Fair Information practices.  The Code
was developed by a government task force that included policy makers, privacy
experts, and computer scientists.  The Code later became the basis of the
United States Privacy Act.

   Dr. Ronni Rosenberg, who has studied the role of computer scientists in
public policy, said that "Computer professionals have an important role to play
in privacy policy. The CPSR privacy guidelines are another example of how
scientists can contribute to public policy."

   CPSR is a membership organization of 2500 professionals in the technology
field. For more information about the Privacy Policies and how to join CPSR,
contact CPSR, P.O. Box 717, Palo Alto CA 94302.  415/322-3778 (tel) and

        Glitches stalling updated airport radar
            Bugs mar new air control system
              Toronto Star, 3 August 1992 
                 By Bruce Campion-Smith

   An $810 million program to install updated radar systems at Canada's major
airports has been stalled by a series of stubborn software bugs.  The
sophisticated system has crashed in tests and in actual use, freezing radar
screens, displaying false information and even showing jets flying backwards,
sources say.  In at least one case, air traffic controllers in Montreal were
left without radar for 15 minutes when the system suffered a "catastrophic
failure," according to federal documents.
   Controllers restricted flights and later that March night resorted to the
old radar system, according to a memo obtained by The Star under the Access to
Information Act.  At no time were passengers at risk, says a letter
accompanying the memo.
   "It's incredible.  It's a multi-million-dollar operation.  We're up to
version four and it's still not operational," said Paul Gauthier.  Gauthier is
vice-president, technical, with the Canadian Air Traffic Control Association,
the union representing the country's controllers.  "Government seems to be able
to get themselves in the situation where they are paying through the nose and
not getting the goods," he said.
   The system has been in use at Calgary International Airport since June 6 and
so far the system is working well, said Roger Westmore, Transport Canada's
project manager.  "There is a back-up, but we think it's unlikely it would be
required," Westmore said.
   That back-up is provided by controllers in Edmonton, and a switchover in the
event of a major failure of the system would take five to 10 minutes, Gauthier
said.  "I couldn't believe it, but that's what they are doing," he said.  "It's
not certified or commissioned, but they are running live tests with live
people."  The massive program is known as the radar modernization project
(RAMP) and is touted as one answer to easing congestion -- and reducing delays
-- in the skies above congested airports, like Person International.
   The new radar replaces vacuum-tube technology with a better picture of
what's happening in the skies.  That would allow them to space aircraft closer
together and, in the end, get more flights in and out of busy Pearson.
   Transport Canada officials say they are close to clearing "the last hurdle"
and are optimistic that the system will be up and running at Pearson early next
year -- 2 1/2 years after originally expected.  The system should be fully
operational across Canada within the next six months, Westmore said.  But
controllers and airline representatives are less hopeful.  "That's the story
we've been getting for the last three years.  It's always just around the
corner," said John Redmond, president of the controllers' association.
   "It's crashed in Montreal.  It's crashed in Moncton.  It's crashed in
Toronto," Redmond said.  "The problem is primarily with the software not being
able to handle the amount of data that runs through the system, and it keeps
crashing," Redmond said.
   Controllers who have experienced an unnerving system crash say they never
know how long they'll be without radar when it happens.  That's why the new
system is losing the trust of the very people who will have to use it, Gauthier
said.
   The system screw-ups in testing include:
 -- Switching the data tags between two aircraft when the planes are close
together on the radar screen.  The tags are vital, identifying the green blips
on the screens.
 -- Backing up targets on the screen, in essence showing jets flying backwards.
   Developing a software package that would work in Toronto Centre -- the
busiest airspace in Canada -- has remained the big hurdle, sources say.  One
stumbling block has been the system's inability to handle heavy traffic.  Just
when designers think they have one glitch cured, another pops up, sources say.
The curious problems struck as recently as last month, when the latest package
of software was tested in Moncton and failed, they say.
   Westmore denies the system failed and instead says it needed "additional
improvements."  With a project of this magnitude, it's normal to expect some
problems, he said.  The contract for the system was awarded to Raytheon Canada
Ltd. in 1985.

Beware of high pressure without passive safety devices!  The following account
of a near accident at a research university is constructed from conversations
with a friend of mine who will remain nameless, as will his university.

Researchers were attempting to measure directly the permeability for melt
transport through a matrix of partially molten rocks. This required the use
of a digitally controlled high-pressure pump (a 25,000 psi Single-Cylinder
Positive Displacement Pump manufactured by Ruska Instruments of Houston, TX.)

The pump was controlled by a ZEOS 386 clone via a serial line. On the day in
question, the computer froze while the pump was compressing the system at full
speed. Before dying, it sent enough garbage across the serial line to confuse
the pump's keyboard, so that researchers lost all software control of the pump,
which merrily continued to compress past the software pressure limit which had
been set (corresponding to the maximum pressure for the tranducers in the
system, 2000 psi). It got to 4000 psi, the threshold for permanent damage to
the transducers, before they managed to switch the power to the pump's motor
off. This is particularly scary because the pump will go to 25,000 psi, but the
plumbing was rated only for 20,000 psi so it would probably have been an
explosive failure.

They had had problems with the clone in the past; most of which were believed
related to the Extended Memory Manager.

It should be noted that the following safety precautions would eliminate this
type of danger: use of _hardware_ travel limit switch as well as software
pressure limit. Also, any system with pressure-sensitive parts should always
have at least one safety head equipped with a suitable rupture disk.

Some years ago, a cellist acquaintance landed a job on the opposite coast.
Like all serious cellists, she bought a second ticket for her valuable
instrument rather than subject it to the vagaries of airline baggage handling.

As it happened, someone near the destination later offered her the use of
another fine cello so that she wouldn't have to bring her own.  Stuck with an
extra ticket, she successfully advertised it for sale.  The only catch was that
the purchaser had to identify himself as Mr. C. (for Cabin) Baggage when he
boarded the flight.

It seems that the ticket-reservation system doesn't have a provision for
tickets issued to non-persons.  A blank field is an error, and there is no
override.  I've heard of some pretty creative names invented by cellists to
identify their instruments on flights.

            [She could buy a ticket for the 'cello case in the name 
            of Justin Case -- just in case she needed the extra seat.  
            Further confusions arise ticketing a baseball pitcher named Viola

I know that caller ID has generated a number of discussions about privacy and
risks to individuals.  I'd like to pass on a personal experience I had with a
related technology, call return.

I was using my modem and computer to telecommute on Sunday afternoon.  Shortly
after hanging up, my phone rang.  The caller asked with whom she was speaking.
I responded by asking who she was trying to reach.  It turned out that she had
just been the victim of a harassing phone call.  Southwestern Bell has a phone
feature (call return) that allows a person to press a star-sequence (i.e., *1)
to call back the last caller.  According to the phone salesman who
(aggressively) marketted it to me when I had my phone connected three months
ago, it uses the same logic as caller ID.  (He mentioned that Southwest Bell
would offer caller ID in the fall.)  He promoted call return as a "great way to
deal with obscene or harassing callers."  My experience Sunday afternoon points
out a serious risk associated with such technology.  Clearly, the system has a
bug.  That bug lead someone to believe that I was harassing them.  Depending on
what was said, the system identified me as a misdemeanant or a felon.

On Monday, I called Southwestern Bell and explained my concern.  While the
person I spoke with understood my concern, he did not help.  He repeated the
standard disclaimer about "no phone system is perfect, the phone company can
not guarantee accuracy, blah, blah, CYA, CSWBA..."  I did manage to get from
him some further information: First, this was hardly the first time this
happened.  He mentioned that incidents like mine occur frequently.  Second, the
phone company's policy requires that, before turning a case over to the police,
someone must repeatedly call and harass someone.  One instance does not
suffice.

I then called the P.U.C.  I spoke with a woman there who, when she realized I
was calling to voice concerns about caller ID and call return, adopted a very
tired tone of voice.  She gave me a docket number and said that I should send
in my comments to the P.U.C.  I asked about groups who may have joined fight
against such technology.  She said that SWB had just submitted the caller ID
request, but she expected that a number of people would get involved in the
ensuing discussion.  She did not sound pleased at the prospect.
                                                                    Rex

General Telephone is just now offering the "Personal Secretary" voice message
service to the public here.  In recent newspaper ads GTE touts that the service
takes messages, reminds you of important dates, has a wake up service, and can
be programmed up to a year in advance.  Sounds like I can throw away my answer-
ing machine, my date book, my alarm clock and my computer, all for the low
price of $5.95 a month with the first 30 days free!

Customers, however, are not made aware of some of the risks involved.  A friend
was recently made a victim of the service WITHOUT subscribing.

She noticed her home phone (which she always used to receive client calls) was
not ringing and no messages were being left on her answering machine.  Several
times when she tried to dial out a strange tone came over the receiver.  This
went on for several days until her business associate complained of the same
problems.

After discussing this with GTE my friend discovered that a church-friend that
works for GTE signed up SEVERAL people without their knowledge.  (She thought
it was a "nice" thing to do.)

My friends problems with the "Personal Secretary" were caused by the way the
system is set up.  First, it answers on the first ring, therefore it wouldn't
activate the answering machine or allow a person to answer.  Second, without
the proper code number you cannot retrieve your messages (the tone she heard
was alerting her to the messages she had waiting... but of course she had no
idea what it was for).  Needless to say my friend was not impressed!

How could the phone company employee sign someone up without their knowledge or
signature?  Doesn't GTE have some legal obligation to notify a customer before
tapping a service onto their line?  Can they just do it without any proper
authorization?

 New York Awarded Funds to Improve Criminal History Records
 To: State and City Desks
 Contact: Stu Smith of the Office of Justice Programs,
          U.S. Department of Justice, 202-307-0784 or
          301-983-9354 (after hours)

   WASHINGTON, July 30 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The U.S. Department of Justice has
awarded the state of New York $381,512 to continue its program of improving the
quality of the state's criminal history recordkeeping, the Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS) announced today.  The project, administered by BJS in the
Office of Justice Programs (OJP), is part of a three-year, $27 million program
established by the Attorney General to help states upgrade current systems used
to maintain records of arrests, prosecutions, convictions and sentences.  The
Bureau of Justice Assistance is providing the funding through the Edward Byrne
Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program.
   "The major objective of this cooperative agreement is to improve the overall
quality of the state's criminal history record information by improving
disposition reporting, " said BJS Director Steven D. Dillingham.  "This
administration is making every effort to assure the highest standards of
accuracy and timeliness in criminal history record information across the
country.  It is critical that law enforcement officers, prosecutors, judges and
corrections officials have access to complete and accurate information on each
individual within the purview of the criminal justice system," Dillingham
commented.
   The New York Division of Criminal Justice Services will use the assistance
to correct database problems identified during the first phase of the program
and complete a study to determine if problems related to disposition collection
can be systematically resolved.  "The program emphasizes the recording of
arrest, conviction and sentencing information in a form that will make felony
history information more reliable and complete," Dillingham commented.  "This
is a crucial component of the overall objective of insuring that state criminal
history records are up-to-date and available to all criminal justice agencies."
Additional information about this program is available from BJS.  Publications
and statistical and research data may be obtained from the National Criminal
Justice Reference Service, Box 6000, Rockville, Md. 20850.  The telephone
number is 301-251-5500.  The toll-free number is 800-732-3277.

There's a fundamental problem here which we might as well lump together with
computer literacy (or lack thereof).  Many people have an instinctive,
gut-level response to anything that "looks technical": "Oh, this is too
complicated.  I can never figure these things out."  No amount of (impersonal)
hand-holding in the form of allegedly idiot-proof instruction will help; these
people's minds are firmly made up.  ("The lady doth protest too much, methinks"
applies -- if a technical system, for use by the masses, seems to need
"idiot-proof" instructions, it's probably too late.  Don Norman's POET
discusses this phenomenon well, and at length.)

The instinctive response ("I can't figure this out") is irrational, because
there are many allegedly idiot-proof technical systems out there which are
truly inspired in the techniques they employ to achieve alleged
idiot-proofness, techniques which render the interfaces accessible to just
about anyone *if they try*.  But remember, humans are basically irrational
creatures (which only makes irrational responses harder to understand for those
of us who occasionally try to be rational).

A lode that newspaper columnists have been gleefully mining lately is disgust
(theirs and their readers') over voice mail systems ("push 1 if you would like
to...").  These systems, when implemented well, can be much more efficient than
waiting on infinite hold for harried, human operators.  But the people doing
the complaining want to talk to a person, they don't want to push buttons.

I think it will take a couple of generations before there is any kind of
widespread approval and appreciation of these and other similarly technical
systems.

Robert Slade, in RISKS 13.69, describes the scene in front of various
automatic teller machines and ticket machines and sees that in spite
of clear and instructive diagrams (to him) people (especially older
people) are still having trouble using automatic machines.

Although it's a little hard to read Robert's prose, he appears to be saying
that no matter how smart the computer is, some people are still too stupid to
use it.  I'm a bit worried by that -- the readers of RISKS are all fairly
sophisticated computer users who can handle the various commands of Unix, VMS
and fourteen million different mail-readers.  Have we forgotten that not
everyone else in the world uses computers the way we do?  That operating a
machine, be it a soda vending machine, vacuum cleaner, bank machine, or Sun
workstation, is not a skill human beings are born with?

If the user interface is too difficult for most users to figure out, it's not
the user's fault.  It may not even be the machine's fault -- it may just be the
job the machine is trying to do is too complicated for the average person.  The
problem is that is was designed by "computer geeks" like us, who don't have a
problem learning a difficult interface.

Perhaps as the older generation passes, replaced by a generation born using
Nintendos, remote controls, digital watches, and other accoutrements of the
digitized era, the minimum ability of the average person to use a machine
interface will increase.  But until then, we shouldn't fall into the trap of
blaming the victim for the inadequate user interface.

This is a good illustration of a problem that is often blamed on copmuter
systems, particularly when cutting in a new system.

   People forget that it is a different game.

The rules were changed (I presume at the insistance of the Americans as a
result of the Soul Olympics), why should one expect the same result from the
new rules as the old obsolete rules? The fact that a computer system was used
to keep score under the new rules is neither here nor there (unless there has
been a real computer glitch).

One can conjure up many different possible reaons why the new rules give a
result different from the old rules, one can also argue endlessly as to which
set of rules are better, but rules are rules.

To bring this back to RISKS: using a new computer system to implement a new set
of rules can bring about surprising result, having people in the loop adds a
degree of self-correction.

In <A HREF="/Risks/13.69.html">RISKS-13.69</A>, John Carr presents a _Boston Globe_ except about a "computer
glitch" that eliminated US boxer Eric Griffin.  As someone who watched the
fight (tape delayed) on TV, and has been following the controversy, I'd like to
add a few points that are missing from the article.

There are two main human reasons why the computer system, which most
commentators thought functioned properly, would record such a score.  First is
the "Nintendo effect"--boxing judges don't tend to have particularly good
reaction times, and therefore may miss the one-second cutoff.  Second is a
particularly bad judge, who recorded only 13 punches total while the others
averaged 29.5.  This judge had just returned from a two day suspension for poor
performance.

To understand the system, it is somewhat useful to understand the layout of the
ring judges.  This picture is approximate:

	       X
           ----------
           |        |
        X  |        |  X
           |        |
           ----------
             X   X 

Under the new scoring system, the main score is based on a majority of judges
recognizing any punch.  Since at least one, and often two will have obscured
views, a single bad judge really can throw off the system WITHOUT ANY COMPUTER
MALFUNCTION.

Finally, this particular match, while extremely shocking, is not that unusual.
Throughout these olympics, a large number of clear punches, particularly to the
body, have not been scored.

As we see again and again, a computer cannot take a poor system and make it
better--but it can provide a focus for blame.

If you don't know how to do something, you don't know how to do it with a
computer.

  The real problem is that boxing has not decided what they mean by "landing a
blow".  Note that the individual scores vary by more than a factor of 3.  If
the judges differ by a factor of three, how can they expect that software will
mediate this difference?  I suspect that the software did exactly what it was
specified to do.

According to the commemtators, the new scoring system has changed the
style of boxing.  Computers cannot decide what the rules should be, but
they can, and perhaps should, be used to see what results different rules
give, and one can they chose the rule that most closely correlates with
the judges' impressions.

		   "Bug" Backfires on Computer Consultant

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A computer consultant must pay $25,000 to a Manhattan
law firm whose computer system crashed because he put a "bug" in it.
	Donald R. Lewis hoped the bug would cause the law firm of Werner,
Zaroff, Slotnick, Stern and Askenazy to call him for repair work after the
system collapsed, according to Civil Court Judge Richard F. Braun.  Lewis was
hired in 1985 to upgrade the firm's computer system, which tracks medical
payments of auto accident victims to health care providers.  The patients,
under the state's no-fault insurance law, assign their awards to the health
care professionals.  Lewis initially estimated the upgrade would cost up to
$5,000, but the firm eventually paid him some $21,000.
	In the months that followed, Lewis periodically called the firm's
receptionist to see if the computer file had entered claim number 56789.  In
July 1986, six months after the firm made its last payment to Lewis, the
computer system shut down.  It had filed claim number 56789, Braun
said.	Lewis had put a "conditional statement" in the computer's software
which caused it to stop functioning at claim number 56789, the judge said.  The
law firm paid another consultant $7,000 to fix the problem.

  [Once again this brings up the concern of people thinking that anything that
  happens in a computer system that wasn't expected by the end users is a bug.
  I'd like a job where I got paid $7000 to remove a "conditional statement."

From THE SEATTLE TIMES, Wed. Aug 5, 1992, p. D1:

"Ship makes list - the hard way" by Penelope M. Carrington

F. Garcia had just rounded the corner ... yesterday when he saw the 300-foot
fish-processing ship list to its right and crash into the neighboring dry dock. 
... the vessel, the Dona Karen Marie, had been leaning since early yesterday
morning.  First it listed to the left --- portside.  Then an engineer came to 
fix the problem.  Workers watched as the ... ship leveled and then listed to
the right --- starboard --- into the United Marine Marketing dry dock.

Shipyard spokeswoman Ruth Nelson said something malfunctioned in the computer
that controls the water-ballast tanks of the boat when the engineer tried
to correct the original listing.   As a result, all the water in the left tank
"was swooshed down to the other side," said Nelson, who was unsure why the
boat listed in the first place.

There were no injuries, and no danger of the ship tipping over into Lake Union
because it rested against the firmly anchored dry dock.  

Tacoma Boat, which built the Dona Karen Marie, was contacted to secure copies
of the original plans to the ships ballasting system.   The Seattle Fire
Department hoped to find the pipes that would pump the water back to the port
side. ... The Dona Karen Marie has been moored in the shipyard for weeks. 
Nelson said she could not identify the vessel's owner.

[ I pass the scene every day on my way to and from work.  It is quite a sight
--- imagine a four-story building tipped over onto its neighbor. The ship is
tipped about 30 degrees away from vertical, resting against the wall of the
adjacent drydock.  I don't know if it would have capsized if it hadn't struck
the drydock, but it looks like it might have.  It is lucky no one was hurt. ]

I have a long, but unfortunately, confidential article about bugs reported to
me in the microcode of microprocessors, including those used in
`safety-critical' systems. I would like to collect further examples.

Clearly, such bugs could undermine safety-critical systems. I have a list of
such bugs, but unfortunately, many are confidential.  I should like to collect
further examples. If I get enough non-confidential examples, I will post them
to comp.risks.

Please send E-mail information to me and state whether your example should be
kept confidential or not.  Give full details, such as the microprocessor, date,
and nature of bug.  Thanks.  Brian Wichmann, National Physical Laboratory

Recently, a couple of entries attracted my attention: rex@iqsc.com (Rex Black)
talked about "Unreliable call-return phone feature...", while
CMHAM01@UKCC.uky.edu (Chuck Ham) mentioned problems associated with GTE's
Personal Secretary (where a friend had troubles without even subscribing).  I
suspect that something like my small risk has been mentioned before, but who
knows....

Last year, Bell Canada had a promotion in our area to flog (among other things)
Call Waiting.  It was mentioned in a glossy throwaway in our monthly bill that
we were having Call Waiting installed on our lines (we have two) for a free
trial period.

Shortly after this, I was at home and my S.O. [significant other] was out
curling.  The arrangement was that she would call me when she finished, I'd
pick her up, and we'd go scare up something to eat.  While waiting, I dialled
in to work and probably read news.  After a while I got occasional bursts of
line noise but ignored them - the local phone lines are sometimes noisy.  The
other phone never rang...

The other half of the story is that there was an increasingly grumpy person at
the curling club trying to find me: calling home (I wasn't there, because, of
course, the phone was ringing and not being answered), work, friends' places,
and the like.  It took a long time before she thought of using the other phone
number.

The risk is small, but annoying: with the increasing use of phone lines for
data, it is not necessarily the best decision to use a normal "ring" when a
caller dials a busy line with call waiting on it.  One should also read glossy
throwaways more carefully. :-)

About a year ago, I had my long distance service switched from MCI to AT&amp;T
without my authorization--and didn't find out until the bill came from my local
phone company, Pacific Bell.  I called AT&amp;T who said they keep no record of
where a switch request comes from (they insisted that I must have filled out a
form, or that I told a telemarketer to switch me, etc).  They did take down an
incident report after I insisted on speaking to a supervisor's supervisor.

Pacific Bell told me that they do no verification if a long distance carrier
requests a switch on a customer's phone line; they receive a tape with phone
numbers on it and switch every number listed on the tape to AT&amp;T.  (Pacific
Bell also wanted me to pay to switch back to MCI, which MCI ended up paying).

     [This gets us back to the problem of the meaning of "unauthorized access"
     where no authorization is required, or in this case the meaning of
     "authorized access" when no authorization is requested!  PGN]

In RISKS 13.70 Rex Black relates a story of being "called back" via RETURN CALL
by a woman who believed he had made a harassing call.

This is yet another version of an old set of pranks that involve connecting
together unsuspecting phone users.  While most of us are more familiar with the
version where a prankster with 3-way calling connects together two strangers
(while listening in), I haven't heard much about people making harassing calls
while having CALL FORWARDING activated to deflect the return call.

Unfortunately, until we can tell whether a call we make is being forwarded
(which may mean until we get ISDN, or the messiah comes, I'm not sure which is
likely to come first), there is no way to prevent a prankster from deflecting
calls to another line.  Rest assured, though, that the switch does know who
placed the call, and that CALL TRACE would properly finger the prankster no
matter what forwarding was in place.

I would like to think that a user-interface problem, not judging incompetence
or favoritism, was the cause of the shocking loss by the US boxer.

In the third round of the fight, with the score tied at 2-2 (an obvious problem
right there), the German threw a punch that missed, and the American landed a
counterpunch that split the German's eyebrow open.  The German was awarded a
point!

How did this happen?  Each judge has a box with two levers, one for each boxer. 
If the boxer in red lands a punch, the judge presses the left lever; if the
boxer in blue lands a punch, the judge presses the right lever.

Now: The judges watch the fighters stalk each other, circle, and throw
combinations.  They press the left lever -- no, the right!  Too late.

I think the judges all pressed the wrong lever.

Several RISKS contributors have correctly noted that the problem with the
computerized scoring system used for Olympic boxing is not the computer but
rather the button-pressing speed of the judges and the scoring rules that were
implemented in the program.  The computer RISK is that electronic
implementation of complicated scoring systems, systems which would not be
feasible without computers, allows scoring rules to be used whose consequences
are not well understood.  These new scoring systems often seem reasonable on
paper but turn out to have surprising consequences.  I'll bet boxing officials
were surprised (embarrassed?) to learn that all judges could score a fight in
favor of Boxer A but that the majority-rule-per-punch rule could give the
decision to Boxer B.

The larger RISK is that implementations of "electronic town meetings" and
telephone voting will allow the use of creative scoring systems for electing
candidates and making policy decisions.  Without extensive forethought, such
computerized voting systems will inevitably produce unexpected results with
more serious consequences than who receives boxing medals.

There need not be surprises.  There is a large literature in the field of
public choice on the formal analysis of voting and scoring rules.  Kenneth
Arrow won the Nobel Prize in Economics for, among other things, proving that if
there are three or more options [not a problem for Olympic boxing] then it is
impossible to have a scoring system without unpleasant surprises such as being
manipulable and producing intransitive choices.  Since then the search has been
on for finding voting systems that have the fewest problems and a large array
of analysis tools are available.  The boxing officials ought to have consulted
experts in the field of public choice as well as computer experts.  Perhaps
they did.  The boxing rules may not be all that bad; they have a remarkable
similarity to the rules NASA uses to resolve disagreements among on-board
computers and NASA did consult with the public choice experts.  However, in the
boxing case, it is easy to show that conservative judges [these may not
necessarily be the worst judges as alleged in the recent case] have a
disproportionate impact because it is more likely that their votes will be
decisive in forming the majority on any given punch.  The punchline is that
computers may allow us to get into kinds of political trouble with fancy
scoring rules that would not have been possible with paper-and-pencil systems
which are forced to be simple.

Ed Ravin (elr%trintex@uunet.uu.net) and Steve Summit (scs@adam.mit.edu) hope
that the next generations will have less problems with (the user interfaces of)
machines due to childhood training at Nintendos etc.

I doubt this: I notice that I become more impatient the older I get. I spent
countless hours learning the tricks of my programmable calculator. Nowadays I
am too impatient to read the manual of my video recorder. When in ten years
they force me to use ATMs, I will probably even be too impatient for learning
that, especially if there are people waiting in the line (and it does not
matter that learning the system is the fastest way to get it done). As an
analogy, we have had forms since the invention of bureaucracy, but they still
confuse us.

In <A HREF="/Risks/13.70.html">RISKS-13.70</A>, Geoff Kuenning tells the story of a Mr. Cabin Baggage (actually
a violoncello) having a ticket on an airline flight.  Having to ticket cabin
baggage that way is a potential RISK to a search and rescue party in the event
that the airplane crashes, since if the ticket is used, the passenger list will
show one more soul on board, and the rescuers will be looking for another
potential survivor.  It would be a tragedy if a rescuer someday lost his life
trying to find Mr. Stradivarius Cello.

I know that I've had cabin baggage successfully ticketed by United without
having to come up with a fictitious name; some reservation systems do it right.

But musicians seem to get into this type of trouble.  The duo-pianists Stecher
and Horowitz once arrived at the airport to find that the rear row of seats had
been removed from the aircraft to accommodate the stretcher -- they'd been
booked as `Stretcher patient, Horowitz!'

    [When dealing with computerized systems, we must be forewarned that we
    need to be forearmed.  But for pianists, four-armed can be four-handed 
    on one keyboard or duo-piano, on two.  But the absence of seats cannot
    be forewarmed.  PGN]

       [Incidentally, since I am already drifting in relevance (too much
       flying?), John Levine (johnl@iecc.cambridge.ma.us) noted that a
       professional cellist friend of his regularly buys a seat for his cello,
       but the airlines won't let the cello join a frequent flyer program.  It
       would probably do violins to their computer system.  At any rate, this
       is certainly enough for this topic...  Thanks for your indolcence. PGN]

For those in the greater Washington DC area, I will be teaching a course in
Georgetown University's continuing education program, surveying issues
arising from our entry into the "Information Age."   The course description
is below, and it runs for eight Thursday evenings.   Contact the School of
Summer and Continuing Education at Georgetown for further information (and
forward this note to others if you like).        Ross

ISSUES FOR THE INFORMATION AGE

     This course will address issues of the "Information Age" for a
nontechnical audience, i.e., how computers and computer-based information and
systems are transforming the world around us.
     What does it mean to say that "information about money is as valuable as
money itself?"  Many companies do nothing more than broker information, as an
increasingly larger percentage of the U.S. economy.  But where ought the
boundary between commercial profit and personal privacy be drawn?  Lotus
Development Corp. cancelled its plans to market a database on consumers in the
face of protests from those it would have monitored, and across the U.S.
"caller ID" technology is facing severe scrutiny from all sides.
     In the wake of the failed Soviet coup, a U.S. communications company took
out a full-page ad to congratulate Soviet citizens who, "armed with nothing
more than information...saved the day."  News of the Tiananmen Square massacre
came to us out of China by way of portable satellite dishes and the fax
machine.
     Information systems are making life more efficient, but never before has
it been possible for a simple computer glitch to cause a billion dollars worth
of damage--twice in 1991 software bugs crippled large portions of the U.S.
telephone system, and a Cornell graduate student's program shut down tens of
thousands of networked computers in 1988.  [WELL, Cliff Stoll estimated 2,600
of the estimated 6,000 BSD Unix systems.  PGN]
     The legal profession is scrambling to apply yesterday's laws to new
realities, and "artificial reality" has been used in court testimony, while the
FBI lobbies to make digital telephones easier to wiretap.  What do we have to
fear from "hackers?"  Does computer crime pay?
     Readings will be provided, taken largely from the current press, to serve
as background and focus for discussion.
     Dr. Ross Alan Stapleton is a science and technology analyst with extensive
experience studying computer and information technologies in the former USSR
and Eastern Europe.
     8 sessions, Thursday evenings, 7:45 to 9:15 p.m., September 24 through
November 12, 1992.

                           CALL FOR PAPERS
                         AND PRE-ANNOUNCEMENT 
                     The 1992 World Conference On 
                  Network Administration and Security 
                    November 30 - December 4, 1992
                           Washington, DC 
 
THEME: Practical solutions for cost-effective network administration and
security in a UNIX environment.
 
ELIGIBILITY: Network administrators, system administrators, security
administrators, technology managers, computer installation managers, and their
staff.  In addition, a limited number of places are available for staff members
from organizations that offer off-the-shelf software and hardware products that
support network management and security.
 
LOCATION: Ramada Renaissance Techworld Hotel, 919 9th Street NW, Washington,
D.C. 20019,  (202) 898-9000 
 
CONFERENCE DATES: Tutorials: November 30- December 1
                  Technical Sessions: December 2- December 4 
 
INFORMATION: For pre-registration materials, send mail to: 
 
Program Chairman, Alan Paller, Conference Office, 4610 Tournay Road
                  Bethesda, MD 20816 
 
or send email to paller@fedunix.org. 
 
HOST ORGANIZATION: The Washington Area UNIX Users Group and the Federal Network
Administration Council.
 
CONFERENCE SPONSOR: the Open Systems Conference Board, a not-for-profit
educational organization dedicated to removing the barriers to widespread
adoption of UNIX and Open Systems.
 
WHY YOU SHOULD PARTICIPATE: The demands of mission critical applications are
driving the need for network innovation at an amazing pace.  New technology and
new standards promote confusion and interoperability problems while at the same
time providing much needed connectivity and increased bandwidth.  Cutbacks have
forced fewer people to provide more service with less money.
 
These challenges are particularly apparent and frustrating in the government
agencies (both in the US and abroad), universities, and companies which have
been in the vanguard of the move to open systems and networks of UNIX
computers.
 
This conference is designed to identify the current state of the art for
cost-effective network administration and security so that the techniques and
tools used by the most effective managers can be adopted by those still looking
for solutions.

Peer-reviewed papers will be complemented with invited papers plus

   "Ask the Experts" sessions where you'll find practical answers
   to your questions. 

   "Best Of The Net" session where you'll learn which free programs
   available from the net are most useful.

   "Tips and Techniques" sessions in which conference attendees can
   share, in 5-minute presentations, their favorite techniques for
   solving recurring problems.  These sessions are run as moderated
   BOFs with all conference attendees being asked, in advance, to
   contribute if they choose.

   "Ask OSF" session where you can learn from the people who brought
   you DCE.

   Informal Birds Of A Feather sessions in the evening to expand the
   sharing time.  Please send your suggestions for topics with your
   registration.
 
In addition, the Monday-Tuesday tutorials will be taught by several of
America's top-rated instructors. Tutorial topics include TCP/IP and
UNIX Network Programming, UNIX Security, OSF DCE and DME, UNIX
Fundamentals, UNIX Internals, UNIX System and Network Administration
(Basic and Advanced courses), and Perl Programming.
 
                        ********************* 
                        ** CALL FOR PAPERS ** 
                        ********************* 
 
Papers are being sought for the technical conference from network
administrators, system administrators, security managers, consultants,
academics, and hardware and software developers.
 
You don't have to have made a major breakthrough to have your paper accepted.
The delegates will be looking for good problem definitions and practical
solutions. And your presentation does not have to be long. You may choose a 15,
30, or 45 minute time slot.
 
IMPORTANT DATES FOR SUBMISSION: 
 
                  Abstracts Due: September 14, 1992

On July 23, 1992, New York City Mayor Dinkins announced in a press conference
that the $60,000,000 contract to replace the city's mechanical voting machines
with electronic voting systems (EVM) would be awarded to Sequoia Pacific, 
pending the outcome of public hearings.

The city's press release included the following statement:
	"In January 1989, SRI determined that Sequoia Pacific was best
	 positioned and most willing to modify its system to meet the
	 needs of New York City and New York State standards."

In actuality, SRI's Final Report (Evaluation of Offerors for the Procurement 
of an Electronic Voting System, December 23, 1988) contained the following 
first sentences under FINDINGS:
	"No offeror's system completely meets the RFP specifications.
	 On the basis of our analysis and the testing of the EVMs,
	 SRI concludes that no offeror currently has either an EVM
	 or central system acceptable for the city."
They went on to say:
	"No offeror scored higher than 63% of the total possible RFP
	 and evaluation criteria points."
And:
	"SRI does not believe any of the four offerors has fully met
	 the requirements of the RFP, based on their proposed EVMs,
	 their central systems, and/or management and financial
	 considerations. Each offeror would have to make substantial,
	 significant modifications and additions -- in both technical
	 and management areas -- for its approach to be considered
	 acceptable for the City."

SRI went on to recommend Sequoia on the basis that of the four offerors,
they had the greatest "probability of ... successfully implementing an
electronic voting system for New York City."

Does the record indicate that Sequoia has or can successfully implement
a system for New York City? You decide. Here is some information from 
public documents:

Monroe County, Indiana vs. Sequoia Pacific:
	"In December, 1988, Monroe County, Indiana, filed a lawsuit 
	 against A. E. Boyce and SP, alleging that the defendants
	 breached a contract between the County and Boyce whereby
	 Sequoia was to have manufactured and Boyce was to have
	 delivered to the County 120 automatic voting machines.
	 Only 40 of the machines were delivered and Sequoia
	 subsequently ceased production of the model which was
	 the subject of the contract." "In December, 1990, the
	 case was settled by the parties. The contract in question
	 was terminated..."

On July 11, 1990 the Sequoia Pacific Electronic Voting System was denied
certification in the state of Pennsylvania on the following grounds:
	"(1) The system does not conform to Pennsylvania statutory 
	 requirements for overriding straight-party votes in individual
	 offices; (2) the system can be placed inadvertently in a mode
	 in which the voter is unable to vote for certain candidates,
	 which is volative of statute; and (3) the system reports straight-
	 party votes in a bizarre and inconsistent manner."
The NY City Board of Elections stated in a letter on January 3, 1991 that:
	"The vendor has admitted to us that release 2.04 of their software
	 used in the Pennsylvania certification process had just been
	 modified and that it was a mistake to have used it even in a
	 certification demonstration."

In what appears to be the final updated evaluation by SRI (June 19, 1991)
of the Sequoia Pacific EVM and its Programmable Memory Device (PMD) which 
contains the vote tally, under the heading of Reliability, the testing
status report from Sequoia Pacific stated:
	"SP doesn't know how to show that EVM/PMD meets requirement --
	 this depends on poll workers' competence."

If the above concerns you, here's what you can do:

1. Attend and comment at the public hearings in New York City. It is 
   critical that individuals have their opinions on this matter stated
   for the record, BEFORE the contracts are presented for signing.
   New York City residents as well as ALL other interested parties
   are permitted to attend.
   The meetings are:
	August 20, 42nd &amp; Broadway, 6th Floor, 6PM
	September 10, City Hall, 10AM (tentative)

2. Request documents from the city under the Freedom of Information Act.
   Contact Lorraine Jones at 212/566-3307 in the Department of General
   Services. You may wish to request all or some of the following:
	A. SRI Final Report, Volume I, December 23, 1988,
	   Evaluation of Offerors for the Procurement of an
	   Electronic Voting System.
	B. SRI Updated Evaluation of the Sequoia Pacific EVM,
	   June 19, 1991.
	C. Technical Specifications including -
		System Requirements Documents
		System Design Documents
		System Quality Documents
		System Verification Plan
		System Test Plan
		Results of Entire System Test
	D. A list of other publications relevant to this matter.

3. Write letters of concern and comment to:

	Daniel DeFrancesco
	Executive Director
	Board of Elections
	City of New York
	General Office, 32 Broadway
	New York, NY 10004

	cc separate copy to

	Philadelphia, PA 19105	

4. If you are a member of ACM, IEEE or other professional, computing or
   engineering organizations, encourage your officers and club members
   to become involved and informed on this issue.

5. Forward this posting to everyone you believe would be interested in
   commenting on this matter.

Is there a record for the greatest number of people affected by one computer
bug?  [This is most likely not it.  But it also depends on how you define 
"affected"...  PGN]

BANK WARNS CREDIT CARD CUSTOMERS [Cambridge Evening News, 11 Aug 1992]

  Millions of credit card customers are being contacted to be told their
statements might be wrong. NatWest [the National Westminster Bank] is to tell
its five million cardholders about the possibility of errors caused by a
computer problem - and millions of cardholders with other banks who also have
their accounts processed through the same system could be affected.  But no-one
will lose money as a result of the errors, said a NatWest spokesman. [No-one?
Not even the banks? You bet, not the banks...]
  The mistakes have come about because of a "blip" in the computer system run
by First Data Resources. Cards affected include Visa, Mastercard and Access
supplied by NatWest, Midland and Lloyds.  `We will be correcting it all
ourselves. There will be no need for the customer to contact us', said a bank
spokesman.

  [This item was also reported on ITN's TV newscast, where they interviewed a
  customer whose statement had spuriously acquired a debit for over 4,000
  pounds.  The credit card bill had automatically been paid from his regular
  bank account by Direct Debit, thereby making the bank acount overdrawn and
  attracting heavy interest charges.]

The following is the latest in a series of articles that I have seen in various
papers over the last few months about a growing campaign against the practice
that UK Banks have of assuming that all cash card fraud is due to stolen or
misused cards and pin numbers. (This continues despite the case of the proven
cash card fraud carried out by an engineer working for the Clydesdale Bank, if
I remember correctly, who eavesdropped electronically on cash dispensing
machines.) As I understand it, class actions are comparatively rare and
difficult in the UK, so the story is locally interesting just for that reason.
However I have not before seen any mention of the way that the barrister
leading the action has arranged for computer database and communications
technology to be used to gather evidence to counteract the banks' claims -
hence this posting to RISKs.  Brian Randell

Banks face legal challenge over cash card fraud 
By Susan Watts, Technology Correspondent, The Independent, 12 Aug 1992

People convinced they have lost money through cash dispenser fraud could
have a novel computer system to thank if they succeed in legal action
against their banks due to start tomorrow.

Alistair Kelman, a barrister acting for aggrieved customers in a case against
seven high street banks and building societies is using computer software to
spot patterns in the way unauthorised transactions take place.  Mr Kelman has
built up a computer database holding information on more than 400 cases. His
"relational" database allows him to cross-correlate the place, date and time of
mystery cash withdrawals. He hopes to match cases with similar characteristics
in a way that he says the banks have so far failed to do. The database will let
him analyse "the spider's web" of automatic teller machines across Britain, he
said.

"I don't think the banks are capable of doing what we are doing. They would
only have the pattern of their own branch or their own banking network."
Rebecca Evans, a barrister working for the Consumers' Association, said she had
already noticed that victims often lived in the same area. Banks have also
claimed phantom withdrawals occur near the victims' local cash machine,
implying that their personal identification number has been passed on or
stolen. She said the database should help to support or dispel such theories.

Mr Kelman believes the case is unusual in that it enlisted help from
thousands of interested observers via a computer "conference" on the
Compulink Information Exchange. This type of electronic message service
lets people add their ideas to computer-based "conversations" via telephone
data links.

Mr Kelman said the case had attracted about 5,000 contributors including
policemen, people offering advice on how to make phantom cash withdrawals and
others who had had first-hand experience of cashcard theft.  One story added to
the computer bulletin board recently was from a man claiming his high street
bank account was debited from Scotland while he was sitting an exam in Chester
with the card on his desk as proof of identification. The bank involved paid up
almost immediately, despite the banks' persistent claim that their machines are
infallible.

Mr Kelman said that linking the cases via his database has enabled him to bring
a "group action" against the financial institutions.

Denis Whalley, associate solicitor at Keith J Park in Merseyside who is
preparing the cases, said Mr Kelman's approach had helped him secure legal aid
for many of the plaintiffs even though most were claiming less than
(pounds)1,000, which would normally be too small a claim to qualify. He intends
to issue writs on 10 cases tomorrow, then add to these over the following
months to work towards a full trial next summer.

Mr Whalley said the banks had become more willing to pay up as his court case
approached. But a spokesman for the Association of Payment Clearing Services
the banks' cheque clearing system insisted yesterday that the banks were
confident in the security of their computer systems and fully prepared to face
the court action.

By the close of business Tuesday, Barnett Banks Inc had learned what it is like
to be an 800-pound gorilla wearing a blindfold.  Florida's largest banking
company opened its 550 branches statewide Tuesday only to find its computers
were taking the day off...branches could not open a new account or check
balances in any customer's account.

Most branches set dollar limits on cashing checks and worked to minimize the
confusion.  But Barnett customers with big transactions to make and who did not
pass a 'Do I know you' test of branch managers were out of luck for the day.
...

Though computer experts spent most of Tuesday in search of the 'bug' that
plagued Barnett's systems, they were not able to identify it and fix it before
most of the bank's offices closed at 4 PM.  As it turned out, a single
transaction ground Barnett's two giant mainframe computers to a halt, according
to Jonathan Palmer, Barnett's chief technology officer.

"A coding error in a program caused our whole computer complex to 'hang up' ...
That one transaction acted like a computer virus" by redirecting the computers
from their appointed tasks.  Barnett is working on new systems to avoid any
repeat of Tuesday's troubles.  "This should be an extremely rare occurrence,"
Palmer said.

| A more detailed description of how the bug "redirected" their
| computers and in such a way that the offending transaction couldn't
| itself be located or help find the bug during the whole day would
| be interesting.  Other risks naturally include being a bank user
| who customarily uses ATMs or uses different branches for convenience.

The ocean liner QE2 had its hull damaged sailing near Martha's Vineyard.
Nautical charts of the area (made in 1939) show a shoal at a depth of 39 feet
(surrounded by readings of 85 and 90 feet) near where the ship hit something.
The ship's draw is listed as 32 feet, which should have left seven feet to
spare.  (Of course, it is not known if this is what was hit, or if the pilot, a
local pilot brought on board to navigate coastal waters, would have tried to
stay clear of that ledge even if there was supposed to be seven feet
clearance.)  The entire area has been known as a dangerous one for ships for
centuries, though the QE2 was in a standard navigation channel, heading for
NYC.

An article in the NY Times today (12 Aug) points out that the nautical charts
are based on a "sonar technology that may have overlooked higher peaks or
boulders on an underwater ledge", described by an NOAA spokesman as "hit or
miss".  He said "It is possible that the survey missed a shallower depth, that
the survey passed around it and didn't see it."

It surprises me that surveyors, when finding a steep shoal like this, 50 feet
higher than the surroundings, would not look specially for its tip.  This
points out the danger of digitizing real world data onto a fixed grid.

Today's article in the Times (by Felicity Barringer) ends by noting that "at
least two of the ship's three electronic navigational systems were operating at
the time" of the accident.

The Aug 1st issue of the Economist has an editorial and article on "Stupid
Computers".  They say attempting to pass the Turing test is a bad idea, because
computers think differently than people.  Computers and people can complement
each other.  American Express, having computerized its credit card division,
can now hire humans who are good at dealing with people (instead of at number
crunching), and can give them more freedom to solve customers' problems (with
the computer's help).

The article starts out:
  Every customer has at least one horror story to tell of a company
  or a government deptartment that is unable to stop sending wrong bills,
  or to correct an address, or to divulge a piece of information "because
  of the computer".  Teh brainless obstinacy of some machines has made
  them great allies of bureaucratic solution blockers.  So the very
  thought of giving machines more responsibilities will send chills down
  many spines.  Fear not.  Companies are findin that the more intelligent
  machines are allowed to play to their strengths. the more they reduce
  human obstinacy.

However, it does conclude on a note of fear:
  Someday someone will inevitably go too far.  Bankers, for example, are
  talking about using artificial intelligence to enable their people to
  sell financial products too varied and sophisticated for the salesmen to
  understand.  Now that is an intelligent idea that could leave someone
  looking very stupid indeed.

I don't see qualitative difference between this scheme and the one that allows
American Express to hire people who don't understand the number crunching.

I was working as a programmer for a military command center, the kind with
large screens around the walls which display current status of whatever.  The
system was a custom job with custom software, but was fairly stable (no
outstanding software problem reports, no recent modifications).  Normal
operations 24 hours / day, 7 days / week.

One Monday morning about 0600, the system crashed.  No problem.  The operator
initiated warm start on the hot backup system and dump procedures on the failed
machine; back on-line in less than 3 minutes (and called me, midnight shift
programming support).  A few minutes later the alternate system crashed.  What
to do?  (The dump takes about 11 minutes.  If we abort the dump to get on-line
as fast as possible, we lose any chance of finding out why the first crash
occurred.  And the primary system may go down again if we have an unrepaired
hardware problem.  But since both systems crashed within minutes of each other,
its probably a software problem, so if I don't get the dump, we have ZERO
chance of finding out what happened.)  Call the command post for permission to
complete the dump.  Denied.  Abort the dump.  Reboot the primary.  Initiate
dump on the alternate.  The primary crashes again.  Reboot the alternate.
Initiate dump on the primary.  The alternate crashes again.  This time we get
permission to allow the dumps to complete.  Reboot and back on-line.  By now,
it's after 0700.

Start analyzing what happened.  Trace the problem to a data input routine.
Hmmmmm. Seems like its overrunning the buffer and trashing an adjacent data
structure.  Can't be, the buffer is already larger than the physical limit on
the terminal (an IBM 2701 - a then modern but now ancient IBM Selectric
ball-type typewriter rigged as a computer input device).  Quick fix: move the
adjacent data structure further away from the buffer, re-assemble (Yes,
Virginia, we had computers before we had compilers.  What's that, you little
snot?  Yes, I did work on them and no it was not before Christ.), bring the
alternate to "hot backup" status and do a switchover.  Take a deep breath and
start figuring out WHY it happened, because the General has missed his Monday
morning briefing and is going to want to know whether he cna count on his
primary command and control system or not.

Hit a stone wall.  Couldn't find anything wrong with the code.  So I put an
alarm in that input routine, took my chewing out and went on with life.  Two
weeks later, my alarm went off.  The system didn't crash because I had moved
that fragile data structure, but it would have if I hadn't moved it.  The alarm
also triggered an on-line dump and, when I checked it, sure enough, that same
terminal had overrun its buffer again.  But it can't!  The buffer is 128
characters deep and the IBM 2701 is only 85 characters wide; you HAVE to enter
a carriage return to continue.

Well, not quite.  I finally made the connection between one particular Major
inputting data for the General's morning briefing and the alarms.  It seems
this Major had figured out that the display screens could handle lines 132
characters long even though the input devices could only provide 85.  So when
he got to the end of a line on the terminal, he would grab the typewriter ball,
drag it to the left, manually roll the paper forward and keep typing.  As long
as he was entering less than 128 characters, everything was ok.  But when he
went over that, ...

OBSERVATION 1:  A user will do anything (s)he can think of to get the job done.
OBSERVATION 2:  They are usually more creative than we are, i.e., they think of
                things we don't.

Under (price) pressure, failures certainly become more common:

&gt;Beware of high pressure without passive safety devices!

This is the same problem as our perrenial fly-by-wire discussion, so I'll let
that part of the message stand. I would like, however, to raise another point:

&gt;The pump was controlled by a ZEOS 386 clone via a serial line. [...]

&gt;They had had problems with the clone in the past; most of which were believed
&gt;related to the Extended Memory Manager.

Ah. Doing real-time control under DOS or Windows. I couldn't imagine speccing
a DOS based system for real-time control where system failure could lead to
physical harm. I'm even leary of the use of an AT bus based machine: given
the cost of the rest of the system and the risks involved I'd suggest buying
a professional quality real-time control system rather than using this sort
of hobbyist equipment.

Yes, we use DOS systems as part of real-time control systems, but only for
man-machine interface (monitoring, supervisory control, and so on). And we
typically buy the PC from one of the vendors that sells industrial quality
equipment. Yes, a 19-inch rack-mount passive-backplane box may cost several
times as much as a generic clone, but it's worth it.

If you MUST use a PC, there are real-time systems available: QNX, LynxOS,
iRMX, and so on. iRMX even comes with a Windows-capable compatibility box,
so you can run your DOS and Windows software... though I'd strongly recommend
against it, at least while the experiment is under way.

(note that this is not a panacea: the (presumably professionally implemented)
 real-time control system in the pump itself apparently failed as well... but
 at least it does give you a fighting chance at producing a reliable system)

===
On another note, I'm concerned about the possibility of "frequent" mistakes
in Southwestern Bell's Caller-ID system. I'm strongly in favor of Caller-ID
as a concept, and have said so here and in TELECOM digest in the past. I did,
however, assume that it would be approximately as reliable as the rest of
the phone system: wrong numbers that are not the result of misdialing are
quite rare. If there's a problem in Call-Return shared by Caller-ID (which
is possible though not obvious: the dialler at the CO that Call-Return uses
might be at fault) then I would certainly want it fixed BEFORE it goes on
line. I'd even support pulling Call-Return until the problem can be resolved.

Pat Townson of TELECOM Digest has apparently seen no signs of this up in
Chicago, so it may be a local problem. Southwestern Bell has not impressed
me with their competance in the past.

===
As for voice-mail systems, a simple "and dial 0 for an operator" entry in
the menu would solve most of the problems people have. I *like* using
these systems, but occasionally I get lost in a maze of twisty little
options (say, for example, the menu item I'm used to selecting has been
changed) and would dearly like the ability to bail out.

This article was originally posted in 'misc.consumers' and
'misc.consumers.house', and a responder suggested also posting in 'comp.risks'.

I'm looking for information from anyone who has experienced an
electronic-control appliance "autonomously" turning itself on or otherwise
doing something that it was not explicitly "commanded" to do by a user.  Also,
if anyone has not experienced this first-hand, but knows of such incidents, I'd
like to know.

Here's why I'm looking for this information.

Recently, while we were out of the house, our electronic-control microwave oven
turned itself on.  While this oven has a timer, it had not been activated, and
there was no "logical" reason for the microwave to turn on.  There had been,
however, an electrical storm in the area that was severe enough to have
affected many of the computer systems where I work (about a mile from our
home), and the only logical explanation for the microwave coming on was that
its microprocessor control had received just the right impulses from the storm
to set it running.  We don't know how long the oven had been running when we
came back, but when we entered the house the microwave was running and had
burned/melted a plastic trim piece inside, and had filled the house with
burned-plastic fumes.

In my opinion, electronic controls for appliances should be designed with more
fail-safe capabilities than seem to be the case here, and it appears to me that
our oven has a fundamental safety design flaw.  Very likely ALL
electronic-control appliances share this flaw, and there are likely to be
severe consequences, although probably quite rare.  In our case our house would
probably have burned if we had not come back and turned the microwave off.

Because occurrences like this are probably very rare, and maybe even
unbelievable, I'd like to hear from anyone else who could relate incidents
similar to this that could add to the believability of what happened.

Please send relevant information to me at a.e.eckberg@att.com

About a year ago, Hennessey's, a local bar, replaced the usual ESPN programming
on one of their four TV monitors with an obviously computer-generated display
giving the day's sports scores, standings, and miscellaneous news, as well as
showing advertising and some simple graphics.  I found it to be a nice
addition, since ten minutes or so of watching would give me the results on my
favorite teams.

This summer, the system has developed a rather troubling memory problem.  There
seems to be a flaw in the deletion of outdated information.  In July, for
example, it reported on the outcome of a Stanley Cup hockey game played in
April, complete with a coach's comments on the (supposedly) next-scheduled
game.  This evening (August 16), it displayed baseball standings showing the
Dodgers in fourth place, 6.5 games out of first.  (As of this morning, they
were in last place, 22 games behind.  I guess today's loss to San Francisco
really helped their standings!)

Even more interesting, the out-of-date results are mixed with up-to-date
information.  The incorrect baseball standings were followed by a Las Vegas
odds display gaving information on the correct National League baseball
schedule for Monday.

I have no idea how the system works (except that the immediacy of the
results and the speed of the display update together indicate a local
computer which receives information from a service via a modem), so I
can't speculate on where the problem lies.  But it's clear that
somebody needs to erase the disk!

     [Sounds as if there is a selective three month lag for certain
     results.  OR, could it be that some of the data entry is done by people
     who write dates such as 7/4/92 to mean 7 April rather than July 4?  PGN]

    From a scanner hobbiest newsletter:

Hayward [California] Fire department is going to be going to all MDT dispatch
in the future. According to Hayward Fire, they will never, ever, have to use
voice traffic again.  Even the Battalion Chief won't hear the calls since there
will be no voice traffic calls.  The Chief will have to be near a computer
terminal to see the calls.  This according to an anonymous source.

    The risks should be obvious...

I bank with one of the UK's largest building societies, the Nationwide. I was
attracted by their advertising, which offered 'electronic payments' via their
cashpoint machines. You notify details of the accounts you'll want to pay, and
can then send money to pay the bills from any machine. It looked neat and fast,
and I liked the idea of a paperless payment.

I'd used it to pay my credit card bills for about a year, when in May I needed
to settle a Visa account of 600 pounds or so ($1100). It was twelve days before
the due date...

Yes, that's right. Although they debited my account immediately, they did not
pay the credit card company for two weeks - and I incurred interest charges for
not making a payment when I'd made it 2 weeks before.

This was NOT an accident, it wasn't a mistake - Nationwide told me that their
terms and conditions permitted them to take up to TWO WEEKS to make an
ELECTRONIC payment! The small print, which talks of 'working days' rather than
'real' days, bore this out. I'd - foolishly - always assumed payment would be
made faster if I used an electronic cashpoint; this was several times slower
than a paper transaction!

The RISKs are obvious; your money goes, but bills are not paid, and the bank
doesn't tell you.

I asked for a technical explanation - writing a system which takes two weeks to
process a payment sounded tricky to me. The eventual answer was so depressing
it had to be true - mag tapes are moved physically around the UK, until they
eventually arrive at the right location.

(From _The Vancouver Sun_  August 13, 1992.  Article by Lynn Moore)

University of B.C. student Tamiko Musgrove thought the worst had happened when
she checked on her class schedule for September and found she didn't have one.
Only two weeks earlier, Musgrove had used UBC's telephone registration system
and managed to get all nine courses she needed for her second year of study,
including those hard-to-get labs.  Someone, Musgrove concluded after a brief
investigation, had breached the security of the Telereg system and wiped out
her courses.  A Telereg hotline operator told her someone using her student
number and birth date entered the system one week after she chose her courses
and dropped them one by one.  And seven of the nine courses she wanted had
filled up since then.  Although Musgrove was quickly reinstated into her
courses after assuring UBC it wasn't she who dropped them, she still wonders if
Telereg security is up to snuff.  UBC registration coordinator Sham Pendleton
says it is and what happened to Musgrove is rare.  "One or two students each
year" claim their registration files have been tampered with through the
Telereg System, Pendleton said.  And Martin Ertl of the Alma Mater Society said
Telereg security breaches have not been reported to the student association.
Students should keep their eight-digit identification number to themselves,
Pendleton said.  That and their birth date combine to make the Telereg access
code.  "Chances of someone knowing that combination of numbers is very, very
slim," she said.  Student identification numbers have to be used on every
assignment and lab that is handed in to be marked, countered Musgrove, and it
would not difficult for a determined classmate to learn a student's number.
Birth dates are a little more difficult to figure out but not impossible, said
Musgrove, who believes that a male classmate who was harassing her last year
erased her courses.  Pendleton said that when cases like Musgrove's arise,
students are put back into their original courses and given a new _and
fictitious_ birthday.  Students can also request that a new birth date be
assigned to them if they fear their numbers are known to others, she said.

I work for a game software company in Eugene, Oregon.  It has grown
tremendously over the past year as a result of a successful series of products
and a merger with another, larger company, going from 35 to 135 employees in
about a year.

Traditionally, employees have been asked to hand in signed timesheet forms to
report vacation and sick leave days taken and information on projects we were
working on.  During the last pay period the accounting department announced
they were going to introduce a program called AUTOPAY that would run on the
company-wide LAN to gather this information, and that eventually paper
timesheets would be phased out.

Someone soon noticed that since you only needed to provide your LAN login name
to AUTOPAY for identification, it was possible for anyone to view and modify
anyone else's timesheet data.  When I brought up my concerns to our chief
financial officer while handing in my paper timesheet, I was assured that data
from AUTOPAY would be checked before being entered into the payroll system.
Later this person also responded to a public e-mail message noting that AUTOPAY
had no security, saying that "the only reason someone would modify another
person's timesheet would be to be mean or ornery."  By now I had become
concerned, and wrote an e-mail reply of my own saying that with that kind of
attitude and no security, we were just waiting to be stung.  I also noted that
computer-gathered data of this type is all too often used without any
verification.  Even with verification it would still be possible to do subtle
things like add vacation days a few at a time to someone else's timesheet until
they were used up, resulting in at best confusion and at worst loss of pay when
the person claimed real vacation time.

Since then we've gone through another pay period where password protection was
hacked into the program.  I promptly requested a password in person (the
announcement asked people to send password requests in e-mail!), then
discovered on returning to my office that I couldn't get it to work.  I then
tried something that I hoped wouldn't work, but suspected would -- I grepped
the directory tree containing the AUTOPAY files for the first few characters of
my password, and found it in one of the files.  To my horror this file was
publicly readable _and writable_; I could see other people's passwords and
modify them if I had wanted to.  All six characters (the maximum allowed!) were
entered correctly in the password file but if I typed them into the program
they would never match, although typing the first five would work.  After I
complained about the lack of access protection for the password file it was
made read-only, which means that although now people can't change other's
passwords, they can still find out what they are.

Unfortunately the head-in-the-sand approach to security exhibited by the
accounting staff and some other participants in a small public e-mail
discussion has been rewarded so far because no one has been malicious enough to
try screwing up the AUTOPAY data.  I have gotten a bit frustrated that the
attitude towards security for data that affects everyone's pay is so lax.

Another less drastic problem with this AUTOPAY system is that it has an
unusually poor user interface, particularly when it comes to saving timesheet
data and exiting the program--I usually have to run through it twice to make
sure that my data has been entered properly because the method for exiting and
the prompts given by the program are obscure.  The individual author (whose
name appears in a garish and pointless title screen) appears to know as little
about user interface design as he does about security.

Although nothing has yet gone terribly wrong with AUTOPAY, it has all the
ingredients of a minor computer security fiasco in the making.  I hope that any
sequels I write will be happier ones.

Kraig Meyer reported on being switched from MCI to AT&amp;T without any action on
his part. We has something similar happen to us recently, but with an
additional twist.

In February, MCI called our home and convinced my wife to sign us up for the
MCI Friends &amp; Family program, promising her $20 of free long distance and that
they would switch us back free to AT&amp;T if we didn't like it. She asked them
explicitly how the $20 would be paid ("a credit on your first month's bill")
and generally made sure they weren't trying to pull any tricks. I was surprised
that several days later, we were on MCI, since I have a password on my New
England Telephone account that they assured me would prevent anyone from making
any changes without it. Risk number one: a supposedly secure system that allows
unauthorized transactions if they come from certain sources that NET trusts,
but I don't.

In early March, we received an envelope from MCI containing a $5 certificate
good only for our March bill, a $5 certificate good only for April and a $10
certificate good only on our May bill. I immediately called MCI and explained
that this was unacceptable, and that I wasn't going to do business with a
company that lied to us. I told them to switch us back to AT&amp;T free like they
had promised. I was told that I would have to call my local phone company for
that change, that they could only switch people to MCI, not to other carriers.
I asked them how they were going to pay for it, and they said "a credit on your
bill".  Risk number two: MCI claims to be unable to reverse their transactions.

I called NET and they agreed to switch me back to AT&amp;T. Several days later, the
700 number that tells you your LD carrier told me I was on AT&amp;T.  When our
March bill arrived, it had all LD calls billed by MCI.  I called the 700
number, and sure enough, we were back on MCI.

NET looked up the change and told me that apparently MCI frequently puts
through changes a couple of months in a row, to make sure that people really
get switched. They agreed to switch me back to AT&amp;T immediately at no cost.
They also told me not to pay for any of the calls billed by MCI after the date
was supposed to have been switched to AT&amp;T.  Risk number three: Transactions
are not verifiable, and are repeated.

A month later, our April bill arrived, and all of the LD charges were billed
by...you guessed...MCI. We called NET who informed us MCI had pulled the same
trick: apparently not many people take them up on their offer to switch back
after a month. NET told us not to pay the LD charges (so we ended up getting
the free LD service after all :-) and switched us BACK to AT&amp;T. About this time
I started getting entreating letters and phone calls from BOTH AT&amp;T and MCI
begging me to get back on their service. I was very short with MCI, and had to
try very hard to convince that AT&amp;T telemarketers that I really was on AT&amp;T and
they weren't going to pick up a commission on me. Risk number four:
telemarketing databases that seem out-of-date with customer records.

When our May bill arrived, our LD calls were billed by MCI. This time NET
assured us that we really were on AT&amp;T and they would look into it.  They told
us to pay the bill (over my protestations). The 700 number told us we were on
AT&amp;T.

Our June bill was also billed by MCI, and this time we managed to talk to
someone at NET who took an intellectual interest in what was happening, and
tracked things down. Apparently, NET had us correctly connected to AT&amp;T's LD
network, and everytime we called, the technicians would check the configuration
on our number and see that we had already been changed to AT&amp;T and do nothing.
The billing system, however, had failed to notify AT&amp;T that we were back on
their network, and had also failed to notify MCI that we were off of their
network. Moreover, NET's billing system actually thought we were on MCI.

Our July bill correctly showed us on AT&amp;T for the latter part of the month.

Question: does this mean that NET generates the billing data for LD calls
dialed, rather than the company that is actually carrying those calls??

System designers will need much more understanding of diversity (not the PC
kind) as computer based systems go into widespread use.  The somewhat
intolerant comments regarding user inability to understand obvious systems are
indications of design flaws.  There are some people who are stupid, and others
who have learned to use feigned stupidity as a negotiating mechanism, but most
of these problems are related to different personality traits.

As a basic, I recommend that anyone working with such systems really learn
about how different people can be.  The Hermann Brain dominance profile
(left-right brain) and the Myers-Briggs profiles are two important ways to
discuss some aspects of differences.  There are also many other more discipline
specific analyses of such things as human behavior under stress, etc.  Reading
the literature is a start, but the organized training courses are very
important.  Take one if possible.  You may learn a lot about how differently
react and how differently they want to be treated.

One of the classic examples is between the analytic left-brained engineer who
insisted on a detailed theoretical training method.  His customers were
physically oriented lower-left brain sensor types.  They wanted someone to take
them to the machine, literally hold their hands, have them push the buttons,
and directly experience the machine.  The engineer felt that this would be a
very demeaning experience, while they thought the lecturing was worthless and
insulting.  A simple personality difference.

Also, don't forget the impact of age, illness, stress, and the like on
behavior.  Now that more of us have grey hairs you see more computers that are
usable by bifocal wearers.    Rob Horn

Here is a press release from the U.S. Justice Department.
 
 California Woman Convicted in Income Tax Refund Scheme
 To: National Desk, California Correspondent
 Contact: U.S. Department of Justice, 202-514-2007
 
   FRESNO, Calif., Aug. 18 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Acting Assistant Attorney General
James A. Bruton and the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of
California, George L. O'Connell, announced Monday, Aug. 17, that Enedina Ochoa
of Turlock, Calif., 26, was convicted by a federal jury on Friday, Aug. 14, of
one count of conspiracy to defraud the government and 20 counts of assisting
others in filing false income tax refund claims with the Internal Revenue
Service.
   The jury trial lasted four days before United States District Judge Oliver
W. Wanger.  Wanger ordered Ochoa held in custody pending sentencing.  Ochoa's
scheme exploited the Internal Revenue Service's newly implemented electronic
filing system, which allows filers of refund claims to receive their refund
checks in one or two days.  By causing large numbers of false refund claims to
be electronically filed, Ochoa and her co-conspirator, Karleena Pulido,
fraudulently obtained approximately $100,000 from the Internal Revenue Service.
Most of the criminal activity involved 1991 federal income tax returns filed
earlier this year.
   Ochoa and Pulido, a Turlock income tax preparer who pled guilty two weeks
ago to conspiracy to defraud the government and 29 counts of assisting others
in filing false claims for income tax refunds, engaged in a scheme to
electronically file false refund claims with the I.R.S. by recruiting
individuals to provide their real names and social security numbers for use by
Pulido on false Forms W-2 which Pulido fabricated.  Ochoa then assisted the
recruited individuals in electronically filing these false refund claims with
the I.R.S. from electronic return transmitters such as Cash-N-Dash, an income
tax transmittal and check cashing service headquartered in Fresno.  Ochoa and
Pulido then divided divided the refund proceeds among themselves and the
individuals they recruited.
   The long-standing I.R.S. system of filing paper returns requires a taxpayer
to wait several weeks before receiving a refund check.
   Ochoa and Pulido face a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment and a
fine of $250,000 for the conspiracy convictions and five years imprisonment for
each conviction of assisting in the filing of a false claim.  Sentencing is set
for Oct. 19, and Oct. 26, for Pulido and Ochoa, respectively, before Wanger.
   The case is the result of an extensive and ongoing investigation of
electronic filing fraud by special agents of the Internal Revenue Service's
Criminal Investigation Division, and was prosecuted by Department of Justice
Tax Division Trial Attorneys Eric C. Lisann and Floyd J. Miller.  It is the
first prosecution of this type of crime in this judicial district, and is one
of only a very few such cases that have gone to trial anywhere in the United
States since the inception of the Internal Revenue Service's electronic filing
system.
   Acting Assistant Attorney General James Bruton stated, "This conviction
serves as notice that the federal government is committed to early detection
and prosecution of electronic filing schemes.  Blatant abuse of the Internal
Revenue Service's computerized refund program will not be tolerated."
According to Rick Speier, chief of the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal
Investigation Division in San Jose and Fresno, "as the use of electronic filing
increases, the Internal Revenue Service will continue to be vigilant in
identifying electronic filing schemes organized by unscrupulous individuals who
seek to exploit the system for criminal purposes."

The Santa Monica, CA Municipal Pier has recently added new "high-tech" public
restrooms that are discriminatory about to whom they will dispense water.  Like
many of the new breed of restrooms increasingly found in airports, both the
urinals and the washbasins have an infrared proximity sensor which turns the
water on and off for you; there's no need to ever touch a control.

A nine-year-old who was with me stood in front of a washbasin I had just used,
and got mad when the faucet wouldn't turn on for him.  Nothing he tried,
including covering the sensor with his hand, would work.  Only after I
suggested jumping up and down and waving his hands above his head did the
faucet finally acknowledge that a human was there and grant the public
resource, and then promptly quit a few seconds later when his hands moved down
to be washed.

I know the problem of people leaving conventional faucets running unattended is
ancient, and that many solutions have been tried in the past to combat it; such
as the mechanical push button which will let the water run for anywhere from 1
to 15 seconds, depending on the maintenance history.  I see in this new
electronic twist to an old problem two new RISKS, one of which is rather
serious:

1) Discrimination against short people.  This being a public area, it is
reasonable to expect children.  (It's doubtful that any health epidemic might
result from this; after all most kids don't wash their hands and don't prepare
food in eating establishments.)

2) I saw no manual overrides for the controls; I assume that if a power failure
were to occur (as a result of a natural disaster; not difficult to imagine in
California) it would also cut off the water delivery, a crucial resource during
such times.  Often during a disaster the electricity is the first thing to go
out, while the water flow is much more reliable.  This new solution
unnecessarily couples the two while providing no perceivable advantages over
the older mechanical methods, exacerbating worst-case scenarios.

(This gets added to my ever-expanding list encompassing electronic tire
pressure gages, electronic carpenter's level, computerized office building
directories, microprocessor-based wire strippers, etc. for having no advantages
over the prior art but catastrophically fail when the batteries die.)

Last night NBC broadcast an episode of "Secret Service" in NY at least that
featured a straightforwards nut who wants to kill the President plot and then
a rather confusing account of their high technology defense of a fuzzy city
power system against sabotage by a fired employee.  

I hope someone taped it and caught the exact wording of the disclaimer at the
end because it was hard to follow the logic and determine what was the original
incident and what was Hollywoodisms.   

The piece was prefaced with a brief discussion some of the risks of power
outages.

The expert quickly diagnosed the problem as a VIRUS.  Persistent references to
virus in the context of a electric power control system seemed odd. Since they
appeared to be running pre-existing VIRUS checking software on the system one
might suspect the "main frame" was an IBM PC or Apple Macintosh running
standard software rather than a real tiem control system or perhaps something
larger and safer. Interesting references were made to viruses lurking WITHIN
modems.  Then they identified the source of the attacking codes as the local
font storage in what appeared to be a old DECwriter dot matric printer.  

With some external clues the agents attempt to confront the criminal in house,
which is wired with many falling metal screen, sounds effects, and gas but
which lacks reinfored walls.  The culprit is classic middle aged computer geek
who appears uncaring about possible loss of life although the agents do not
mention to him the risk of a life sentence of death penalty of others die as a
result of his sabotage.  He refuses to help them disarm the problem.

The expert has announced that this is a logic bomb and eventually realizes that
since the bug code is not in the copy of the system on disk as long as they
shutdown without writing memory to disk they can reboot bug free.  So a brief
deliberate blackout is used to save the city.

I am obvious very curious about the TRUE FACTs of this can if the show plans to
show such other SS triumphs in the war on electronic crime as almost destroying
Steve Jackson Games.

I have been doing exhaustive tests on Novell Netware protection, and I cannot
believe these people can sell their product on the basis that it is the most
secure.  If it is, we are in big trouble!!

"Read Only" files are successfully infected by DOS viruses!
"Directory protection" works exactly the opposite of how the manual claims!
		IN 3 DIFFERENT PLACES!!!
Several protection bits work from a MacIntosh, but not from DOS machines!!
	What kind of network protection doesn't work when the user uses a
	different machine to login?!?  Protection based in the user's machine
	and not on the server!!!  

A shareware product successfully gathers passwords from the net as they are
	entered by the users!  For $35 I can get every password on your network
	(if I choose to pay the shareware licensing fees to be honest about it)
Passwords can be ANYTHING - including nothing at all!  The supervisor password
        on our network is empty, so anyone on the net can login with no password
	(we are physically isolated - but how about some password controls!)
So-called Execute Only protection does not prevent companion viruses from
	working, and prevents the sys admin from verifying program integrity,
	prevents backup and restore of execute-only files, and thus is a great
	hindrance to protection!  

This was the results of the first 2 DAYS of experiments!  If we can find this
many problems in 2 days (while not explicitly trying to look for these kinds of
holes), I can't imagine anyone claiming this system to be the best available
security.  But who knows?  In the next few days we will be looking at Unix
based servers!  FC

Joe Konstan reports that CALL TRACE would pick up the identity of the
individual responsible for making the harassing telephone calls even if RETURN
CALL did not.  He notes that "the switch does know who placed the call..."
However, this assumes that the switch itself (which is computer software, after
all) is operating properly, and isn't the cause of the problem.  Even assuming
no "bug" in the switch, there is always the (very real) danger that the switch
can be compromised by unauthorized users (insiders or "hackers").  What this
teaches us is that, as computerized systems become more vulnerable to attack
and compromise, their reliability is compromised.

As a lawyer and former (computer crime) prosecutor, I can assure you that
computerized information is *routinely* accepted as reliable and frequently
forms the basis for criminal prosecutions and convictions.  Telephone toll
records, credit card records, bank statements and the like are admitted into
evidence as "business records" without even a fleeting inquiry into the manner
in which they were created.  For the most part, Courts "assume" that these
records are reliable.  While computerized summaries and computer generated
reports (created for litigation) are subject to greater scrutiny, they all
suffer from the MEGO effect (My Eyes Glaze Over).  If I can't understand it, it
must be right.

Generally, there is little harm to this.  For the most part, computer generated
records are reliable, and are relied upon in the ordinary course of business
transactions.  Indeed, they are frequently more reliable than the "paper"
records they replaced and which were routinely accepted.  However, the public
must be ever vigilant against the possibility of alterations,
misinterpretations, and simple errors in these records -- they are not always
what they seem.

&gt;From the 18/08/1992 issue of the "Independent" (a "quality" English
newspaper.) All transcription mistooks are, of course, my own.

    Hackers pinpoint card weaknesses (John Eisenhammer --- Bonn)

    Barclays Bank executives in Germany were forced to admit
    yesterday that young hackers had made a fool of their credit
    card computer system.

    According to Hans-Hermann Schra"der, the official responsible for
    the Protection of Information regulations in the state of
    Hamburg, where the "crime" took place, the bank's computer
    security was "totally unsatisfactory".

    For the past few months, a group of youths in Hamburg have been
    drawing out information about individual Visa and Eurocard
    owners, including their credit ratings, in order to show how
    easily such allegedly confidential information can be used.

    Even worse for the bank, which has been running a massive
    advertising campaign in Germany for its offer of both main
    credit cards for the price of one, officials still cannot tell
    from the voice-mail computer records that anything was amiss. It
    was only after hearing tapes on television, with client voices
    on them, that Barclays officials conceded that all was not as it
    should be.

    The special voice-mail computer was used by clients confirming
    that they had received their cards, at which point they provided
    their personal numbers, and by those requesting a credit limit
    increase. The information was recorded, not on normal tape but
    digitally by a computer, and the information was later decoded
    by bank staff. According to Rolf Wo"rdemann, a member of
    Germany's main hacker organisation, the Hamburg Chaos Computer
    Club, voice-mail computers such as the one at Barclays are as
    "easy to break as a bicycle lock".

    Rather than prosecute Barclays officials are hoping that the
    hackers will be willing to co-operate, so that the bank can find
    out just how bad things are, and who needs new credit cards, The
    fact that the enterprising youths also managed, once they had
    accessed Barclays' computer system, to make lengthy
    international telephone calls at the bank's expense, will be
    quietly forgotten.

I found this especially amusing since Barclays officials have recently
been appeared on national news in the UK expounding the infallibility of
cash-card machines. I find the automatic assumption the computer cannot
be fouling up exceptionally irritating. The thought of having to give
personal numbers over the phone is also a bit of a worry (to me anyway
--- but then I'm paranoid :-)

I also dislike the idea that the bank is having to ask the hackers how
they did it. Shouldn't they have the expertise to find holes as
apparently large as exist in the system (then again if they had the
expertise, the holes wouldn't be there.) The "hackers" in the article,
while not exactly represented as heros, are definitely not painted as
villains either. I'm not so sure.

Oh well, another Infallible-Banking-Computer-System (tm) bites the dust!

   This year, I started serving as a registrar for my precinct.  Our county
started using computerized tallying machines this year, and everyone had to go
through required training to learn how to use them.  During the training
meeting, I asked what would happen if a machine should completely fail.  I was
assured that this "probably" would never happen.  I could swear that some of
the sample tallying machines in the back were snickering after this remark.
   If there is a blackout to the machines, then voters are supposed to put
their ballots into a special slot just for such emergencies.  It is assumed
that the electricity will come on again later during the day.  (What if the
power goes out 10 minutes before closing?)  After the polls close, the
registrar and judges are then supposed to open the special slot and send the
ballots through the reader.  Ballots cannot be read twice because the machine
marks them as they go through.
   The machines worked fine during the primary, but during the runoff, in which
very few people voted, my machine had a memory error just a few minutes before
closing.  There was nothing that could be done except send another machine out
to me.  We only had 21 people vote the entire day (!), so we could have counted
it by hand, but the elections board wouldn't allow it!
   What if there had been several memory failures during the day?  Would there
be enough backup machines to handle it?  What a mess!  And why are we so
reliant on machines that we cannot allow humans to do something that we can do
just as quickly?

According to a report from Vesselin Bontchev who just returned from his summer
vacation in Bulgaria, Macintoshs are becoming quite popular in Bulgaria.
Recently, an Apple distributor began to distribute Macs which many Bulgarians
found superior to their PC clones and began to like. We strongly hope that this
may not attract the interest of the well-known virus authors in Bulgaria and
subsequently in other Eastern European countries.

Everyone gets credit card "pre-approval" offers in the mail, but this last one
started me wondering.  First off, it was addressed to "Jeffery L. Beckmann,"
with my correct address, down to a zip +4 code.  My name is Beckman, not
Beckmann (two n's), and my name is Jane G., not Jeffery L.  And we won't even
go into the way that my gender has gotten switched.  So, how did Mr. Beckmann
get associated with MY address in whomever's database?

Just for grins, to see what sort of gold Mastercard he was being offered, I
read the thing.  It had a $10,000 credit line, and NO ONE, repeat, no one, has
*ever* offered Beckman, Jane G. a card with that kind of credit line.  Weirder
still, to get the card, you were *required* to take out a cash advance of a
minimum of $2000, up to the $10,000 limit of the card.  After much searching
through fine print, I found the card was offered by an institution called
"First Deposit."  Then I found the weirdest part---the terms would only be sent
to you when you sent for your pre-approved cash advance and activated the Gold
Card.  In short, it could be 50% annual interest, starting to accrue from the
time they send you your "advance," and you wouldn't even know it until you had
taken the plunge.  Even the form was strange---just a signature line and a
phone number are to be provided.  Normally, these forms ask for independent
confirmation of credit---the usual questions about your obligations, etc., even
if they are theoretically "pre-approved" (which is actually a misnomer).

Several things occur to me.  I could sign Jeffery Beckmann up, collect his cash
advance, and skip town, if I were that sort.  Who would be responsible?  The
mysterious Mr. Beckmann, who may not exist?  For that matter, what if Jeffery
Beckmann's obligations and credit history get mixed up with mine, since his
address is obviously already mixed up?  And speaking of, HOW did this mystery
person get HIS name associated with MY address, aside from a totally
superficial resemblence between last names, his not even being spelled the same
as mine?  What if Mr. Beckmann is an international representative of a drug
cartel, and now has his address linked to mine?  Will my house suddenly be of
interest to some unknown authorities, who are doing computer traces of his

it determine that Mr. Beckmann was able to qualify for such a hefty cash

====================================================

August 11, 1992

Representative Jack Brooks
Chairman
House Judiciary Committee
2138 Rayburn House Office Bldg.
Washington, DC 20515-6216

Dear Mr. Chairman:

     Earlier this year, you held hearings before the Subcommittee on Economic
and Commercial Law on the threat of foreign economic espionage to U.S.
corporations.  Among the issues raised during the hearings were the future of
computer security authority and the efforts of government agencies to restrict
the use of new technologies, such as cryptography.

     As a national organization of computer professionals interested in the
policies surrounding civil liberties and privacy, including computer security
and cryptography, CPSR supports your efforts to encourage public dialogue of
these matters.  Particularly as the United States becomes more dependent on
advanced network technologies, such as cellular communications, the long-term
impact of proposed restrictions on privacy-enhancing techniques should be
carefully explored in a public forum.

     When we had the opportunity to testify before the Subcommittee on
Legislation and National Security in May 1989 on the enforcement of the
Computer Security Act of 1987, we raised a number of these issues.  We write to
you now to provide new information about the role of the National Security
Agency in the development of the Digital Signature Standard and the recent
National Security Directive on computer security authority.  The information
that we have gathered suggests that further hearings are necessary to assess
the activities of the National Security Agency since passage of the Computer
Security Act of 1987.

The National Security Agency and the Digital Signature Standard

     Through the Freedom of Information Act, CPSR has recently learned that the
NSA was the driving force behind the selection and development of the Digital
Signature Standard (DSS).  We believe that the NSA's actions contravene the
Computer Security Act of 1987.  We have also determined that the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) attempted to shield the NSA's role
in the development of the DSS from public scrutiny.

     The Digital Signature Standard will be used for the authentication of
computer messages that travel across the public computer network.  Its
development was closely watched in the computer science community.  Questions
about the factors leading to the selection of the standard were raised by a
Federal Register notice, 56 Fed. Reg. 42, (Aug 30, 1991), in which NIST
indicated that it had considered the impact of the proposed standard on
"national security and law enforcement," though there was no apparent reason
why these factors might be considered in the development of a technical
standard for communications security.

     In August 1991, CPSR filed a FOIA request with the National Institute of
Standards and Technology seeking all documentation relating to the development
of the DSS.  NIST denied our request in its entirety.  The agency did not
indicate that they had responsive documents from the National Security Agency
in their files, as they were required to do under their own regulations.  15
C.F.R. Sec. 4.6(a)(4) (1992).  In October 1991, we filed a similar request for
documents concerning the development of the DSS with the Department of Defense.
The Department replied that they were forwarding the request to the NSA, from
whom we never received even an acknowledgement of our request.

     In April 1992, CPSR filed suit against NIST to force disclosure of the
documents.  CPSR v. NIST, et al., Civil Action No. 92-0972-RCL (D.D.C.).  As a
result of that lawsuit, NIST released 140 out of a total of 142 pages.  Among
those documents is a memo from Roy Saltman to Lynn McNulty which suggests that
there were better algorithms available than the one NIST eventually recommended
for adoption. If that is so, why did NIST recommend a standard that its own
expert believed was inferior?

     Further, NIST was required under Section 2 of the Computer Security Act to
develop standards and guidelines to "assure the cost-effective security and
privacy of sensitive information in federal systems."  However, the algorithm
selected by NIST as the DSS was purposely designed to minimize privacy
protection: its use is limited to message authentication.  Other algorithms
that were considered by NIST included both the ability to authenticate messages
and the capability to incorporate privacy-enhancing features.  Was NSA's
interest in communication surveillance one of the factors that lead to the NIST
decision to select an algorithm that was useful for authentication, but not for
communications privacy?

     Most significantly, NIST also disclosed that 1,138 pages on the DSS that
were created by the NSA were in their files and were being sent back to the NSA
for processing.  Note that only 142 pages of material were identified as
originating with NIST.  In addition, it appears that the patent for the DSS is
filed in the name of an NSA contractor.
 
     The events surrounding the development of the Digital Signature Standard
warrant further Congressional investigation.  When Congress passed the Computer
Security Act, it sought to return authority for technical standard-setting to
the civilian sector.  It explicitly rejected the proposition that NSA should
have authority for developing technical guidelines:

     Since work on technical standards represents virtually 
     all of the research effort being done today, NSA would 
     take over virtually the entire computer standards job 
     from the [National Institute of Standards and 
     Technology].  By putting the NSA in charge of developing 
     technical security guidelines (software, hardware, 
     communications), [NIST] would be left with the 
     responsibility for only administrative and physical 
     security measures -- which have generally been done 
     years ago.  [NIST], in effect, would on the surface be 
     given the responsibility for the computer standards 
     program with little to say about the most important part 
     of the program -- the technical guidelines developed by 
     NSA.
 
Government Operation Committee Report at 25-26, reprinted in 1988 U.S.  Code
Cong. and Admin. News at 3177-78.  See also Science Committee Report at 27,
reprinted in 1988 U.S.C.A.N. 3142.

     Despite the clear mandate of the Computer Security Act, NSA does, indeed,
appear to have assumed the lead role in the development of the DSS.  In a
letter to MacWeek magazine last fall, NSA's Chief of Information Policy
acknowledged that the Agency "evaluated and provided candidate algorithms
including the one ultimately selected by NIST."  Letter from Michael S. Conn to
Mitch Ratcliffe, Oct. 31, 1991.  By its own admission, NSA not only urged the
adoption of the DSS -- it actually "provided" the standard to NIST.

     The development of the DSS is the first real test of the effectiveness of
the Computer Security Act.  If, as appears to be the case, NSA was able to
develop the standard without regard to recommendations of NIST, then the intent
of the Act has clearly been undermined.

     Congress' intent that the standard-setting process be open to public
scrutiny has also been frustrated.  Given the role of NSA in developing the
DSS, and NIST's refusal to open the process to meaningful public scrutiny, the
public's ability to monitor the effectiveness of the Computer Security Act has
been called into question.

     On a related point, we should note that the National Security Agency also
exercised its influence in the development of an important standard for the
digital cellular standards committee.  NSA's influence was clear in two areas.
First, the NSA ensured that the privacy features of the proposed standard would
be kept secret.  This effectively prevents public review of the standard and is
contrary to principles of scientific research.
 
The NSA was also responsible for promoting the development of a standard that
is less robust than other standards that might have been selected.  This is
particularly problematic as our country becomes increasingly dependent on
cellular telephone services for routine business and personal communication.

     Considering the recent experience with the DSS and the digital cellular
standard, we can anticipate that future NSA involvement in the technical
standards field will produce two results: (1) diminished privacy protection for
users of new communications technologies, and (2) restrictions on public access
to information about the selection of technical standards.  The first result
will have severe consequences for the security of our advanced communications
infrastructure.  The second result will restrict our ability to recognize this
problem.

     However, these problems were anticipated when Congress first considered
the possible impact of President Reagan's National Security Decision Directive
on computer security authority, and chose to develop legislation to promote
privacy and security and to reverse efforts to limit public accountability.


National Security Directive 42

      Congressional enactment of the Computer Security Act was a response to
President Reagan's issuance of National Security Decision Directive ("NSDD")
145 in September 1984.  It was intended to reverse an executive policy that
enlarged classification authority and permitted the intelligence community
broad say over the development of technical security standards for unclassified
government and non-government computer systems and networks.  As noted in the
committee report, the original NSDD 145 gave the intelligence community new
authority to set technical standards in the private sector:

     [u]nder this directive, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
     was given broad new powers to issue policies and 
     standards for the safeguarding of not only classified 
     information, but also other information in the civilian 
     agencies and private sector which DOD believed should be 
     protected.  The National Security Agency (NSA), whose 
     primary mission is one of monitoring foreign 
     communications, was given the responsibility of 
     managing this program on a day-to-day basis.

H. Rep. No. 153 (Part 2), 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 6 (1987).  The legislation was
specifically intended to override the Presidential directive and to "greatly
restrict these types of activities by the military intelligence agencies ...
while at the same time providing a statutory mandate for a strong security
program headed up by [NIST], a civilian agency."  Id. at 7.

    President Bush issued National Security Directive ("NSD") 42 on July 5,
1990.  On July 10, 1990, Assistant Secretary of Defense Duane P. Andrews
testified before the House Subcommittee on Transportation, Aviation, and
Materials on the contents of the revised NSD.  The Assistant Secretary stated
that the "the new policy is fully compliant with the Computer Security Act of
1987 (and the Warner Amendment) and clearly delineates the responsibilities
within the Federal Government for national security systems."

     On August 27, 1990, CPSR wrote to the Directorate for Freedom of
Information of the Department of Defense and requested a copy of the revised
NSD, which had been described by an administration official at the July hearing
but had not actually been disclosed to the public.  CPSR subsequently sent a
request to the National Security Council seeking the same document.  When both
agencies failed to reply in a timely fashion, CPSR filed suit seeking
disclosure of the Directive. CPSR v. NSC, et al., Civil Action No. 91-0013-TPJ
(D.D.C.).

     The Directive, which purports to rescind NSDD 145, was recently disclosed
as a result of this litigation CPSR initiated against the National Security
Council.

     The text of the Directive raises several questions concerning the
Administration's compliance with the Computer Security Act:

     1. The new NSD 42 grants NSA broad authority over "national security
systems."  This phrase is not defined in the Computer Security Act and raises
questions given the expansive interpretation of "national security"
historically employed by the military and intelligence agencies and the broad
scope that such a term might have when applied to computer systems within the
federal government.

     If national security now includes international economic activity, as
several witnesses at your hearings suggested, does NSD 42 now grant NSA
computer security authority in the economic realm?  Such a result would clearly
contravene congressional intent and eviscerate the distinction between civilian
and "national security" computer systems.

     More critically, the term "national security systems" is used throughout
the document to provide the Director of the National Security Agency with broad
new authority to set technical standards.  Section 7 of NSD 42 states that the
Director of the NSA, as "National Manager for National Security
Telecommunications and Information Systems Security," shall

     * * *

     c. Conduct, *approve*, or endorse research and 
     development of techniques and equipment to secure 
     national security systems.

     d. Review and *approve* all standards, techniques, 
     systems, and equipment, related to the security of 
     national security systems.

     * * *

     h. Operate a central technical center to evaluate and 
     *certify* the security of national security 
     telecommunications and information systems.

(Emphasis added)

     Given the recent concern about the role of the National Security Agency in
the development of the Digital Signature Standard, it is our belief that any
standard-setting authority created by NSD 42 should require the most careful
public review.

     2. NSD 42 appears to grant the NSA new authority for information security.
This is a new area for the agency; NSA's role has historically been limited to
communications security.  Section 4 of the directive provides as follows:

     The National Security Council/Policy Coordinating 
     Committee (PCC) for National Security Telecommuni-
     cations, chaired by the Department of Defense, under the 
     authority of National Security Directives 1 and 10, 
     assumed the responsibility for the National Security 
     Telecommunications NSDD 97 Steering Group.  By 
     authority of this directive, the PCC for National Security 
     Telecommunications is renamed the PCC for National 
     Security Telecommunications and Information Systems, 
     and shall expand its authority to include the 
     responsibilities to protect the government's national 
     security telecommunications and information systems.

(Emphasis added).

     Thus, by its own terms, NSD 42 "expands" DOD's authority to include
"information systems."  What is the significance of this new authority?  Will
it result in military control of systems previously deemed to be civilian?

     3. NSD 42 appears to consolidate NSTISSC (The National Security
Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Committee) authority for
both computer security policy and computer security budget determinations.

     According to section 7 of the revised directive, the National Manager 
for NSTISSC shall:

     j. Review and assess annually the national security 
     telecommunications systems security programs and 
     budgets of Executive department and agencies of the U.S. 
     Government, and recommend alternatives, where 
     appropriate, for the Executive Agent.

     NTISSC has never been given budget review authority for federal agencies.
This is a power, in the executive branch, that properly resides in the Office
of Management and Budget.  There is an additional concern that Congress's
ability to monitor the activities of federal agencies may be significantly
curtailed if this NTISSC, an entity created by presidential directive, is
permitted to review agency budgets in the name of national security.

     4. NSD 42 appears to weaken the oversight mechanism established by the
Computer Security Act.  Under the Act, a Computer Systems Security and Privacy
Advisory Board was established to identify emerging issues, to inform the
Secretary of Commerce, and to report findings to the Congressional Oversight
Committees.  Sec. 3, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 278g-4(b).

     However, according to NSD 42, NSTISSC is established "to consider
technical matters and develop operating policies, procedures, guidelines,
instructions, and standards as necessary to implement provisions of this
Directive."  What is the impact of NSTISSC authority under NSD 42 on the review
authority of the Computer Systems Security and Privacy Advisory Board created
by the Computer Security Act?

Conclusion

     Five years after passage of the Computer Security Act, questions remain
about the extent of military involvement in civilian and private sector
computer security.  The acknowledged role of the National Security Agency in
the development of the proposed Digital Signature Standard appears to violate
the congressional intent that NIST, and not NSA, be responsible for developing
security standards for civilian agencies.  The DSS experience suggests that one
of the costs of permitting technical standard setting by the Department of
Defense is a reduction in communications privacy for the public.  The recently
released NSD 42 appears to expands DOD's security authority in direct
contravention of the intent of the Computer Security Act, again raising
questions as to the role of the military in the nation's communications
network.

     There are also questions that should be pursued regarding the National
Security Agency's compliance with the Freedom of Information Act.  Given the
NSA's increasing presence in the civilian computing world, it is simply
unacceptable that it should continue to hide its activities behind a veil of
secrecy.  As an agency of the federal government, the NSA remains accountable
to the public for its activities.

     We commend you for opening a public discussion of these important issues
and look forward to additional hearings that might address the questions we
have raised.
                                            Sincerely,
                                            Marc Rotenberg, Director
                                            CPSR Washington Office

The Gazette in Cedar Rapids reported on Fri Aug. 21, 1992 that:

"Spurious radio signals may again be the culprit in an automatic shutdown of
the Palo nuclear power plant" The shutdown occurred on Monday. The Gazette also
reported that "A similar incident occurred in June 1989."  They believe a
security guard walking by a control panel with his walkie-talkie caused the
control panel to trigger a shutdown.

I am glad that it did not tell the system to pull the control rods.  Why think
about microwave ovens being turned on via radio signals when you can talk about
nuclear plants being effected by radio signals.

"Thousands of pounds in poll tax arrears are being left uncollected because of
a "design fault" in ICL's Comcis software package.  Cash-stricken London
councils, including Lambeth and Southwark, have had to delay debt collection

and not the single sum given by Comcis, which, as the market leader, is used by
about 400 councils.
   ... Bob Hoskins, head of IT at Southwark commented "Instead of sending out
1,500 summonses per week, we're limited to issuing only 1,000 because of the

Computer weekly, Thursday 6 Aug, 1992.

"A financial fiasco involving the loss of 5.5m pounds of taxpayer's money has
prompted the CCTA, Whitehall's computer adviser, to toughen its contracts with
suppliers. ...  Last year the roads service of the Dept. of the Environment for
Northern Ireland found that although it had paid services company SD-Scicon
5.5m pounds for an IBM 3090 mainframe and software, it did not own the system,
and was legally not entitled to use it.
  The anomaly came to light following a legal dispute between users and
SD-Scicon in which solicitors said ownership of the system did not pass to the
department until it had been accepted and paid for in full.
  SD-Scicon's development was never completed and the system did not undergo
acceptance tests, but users in Northern Ireland had paid SD-Scicon 5.5m pounds
for the first phases of work - money which was completely wasted.
  A Northern Ireland Audit Office report says users had to pay SD-Scicon a
further 1.8m pounds on top of the 5.5m pounds to enable the department to own
the IBM mainframe they had already paid for.  But the IBM software was later
scrapped.  The department said this week it has now devised a new computing
strategy to minimise risk."

A most interesting story.  Sell a contract based on hardware and software,
don't complete the software and charge extra for use of the hardware the
customer had already bought !!

Scientists cry foul over NASA security raid at Ames
By Michelle Levander, Mercury News Staff Writer

A security raid that one scientist likened to a "KGB attack" at NASA/Ames
Research Center two weeks ago has pitted scientists who depend on the free
international exchange of ideas against government bureaucrats afraid of losing
economically valuable technology.

On the weekend of July 31, a security force from NASA headquarters in
Washington, D.C., descended on research facilities at Ames in Mountain View,
changing locks, sending scientists home without explanations, searching through
papers on desks and reading people's electronic mail and computer files.  The
security team, sent by NASA's new administrator, Daniel Goldin, then
interrogated some of the most distinguished experts in the country in
aeronautics research and temporarily denied about 10 researchers access to
offices and computer files.

Harvey Lomax, chief of the Computational Fluid Dynamics Branch at NASA/Ames,
said the search -- conducted by men without badges who sent people home or
interrogated them without any explanation -- violated the university-like
atmosphere he tries to create among his staff.  Lomax said he understood the
need need to protect security, but, he said, in his 48 years at Ames, "I have
never seen an instance of such insulting contempt."

The NASA search was aimed at reviewing the center's handling of classified
material and to "review our safeguarding of technologies that are important to
national competitiveness," NASA/ Ames director Dale Compton said in a letter to
employees this week.  Compton apologized in an open letter to NASA scientists
for an event that "disrupted" a work culture that "promotes an open exchange of
scientific information."

A center spokesman said he knew of no specific incident or security breach that
prompted the search but said it was legal for the government to search
employees' desks and files.

Now that fears of Cold War enemies have died down, government officials are try
to prevent information-sharing between government scientists and their
colleagues in other countries that compete with ours.  But some critics say
such policies could isolate the U.S. scientific community and stymie basic
scientific research normally conducted in the international community.  [...]

NASA/Ames scientists said they have also recently face increasingly tight
restrictions on what information they can share with others and often have to
submit work to a government official in Washington for approval.  Scientists
agree that some research shouldn't be shared but complain that Washington
bureaucrats can't tell the difference between basic research and a sensitive
technology transfer.

In a meeting with staff this week, Compton said top NASA officials were
concerned that ideas on fluid dynamics or other topics could end up in the
hands of aerospace or auto companies abroad rather than U.S. firms.  "He said
we are funded by the United States and one of our missions is to do basic
research for industry and not give a competitive edge to others," said one
scientist at a meeting held by Compton on the raid.

One irony apparently unnoticed by search team investigators, however, was that
while they were taking action against staffers who sent computer transmissions
of information abroad, scientists from Germany, France, Spain, Israel and Japan
were working on Ames computers and sharing research ideas with their U.S.
counterparts as the invited guests of the research center.
 
The theoretical research done at Ames often involves international
collaboration.  In fact a good deal of the center's research is published in a
British journal.

The research units apparently targeted by the search use supercomputers to
solve complex equations governing how a fluid moves, which scientists said is
far removed from immediate practical applications.  In such theoretical
research, involving a single equation can take as much as 500 hours of
supercomputer time.

   [The article also notes allegations of racism from the Asian-American
   Pacific Islander Advisory Group at Ames, and strong denials from Ames.  PGN]

Well, it's worse than I thought it would be.  Unix experiments through last
night showed that viruses succeeded in infecting files that didn't have read or
write access.  I could even run programs with no read, write, or execute
privileges!  It seems that the Unix networking allows far more than the access
controls permit to the local Unix user.  Directory protection seemed to work
right, but then, I was able to load and execute files from directories with
only Execute permission - not a good sign.

I got a lot of mail about the last posting.  I don't think I'm a moron, and if
someone can break Novell in 2 days, I don't think the situation gets better by
spending more time.  Novell version 3.11 - I used the default installation with
no 3rd party software - I do know the difference between file attributes and
directory rights, and the inheritence does indeed work the opposite of the way
the manual describes it.  I am replacing the renowned virus marketing expert
John McAfee at the Vbull conference - first speaker on the first day - I think.
Full details of the experiments will be published at that conference, and after
we get some more experiments done, I hope to submit to Computers and Security.
Perhaps some of you should read the paper before making assumptions and calling
me names.  In anticipation of more questions about Unix, System V3.2 with Sun's
PC/NFS on the PCs.  Default installation - I still don't think I'm a moron - No
I haven't tried setting the file system to Read-Only, I am only looking at how
an average network might be installed by an average administrator, not at how
the world's leading expert on Novell might do it after spending a year to get
it right.  Want to repeat the experiment?  I think the paper provides adequate
documentation to allow a thorough repetition, and we repeated the test with
independent people watching to make sure we weren't doing something wrong.  By
the way, the peron installing the Novell has done a number of commercial
installations before, and to claim that they know nothing about how to make
Novell safe is confirmation of the fact that it is hard to understand the way
inheritance, rights, and attributes work together, and that many Novell
installations may be unsafe.  I doubt if any legitimate and knowledgeable
people from Novell will disagree with my findings once they come to the
conference and/or read the paper.

	Which brings me to one last point.  I got a lot of complaints, but only
one person wanted to perform similar experiments to confirm our results.  There
is a big risk associated with unconfirmed (or refuted) results.  I don't
believe all I read either, but if I really want to know, I repeat the
experiment or ask for more details.

In Risk Forum Vol.13, Nr.74, Adrian Howard summarizes a report in UKs (quality)
newspaper Independent about a hacker attack on Barlays (Hamburg) Credit Card
Service. The original article to report the fact (which was also mentioned in
German TV, 1st channel, on Sunday August 16, 1992) appeared in the weekly
magazine "Der SPIEGEL" (also regarded as quality press product) which had
issued a press release on Sunday (marketing).

Having been asked on Sunday (immediately after returning from a sailing trip)
for some comment (for another publication), I preferred to analysed the case
myself in more detail. My findings regarding the facts are less spectacular
(though some information holes may never be filled), but now I understand why
"Der SPIEGEL" blew up this story (see background).

The facts: Barclays Credit Card Service offers advice via a published
130-number (tool-free, equivalent to 800 in USA). During non-office hours, to
record questions and messages of customers, Barclays has a computerized
telephone call recorder, using a Meridian system of Northern Telecom.
          
Incoming calls are recorded on the system's store in sequential 
order. According to "Der SPIEGEL", messages of the following kind
were recorded:
   message #3 (date/time recorded): person NN1 asks to increase the
credit limit from 3.5 kDM to 8 kDM;
   message #7 (date/time recorded): person NN2 reports that his new
card with given number and account had arrived.
          
The Meridian system enables remote invocation of the stored invocation of the
stored information, as many telephone call recorders do.  In this case, a
special combination of telephone keys plus a 3-digit code enables to listen to
the recorded voice mail from any telephone (but using the same technique which
hand-held devices for remote operation of telephone recorders use).

According to Der SPIEGEL, "888" was used as secret code; Barclays responsible
manager (a marketing expert) denied that but admitted that only a 3-digit key
was used.

Der SPIEGEL describes the potential misuse of credit cards in some detail.
Indeed, knowledge of credit card numbers, accounts and expiration dates allow
misuse in telephone trade etc.

Analysis: A1)Without doubt, Meridian is computerized equipment which moreover
can be directly connected to work stations and mainframes for automatic
processing. Barclays regarded this as "merely a telephone recorder" even when I
spoke to them (they argued that this is not a Computer Security problem so I
should not be interested!)  Unfortunately, as no personal data files in the
normal sense are stored, the German national and the Hamburg state Data
Protection legislation do not apply; therefore, Hamburg Data Protection
ombudsman Dr.Schrader's reaction ("unresponsible") behaviour as mentioned by
Adrian Howard was not justified by legal evidence.

       A2) As the Meridian system allows for significantly longer
authentication code (at least 6 digits, while Barclays used only 3), and as the
feature to automatically enforce a new code after a given period was not used
by Barclays, they used the digital message recorder not in the safe way which
the nature of the customer information deserved. Only after the journalist's
recherche, they are now reconsidering this problem.

       A3) The responsible manager said that NO connection to their mainframe
was installed. After some discussion with him and some contradicting
information, some doubts remain. He told me that a major revision of the
system's use is underway (and that his experts do not have time to answer my
few questions) but when merely used as telephone recorder, improvements are
easy and fast to install (as Northern Telecom specialists worked there).

In the SPIEGEL report, there is no evidence for a break-in into Barclays
mainframe but their denial to allow me to see the system with several,
partially contradicting reasons given at times leaves some doubt (background: I
supervise the largest European backup center for banks, insurances etc, with a
300 MIpS/1.0 TByte machine and inspect large computer centers on a regular
basis).

       A4) In the last part of SPIEGEL's article, there are several references
to Kimble's case (see my corresponding report in July) who demonstrated a new
phreaking technique to the German economic monthly "CAPITAL" (and a German TV
station). Presently, some research "from a Cologne as well as from a
Californian security advisory enterprise" are underway, according to Der
SPIEGEL, and in these cases, "computer kids .. received significant
honoraries".  There is indeed evidence that competing hacker and phreak groups
(esp. Kimble with CAPITAL versus Chaos Club which was cited as information
source by Der SPIEGEL) seem to entertain a showdown for honoraries.  Kimble, in
several (paid) interviews, made some negative comments on Chaos Club. As CCC
explicitly (citations) and implicitly (some undocumented role in the phreak
action) is connected with this case, it is not improbable (to be cautious) that
this phreak attack was one reaction to the Kimble case. It is interesting to
remember that several Hamburg journalists (then at a TV station, one of which
works since some time for SPIEGEL) first reported Chaos Club's NASA and KGB
activities.

Summary: The report of SPIEGEL (and those derived from it) concerned a phreak 
         attack on a digital telephone recorder; the presentation of the facts 
         and esp. implications for a bank computer attack were inadequate. 
         The attacked bank demonstrated a shockingly insufficient knowledge of 
         security demands and procedures related to a new digitized service.

Update of Barclay Hamburg Credit Card Service's Voice Mail insecurity:

The evident contradiction between Meridian Mail's minimum keynumber length
(4..16 digits) and the fact that a 3-digit code was used found a surprising
explanation: Northern Telecom requires for the US/Canada product *at least 4
digits code*, whereas the German version was reduced to require *at least 3
digits*. This has possibly to do with the fact that most European customers
have smaller telephone systems with less than 999 lines connected. After this
incident, Northern Telecom Europe decided to improve European applications to
US/Canada standards, requiring 4..16 Bytes. Moreover, they will put more
emphasis on enfording regular changes of keynumbers.

According to Northern Telecom experts, Barclay connected a WYSE terminal for
service purposes via RS 232 port; the general software needed to connect the
Meridian Mail system to another computer (sw Meridian Link) was not installed,
said NT officials. This implies that the surprisingly long time needed for
security improvement (more than one week of several experts, including NT
personnel) was needed to upgrade the knowledge of the "experts". As security
improvements are really simple (about 1 hour), serious doubts remain (even
assuming maximum incompetence of Barclay Hamburg "experts").

The Hamburg Data Protection Ombudsman presently examines the case; he assumes
that the digitized system has a file of personal data which entries may be
individually retrieved, such that Data Protection laws apply. There is some
doubt that the legal definition may apply to a flat file of characters without
any ordering structure and no retrieval functions available in the system.

I discovered a situation very similar to the Barclays voice-mail incident,
right here in the US.

Sometime a couple years ago my roommate received a letter from a company called
TeleCredit regarding his Visa charge card that was issued to him by a small
local bank.  Apparently, TeleCredit was contracted by the small local bank to
handle the issuing and billing matters of the credit cards that the local bank
was offering.

The letter requested that my roommate call a 800 number and with a touch-tone
phone enter a certain extension and leave his account number and name and a
short statement that they did receive their card in a recording.  I found this
very interesting and gave their voice-mail system a call.

Since I am a hacker, I instinctively pressed the # key followed by the voice
mail box number to enter the mail box, and found to my surprise that there was
no password protecting the messages people were leaving!  I wasn't as surprised
as others might be since as a seasoned hacker I knew this kind of situation was
all too common.

For [a?] month I called the voice mail box and listened to about 30 messages a
day of people leaving their names and credit card numbers and SSN numbers and
daytime phone numbers.  Unlike the letter, the greeting to the voice mail box
requested they leave such info.  Being inside the voice mail box could have
even allowed me to change the greeting to ask for other sensitive info, and
common folks not knowing any better would have left it with no hesitation.  Of
course, I did no such thing.  If I were malicious, I might even change the
password and TeleCredit, not knowing how to set a password, would have taken a
few weeks to figure out how to change it back and thus would have a major
interruption in their card accounting procedure.

I suspect a similar thing happened with the CCC and Barclays, and all Barclays
need do is read their voice mail system manuals.  No need to hire CCC to come
in and explain it for them.  All CCC has to say is rtm (read the [...]
manual).  I wonder if I had broken my little discovery to the press it would
have become the media circus the CCC is always striving for.  I can see the
headlines now: "Hacker Cracks Credit Card Database; Privacy of Thousands of
Accounts In His Hands!"

Luckily, TeleCredit wised up after about six months and has apparently
discontinued the practice of having customers report their account numbers to a
voice mail-box, for the mail-box was discontinued.  However, other less
sensitive mailboxes still lie wide open.

I still have recordings on tape of the messages people were leaving on that
TeleCredit mailbox that I forgot about, the Barclay article made me remember
that I had still had them.

An article in the July 1992 Siam News by Robert Skeel contains more information
on the Patriot missile bug.  Apparently the program contained representations of
.1 as both 24-bit and 48-bit fixed point binary numbers.  If either had been
used consistently there would have been no problem.  However using both proved
disastrous as it introduced errors of the form (.1d-.1e)*t (where .1d is the
48 bit representation, .1e is the 24 bit representation and t is the time
elapsed since the clock was zeroed).  I got the impression that the software
was written in a pretty slipshod way.

             COMPUTER NETWORKS AND SOCIAL NETWORKS
                IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (GG 792)

Prof. Sheldon Annis                      Fall 1992
Geography Department                     Thursday, 3:30-6:30

Computer networks, such as the Internet, are beginning to penetrate Eastern
Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa, Asia, and Latin
America.  As a result, students at BU have access to vast new information
resources and can now communicate electronically with researchers around the
world.  This course explores the implications of this new connectivity and
teaches students to use these powerful new research tools.

Substantively, the course examines how new information and network technology
is affecting people in developing countries.  The evolution of networks, their
political and economic consequences, and issues in informatics policy will be
discussed.  Case material will be drawn from Central America, the Philippines,
and Africa.  Special attention will be paid to World Bank lending in developing
countries.  Computer networks, GIS, and satellite communication technology
(e.g., VitaSat and SatelLife) will be explored.

Students will learn to use networks based on Internet, BITNET, UUCP, and
Fidonet technology.  (Fidonet is especially important in Africa.)  Students can
expect to access a wide variety of overseas networks, and should be able to
contact researchers in most countries.  They will learn basic skills such as
the exchange of e-mail, conferencing, and FTP (electronic transfer of
documents), as well more advanced skills such as remote searching of library
catalogs, use of electronic data bases, access to electronic journals, use of
newsgroups, and interactive ("real-time") conversation over the Internet.  They
will also be introduced to a highly advanced generation of new software --
sometimes called "knowledge robots", or "knowbots" -- which can search for
information _across and through_ vast, decentralized networks (also called
Wide-Area Information Servers).

_Prerequisites and limitations_: This course is intended for graduate students
with well-developed research interest in developing countries _or_ students
with strong technical backgrounds who want to explore the applications of
network technology.  Some knowledge of computers is assumed, though not
necessarily of networks.  Limited to 15 students.

_Texts_: _Zen and the Art of the Internet_ by Brendan P. Kehoe, and readings on
developing countries.

Note:  this course is not yet listed in the current _Schedule of
Classes_, but it _is_ being offered.

According to the AP, a ``Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System'',
designed to prevent mid-air collisions, apparently malfunctioned and nearly
caused one.  Two planes, a 767 and a DC-9, were separated by 1,000 feet of
altitude, in accordance with FAA regulations.  But the TACAS system told the
pilot of the 767 to descend to the DC-9's altitude.  The horizontal separation
of the planes was only .5 miles, rather than the 5 miles required.

                         TOPEX/POSEIDON STATUS REPORT
                               August 28, 1992

     The TOPEX spacecraft went into safemode at 18:13Z on August 27.  The
project reports that during a planned maneuver that they received a "roll
momentum wheel saturated" alarm causing the spacecraft to go into safemode and
causing the project to abort the maneuver after 98% completion.  The project
has elected to remain with TDRS support for the time being.  The project has
not declared a spacecraft emergency.  The cause of the safemode is currently
under investigation.

                  TOPEX/POSEIDON STATUS REPORT
                         August 28, 1992

          The TOPEX/Poseidon satellite entered into safe hold
mode on Aug. 27, 1992 at approximately 11:13 a.m. PDT.  This
incident occurred during the inclination maneuver about 6 seconds
from the end of the propulsion burn.

          The inclination maneuver was successful and placed the
satellite in the proper 66 degree inclination toward the Earth.

          Project managers have determined that the safe hold
mode was the result of a "bug" in the software code which set the
failure detection correction limit for a roll angle of 3 degrees,
not 7 degrees as intended.  This was a result of residual LANDSAT
code which did not correlate to the program design language.

          All satellite hardware is functioning properly based on
detailed review of the maneuver playback data.  Reconfiguration
of the satellite back to the standard configuration prior to safe
hold mode is in process at this time and is expected to be
completed tonight.

          The solar array was offset to -55 degrees at 12:45 p.m.
PDT today prior to the start of occultation.  This was done so as
to not overcharge the batteries when the Sun hits the solar array
after coming from eclipse.

          Since the inclination maneuver goals were achieved, the
flight team is proceeding with the nominal maneuver campaign.
There are four more maneuvers to go.  In-Plane Maneuver One is
planned for Wednesday, Sept. 2, 1992.

          The NASA radar altimeter was turned off when the
satellite entered the safe hold mode.  It will be turned back on
about 6:30 p.m. PDT tonight.  Initial data from the NASA
altimeter prior to the incident looked very good.

                       HUBBLE STATUS REPORT
                         August 31, 1992

HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE (HST): HST operations have returned to normal following
the recent safehold entry and recovery. Starting on July 30, a chain of events
caused HST first to enter an inertial hold safemode followed by a hardware
sunpoint safemode.  The first was caused by an incorrect ephemeris table that
was loaded into the spacecraft computer, and the latter by a problem with an
onboard computer software macro. Science observations that were scheduled for
execution during the safemode events are being rescheduled. HST launched April
24, 1990 aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery.

From the Asbury Park Press, August 30, 1992:

  A malfunction in the computer that opens and closes the Route 37 bridge
  rendered the span impassable for an hour yesterday afternoon, backing up
  traffic for miles in each direction.

  Dover police Sgt. Vincent Pedalino said officers were forced to reroute
  traffic north to the Mantoloking Bridge on Route 528 while state Department
  of Transportation workers found a way to repair the computer.

  The bridge was closed between 2:30 and 3:30 p.m., stranding many motorists on
  the bridge in the hot afternoon sun.

  Pedalino said the drawbridge structure itself -- which opens upward to allow
  water traffic through in Barnegat Bay -- was unimpaired, but the automobile
  barriers wouldn't reopen.  Normally there are manual controls that override
  the computer system, but they also were not working, he said.

The bridge is a long span from the Toms River area to the barrier resort
of Seaside Heights and the popular Island Beach.  The Mantoloking Bridge
is the nearest other exit from the barrier peninsula, about 10 kilometers
north.

The story does not tell what was wrong with the computer or the manual
controls.  I wonder whether those "manual" controls would work during a power
failure!

An article by O. Casey Corr, The Seattle Times Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business
News, 20 Aug 1992, describes the case of Mel Creamer, coordinator of a software
system for mainframe computers used in Olympia, Washington, by the Department
of Social and Health Services.  He was doing a routine check of the system's
performance when the following message showed up:

  "THAT DEVICE DOES NOT EXIST ON STATION DEFINED."

A keystroke-capture watch was set up.  It then was determined that this message
had been triggered by a temporary clerk-typist trying to print something
locally using the access code of another user normally in a different area, and
the system could not interpret the command.  He was trying to print the file of
personal sign-on codes, and had created new accounts and access codes, and had
erased audit trails to remove evidence of the activities.  He clearly had all
the necessary access codes.

The computers contained software for issuing checks and ordering state
services, personnel records for the department's 16,000 employees, arrest
warrants for parking tickets kept for the Department of Licensing, and private
information on individuals and countless companies that did business with the
state.  A computer linked to the one breached by the intruder maintains the
state's budget records.  Malicious misuse of those systems could be quite
damaging.

Timothy M. Lewis was charged by King County for computer trespass in the first
degree, a felony, along with three other people, for misuse dating back to
1987.  The victims, in addition to the state, included Aldus of Seattle,
Asymetrix of Bellevue, and Phonelink Inc. of Bellevue (now Fox Communications).
(This is reportedly something like the 14th such case involving adults since
1988.)

Eugene Raddatz, a data security analyst with DSHS, recalled two previous cases
in the 1980s when state employees got into the computer system and stole money
by having checks written to themselves.  Both people received prison terms, he
said.

For more than a decade I've been a customer of a money-market fund that shall
remain nameless here.  For all that time, they've sent me a statement monthly.
Early on, they returned canceled checks with each statement; some years back
they started batching the checks, returning them only twice a year, to save on
postage.

In recent months, they've started sending me a statement every time there's
activity in my account: every time a check clears, or I make a deposit.  In my
case, that means a minimum of three statements per month, at 27 cents postage
each.  So I called up, endured their voicemail system and a five-minute hold,
and asked the customer-service person what's going on.

It seems they've just "enhanced" (her term) their computer system, and one of
its "features" now is that it kicks out a statement every time there's
activity, whether you want one or not.  I pointed out that this is costing ten
times what they're saving by batching canceled checks, but there's nothing to
be done: that's how the computer works, and it can't be changed ...

An AP story in today's paper (21 Aug 1992) date-lined San Francisco states that
Federal prosecutors sought court orders yesterday to force three local
businesses to turn over their customer lists, sales receipts and shipping
records for indoor "Growing lights" since the start of 1990.  They also want
copies of any correspondence mentioning marijuana.

The three companies--Diamond Lights, General Hydroponics, and Berkeley Indoor
Garden Center--refused to turn over the documents without a court order and are
now fighting the court order on the grounds that the request was too broad and
would violate customer privacy.

&gt;From their names I'd guess these businesses sell lots of "grow-lamps"; the
RISK is that with the increasing use of sales-registers that record customer
identification along with each sale how long until the government starts
investigating people who innocently buy a few of these lamps from the local
K-mart, or any other item that might just possibly be used in some sort of
illegal activity?

There's a known problem with the BSR X-10 home automation system whereby the
"appliance modules" can spontaneously turn themselves on.  This happens with
certain types of loads, particularly electronic loads such as computers and
compact fluorescent lights, and it is due to a misfeature called "local on".
(The X-10 is a carrier current appliance control system widely marketed under
other names, including Radio Shack, Heath and Stanley. The "appliance modules"
are relay boxes that plug into the wall between the AC line and a load to be
controlled.)

The "local-on" feature is intended to allow a user to turn on an appliance
locally, without having to go to the control box. If the appliance is a lamp,
you just flick its regular switch on and off several times, and the appliance
module turns on.

This feature apparently works by trickling a small amount of current through
the load whenever the appliance module relay is 'off' and watching for sudden
voltage swings across the load that would indicate that the user is cycling the
power switch. It works great for simple resistive loads like incandescent
lamps, but nonlinear electronic loads (especially those that directly rectify
and filter the AC power line) will often draw almost no current until some
voltage is reached across the load's internal filter capacitor. Then the load
conducts, discharging the capacitor and causing the input voltage to drop
suddenly. A few cycles of this "relaxation oscillator" simulates a user
flicking a switch well enough to trigger the appliance module's "local on"
feature.

The problem usually occurs right after you switch the load off -- several
seconds later, it comes back on again. But it's possible that the spurious
turn-on could occur much later. This problem drove me crazy until I realized
from the description of "local on" in the manual what was going on. There was
no specific warning about this possibility. Indeed, the manuals take great
pains to point out that "lamp modules" (which contain dimmers) are not to be
used with flourescent lamps and electronic loads; appliance modules should be
used instead. The instructions do warn about controlling appliances that could
cause damage if they were turned on inadvertently (e.g., an empty coffee pot)
but this doesn't really address the issue.

It turns out that cutting an undocumented jumper inside the appliance module
defeats the "local on" misfeature. It's obvious that someone anticipated this
problem since the jumper wasn't essential in the PC board layout, so it's
doubly annoying that there is no mention of this problem or its solution in the
manual.

According to a report that was just on CNN, the problem was that the pilot went
the wrong way, i.e, TCAS told him to go up and he went down.  In the report
(which was surprisingly good) they also mentioned that the controllers hate
TCAS because they lose control and that the pilots love it because they gain
control.  The people interviewed on the report that appeared disturbed by the
incident were controllers so it is difficult to really know how serious it
actually was.

   According to the AP, a ``Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System'',
   designed to prevent mid-air collisions, apparently malfunctioned and nearly
   caused one.  Two planes, a 767 and a DC-9, were separated by 1,000 feet of
   altitude, in accordance with FAA regulations.  But the TACAS system told 
   the pilot of the 767 to descend to the DC-9's altitude.  The horizontal 
   separation of the planes was only .5 miles, rather than the 5 miles required.
	 
This message is incorrect.  There was a good report on CNN, and I also spoke to
a friend at the FAA.  The pilot sighted the other plane visually before the
TCAS alert and mistakenly thought the plane was at the same altitude.  He
descended.  From everything the FAA can determine, TCAS gave a correct advisory
and did not "malfunction."  The pilot says that he does not remember what the
TCAS advisory was but that his maneuver came before the advisory and was based
on his visual sighting.

If you read about TCAS, you need to be aware that it is in the midst of a big
political struggle.  The pilots love it (there was a representative from ALPA
on the CNN report).  The controllers hate it.  According to my friend in the
TCAS office at the FAA, the data released by the controller's union about TCAS
problems and printed in some newspaper reports of this recent incident is just
not correct.  So watch who is speaking when you hear about TCAS and its
problems or advantages.

In case there is anyone who doesn't know, my Ph.D. students (Mats Heimdahl,
Holly Hildreth, Jon Reese, Ruben Ortega, and Clark Turner) and I are working on
a formal system requirements specification of TCAS II.  This will serve as the
official FAA specification of TCAS and also as a testbed application for their
dissertations on safety analysis and risk assessment.

 In the version of the TCAS story I saw locally about the 2 USair jets
near-miss, it mentioned that for the period june -June of the previous year,
over 60% of the warnings/advisements from TCAS systems nationwide have been
erroneous. Many of these have been of the same sort reported -- the system told
two planes that were "safe" to maneuver into an "unsafe" flight path....

The current issue of The New Yorker (7 Sept 1992) has an item in The Talk of
the Town on the Glitch telephone network.  Call 212-228-7514 and get a "glaring
light each week on some dark alley that science is currently leading us down.
In the past several months, Glitch has alerted us to the hazards of computer
technology, the vulnerability of telephone privacy, and the folly of the
high-speed chase."  

I called Janet Pensig, who runs this line.  Her message of the week deals with
polymorphic viruses.  She also notes that The New Yorker fabricated all sorts
of quotes and missed the content of what she was saying.  She is said by the
article to be "deeply pessimistic about the future", which she says on the tape
is not at all what she told them!  I left her a message, and when she called me
back I discovered that she has been faithfully reading the RISKS section of the
ACM Software Engineering Notes, as well as Inside Risks in the CACM.  She is
very serious about what she is doing.  This seems like a wonderful educational
opportunity for new yorkers (lower case to distinguish them from the magazine).

The Talk of the Town writer ended the last paragraph of the item like this:
"We knew that ... we would never know the true face of doom -- so we just
thanked her for her time and told her that we now felt much worse."

Check out Glitch if you wish.  PGN

                   who got to his issue before I got to mine...]

By David Ashenfelter, Detroit Free Press Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

DETROIT--Sept. 1--In the late 1980s, high-tech pranksters got their kicks by
breaking into unprotected computer systems.  Then, they infected computers with
harmful binary viruses. Today, hackers are wreaking havoc on computerized
telephone systems. "It's a big problem and getting worse," said John Haugh, a
Portland, Ore., a telecommunications expert who estimated that hackers are
responsible for about $4 billion a year in toll fraud.  "Once they get inside
the system and get a dial tone, they can make phone calls all over the world,"
Haugh added. "By the time the customer gets his phone bill, the criminals are
long gone."

The Detroit Newspaper Agency (DNA), publisher of the Detroit News and Detroit
Free Press, recently became a victim of one variation of the telescam.  Three
months ago, DNA employees started finding strange messages in the company's
computerized voice mail system. The messages were intended for someone else and
were left by callers who identified themselves as "Black Lightning," "Phantom,"
or "Plastic Man."  What initially appeared to be a glitch in the voice mail
system turned out to be the work of a hacker who broke into the message system
through a dial-in maintenance line, said DNA telecommunications manager Ricardo
Vasquez.  Once inside, the hacker cracked the system administrator's pass code
and set up scores of voice mailboxes for friends and associates who dialed in
on the DNA's toll-free number.

Later, officials at Shell Oil Co. in Houston and Shearson Lehman Bros. in St.
Louis notified Vasquez that their voice mail systems had been penetrated by
hackers who left messages urging their friends to call a mailbox at the DNA.
"We were lucky," Vasquez said. "Our losses amounted to only a few hundred
dollars for calls on our toll-free phone line."  He said the company's losses
would have been far worse had the system been equipped to allow the intruders
to make worldwide long-distance calls on DNA phone lines.  Vasquez said the DNA
does not plan to request a criminal investigation because losses were small.

Officials at Shell Oil and Shearson Lehman declined to comment.  Michigan Bell
security employees referred inquiries to the public relations staff, which, in
turn, referred inquiries to the Tigon Corp., an Ameritech subsidiary in Dallas
which sells and leases voice mail systems.  "It is a growing problem and people
need to be aware of it," said Tigon spokesperson Jill Boeschenstein. "In most
cases, hackers try to get in to have some fun and fool around with the message
system.  "The real expense comes when they're able to make outgoing calls that
the company ends up paying for. That can be a considerable sum before company
realizes what is going on."  Boeschenstein said companies that buy or lease
voice mail systems are responsible for unauthorized usage. She said companies
can protect their phone systems relatively easily by using longer pass codes
and disconnecting maintenance phone lines which enable system administrators to
operate the system from a remote location. Boeschenstein also said companies
should do a more thorough job of monitoring their systems.

Telecommunications expert Haugh, whose company interviewed more than 400
toll-fraud victims or near victims, said the most sinister telephone hackers
break into a phone system and set up hidden mailboxes, then sell them to drug,
prostitution and child pornography rings that want to make free calls that are
hard to trace.

Hackers also market mailboxes to nationwide rings which sell long-distance
phone calls for $10-$30 apiece from pay phones on the streets of large U.S.
cities. Haugh said many of the customers are immigrants who want to call
relatives in their homelands.

A favorite time for hackers to sell phone service is on weekends when companies
aren't using or monitoring their phone systems, some of which are capable of
handling hundreds of long-distance calls simultaneously.  Haugh said one
nationally-known manufacturer which he declined to identify belatedly
discovered that it was on the hook for $1.4 million worth of long distance
calls made on its phone lines in just one weekend.  And after companies are
victimized, they rarely are willing to discuss it publicly.  "They're afraid of
bad publicity or liability and in almost all cases their fears are unfounded,"
Haugh said. "It's a very foolish attitude. Until the problem becomes better
understood, other companies aren't going to do enough to protect their systems
from abuse."

    [The following review was prepared by Donn Parker for distribution to the
    members of the International Information Integrity Institute (known as
    I-4), an organization consisting of something like 60 companies with 
    significant interest in improved computer security and integrity, which 
    is managed by SRI -- with Donn as one of its key players.  This review is 
    reproduced here with his permission, and is authorized for further 
    distribution, with appropriate attribution.  Sneakers opens today to the
    general public, although in a few selected theaters it opened on Wednesday,
    presumably to get early reviews.  (Both Donn and I had been visited by
    Parkes and Lasker regarding security risks, in their preparation for the
    screenplay for WarGames.  They even used some of our ideas.  In general,
    Sneakers seems technologically sounder, and is certainly of interest to
    RISKS readers.  For those of you who don't know Donn, he is often
    referred to as the Great Bald Eagle of Computer Security.)  PGN]

FILM REVIEW OF SNEAKERS
by Donn B. Parker
September 1992

Sneakers (released September 11, 1992 by Universal Studios, owned by Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co. Ltd., and promoted in association with CompuServe,
owned by H&amp;R Block) starring Robert Redford, Dan Aykroyd, Ben Kingsley, Mary
McDonnell, River Phoenix, Sidney Poitier, and David Strathairn; directed by
Phil Alden Robinson (Field of Dreams director); and produced and written by
Walter F. Parkes and Lawrence Lasker (writers and producers of WarGames in
1981).

The new computer crime movie, Sneakers (as in hackers who wear sneakers and
sneak into computers) was previewed in a San Francisco showing sponsored by
Universal Studios and Mondo 2000 Magazine (a slick-cover psychedelic
publication of the Timothy Leary genre appealing to hackers) and attended by a
large segment of the Bay Area hacker community including Cap'n Crunch.  I had
assisted the writers, Messrs. Lasker and Parkes, with their first movie,
Wargames-much to my chagrin because the technology was so distorted.  This time
they had the technical assistance of Len Adleman (the A in RSA Crypto) from
USC and Robert Abbott, an information security consultant of long standing.
This Mission Impossible, PG-rated (only three "God damn"s and almost no sex)
film is mostly technologically believable, unlike Wargames.  We can forgive
them for showing a Cray computer with a terminal displaying Windows 3.1.

All information security professionals should see this film and use it to
promote security awareness.  Some critics may pan it, but it has all the
ingredients for financial success.  It has:

o  great chase and other street action scenes in the 
   beautiful San Francisco Bay Area
o  an interesting but predictable plot
o  the blind technician who finds the bad guys' hideout 
   from sounds heard from the trunk of a car
o  the old technique of the bad guy shooting into the 
   ceiling tiles at his hidden enemy hiding in ceiling duct area
o  three bloodless murders
o  total unconsciousness produced by simple taps on 
   the head followed by immediate concussion-less 
   revival with little visible damage
o  popular stars, Redford, Poitier, Aykroyd, and 
   Kingsley, who look like the oldest hackers in the 
   world (except for me and Cap'n Crunch)
o  great human melodrama with good character 
   development and not too much technical sci-fi stuff
o  the good guy and his girlfriend at the mercy of the 
   bad guy in the grand finale
o  cryptography very well explained and used for a 
   general audience
o  the proverbial spinning computer tape drive, and 
o  as usual with Lasker and Parkes, a moral at the end.

Universal has uniquely teamed up with CompuServe and CompUSA computer stores to
promote the movie.  A chat board has been set up to fire questions about the
movie at Mr. Robinson, the director, who has been using CompuServe for 8
years.  Anagram and secret password games can be played, with prizes including
trips to Hollywood and Robert Redford's jacket worn in the film.  The film is
sure to be a big hit in Europe and Japan as well as in the United States and
should appeal to the juvenile hacker culture throughout the world.

One unbelievable item is the skimpy $175,000 accepted by Redford's security
penetration (read "tiger team") consulting company for a record-breaking
information security project.  Redford's team plus all the high-priced
technical equipment were worth much more than that.  They had to steal the
universal decryption black box-the Maltese Falcon of the movie-and then steal
it again from the bad guys posing as NSA types who steal it from Redford.
There is a neat shoulder-surfing password pickup by video recording.  There are
hacker antics such as a transfer of President Nixon's net worth to the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), credit record and
license plate registration privacy invasions, trashing of the NSA, CIA, and
FBI, and liberal-politics slams at President Bush and the Republican Party
well-timed for the upcoming national elections.  However, this is all tolerable
since it is done by Redford's character and his team who all have serious
criminal and other highly unethical practices in their backgrounds.

A tiger team attack on a client bank that has relatively good security is
excessively elaborate and would have left the bank guard in a good position to
sue his employer for aggravated assault and mental anguish.  We will probably
have to assure our company management people that we don't do things like
that-but the time to justify your budget and staff is soon after they see this
movie.

The film ends with the rather patronizing and simplistic advice that whoever
controls the information, controls the world.  Just the straightforward action
and technology without all the liberal politics and moralizing would have made
it even better.

You and your teenage children and your computer users and management should all
see and enjoy this much-to-be-talked-about film.

Early on Saturday (5th Sept) morning in Auckland, New Zealand, Paul Gordon
Edward White, 26, a computer broker, was found in a crashed car by the Auckland
harbour bridge; he died shortly afterwards.  A police investigation into the
accident began.  But last night (Tuesday) the Police Minister, John Banks,
asked police to begin high priority investigations into allegations that his
death may not have been accidental.

White had purchased $525 of surplus office and computer equipment from Citibank
in Auckland.  Accidentally included with the equipment were around 90 computer
disks.  TV3 reported the disks contained details overseas bank accounts of some
politicians and of some companies laundering money overseas.  White is
understood to have offered to sell the material back to the bank for $50,000.
In an out-of-court settlement on Friday, Citibank paid White $15,000 cash for
the return of all outstanding information in his control.  The suitcase in
which White had the money was found in the car along with his body, but the
money was missing.

White's lawyer, Mark Blomkamp told TV3 that someone may well have considered
the information on the disks serious enough to kill for.  Asked if it was
possible that because the money was not in White's briefcase in his crashed car
the accident could have been invoked, Blomkamp said: "You might well think that
but I couldn't possibly comment".

Radio NZ last night quoted an unidentified source saying that White's car was
not as badly damaged as could be expected from an impact with a concrete
pillar.  The front of the car was significantly damaged by the 5.15am crash on
the Fanshawe St, city side, approach to the harbour bridge, but the dashboard
and steering wheel were not and there was no blood in the vehicle.

Bits and pieces ..
* Neighbours reported White's home in Birkenhead had been broken
  into several times and that he had met Tauranga MP Winston
  Peters (who is a member of the current government and several
  months ago alleged government links with big business and corruption).
* In one of three earlier burglaries, White was attacked as he
  returned home one night.
* White reported that in July he had been approached by people
  who identified themselves as members of the Security Intelligence
  Service, wanting to discuss the Citibank information.  After the
  meeting, White told an acquaintance that the supposed SIS agents
  had warned him that the police were about to search his property.
  The search took place two days later.  (NZSIS is NZ's approximate
  equivalent to the US's CIA.)
* On Friday, White celebrated at the Centra hotel in Auckland, he
  then left with a man and a woman (who have since been interviewed)
  at 10pm and went to the Regent Hotel for a meal.  After that he
  went to a nightclub and left about 4am.  What happened between
  then and 5.15am when he was found is unclear.
* Citibank is the New Zealand subsidiary of one of the largest
  banks in the United States, Citicorp.  It operates as a clearing
  bank and provides a range of non-retail banking services.
* The Ambulance service received "two or three" emergency calls from
  mobile phones -- it is not known who made the calls, or whether
  they witnessed the car crash.  White died shortly after the ambulance
  arrived.

Note: I recently posted a similar note to misc.legal.computing; I suspect the
      problem is common enough to enlist the help of the RISKS community.

An attorney acquaintance has a number of clients who have been picked up and
detained for various lengths of time, on the basis of warrants, later shown to
be incorrect. Reasons range from sloppy administrative work (clerical errors,
name confusions), to accumulated delays in the record-keeping process.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Police officers in the US need a few things in order to take a person into
custody ("arrest" them): chief among them is probable cause to believe that
they have committed a crime. The fact that an arrest warrant exists is in
itself probable cause. In practice, one can be taken into custody if the
arresting officer believes that a warrant exists--and someone on the radio
telling him that "the computer" shows an outstanding warrant is reason enough.

Problems occur in areas where numerous law enforcement agencies overlap, i.e.,
most urban areas in the US. Although there is normally a regional database of
warrant information, any agency can keep a database of warrants its own
officers have issued. Should a judge order a warrant killed ("quashed" is the
legalism), and should the kill order not be properly accomplished, the stage is
set: person leaves courtroom relieved, goes about his business, is stopped some
months (or years) later, officer checks central database, finds warrant
information, calls warrant-issuing police department, which checks **its**
warrant database. Conclusion: you are under arrest. There follows a collection
of more or less unpleasant and inconvenient experiences (e.g., a weekend in the
county lockup).

My question: is there an archive of these, or similar, occurrences on the net?
Is there a model of how the problem should be solved, perhaps in Jurisdiction
X?

I should mention that the attorney is presently suing the government units
involved, in federal district court in Chicago.

Thanks for all help.

Sigh. It's like no one reads comp.risks :-(.

The "Tagespiegel" announced this morning that the Berlin Fire Department has
been having terrible trouble with it's new dispatching system. Seems they went
on line after just a few "tests" (no running the system in parallel to the old
one) because they now have to take care of the whole city and not just West
Berlin. They are having problems with fire-trucks being listed more than once,
phantom fire trucks, disappearing fire-trucks and messages, and the wrong
trucks being alerted. Seems the data entry people or the algorithm for finding
the closest fire station (or both) are not working, and trucks are being called
from far away, or they are alerted and then not told where to go. There have
been cases of it taking 30 minutes to get a fire truck to the scene of a fire.

Not a nice thought when youths are increasingly setting fires to refugee
hostels and such.

The company that installed the program is busy fixing the bugs, the newspaper
assures us, and will have it running soon.  Won't we all sleep better knowing
that it is sure to run when that last bug is gone?!

My institution, Union College, fell victim to a computer problem today: A
Hewlett-Packard machine used to handle registration died, leaving the College
unable to complete freshfolk registration.  Consequently, classes that were
scheduled to start on 9/10 cannot meet until next Tuesday, and an extra day (or
two??) will have to be added to the term calendar to make things work out.  All
faculty received notices marked URGENT that spoke of a 'massive computer
failure.'

I have little data on the failure, other than that it was apparently NOT a
software failure, but a real hardware breakdown.

Now, I suppose that the software and data on that machine are backed up -- but
there's the rub.  What do you do when you only have one piece of HARDWARE?
It's ironic, because most of the campus is hooked up to a 3-machine VAX cluster
-- while Administration runs on the single HP.  Good for security, but bad for
reliability.  Since many of the copiers went down at the same time (yep, in the
midst of syllabusing) I suspect a technological conspiracy...;-)

The lead article in the current issue of "Global Electronics" (issue 115,
August 1992) concerns the pollution of San Francisco Bay by heavy metals
running off from small printed circuit board assembly shops in Silicon Valley.
It traces the problem to the common electronics industry practice of
subcontracting to these small firms rather than doing the dirty work in larger
and safer facilities of its own.  "Global Electronics" is published by the
Pacific Studies Center, 222B View Street, Mountain View CA 94041.  It costs $12
per year (12 issues of four pages each).

&gt;From RISKS 13.78,
   In the version of the TCAS story I saw locally about the 2 USair jets 
   near-miss, it mentioned that for the period june -June of the previous year,
   over 60% of the warnings/advisements from TCAS systems nationwide have been
   erroneous. Many of these have been of the same sort reported -- the system
   told two planes that were "safe" to maneuver into an "unsafe" flight path...

This is totally and completely untrue and is evidence of what I warned about
in my previous message.  Even if you don't have the facts, does anyone 
seriously think that a system with this error rate would be used at all?  
Pilots are just not that stupid or suicidal and neither are those at the FAA..

It is very important that forums such as RISKS do not become sources of
dangerous misinformation.

    [I agree.  I have been somewhat too lenient in recent times, permitting
    material to emerge that is lacking in credibility, scholarship,
    carefulness, etc.  Time to ratchet up the quality again.  But I am very
    much at the mercy of our contributors.  Please observe the masthead
    guidelines.  Thanks.  PGN]

The son of a former employer of mine was met at the door one Saturday morning
by two local police officers, who presented him with a felony arrest warrant
and took him off to jail.  The charges involved were something like passing bad
commercial paper and perhaps interstate flight.  I gather that he was a little
surprised.

It turned out that he had left some money in a checking account in a bank in
another state (Missouri, I think) before moving to his new residence.  After a
while, the service charges ate up the funds in the account and the last charge
"bounced."  The bank treated it as a bad check.  They looked for him for a
while, and then, since bad paper in the state in question is a felony,
regardless of the amount, they passed the info to the local authorities and an
arrest warrant resulted.  (I wonder whether there was any human intervention up
to the point where the judge issued the warrant.)

Apparently there is a pretty good interstate commerce in arrest warrants, and
somehow the out-of-state warrant wound up at the local police station, along
with the "suspect's" current address.  Most stations keep a pile of warrants
that need to be served handy for slow times--like Saturday morning.

It could happen to YOU!

Disclaimer: This story was related to me a few years ago by a former employer.
I believe that the facts as I have stated them are essentially correct, though
the details are no longer clear in my memory.

[From the Dutch national paper "De Volkskrant", September 3, 1992:]

On Saturday morning, August 29, the presses at the local newspaper "De
Gelderlander" went down, causing delivery to be delayed. Many subscribers
called the newspaper at its phone number 650611.  The telephone exchange at the
newspaper got jammed. One of the consequences was, that when people tried to
call the newspaper, often only the last four digits, 0611, came through. Now it
happens that 0611 is the national emergency number in the Netherlands. So the
police was swamped with calls from people, informing about the delivery of
their newspaper, jamming the emergency number. In a reaction, the PTT said that
they would be careful with giving numbers ending in 0611 to large companies.

In light of all the financial problems that get reported I decided to recognize
a firm that made an intelligent decision.  Recently Citizen's Utilities had a
stock split: 3 for 2.  People who use the dividend reinvestment alternative
generally have fractional share balances.  So someone with 0.70 fractional
shares would now have 1.05 shares.  Rather than merge the full shares from the
split with the full share from the fractional share account, they chose to wait
until the next regular quarterly dividend.  At this time the routine processing
shifts full shares.

In the letter accompanying the newly issued shares they called attention to
this and gave the name of the person who could manually issue the extra share
if for some reason you needed that share before the next dividend (about ten
weeks later).  They gave the reason for all this as:

     excessive programming complexity

Considering how few people will need that one share certificate during the next
ten weeks I think they made a good choice by sticking to the regularly used and
reliable procedures, providing a manual override, and informing their owners.

We usually hear about various kinds of mistakes, oversights, and maliciousness.
It is also appropriate to point out things done well.

I was on a jury last week (trial now over so I can talk about it) and part of
the case involved a breath alcohol machine.  We were not shown the machine but
it was described by expert witnesses and we saw its output.  The machine in
question is microprocessor controlled and displays two digits of output - any
other significance is truncated.  To use it the officer first puts a blank card
into a slot and types in the suspect's name and date and time and the like.
The machine prints all this on the card along with the test results.  The test
consists of an air purge, when the machine checks itself for a zero reading;
then the suspect blows; then another air purge and zero check; then another
blow; then a final air purge and zero check and all these results are printed
on the card.  During the blowing a tone sounds to signal that the suspect is
blowing hard enough.

Whatever it is the machine measures, it takes a measurement every 0.6 seconds
and waits for three of these to be the same before treating that as a reading.
Hence as the alcohol concentration in the blow increases the machine is
supposed to wait for a plateau and record the plateau value.  The machine is
supposed to measure and subtract something else to eliminate the effects of
substances such as acetone that were known to throw off earlier model machines.

Supposedly the calibration of the machine is fixed at manufacture; but the
calibration is verified about once a week by the forensic lab which takes care
of it.  There is an alcohol-water solution in a breath simulator attached to
the machine.  The lab dials up using a modem and commands the machine to verify
its calibration.  The machine measures the simulated breath and sends the
measurement and its identification back to the lab, where the information is
kept in their computer and can produce a printed report as needed.  The test
solution is supposed to make the machine read 0.14% +/- 0.01%.

For the machine in question there was a verification a few days before the
crucial test, and another one a few days later.  Both times the machine read
0.15%, which is acceptable.  We saw the results of several other verifications
and this machine usually read 0.15%, although once or twice in the past it had
read 0.13%.  On the test in question the machine had read 0.09% . A blood
alcohol level of 0.08% makes it illegal to drive a car in California.

I convinced myself and the rest of the jury that a blood alcohol level of 0.08%
in the defendant was unproven.  First, when the machine read 0.15% that could
mean anything between 0.1500... and 0.1599...  Second, we were not told any
more about the test solution than that it should produce a reading of 0.14%.  I
know chemists can mix up solutions very accurately, and for good science you
would want to mix the solution as close to 0.14500.. as possible; but we had to
assume the solution could be anywhere between 0.1400...  and 0.1499...  So we
could have a solution at the high end of 0.14 and the machine could be
measuring at the low end of 0.15 and it is measuring pretty close.  Or we could
have a solution at the low end of 0.14 and the machine could be measuring at
the high end of 0.15 and it is off by just under 0.02%.  If errors are additive
offsets then the defendant's blood alcohol could be anywhere between 0.0700...
and 0.0899... and that absolutely fails to prove 0.08% or more.  I used an
analogy at the time that this is like trying to verify the accuracy of a
yardstick by comparing it with another yardstick.

There's an interesting psychological phenomenon that I observed.  There was a
lot of testimony by experts about errors and possible errors in the machine.
Invariably they and the attorneys would add and subtract 0.01 here and 0.02
there from machine readings as if all the errors are additive offsets.  There
was never any testimony as to whether the errors in the machine are really
offsets or proportional to the reading, or completely nonlinear, or anything
else.  Nobody ever mentioned an error of so many per-cent, or suggested that
multiplication be used.  So I conjecture: when people deal with numerical data
where there are only two digits they tend to assume that any adjustments to the
data are to be made by addition and subtraction.  Maybe this phenomenon results
from habit dealing with dollars and cents; or maybe it's just that people are
lazy and addition is easier than multiplication.

Both experts agreed that the readings are affected by the suspect's body
temperature.  I was surprised that the machine doesn't measure and correct for
this, or that the temperature isn't taken and recorded at the time of the test.

If we had not been doubtful of guilt from the above accuracy considerations
alone we would have had to consider the defense expert's suggestion of various
confounding factors, a much more speculative undertaking.  He and his
colleagues have done experiments and published in the field.  They have a few
instances in which the subject got a false high reading by blowing very hard.
This is not fully understood.  He said something about the mucous membranes
drying out and releasing extra alcohol.  He drew a graph showing that the
machine sees a first plateau, at which the reading is good; but then the
alcohol level increases and goes to a second higher plateau and the machine
takes that as its reading instead of the first.  They have also found the
machine will read too high if the suspect is still absorbing ingested alcohol,
which can happen for example if the alcohol was taken with food.  He didn't
offer an explanation for this, but only evidence that it can happen.

There are formulas to predict blood alcohol level based on the amount of
alcohol ingested and the weight of the subject and other factors.  Our
defendant admitted to drinking only one pint of stout with food about 2 hours
before the arrest.  Both experts calculated this was not enough alcohol to get
anywhere near 0.08% blood alcohol.  It was maybe barely enough to get the
machine to read 0.09% with all of the confounding factors such as temperature
and blowing hard and the absorptive-phase phenomenon.  Maybe she drank more
than she admitted; maybe the machine really is that lousy inaccurate; maybe
there are other unconsidered factors leading to errors; we didn't have to go
into that.

Advice to drivers would seem to be: if you are arrested for DUI and believe you
are innocent then don't choose the breath test - it's not very accurate.  If
you think you might barely be guilty then choose the breath test and fight it
in court.

A friend's husband just recently got a shock.  A notice showed up in the mail
that his driver's license was suspended.  He called up the California
Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to find out what was going on.  He had
recently been involved in a dispute involving his auto, so he suspected it
might have something to do with that.

Well, they asked him, didn't you recently plead guilty to a charge of Reckless
Driving?  Yes, he said.  Well, that explains it.  Wait a minute, he said,
explains what?  He said it was his understanding that Reckless Driving was not
something they normally pulled your license for, or he would have fought it.
Oh no, they said, that was for the liquor.  You have a DUI (Driving Under the
Influence).  WHAT? he asked.  Your Reckless Driving in connection with DUI.  At
this point, he knew he had a problem since there was no alcohol involved.

He explained to the woman that the Reckless Driving charge was a plea bargain.
He had been stopped and threatened by a juvenile gang who had blocked his car.
He had stepped on the gas and hit one of them in trying to get out of there.
He was charged with Battery and Assault With a Deadly Weapon (his car) by the
gang member, who pressed charges.  His lawyer had advised him that fighting the
charge, despite circumstances, would be a long and costly battle, especially
since where juveniles were involved, it was possible that the jury would find
against him.  They plea-bargained to a lesser charge of Reckless Driving, and
he was fined $250 and sentenced to do 60 hours of community service work (which
he was doing, anyway).

Fine up until that point.  The woman at the DMV insisted that there was a DUI
on the record.  He explained all of the above, and she asked where the liquor
came into it.  He explained that there was *never* any liquor involved.
Finally, he went down to the office and hassled with the officials there, and
the court records were pulled.  Surprise, no DUI!  It was entered into the
system again, and bingo, a DUI came up.  I suspect that regular RISKS readers
already suspect what the problem was.  The system programming on traffic
offenses was set up so that a count of Reckless Driving *automatically* entered
in a paired count of Driving Under the Influence.  The programmer had made the
assumption that the two counts were so intimately connected that you would
almost *never* have one without the other.  To enter a count of Reckless
Driving without a DUI, you had to manually override it, and the data-entry
clerk was not instructed on this peculiarity, nor was there any flag that
Reckless Driving was paired with DUI.  And a "guilty" on that count was paired
to an automatic license suspension.  The problem of overriding the DUI was
finally resolved, but it took several days and a lot of arguing
hyperventilating on his part.  I would suspect that his is not the first, nor
the last, case where this "automatic conviction" came up.

&gt;... Northern Telecom requires for the US/Canada product *at least 4
&gt;digits code*, whereas the German version was reduced to require *at least 3...

This discussion reminded me of something that I was involved in way back in
1979, which I think is still relevant.  The point to be made is that merely the
number of bytes in the codeword is insufficient protection.  What matters is
the product of the number of different combinations by the amount of time
required to try each one.  (I think this principle applies to other things such
as garage door openers as well, and would love to see someone telling me that
once my garage door opener circuitry has recognized that a code was sent which
was not the right one, it would not respond to any other code (even the right
one) for a period of, perhaps, 15 seconds.)  I could then calculate that if
there were 10,000 possible codes, that an automated attack would take an
average of 20.5 hours, and know how lousy the protection was.)  As it stands
now, I don't really know how secure the system is, and I don't have any idea
how secure the 4-digit or 3-digit codes above are.

The incident in question that I had experience with: note that I was not a part
of the system staff, so parts of the following are 2nd hand information and may
not be completely correct.  This particular mainframe system allowed access to
files based on the entry of a codeword, which could have up to 10 characters,
and it was quite secure even if you used a 5 character password, given the fact
that it would accept input at a maximum of 1200 baud: the average time required
to enter all the codes even with a machine doing your typing was years.  Normal
users were not allowed to access files through programs.  The obvious extension
of allowing a user program to open a file was made, and the risk that a program
could try passwords a lot faster than 1200 baud was noted.  The solution
adopted was to write the file opening code so that it would re-read the disk to
get the password on every attempt: thus, the speed of the disk access limited
the speed at which passwords could be tried, and given agonizingly slow disk
performance, things were still secure.  Unfortunately, at some time later disk
cache software was incorporated into the system which made the system smart
enough that it would not re-read something if it still had it available in
memory.  The result was that the 5 character passwords which had been pretty
secure suddenly became worthless, because even a brute-force program to try all
combinations would run in a few hours.

Bottom line: if you're trying to tell me how secure something is, don't tell me
how many combinations there are on the lock, tell me how long it would take to
try 1/2 of the combinations, and convince me that you have a way to insure that
that time will not decrease as faster and more powerful hardware becomes
available.

Anyone who has not already seen "Sneakers", but would like to, should be
careful to have NOT read <A HREF="/Risks/13.79.html">RISKS-13.79</A>, where a so-called review, right at the
top of the issue, reveals most of the storyline and many of the nicer
"touches", WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A SPOILER WARNING.

   [Donn Parker's review was written for his I-4 audience, consisting largely
   of corporate folks with serious security concerns.  He was undoubtedly
   trying to encourage them to see the movie.  Perhaps that review was less
   suitable for the RISKS audience, so I suppose next time Mark or I will have
   write a review specifically aimed at you all, tantalizing you without 
   revealing any of the plot or technological devices.  There are also lots

The phone number they mention in the movie "Sneakers" is a valid 510 area code
number; it gets you the IRS in the East Bay.  I wonder if this was a glitch.
(Movies usually use the 555 prefix for phone numbers.)  When I told the IRS
person they would probably get lots of phone calls, they did not sound very
happy.

Re: PC board waste in San Francisco Bay (Agre, <A HREF="/Risks/13.79.html">RISKS-13.79</A>),

In a similar vein, this month's (Sept.) issue of Byte has an article on the
"Greening of Computers". It certainly opened my eyes to the various issues
involved when disposing of computer hardware.

I wonder if there would be a call for a newsgroup to discuss these
environmental issues in relation to computers (including, I suppose, research
into the adverse effects of over-exposure to monitor radiation etc.) as against
comp.risks which discusses hardware/software failures and such like.

The group would take into account the more wide-ranging impact of computing on
the environment as a whole, and also discussions of methods of minimising the
harmful effects could take place.

If it already exists, what is it called, if it doesn't would
comp.risks.environmental would be a good name for it? Does this entail a call
for votes to set it up??

Any ideas, takers, or comments???

After someone mentioned problems with incorrect information about outstanding
arrest warrants in police databases, I thought I should mention that the U.S.
Justice Department is awarding state governments grants to improve their
criminal history databases.

The following press release from the U.S. Justice Department is typical of
the announcements it makes when it announces a grant to a state government.

Michigan Awarded Funds to Improve Criminal History Records
 To: Michigan Correspondents
 Contact: Stu Smith of the Office of Justice Programs,
          U.S. Department of Justice,
          202-307-0784 or 301-983-9354 (after hours)

   WASHINGTON, Sept. 9 -- The U.S. Department of Justice has awarded Michigan
$50,000 to continue improving the quality of the state's criminal history
recordkeeping, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) announced today.
   The project, administered by BJS in the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), is
part of a three-year, $27 million Criminal History Record Improvement (CHRI)
program established by the attorney general to help states upgrade current
systems used to maintain records of arrests, prosecutions, convictions and
sentences.  The Bureau of Justice Assistance is providing the funding through
the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program.
   "The major objective of this cooperative agreement is to improve the overall
quality of the state's criminal history record information by improving
disposition reporting," said BJS Director Steven D. Dillingham.  "This
administration is making every effort to assure the highest standards of
accuracy and timeliness in criminal history record information across the
country.  "It is critical that law enforcement officers, prosecutors, judges
and corrections officials have access to complete and accurate information on
each individual within the purview of the criminal justice system," Dillingham
commented.
   The Michigan State Police will use the assistance to identify, retrieve and
enter missing court disposition records and develop an automated court records
system.
   "The program emphasizes the recording of arrest, conviction and sentencing
information in a form that will make felony history information more reliable
and complete," Dillingham commented.  "This is a crucial component of the
overall objective of insuring that state criminal history records are
up-to-date and available to all criminal justice agencies."
   Additional information about this program is available from BJS.
Publications and statistical and research data may be obtained from the
National Criminal Justice Reference Service, Box 6000, Rockville, Md. 20850.

Subject: Bounced cheque libel

SPALDING, England - -In what is being hailed as a landmark decision, a bank
that mistakenly bounced a client's cheques will pay more than 50,000 pounds in
libel damages, a British court has ruled.  The July decision from the High
Court concluded a nine-year legal battle between Brian and Margaret Allen,
operators of a Lincolnshire meat firm, and Llyods Bank.
   The conflict began in 1983 when several cheques from the Allen's company
were returned by the bank unpaid and marked "Refer to drawer, please
re-present," even though there were sufficient funds in the account to cover
them.  The Allen's counsel, Micheal Tugendhat, said that the couple took the
bank to court because they wanted to "eradicate publicly any doubt about their
financial soundness and credit worthiness" created by the error.
  The libel case is believed to be the first of its kind to reach British
courts in this century. Expert Mark Stephens commented that the problem is
common but "very few people, including lawyers, are aware that it amounts to
libel.  The suggestion is that someone issued a cheque knowing he had
insufficient funds to meet it, and that can be a very serious libel.

The New York Times business section for Sun 6 Sep 1992 had an article on
Forensic Animation, using computer graphics reconstructions of events as trial
evidence.  Lawyers seem enthusiastic, because this will entertain the jury.
One (who lost his case) said jury members told him afterwards that they liked
the "cartoons".

There have been challenges to the use of such animations.  In one murder trial,
the defendant said he thought the victim had a raised gun in his hands.  The
prosecution's animation showed a [stick?] figure of the victim walking with
arms down, but the judge only let that segment be shown with the victim
"represented by a gray dot".

A Houston lawyer is quoted as saying that once one side has an animation, the
other side "starts scrambling" to get its own, since "they are so taken with"
the idea.  Thus they don't tend to challenge the animations.


The Sun 13 Sep business section has a short note on computer backups during
Hurricane Andrew at Grand Met's Miami computer center.  These are presented as
quite successful, though I was surprised that this involved spending 8 hours
making tape backups, hiding them while the storm came through, and then flying
them out by helicopter once it had passed.


This issue (13Sep) also has a long article on "intelligent cars", discussing
infrared vision systems for night driving, an "autonomous" cruise control, and
collision avoidance.  These are being investigated by the European Prometheus
project, and the article reports on tests made by Jaguar.

The infrared image would be displayed on a CRT or on a heads-up display on the
windshield.  The new cruise control would attempt to keep two seconds behind
another car.  Developers (at the British firm Lucas Automotive) say they chose
not to give it the ability to apply the brakes fully, so as not to scare
drivers.  But they hope that "once people trust the computers to operate the
various functions on the car for them, they will then allow the computer to do
more for them in the future".

They do seem to be paying attention to the fact that (unlike fighter pilots)
drivers of these cars will not be specially trained: "the average guy must
drive the vehicle".  Thus "company secretaries" have been testing the cars at
Jaguar.

The collision avoidance system is envisioned at the moment as only providing
warnings, not actually interfering with the driver.  It might be able to warn
drivers who are dozing off.

The Europeans hope to have these systems available within 5 or 10 years;
American car companies admit they are a bit behind "because of all the
government subsidizing" in Europe.

There's another risk associated with these new computerized warrant systems, at
least when they're installed in police cars where they can be used by the
drivers.

An exhibit at the San Diego Computer Fair features a police car equipped with a
new MDT (Mobile Data Terminal). They're about a year old, and are now in just
about every marked San Diego police car.  It consists of a specialized keyboard
and display mounted to the right of the driver.  It allows the user to run
license plates and drivers licenses, check for warrants, etc. The system also
allows for routine communications, such as checking in and out of service,
car-to-car chatting, etc.  It can be used for emergency communications such as
ordering ambulances, but the officer said that voice was usually quicker for
such things.  There is, however, a prominent button labeled "EMERGENCY".

The equipment was on a swivel mount so it can be used by anyone in the front
seat. When I saw it, it was turned to the left so the driver could use it.  I
asked the officer demonstrating the system whether there was any official
policy on the driver's use of the terminal while in motion. He said the only
policy so far was to "use the minimum number of keystrokes necessary" while in
motion. And, he added with a wry smile, if you have an accident while using it,
then by definition you've just exceeded the minimum number of keystrokes
necessary.  When I pressed him a little further, he admitted to having had a
few close calls already.

Because the system is so fast and easy to use, the officers run plates with it
much more often than when they had to do it by voice.  So instead of calling in
a request only when they really suspect somebody (e.g., during a stop), they
like to drive around semi-continuously punching in license plate numbers.
Car-to-car chatting also seems to be popular. Although things will probably
improve as the novelty of the system wears off, the safety risk here should be
fairly obvious.

The recent postings on outstanding warrants reminded me of a problem a friend
of mine had about a year ago.  This friend owns several wholesale outlets and
must travel quite often to procure stock.  Because of this frequent travel, he
had a tendency to become "lead-footed" and as a result he had quite a few
speeding tickets.

To make a long story short, a letter from the Roanoke (VA) Police Department
arrived at his house one day while he was out of town on business.  The letter
was addressed to both him and his wife, and since he had not told her he had
been to Roanoke in the last few years, she had to open it.

The letter basically asked them to come to Roanoke and turn themselves in for
hit and run (their van had been seen leaving the accident).  Well, since, she
had not been to Roanoke the mess hit the fan when he got home.  When he finally
calmed her down enough to believe that he had not been to Roanoke, they called
the police.

What they discovered was that, yes there had been a hit and run accident in 
Roanoke, but the only information the eyewitness could give was that the
vehicle was a blue Chevy Astro with license plates AR?-???.  Since this was the
only lead they had, they pulled the DMV records for all the vans that fit this
description and mailed them all a letter.  Because he could provide a ironclad
alibi the matter was dropped at this point.  

But what if he couldn't provide an alibi or what if he had really been in 
Roanoke but still didn't commit hit and run.  I imagine it could have
been pretty ugly - if not with the police at least with his wife!

In RISKS 13.79, James Hanlon mentions the problem of people being detained by
law enforcement officials because of incorrect or outdated arrest warrants.

This apparently is a big problem in California, at least in Southern
California.  In my two years at college in Los Angeles, I knew two people who
were erroneously taken in by the LAPD after being pulled over for routine
traffic violations (speeding, etc).

A fairly common cause for this may be the traffic school system.  In
California, if you get a traffic ticket you can usually go to traffic school
rather than just pleading guilty and paying your fine.  However, if you don't
either go to traffic school or pay your fine, eventually the ticket triggers an
arrest warrant.  My traffic school instructor specifically told us to keep our
traffic school completion certificates in our glove compartments for 7 years or
there was a reasonably good chance that we'd get hauled down to the station
next time we were pulled over for a routine traffic violation.

Greetings.  The phenomenon of "surprise" arrests for "minor" offenses is by no
means a new one, but the masses of computerized records have probably
exacerbated the problem.

A friend of mine tells how about ten years ago when she was staying at her
parent's home, Culver City police showed up unexpectedly at the front door
with an arrest warrant.  (Culver City is small city completely surrounded by
the City of L.A.  Its main claim to fame is the number of film studios,
including MGM, within its borders).  Anyway, they handcuffed this teenager
and led her away.  Great fun for the neighbors watching.

Why?  Turned out she had what they claimed were some unpaid *parking* tickets,
which shouldn't have been charged against her in any case since she was a
resident of the area who was supposed to be "immune" from that ticketing.
The judge they brought her before immediately dismissed them all, but it was
still a very embarrassing episode for her.  There's just no telling what
will pop out of the machines to "roll on" if it's a "slow" day.

The classic treatment of the "computer-induced" nightmare through "minor"
errors must be the humorous (fictional) piece done by "Datamation" in the early
70's.  It shows a trail of correspondence between an unfortunate book club
member and a wide variety of computerized systems, and tells, with tongue held
firmly in cheek, of his unfortunate demise.  (A clue: at the end of the piece,
the governor's order to stop the execution is accidentally misrouted...)
                                                                         Lauren

  ...  (I wonder whether there was any human intervention up
  to the point where the judge issued the warrant.)

How can you imagine there wasn't any?  How did the information get from the
bank to the police?  Did the bank computer take the initiative to dial up the
police computer?  How did the police decide to accept the information as valid
and initiate the warrant process?

  Disclaimer: This story was related to me a few years ago by a former employer.
  I believe that the facts as I have stated them are essentially correct, though
  the details are no longer clear in my memory.

The story has a strong tone of urban legend.  Many crimes involving money have
categories of severity depending on amount.  Given the alleged facts here the
amount in question must have been on the order of $3; perhaps someone with
knowledge of criminal law can indicate if there is in fact any state in which a
crime involving $3 is a felony.  Given that ``looking for him for a while'' had
to involve some human action (even to put him on the ``wanted'' list), there
was some opportunity for sanity checking; no guarantee of course but unlikely
to be missed.

If this happened at all, it's far more likely that some serious sized bad
checks were written (perhaps ordinary oversight) just before leaving the
state, and the combination of events triggered serious action (as it should).
The service charges may also have accumulated, but not caused the problem.

In November (presumably 1991), a Fokker 100, flight 1163 landed on runway 22L
at O'Hare.  Winds were from 240 at 25 kts.  Shortly after landing, they
discovered that the thrust reversers weren't working, but the multi-function
display unit showed no problems.  They then found out that the brakes weren't
working either.  The stick shaker was on.  (A stick shaker literally shakes the
yoke to warn that a stall may be imminent.)  They took the high speed turnoff
onto a taxiway, and then turned back onto runway 22L (going in the other
direction, so it could also be called 4 R), just as a United 737 landed on the
far end of 22L.

Denny Cunningham described it:

"The UAL 737 had already touched down on 22L and was rolling head on toward the
Fokker.  [The Controller] immediately issued a go-around to the next arrival,
then started a persuasive campaign to convince the pilot of the 737 on rollout
that it would be in the best interest of aviation safety to make the highspeed
taxiway without delay.  With the radome of the Fokker starting to fill his
windshield, the 737 pilot concurred in a tone of amazement not usually heard on
ATC frequencies.  He managed to clear the runway a few seconds before the
Fokker flashed by going in the opposite direction.

The Fokker pilot kept one engine running to provide hydraulic power to the
steering.  At the end of 22L, he turned onto runway 27L, which was being used
for take-offs.  The planes which were waiting to takeoff were unable to make
any room for the Fokker on the taxiway.  At this point there were 3 jets
rolling on runway 27L.  The tower said that it looked like Oshkosh for
airliners.  The plane just starting its takeoff roll rushed his takeoff to get
out of the way.  The Fokker finally stopped in the middle of runway 27L, and
was towed off safely.  Noone was hurt, and there was no damage to any of the
airplanes.

It turns out that the "squat" switch which determines if the plane is in the
air had jammed, so the plane "thought" it was in the air, and safety switches
prevented the brakes or thrust reversers from working while the plane was in
the air.

Shortly after this incident, a captain attended school on Fokker 100s and asked
what the appropriate procedure was in the event of malfunctioning ground/flight
switches.  He was told that there wer no such procedures, because it couldn't
happen.

This is excerpted from two articles in "IFR: The Magazine for the Accomplished
Pilot", Vol. 8, number 9 (sept. 92). They were published under the title "EEK!
No Brakes!  Ho Hum, just another day at O'Hare; Two airliners playing chicken
on runway 22L" "Cockpit View" by Joseph J Poset taken from the May issue of
"Airline Pilot", and "From the Tower" by Denny Cunningham.

This incident was not directly caused by a computer.  Switches are used in all
sorts of safety devices, both with and without computers.  The danger from
computers is that they tempt us to add many more such switches, which will
eventually fail.

In case anyone is tempted to say that safety features such as the one which
prevented the brakes from working should be removed, remember that they are
often crucial.  The opposite kind of accident happened on 5 July, 1970 near
Malton Airport in Toronto, where a DC-8 crew accidentally deployed the
aircraft's spoilers in flight, killing all aboard.  The (US) FAA then required
a placard reading "DEPLOYMENT IN FLIGHT PROHIBITED" over the spoiler lever.  A
Canadian official called this ridiculous, and instead proposed a placard
reading "DO NOT CRASH THIS PLANE".  In fact the placard did not prevent a
similar (but non-fatal) accident on 23 June, 1973 at JFK.

So, placards don't work, and we install safety devices to prevent people from
doing stupid things.  Then the safety devices fail and cause crashes.  All one
can do is to try to only add safety devices which help more often than they do
damage, and not panic when a safety device does cause damage.  We know that
will happen, despite all attempts to reduce the frequency.

There have been quite a few articles discussing the privacy aspects (or lack
thereof), based on the US Postal Service's databases - especially the
"forwarding" system.

The following article, from "Labor Notes" (7435 Michigan Avenue, Detroit, Mich.
48210, (313) 842-6262) #160, July 1992, is targeted towards labor issues, but
people reading this Digest will quickly grasp the RISKS involved with
videotaping all postal envelopes.  (see additional comments added at end).

Title: Fighting Privatization.  Postal workers urge campaign to organize the
new, private sector, mailing industry, by Sarah Ryan

Text: If top US Postal Service officials have their way, private corporations
will sort most of the mail by the mid 1990s.  And the jobs will pay little
better than minimum wage.

But some members of the American Postal Workers Union are hoping to block
management's plan with an organizing drive in the private sector mailing
industry.  A resolution will be presented to the August APWU national
convention would, if passed, require the union, which has until now included
only governmentemployees, to begin to organize workers in privately-held
automated mail processing plants.

Over 40,000 postal union jobs have been eliminated in the last two and a half
years, and at least 55,000 more are slated to go by 1995.  While many postal
workers and union officials believe they are losing jobs to "automation,"
postal work is being pushed into the hands of an alternate, privately-owned,
mailing industry.

Management calls the process "worksharing."  Contractors are eager to jump
into mail processing and take advantage of the extremely low wages, absence of
unions, new high-speed mail processing equipment, and public subsidies.

subtitle: Worksharing

A year ago USPS announced that the new Remote Video Encoding operation would be
contracted out.  Remote encoding was developed as a way to sort mail which
cannot be "read" by optical character readers and bar code sorting machines.
RVE also allows mail to be sorted without highly trained workers.

Some mail, such as handwritten letters, cannot now be read by machines.  The
new process will transmit the image of these letters through telephone lines to
a data entry operator at a video terminal.  The worker enters an extract code,
and a bar code is chosen by computer and applied to the letter.  The operator
can be thousands of miles away from the mail.

According to former Postmaster General Anthony Frank, the remote video
operation will eventually replace most to the nation's 49,000 mechanical letter
sorting machine jobs.  Over 200 remote keying sites are planned; the first ones
are already on line.

[the article then goes on to discuss the various financial incentives being
proposed by the USPS -and- local governments for the companies setting up these
remote operations.  It also compares the salaries for the workers.  Other
tidbits in the piece describe some specific labor issues, use of convicts by
the USPS, and the like) 

    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Added comments: No doubt the first few machines will only be used for sorting
and bar-code spraying handwritten addresses.  HOWEVER, given OCR technology, it
would be quite trivial to have EVERY piece of correspondence going through the
USPS scanned, and a data list of who sent what to whom could be generated.

I can't cite the reference this moment, but I'm pretty sure the courts have
ruled that "mail covers" are legal WITHOUT a search warrant.  In other words,
"they" can look at the return addresses on the letters in your mailbox (or the
addresses you send "to") without legal hassles.  (Contents, though, are
protected, a little...)

Seems it may be time to change some laws...

In <A HREF="/Risks/13.80.html">RISKS-13.80</A>, James Zuchelli points out that the movie _Sneakers_ used a real
phone number, that of the East Bay IRS office, instead of the normal 555-xxxx 
used in movies an on TV.  PGN then points out that the phone number will be
more or less useless for the rest of time because people will be watching the
movie on videotape.

On a similar vein, I'm sure lots of the RISKS readers are familiar with Douglas
Adams' _The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy_, in which a phone number appears
and is identified as such early on in the book.  The number is the real phone
number of the flat in London in which Adams lived while writing the radio
series which the book is based on.  An introduction to a later collection of
Adams' books contained an exhortation not to call the number, as the people
currently living there have nothing to do with the book and really wish people
would quit calling them up.

I think this brings up an interesting issue as we move into an era in which
people are identified on the net by their account names and site.  We've all
heard of incidents where one person's credit record gets confused with that
belonging to another person with the same name.  The main student system here
has recycled several account names as older students graduate and new students
with the same name show up, request an account with the now freed name, and
inherit that person's net reputation and hate mail.

    [The following message, although drifting in RISKS-relevance,
    is brought to you as a public service.  Good advice.  PGN]

Advice to (responsible) drivers is: don't drink.  If you are arrested for DUI,
you'll have full confidence in passing any test by a wide enough margin to
avoid worrying about the minor inaccuracies of any machine.

If you know you are guilty, then be thankful that you were stopped before
something serious happened.  The RISKS are to life, limb, and property, not the
passing or failing of a breathalyzer test.

Drivers are tasked with safe driving, not seeing how close they can come to
getting away with anything.

I apologize if this is off the subject of computer risks, but I tried and was
unable to let Jim Haynes' last paragraph go unanswered.

Well, I agree - I druther people didn't drink at all when they drive, and when
I gave that advice it was with misgivings that it might be construed as "how to
beat the test" rather than scientific advice.  I was being a little
tongue-in-cheek when I said take the test and fight the results in court --
meaning only to say the machine isn't infallible.  I was trying to say with a
little bit of humor that you shouldn't risk your future on a breath test when
there are better tests available.

WASHINGTON, DC, September 17, 1992

Contact: 
Marc Rotenberg, CPSR Director (202/544-9240)

David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel (202/544-9240) sobel@washofc.cpsr.org


CPSR Sues FBI For Information About Wiretap Proposal: 
Seeks Reasons for New Plan

	Washington, DC - Computer Professional for Social Responsibility filed
suit today against the FBI for information about a new wiretap proposal.  The
proposal would expand FBI wiretap power and give the Bureau authority to set
technical standards for the computer and communications industry.

	The suit was filed after the FBI failed to make the information public.  
In April, CPSR requested documents from the Bureau about the reasons for the 
proposal. The FBI denied that any information existed.  But when CPSR pursued 
the matter with the Department of Justice, the Bureau conceded that it had 
the information.  Now CPSR is trying to force the Bureau to disclose the 
records.

	The proposal expands the FBI's ability to intercept communications.  It
would mandate that every communication system in the United States have a
built-in "remote monitoring" capability to make wiretap easier. The proposal
covers all communication equipment from office phone systems to advanced
computer networks.  Companies that do not comply face fines of $10,000 per day.

	The proposal is opposed by leading phone companies and computer
manufacturers, including AT&amp;T, IBM, and Digital Equipment Corporation.  Many
charge that the FBI has not been adequately forthcoming about the need for the
legislation.

	According to CPSR Washington Office director Marc Rotenberg, "A full
disclosure of the reasons for this proposal is necessary.  The FBI simply
cannot put forward such a sweeping recommendation, keep important documents
secret, and expect the public to sign off."

	In a related effort, a 1989 CPSR FOIA suit uncovered evidence that the
FBI established procedures to monitor computer bulletin boards in 1982.

	CPSR is a national membership organization of computer professionals
with over 2,500 members based in Palo Alto, California with offices in
Washington, DC and Cambridge, Massachusetts and chapters in over a dozen
metropolitan areas across the nation.  For membership information, please
contact CPSR, P.O. Box 717, Palo Alto, CA 94303, (415) 322-3778,

Here is a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice.
 National Criminal Justice Information Conference in New Orleans
 To: City and Assignment desks
 Contact: Stu Smith of the Office of Justice Programs,
          U.S. Department of Justice, 202-307-0784 or
          301-983-9354 (after hours)

   WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 -- A national conference on federal-state criminal
justice information sharing will be held from Wednesday, Sept. 23, through
Saturday, Sept. 26, in New Orleans, the Department of Justice announced today.
   Jointly sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the Justice
Research and Statistics Association (JRSA), the conference participants will
discuss "Federal and State Information Sharing to Effectively Combat Crime and
Ensure Justice."
   Specific topics that will be aired include "New Measures in the Criminal
Justice System," "'Weed and Seed' and New Drug and Crime Prevention
Initiatives," "Challenges and Reforms to the Justice System in the 90s," "Uses
of Incident-based Reporting Systems," "Recent Developments in Criminal History
Improvements" and various research issues in corrections, prosecution and law
enforcement.  Among the approximately 250 people expected to attend will be
officials from state and local government and various federal agencies as well
as leading criminal justice researchers and scholars.  Other participants will
be the directors of State Statistical Analysis Centers (SACs) and other
members, associate members and guests of JRSA.
   BJS has provided funding to state justice statistics and information systems
through a network of SACs since 1972.  There are currently SACs in 48 states,
the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern
Mariana Islands.  The SACs provide a wealth of data about crime and the
operation of the criminal justice system to state and local governments,
legislatures, and Attorneys General for policy analysis and planning purposes.
   This year is the 20th anniversary of the SAC program.  It also marks the
beginning of a new initiative to establish a truly national system of federal,
state and local government information-sharing and readily accessible data
bases.
   Additional information about BJS programs and publications may be obtained
from the Bureau of Justice Statistics Clearinghouse, Box 6000, Rockville, Md.
20850. The telephone number is 800-732-3277.

I wasn't going to contribute this until I read David Paschich's contribution
(Wed, 16 Sep 1992) concerning potential confusion of users on electronic
networks.

Working within a computer-oriented university department, a lot of internal
work (memos, reminders etc) gets distributed by e-mail.  Such distribution
lists exist for staff, postgraduate students and so on.  This afternoon, a
postgrad. student was surprised to receive complaints from postgraduates at a
neighbouring institution about an e-mail message he had sent for internal
distribution.

What had happened was that an electronic mail address had become truncated and
passed through the smart address matching path.  None of the machines on that
path flagged the address as invalid and the mail was sent on up the chain.
When it reached the other institution, it was distributed to their
postgraduates.

This incident illustrates the potential for embarrassing disclosures,
particularly in view of two results from a recent e-mail survey we carried out:

Q:  Have you sent or received confidential/sensitive information by
    electronic mail ?
    Yes: 75%

Q:  Was the material encrypted or protected in any way ?
    No: 91%

Do you know where your e-mail messages are ?

David Paschich writes in Risks 13.81 about one of the risks of getting account
names mixed up, the fact that you could inherit someone's reputation (good or
bad).

While at University I came across another aspect of this problem. When people
left their accounts were put on tape and deleted. I have a fairly common name
(ask Douglas Adams) and there was someone in the year above me also called
Martin Smith. Account names were normally first name and initial of surname but
their account wasn't called MartinS, presumably because there'd been a name
clash in the past. Thus I was known as MartinS.

I came back from the summer holiday and guess which account had been deleted?

Things then became even more confusing when I went to get my files back. There
was *another* Martin S* (the surname escapes me) just arrived in the new intake
who had already been given my old account name. My account had to be renamed to
MartinSm.

I can't help wondering who got deleted when I left.

The Economist (Aug 15) reports that the National Galleries in both Washington
and London have plans to digitally record images of all their paintings,
because digital images "last for ever".  London hopes to scan their pictures
"repeatedly over time ... to track how their colours change": "Since human
colour memory is poor, and photographs change colour themselves, the only way
to do this is by using a computer."

I have trouble here dealing with image files I created a couple of years ago:
we have new hardware, software, and file formats.  I have all but given up hope
that colors will look similar on the screen, when printed, and when scanned in.
I hope the museums will give careful thought to such problems.

Last time I heard about this incident (Here on comp.risks I believe) it was
told that _both_ "squats" had failed. I.e. there where considerations towards
reliability and safety of the devices.

An interesting question pops up now. Should these devices be wired in an "and"
or in an "or" fashion? I guess that it would be safest to wire them in such a
way that when they agree, they can override the pilot, but if they disagree,
the pilot should be able to take responsibility.

re "Airliners playing chicken" from RISKS digest 13.81:

I agree that it is better to have an occasional accident due to a safety
interlock system that fails than to have more accidents due to people
accidentally doing fatal things like engaging the thrust reversers or deploying
the spoilers while the plane is in the air.

However, the better solution is to have an emergency override system that is
simple enough to engage quickly, that cannot easily be engaged by accident and
that warns that it is engaged.  And, of course, there must be severe penalties
for anyone who uses it except under emergency conditions.

To use a computer analogy, there can be serious accidents if everyone has
superuser privileges enabled all the time.  But there are also problems if you
cannot get privileges when you really need them -- like at 9pm when no one is
around and you just have to read that protected file!

Or, we can realize that failures and "impossible" circumstances do occur, and
install overrides so the pilot can tell the system it's wrong.  People deal
with unforeseen circumstances better than computers.

A few quick comments on items in <A HREF="/Risks/13.81.html">RISKS-13.81</A>:

David Wittenberg reports on airliners playing chicken, and suggests that
we "not panic when a safety device does cause damage" even though
switches "used in all sorts of safety devices ... will eventually fail".
I'd like to see an overridable switch:  if the pilot engages the brakes
or thrust reversers, and the computer thinks the plane is in the air, it
shouldn't just quietly fail to engage them, but should tell the pilot what
is going on, and leave some way to override the ground/flight switch.

Daniel Burstein is concerned about the post office's plans to send images of
hand-written envelopes via computer to remote sorting sites, and the
possibility that addresses could be stored in a database.  Of course
letters with typed addresses are already sorted by machines with OCR
software, so these addresses are even easier to store.  Overnight delivery
services must enter each item sent into some kind of computerized tracking
and billing system: who knows if any of them have thought to keep a
database indexed by sender/recipient pairs?

There has been much discussion of the real phone number used in 'Sneakers'
for the NSA agent.  The movie also shows phone numbers being typed in on a
numeric keypad (when they first test the decoder), and at least one
instance where touchtones are audible.  I didn't try to identify any of
these, but I'm sure someone will.

In <A HREF="/Risks/13.81.html">RISKS-13.81</A>, Daniel Burstein relays US Postal Service plans to use remote
video technology to allow remote sorting of mail, and notes: "given OCR
technology, it would be quite trivial to have EVERY piece of correspondence
going through the USPS scanned, and a data list of who sent what to whom could
be generated."

I want to point out several issues related to this article:

1. The RISK of stored communication matrices--having a record of who
communicates with whom--is perhaps simplified, but certainly not
created by the use of computer sorting technologies.  In small town
days, the local postman and telephone operator knew exactly who
communicated with whom. 

2. OCR Technology is already very widely used by the USPS.  If you
place a letter in a mailbox that is designated "for envelopes with
typed and printed addresses only," that envelope is read by an OCR and
a bar code is put on to the envelope corresponding to the zip code.
(Try sending yourself a letter in this manner!)  

3. There was a front-page article in the LA Times (Sunday, 20 Sept?)  that
describes how firms in general are using remote technologies to move jobs to
remote locations.  It's generally a benefit to both the company and the
workers.  The company gets better workers and lower costs.  The workers are
happier because their wages go a lot further in the remote geographic location,
allowing a better standard of living.  Why not let workers in Vermont sort mail
that is going through a plant in New York City?

Terry Gerritsen quotes The Lawyers Weekly as saying that the 9-year libel

erroneously returning cheques marked "Refer to drawer", is believed to be the
first of its kind to reach British courts this century.  Actually I am aware of
a case identical in all pertinent respects, and while I do not remember the
date I am reasonably certain it was within this century.  I remember finding it
in a search of important libel decisions when I was in the UK and it stuck in
my mind.  Given such a clear precedent, it's appalling that it took nine years

Mobile data terminals (MDT's) in police cars are nothing new around here
(Phoenix, AZ area), and have been in use for years.  My experience has ranged
from working for an organization which serviced these devices (and thus using
them in testing), thoroughly studying the computer system that works in the
background, to accompanying on-duty police officers from various departments on
many ride-alongs, and viewing the system in action.  These systems are in use
with virtually every police agency in the Phoenix area, as well as the
Department of Public Safety (Highway Patrol), but not with the sheriff's
office.

The systems are nothing more than data terminals on a radio network.  Data
traffic is NOT encrypted (risks obvious), and converting an installed base to
handle encryption is not feasible for most departments.  Log on practices vary,
with identification information ranging from officer ID, to shift/beat code,
with usually short (and few different) passwords.  The "base computer" is
connected to several databases, including the National Crime Information
Computer (NCIC), the Arizona Crime Information Computer (ACIC), and motor
vehicle records.  Information retrievable includes driving license records
(including traffic violation history), vehicle registration records (including
vehicle description), arrest warrant information, stolen motor vehicle records,
stolen firearm records, etc.  Data retrieval is notoriously slow during busy
times (Friday &amp; Saturday night), sometimes taking as long as 30 minutes for a
license plate check.  Terminal to terminal messaging is possible.
Communication with dispatchers is also possible.  All transactions are
recorded/printed.

Accident Risks: A few years ago, the Phoenix Police Department, after
experiencing numerous problems with officer's driving and operating the
terminals at the same time, improved the ergonomics by mounting the terminal
higher and closer to the driver.  This way, the drivers eyes are not completely
averted from the road while using the terminal.

Privacy Risks: It is common practice for officers to "run" license plates on
vehicles which they observe, for no reason whatsoever, or for any trivial
reason.  Information retrieved via the computer includes name, address, SSN,
and driving license number of the current registered owner, vehicle
identification number, lien holder (usually bank/loan institution), original
lien amount, date vehicle first registered, date registration expires, vehicle
description, and whether the vehicle is stolen.  Registration violations are
most commonly found this way.  As newer officers (who often are less
techno-phobe) take to the streets, use of the system is increasing.

False Arrest Risks: Arrest warrant information obtained through the computer
(term is "CAPRI Hit") will find the listed individual in handcuffs (i.e.
existence of a computer arrest warrant record is sufficient probable cause for
arrest).  Again, we know how infallible information entered into computers is.
These computer warrant records must then be verified against the actual warrant
(on paper), before the arrestee can be arraigned (brought before a judge).
These warrants are stored in filing cabinets at the sheriff's office of the
warrant issuing jurisdiction (here it is the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office,
and I have seen the actual filing cabinets stuffed with warrants).  This
process can be slow, since there are hundreds of thousands of outstanding
warrants in these filing cabinets, some going back over half a century.

Consumer car phones are already shipping with voice dialing.  Extending that 
to replacing the keyboard by speaking letters as opposed to something as 
fancy as full word recognition would be straightforward.  Given not only the 
safety risk but the awkwardness of using a keyboard in a car along with the 
compelling value of using the device while driving, I'd be surprised if voice 
is not added very soon.

Let's start the timer going and see how long it takes to get the technology 
deployed.

&gt;Given the alleged facts here the amount in question must have been
&gt;on the order of $3;

An incident with similar background but (so far) less outrageous conclusion
happened to me.  Early in my consultancy I had my business checking account at
a small bank.  Through a bookkeeping error on my part I bounced a check.  The
check was small, the account was small, the error was small and the overdraft
was small.

In what I hope and believe was a complete coincidence, the bank was closed by
federal regulators between the time the check was bounced and the time I
received notice of it.  The check was not honored but the overdraft charge ate
up the balance in the account plus a few dollars.  Since I couldn't find
anybody who had a clue what was going on I just abandoned the account.

The bank was purchased by Texas Commerce Bank, one of the largest in the area.
For several months they accrued overdraft charges to my old account because it
now had a negative balance.  The end result was that they wrote off the account
with about $75 owing and sent me a nice registered letter to the effect that I
had "caused a loss" of $whatever to the bank.  The way I see it they made off
with the $12 I had in there when they bought the old bank, but I suspect they
could have one of those stealth arrest warrants issued for me by including my
case on a list of other "losses" and mailing it to the district attorney.

I also managed to spend a couple of hours in jail once due to a parking ticket
that was over five years old.  It was legitimate and once I was told about it I
vaguely remembered having gotten it, but I had completely forgotten it.  The
arresting officer could not tell me what I was being charged with at the time
of the arrest, which I found pretty offensive.  All he knew was that a warrant
existed.

What I don't understand is why they can't send out letters to people instead of
lying in wait for them and wasting everybody's time.  It wasn't like I was
going to flee the country over a parking ticket.

Phil Karn comments about a computer terminal mounted on San Diego police cars;
these devices can be (and are) used by the driver while in motion.  He points
out the safety risks associated with that (typing/reading while driving).

Karn also mentions that "[the police] like to drive around semi-continuously
punching in license plate numbers", i.e., that they check plates in many
situations that are not "only when they really suspect somebody (e.g., during a
stop)".

So there's a change with respect to the previous situation: now the checks on
plates can be (they probably are) stored and can be manipulated much more
easily; more such data is gathered; and, more relevant to RISKS, it can be
easily matched with location, as police cars (will) have devices that
continuously report their location.  Of course, if the records exist, they will
eventually be used against someone.

This is yet another instance of a common risk: having more and
richer data changes the possible uses of such data.

The Associated Press reports in 9/29 from Hartford, Conn. that for the last
three years Hartford residents have been excluded from the federal grand jury
pool. The problem was discovered in a lawsuit disputing the racial composition
of the federal grand jury that indicted a minority defendant for bail-jumping.
Apparently, the city name for Hartford residents had been typed in the wrong
place (wrong field?) in computer records, with the effect that the "d" in
"Hartford" overflowed into a status field, indicating the named person as
deceased.

My union just sent out a letter to its members containing (among other
things), the note:

"If your salary is less than 11844 or greater than 32767, please
notify us immediately and we will adjust your membership fee."

The membership fees are dependent on the salary. My salary is higher
than the first figure quoted and I already have the maximum fee. So
why the request to people with a salary greater than 32767 swedish
crowns?

Since 32767 is the greatest integer you can represent in 16 bits with
2's complement arithmetic, I am willing to bet that their computer
misrepresents larger salaries. I guess that someone with an income of
33000 crowns (say) are charged the fee for an income of
33000-32767=233 crowns! That would be the minimum fee...

Someone must have noted this, and now they must correct those cases
manually...

The incident _was_ caused by a computer.  An automated system was "in the loop"
that examined sensor inputs (including the control for the thrust reversers and
brakes (and in the other incident, the flaps), and the indication given by the
"squat" switch, and decided whether or not to deploy the thrust reversers and
the landing wheel brakes.  It seems odd to me (but then again, I'm not an
engineer designing commercial aircraft) that the squat switch should _also_
disable the brakes, which don't seem like they pose a safety hazard if used
during flight.

This seems like an area where a cockpit crew needs to be able to explicitly
override the safety system.  I can imagine a sort-of dialog (not with spoken or
even typed words, but by command actions - pulling levers and switches, and so
on...)

Crew: deploy thrust reversers
Safety Systems: No. Use of thrust reversers in flight will destroy the
                aircraft.
Crew: Acknowledged.  Override safety constraints! Deploy Thrust
                Reversers NOW!

[...]

We still put human crews in airliners.  Maybe the next step is to admit
that the safety systems are fallible, and give crews a way to overcome
that fallibility.

There are numerous design issues involved, though.  The safety systems
are there for a purpose, and the bypass mechanism should have enough
restrictions that it is only used in an emergency, rather than as a way
of avoiding a routine bother.  On the other hand, if the restrictions
are too severe, the crew will be unable to override the systems when
they have to.  At around 200 MPH, a jetliner runs out of runway _very_
quickly, and there isn't a lot of time for access codes, or even
synchronizing movements of two crew members.  Perhaps requiring a lot of
paperwork _after_ the use of the override system would be appropriate.

&gt;From the EFFector 3.05

Following are excerpts from the testimony of Professor David Farber, a
member of the EFF Board of Directors, before the Computer Systems
Security and Privacy Advisory Board of the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) on September 16, 1992.

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Advisory Board:

    My name is David Farber. I am Professor of Computer Science at the
University of Pennsylvania and a member of the Board of Directors of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). I am here today representing only
the views of EFF. I want to thank you for inviting us to testify today
as part of your investigation.

    We are pleased to be included at this early phase of the Advisory
Board's inquiry and offer a brief set of principles for proceeding with
this inquiry. First, it is essential that in examining discrete issues
such as the desirability of various cryptography standards, the Board
take a comprehensive view of what we call "digital privacy" policy as a
whole. Such a comprehensive view requires a clear vision of the
underlying civil liberties issues at stake: privacy and free speech. It
also requires looking beyond the cryptography questions raised by many
to include some of law enforcement's recent concerns about the pace of
digital infrastructure innovation. Second, for the sake of promoting
innovation and protecting civil liberties, the Board should bear in mind
the principle that computer security policy is fundamentally a concern
for domestic, civilian agencies. This principle, as articulated in the
Computer Security Act of 1987, can serve as an important guide to the
work of this Board.

A. THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL PRIVACY TECHNOLOGY

    With dramatic increases in reliance on digital media for
communications on the part of private individuals, government, and
corporations, the need for comprehensive protection of privacy in these
media grows. For most in this room, the point seems trite, but the
digital communications revolution (which we stand at only the very
beginning of), is the key event of which the Advisory Board should take
note. As an example, a communication which is carried on paper through
the mail system, or over the wire-based public telephone network is
relatively secure from random intrusion by others. But the same
communication carried over a cellular or other wireless communication
system, is vulnerable to being overheard by anyone who has very
inexpensive, easy-to-obtain scanning technology.

    For the individual who relies on digital communications media,
reliable privacy protection cannot be achieved without the protection of
robust encryption technology. While legal restrictions on the use of
scanners or other technology which might facilitate such invasions of
privacy seem to be attractive preventative measures, these are not
lasting or comprehensive solutions. We should have a guarantee -- with
physics and mathematics, not only with laws -- that we can give
ourselves real privacy of personal communications through technical
means. Encryption strong enough that even the NSA can't break it. We
already know how to do this, but we have not made encryption technology
widely available for public use because of public policy barriers.
        
B. THE BOARD SHOULD UNDERTAKE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF DIGITAL PRIVACY 
ISSUES    

    Inasmuch as digital privacy policy has broad implications for
constitutional rights of free speech and privacy, and for international
competitiveness and economic vitality in the information age, these
issues must be explored and resolved in an open, civilian policy
context. These questions are simply too important to be decided by the
national security establishment alone. This principle is central to the
Computer Security Act of 1987.1 The structure of the Act, which is the
basis for the authority of this Advisory Board, arose, in significant
part, from the concern that the national security establishment was
exercising undue control over the flow of public information and the use
of information technology.2

    When considering the law in 1986, the committee asked the question,
"whether it is proper for a super-secret agency [the NSA] that operates
without public scrutiny to involve itself in domestic activities...?"
The answer was a clear no, and the authority for establish computer
security policy was vested in NIST (the NBS).

    In this context, we need a robust public debate over our
government's continuing heavy-handed efforts to control commercially
developed cryptography. It is no secret that throughout the cold war
era, the Defense and State Departments and the National Security Agency
have used any and all means, including threats of prosecution, control
over research, and denial of export licenses to prevent advanced secret
coding capabilities from getting into the hands of our adversaries. NSA
does this to maximize its ability to intercept and crack all
international communications of national security interest.

    Now the Cold War is over but the practice continues. In recent
years, Lotus, Microsoft, and others have developed or tried to
incorporate powerful encryption means into mass market software to
enhance the security and privacy of business, financial, and personal
communications. In an era of computer crime, sophisticated surveillance
technologies, and industrial espionage it is a laudable goal.

    Although NSA does not have the authority to interfere with domestic
distribution of DSA, RSA, and other encryption packages, its licensing
stranglehold over foreign distribution has unfortunate consequences.
Domestic firms have been unable to sell competitive security and privacy
products in international markets.  More important, because the cost of
producing two different products is often prohibitive, NSA policy
encourages firms to produce a single product for both domestic and
worldwide use, resulting in minimal privacy and security for users both
here and abroad.

    While we all recognize that NSA has legitimate national security
concerns in the post cold war era, this is a seriously flawed process.
Foreign countries or entities who want to obtain advanced encryption
technology can purchase it through intermediaries in the United States
or from companies in a host of foreign countries who are not subject to
US export restrictions.  There is a big, big hole in the national
security dike. By taking a page out of the Emperor's New Clothes, NSA
opts to act as if the process works by continuing to block export.

    In order to get some improvement in mass market encryption, the
Software Publishers Association, representing Microsoft, Lotus, and
others, had to use the threat of legislation to get NSA to engage in the
negotiations that finally led NSA to agree to expedited clearance for
the export of RSA encrypting software of limited key lengths. Still, all
concede that the agreement does not go far enough and that far more
powerful third-party products are commonly available in the US,
including the fifteen-year-old US Data Encryption Standard.  SPA knows
that specifying maximum key lengths offers little long-term security
given advances in computer processing power, but was willing to
compromise because of NSA's refusal to budge.

    Does this kind of policy make any sense in the post Cold War era?
Mass market products offer limited security for our citizens and
businesses. Determined adversaries can obtain much more powerful
products from foreign countries or by purchasing it here in the US. Is
the NSA policy of slowing down the pace of encryption use by foreigners
and adversaries --even if demonstrable--any longer worth the significant
price we pay in terms of failing to meet our own communications privacy
and security needs?  That is the policy challenge for this Board to
address by a frank, open, and inclusive public debate.

C. THE BOARD MUST ADDRESS THE DIGITAL PRIVACY ISSUE IN A COMPREHENSIVE
MANNER WHICH REQUIRES CONSIDERING THE FBI'S DIGITAL TELEPHONY PROPOSAL
AND ITS IMPLICATIONS.

    The public policy debate on electronic privacy issues over the last
few years has demonstrated that a comprehensive approach to digital
privacy policy cannot be complete without examining both questions
regarding the availability of encryption technology, and the
corresponding infrastructure issues, such as those raised by the FBI's
Digital Telephony Proposal. Attempts to solve one issue without
addressing the other is an exercise in irrational policy-making and
should be avoided by this Advisory Board.

    Last year, the FBI first proposed a "Sense of the Congress"
resolution stating that communications firms and computer and
communications equipment manufacturers were obligated to provide law
enforcement access to the "plain" text of all voice, data, and video
communications, including communications using software encryption. The
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) played an active and leading role
both in opposing such a law and in seeking to find more acceptable means
for meeting legitimate law enforcement needs. Because of our advocacy
and coalition-building efforts with communications and privacy groups,
we were successful in persuading Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden
to remove the Sense of the Congress Resolution from active consideration
as part of Omnibus crime legislation last year.

    Putting aside its attempt to control the use of encryption systems,
this year the FBI has come forward with proposed legislation that would
require telephone companies, electronic information providers, and
computer and communications equipment manufacturers to seek an FCC
"license" or Attorney General "certification" that their technologies
are susceptible to electronic surveillance. We are in danger of creating
a domestic version of the export control laws for computer and
communications technology.

    While the FBI claims that neither of this year's proposals address
encryption issues, the Bureau has made it clear it plans to return to
this issue in the future. The Board needs to hear from the broad
coalition made up of telephone companies such as AT&amp;T, computer firms
such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, and Lotus Development Corporation, and
public interest groups such as the EFF. The EFF will shortly release a
white paper representing coalition views on the need for the FBI to
explore more realistic, less vague, and potentially onerous policy
options for meeting legitimate law enforcement needs.

    The resulting multi-front battle being waged about digital privacy
creates formidable roadblocks to a final resolution of the policy
disputes at issue. Those who seek greater privacy and security cannot
trust a settlement on one front, because their victory is likely to be
undermined by action on the other issue. And law enforcement and
national security concerns cannot be adequately addressed without a
sense of the overall solution being proposed on both the encryption and
infrastructure fronts. This Advisory Board can play a valuable role for
the policy process by conducting a comprehensive review of digital
privacy and security policy, with a consideration of both of these sets
of issues.

With regard to garage door opener security, I recently was asked to
inspect the malfunctioning garage door opener transmitter for a
friend's mother.  I used a screwdriver to open it up, and found a
broken battery wire.  The unit included a microcomputer and a
DIP switch for a 12-bit password.  I don't think I'd be revealing
any great secret to tell you what her password was.  It was
the binary number 000000000001.

Leslie J. Somos: 

&gt;I can understand preventing deployment of spoilers or thrust reversers while in
&gt;the air, but I don't understand preventing brake application.

A lot of the replies have missed a pretty fundamental component of this 
problem: the one of the increasing design modality of airliner systems.  
*Landing* models, *Ground* models, *Takeoff* models, *Flight* models, ad
nauseum.  Conditional logic being used to disable systems or alter the 
behavior of control devices to fit the projected use in a specified mode.

We have had squat switches for years.  They're useful.  The problem arises,
as I see it, when they provide an online datum for evaluation and use by 
client devices in a highly abstract *design* context.  The brake question is 
one such example.  The brakes weren't enabled because it made no sense to 
enable them, from the perspective of the cockpit control logic.  It's a 
"tidiness" that makes for clean block diagrams, but in many ways, lends a 
higher level of complexity to a system interface.  In a conventional 
interface, the pilot would be able to massage the brakes to his heart's 
content, in the air, gear stowed, or whenever.  This may not make much LOGICAL
sense, though, so the feature's *turned off* in the air...  It's yet another
manifestation of the conflict of old-fashioned "open-loop" design, vs.
"modern" "consider-all-cases" (and hope we got it right!) design.

Larry Seiler:
&gt;I agree that it is better to have an occasional accident due to a safety
&gt;interlock system that fails than to have more accidents due to people
&gt;accidentally doing fatal things like engaging the thrust reversers 

I don't see this as an "override" issue.  We need to differentiate between
items that can cause disasters, and items that don't fit an abstract design
model.  A failure of thrust-reverser safety interlocks can kill an airplane, 
as the Lauda crash showed.  "Modality" logic in the case of the brakes makes 
very, very little sense, however-- it's likely, as Fokker learned, that the 
modality *decreased* the safety margin, with *no* increase in safety in a 
properly-functioning system, anyway!  

Technology for technology's sake, once again.  Electronic toilets, anyone?  :-)

It may have been reprinted in DATAMATION, too. (But the above citations are

The Story of Escalating Computer Mistakes entitled "Computers Don't Argue"
by Gordon R. Dickson appears in "Computer Crimes and Capers" edited by
Isaac Asimov, Martin H. Greenburg and Charles G. Waugh, ISBN 0-14-007310-8
(British Edition, Published by Penguin Books), according to the title page
the copyright was made by Conde Nast Publications in 1965. 

This book is recommended to all risks readers for the inclusion of two
stories which highlight risks related issues. The first is "An End of
Spinach" by Stan Dryer (which also appeared in the Magazine of Fantasy and
Science Fiction and carries a copyright of 1981) and the second is "Sam
Hall" by Poul Anderson (copyright 1953 by Conde Nast Publications). 

Having just flipped through the volume again I can also recommend
"While-U-Wait" by Edward Wellen (copyright 1978, Magazine of Fantasy and
Science Fiction). 

"Computers Don't Argue" also appears in "The Best of Creative Computing
Vol Two" edited by David Ahl. But it is likely that this is now out of
print, however it does mention that the story originally appeared in the
magazine "Analog". 

It is interesting to note that many risks mentioned in this forum were
considered by SF writers in the fifties and sixties...

&gt; The classic treatment of the "computer-induced" nightmare through
&gt; "minor" errors must be the humorous (fictional) piece done by
&gt; "Datamation" in the early 70's.

Another classic story of computer automation gone overboard is "Brazil", by
Terry Gilliam.  Makes what we read about here seem like a day at the park :-)

NCSC '92 -- Comment and Commentary
Copyright (c) 1992 by Rebecca Mercuri. All Rights Reserved.

I attended the 15th National Computer Security Conference held October 13 - 16
in balmy Baltimore MD with the hope of coming away with some solutions for the
security problems I had encountered and observed over the past few years. I
left with a longer list of problems, and the vague feeling that our industry
has become remiss in providing us with answers that we can use, or has answers
and is either incapable or unwilling to yield them publicly. Let me state
clearly here that this comment does not in any way reflect negatively on the
conference organizers -- they should be commended for performing their task
well, creating a superbly orchestrated event which covered a broad spectrum of
topics. Indeed, "rookies" were liberally mixed on panels with esteemed
"greybeards" and many women (sans beards) were in evidence as session chairs
and presenters (although I was somewhat dismayed to note that females appeared
to constitute less than 10% of the attendees, lower than in the computing
community in general). The breadth and extent of the conference does not allow
one reporter to describe it fully, so I offer these remarks merely as comment
and commentary, perhaps to stimulate discussion among other attendees.

The conference held an international flavor, with the keynote by Roland Hueber
(Directorate General of the Commission of the European Communities) and the
closing plenary on International Harmonization serving as bookends. There were
repeated calls for cooperation in developing global security standards, with
the primary advantages of such appearing to be in commerce. In the wake of the
cold war, there seems to be a spirit of openness in this regard, but I offer
the speculation that it may be foolhardy to enter into conformity of thought
and solutions.  Diversity, particularly in commerce, inspires creativity.
Monopoly, or single-mindedness, often leaves one at risk of exploitation by a
strong central power, or of attack by those who are close enough or who
understand the system well enough to side-track it. We may need "fault-
tolerant" and "diversified" answers.

Surveying the Track Sessions:

It is useful to juxtapose thoughts about covert channels with those about
encryption systems. For the uninitiated, covert channels (to a first
approximation on a definition) are created when internal intermittent polling
is performed in an effort to conceal illicit data collection activities. Bob
Morris provided the statistic that 1/10 of a bit per second is enough to expose
a key in approximately 1 month. This is at current processing rates, but one
can extrapolate out the Silicon Valley curve and surmise that our current key
encryption systems will be inadequate within the end of the century (if not
now, perhaps).

In the quest for tools one encounters the debate on provability and formal top
level specification. Virgil Gligor referred to "formal top level specification
as an unmitigated waste of time," saying that data structures and source may
not map to the top level, there may not be enough relevant details provided,
and excessive false illegal flows may occur. Earl Boebert stated that formal
proving methods have worth in analysis of specifications, but have failed
utterly in spec/code, code/object, and code/behavior correspondence. Still,
formal methods have their supporters, most notably SRI, as indicated by John
Rushby, one of their directors (who also publicly revealed that there had been
a major successful break-in at the lab last month). Interestingly, the panel on
Intrusion Detection was chaired by SRI's Teresa Lunt, who discussed the use of
expert systems to encode vulnerabilities, attack methods and known suspicious
behaviors.  Steve Snapp expressed the divide and conquer approach, saying that
there may be no single generalizable model of intrusion, and that static,
incidence/existence, and data driven methods should all be used.

The matter of viruses was explored throughout various sessions. The general
consensus of opinion seemed to be that rigorous procedures and policies need to
be implemented so that recovery is possible to some level following
contamination or invasion. In the talks I attended, no clear method for
handling the recovery from a "new" virus (that can not be eradicated with
existing software) was offered. This was not consoling to someone who had just
last week left a client's law office with the admonishment "don't use any of
the text files that you've created in the last 6 months until I can find out
what the new virus strain is that appears to have adhered to some unknown
quantity of them." Here too, the standardization on certain operating systems
and environments (such as Microsoft Windows(TM)), and uniform acceptance of
specific tools (such as the legal community's reliance on Word Perfect(TM))
encourages the proliferation of attacks that could potentially disable large
sectors of the user base.

Losses seem to be tied heavily to the bottom line. In banking, it may not be
advantageous to implement a $10M or more security system that still does not
assure total impenetrability when insurance coverage can be obtained at a cost
of $1M (even if this price only remains low until there is a hit). In health
care, as described in Deborah Hamilton's award- winning paper, the bottom line
may indeed be one or more people's lives. As true with drug approvals, it is
easy to see that holding back an inadequately tested computer system may cost
more lives than providing it while continuing to make improvements and
corrections. How does one weigh security, reliability and verifiability issues
when there is a crying need for access to the developing technology? We are
faced with a moral dilemma without a governing body to set policies.

The area of privacy was eloquently addressed by Attorney Christine Axsmith who
said that our reasonable expectations of privacy, as expressed by the 4th
Amendment, protect people, not just places. But she went on to say that with
regard to the computer industry, the Privacy Act and other legislation efforts
still suffer from a lack of court rulings necessary to define their
interpretations. Will our efforts to improve security undermine privacy?  Curt
Symes (from IBM) stated that "we'll all be using smart cards in the future, for
a higher level of authentication." Does this mean that I will eventually be
required to be bioidentified (DNA, fingerprint, retinal scan, voiceprint) in
order to obtain access to my own data and research?  A chilling thought.

In conclusion, to paraphrase Peter Neumann (which seems only fitting, as he
"scooped" my Nov. 92 CACM Inside Risks column on voting machines by referring
to some of its salient points in his banquet address, without citation) --
perhaps the conference theme "Information Systems Security: Building Blocks to
the Future" should be read not as "building-blocks" (the small bricks), but as
"building BLOCKS" or obstacles to our future as security professionals. There
is a sense of urgency now -- many of us need more than a foundation of toy
blocks, requiring true solutions which appear to not be forthcoming. What we
don't want are systems and design structures that are so cumbersome as to
impede computational progress.  Discussion may be fruitful, but let us all get
our noses to the grindstone and provide functional tools and answers, rather
than guidelines and assertions. Some are working in this direction, others are
needed.

A local proponent of voting-by-phone keeps pointing to the 'safety' of absentee
ballots as evidence that phone-voting would be safe.  So it was with more than
passing interest that I read the lead article in the _Rocky Mountain News_
today....

(Main headline [1])
Vote fraud riddles Colorado County

'Vote early, vote often' was Costilla County pattern, judge rules.
Non-residents used absentee ballots to help pals win office

(Article headline)

Judge finds Costilla County riddled with election fraud

Non-residents marked absentee ballots to help friends, relatives wind
elections, court rules

by Dick Foster
Rocky Mountain News Southern Bureau

Widespread election fraud has been uncovered in Costilla County [in
south-central Colorado abutting New Mexico], where evidence shows people cast
absentee ballots for friends and relatives seeking public office back to 1984.

One of those who cast an absentee ballot in the southern Colorado county was
not even a U.S. citizen.  Another was an imprisoned felon, evidence shows.

Another 106 people who had cast ballots in one or more of the last four
elections lived nowhere near Costilla County and had no claim to an absentee
vote, Chief District Judge Robert Ogburn of Monte Vista ruled.

It took the action of citizens banding together to file a civil lawsuit to halt
the abuses after their complaints were rebuffed by the Colorado secretary of
state's office and the local district attorney.

Office holders felt "entitled" to collect as many absentee votes as possible
from children who had long ago left the county "as well as from nieces and
nephews and anyone else who bore the slightest resemblance to being a
relative," said Ogburn.  "Over the years, the practice expanded to include
friends who had left the community to live elsewhere."

One Mexican national with a green card testified that a county commissioner
solicited his vote and gave him an absentee ballot.

Many of the absentee voters gave fake addresses in the county.  Others simply
used local post office box numbers as their claim to local residence.

Ogburn called one box "famous" -- it had been claimed by several absentee
voters.

Costilla County had 254 absentee ballots in the 1990 general election, about
14% of the county's total vote of 1,827.  In neighboring counties, only 5% to
7% of the votes were absentee.

At least once, absentee ballots meant the difference between victory and defeat
for incumbents.  In 1988, a resident named Lillian Maestas ran against county
clerk and recorder Roy D. Martinez.  She led in election day returns, but lost
when the absentee votes were counted, said Wilmer Pacheco, a Maestas campaign
worker.

"Some of these people haven't lived here since World War II and they're voting
here.  When you have that many votes in a small county it's going to throw the
election," said Stephanie Kimbrel, one resident who helped organize Citizens
for Better Government after the August primary election.  The group launched
its own investigation and civil lawsuit to stop voting abuse.

Urcilia Auth joined the group after returning to San Luis to retire and serving
as a poll watcher during the August primary.  "I saw people I knew from Alamosa
[in a different county] come in here and cast ballots," she said.  "But the
county clerk hadn't given us a challenge list so we couldn't challenge them.
And names appeared on the registration list of some people I know who live in
Colorado Springs."

The residents said they grew angrier when their calls for an investigation of
election abuse where turned aside by the secretary of state's office and
Alamosa County District Attorney Douglas Primavera.

"When I took this to Donetta Davidson, the elections director at the secretary
of state's office, after the August primary, she told me that we should hire a
lawyer because their office has no responsibility at all in these matters,"
said Kimbrel.

Secretary of State Natalie Meyer told the _Rocky Mountain News_ Wednesday "the
law does not give me any authority to do anything" to investigate election
abuses.  Such matters are for the district attorney to investigate, she said.

Primavera told the _Rocky Mountain News_ his office lacked the staff to conduct
an investigation into the residents' allegations.

"They all just passed the buck," Pacheco said.

The residents hired Alamosa attorney Martin Gonzales, who filed a civil lawsuit
in September challenging 108 names of absentee voters in the county.  The
residents themselves gathered records and witnesses to prove the voters were
not county residents.

"I think the secretary of state's office could have stepped in," Gonzales said.
"They didn't."

Here is a press release that I received from the Metropolitan Toronto
Police. The Toronto Star ran a story (based on the press release) on its
front page today (October 7).
 
 1992 October 06, 1950 hours
 
 Teenage Computer Hacker Nabbed by Police
 
 Detectives from the Major Crime Squad at Police Headquarters have arrested a
15-year-old North York boy and charged him with a number of computer-related
crimes. Investigations have revealed that on some occasions his pranks
paralyzed the Metropolitan Toronto 911 emergency telephone system.
 
 Last July, a young man called the 911 emergency number from a location in the
west end of Metropolitan Toronto and reported a number of medical emergencies
which caused units from the Metropolitan Toronto Police, ambulance services and
local fire departments to respond. All of these calls were determined to be
false.
  
 On one occasion, he totally monopolized the 911 system and rendered it
inoperable thereby denying citizens access to the 911 lifeline throughout the
Metropolitan Toronto area.

 Bell Canada security officers assisted police in their search for the source
of the calls. Acting on a Criminal Code search warrant, police today entered a
North York home, seized a quantity of computers and arrested a teen-age boy.
He is to appear in Youth Court, 47 Sheppard Avenue East, North York, Friday,
November 6, 1992, charged with theft of telecommunications, 24 counts of
mischief and 10 counts of convey false message.
 
 Investigations are continuing.

  NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (UPI) -- Three Rutgers University students have been
charged with trying to bilk their fellow students with a fake scholarship scam.
The trio allegedly placed fliers around campus advertising ``New Jersey
Scholarship and Grant Search Services,'' directing applicants to send Social
Security and bank account numbers and credit card data to a mailing address.
Police say they used the information to apply for duplicate birth certificates.

Police say they have located only one victim who actually lost money, a
Livingston College student who had $1,000 withdrawn from her bank account. But
another women allegedly reported that she had received notices from credit card
companies that someone was trying to obtain cards using her name.

Police have charged Justin Okieze, 18, of North Brunswick; Robert Harrell, 21,
of New Brunswick; and Lisa Young, 20, of Edison, with theft by deception.

LONDON (OCT. 8) DPA - A fully-laden Airbus A 320 lost power in one engine for
no accountable reason while approaching London's Gatwick airport,
necessitating emergency procedures, it was reported Thursday. 

This suggested that computers controlling the engine 'could be capable of
developing a mind of their own and countermanding decisions made by the crew',
The Times newspaper said. 

The aircraft of the Air 2000 charter company was on its way from Venice to
Gatwick with 135 Passengers and seven crew September 26 when the starboard
engine continued to 'wind down' until well below the required flight idle
speed, the newspaper said.

The captain had to shut the engine down completely - a routine operation that
did not affect safety - and then restarted the engine at 14,000 feet to make a
normal two-engined landing. 

'Despite a detailed check of all the systems, the fault has not been traced,
but it is believed to involve the engine overspeed valve which restricts the
flow of fuel to the engine as power is cut,' the newspaper said.

Today in a meeting, it was brought up that some one had emailed a message and
most likely added the words T** Sec**t in jest or fun.  The message body was
apparently one of those systems which can include the bitmap for a military
service which will remain nameless.  Some how or other the DoD got this message
and started an investigation.  Needless to say, the DoD was not amused, this
despite system wide disclaimers that said systems are not to be used for
classified work.  Ah!  The electronic future is going to be an interesting one.

This is a brief overview of a General Accounting Office (GAO) review of
computer security procedures at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

The results of the GAO investigation showed that DEA is not adequately
protecting national security information in its computer systems, and that
though the DEA knows of no unauthorized disclosures, revelations of this
national security information would endanger lives and hinder US drug
enforcement and interdiction programs.

The Department of Justice requires that all of its component agencies identify
all computers used to process national security information.  DEA, however,
has failed to do so.  DEA's report was produced by the Office of Security
Programs based on a survey.  Ommisions in DEAs report were caused because
the headquarters was not surveyed, and because one field division did not
respond to the request for information.  Another field division reported
that they did not have any computers processing national security
information when in fact, the GAO found that they do.

DEA was in violation of National Security Guidelines by

  - using the office automation system to process classified data. This system
    has not been approved or safeguarded for processing classified data.
  - not conducting a risk analysis of the system.
  - operating said office automation workstations in open, unshielded work
    areas.
  - using non-TEMPEST rated workstations to process national security
    information.
  - using unencrypted data communications lines.

Additional problems occur because DEA uses the Office Automation system to
process national security information.  For example, any DEA employee,
regardless of clearance, has access to any information stored in any of the
office automation workstations.  Also, vendor-issued system passwords have
not been changed, so the vendor and other knowledgable individuals would
have complete access to the system (which was installed in 1987).

Some DEA personnel were processing classified information on microcomputers
that had fixed hard disks, which, in some cases, results in the inadvertant
storage of classified information on that disk, where it can later be
revealed to individuals without clearance (see GAO/T-IMTEC-91-6 for examples).

In addition to the information security problems outlined above, DEA has the
following physical security problems, which increase the risk from the above
problems:

  - inadequately controlled access to sensitive areas
  - individuals without national security clearances working unescorted in
    sensitive areas
  - unattended computers left logged on
  - computer-generated printouts and disks being left unattended and unsecured
  - documents left unattended and unsecured
  - safes left open and unattended

A specific example mentioned was that janitors are left unattended in
areas where computers were used to process national security information, and
that those computers were left logged on at the time.  These janitors had
neither a clearance nor a need to know.

Non-computer related physical security problems include

  - electronic card key devices are disabled during working hours and doors
    are propped open
  - security staff fail to review card-key logs
  - stolen or lost keycards are not deactivated
  - non-DEA employes have key cards that open sensitive areas within DEA
  - locks on division offices have not been changed since 1985, even
    though 17 keys have been lost or stolen, including masters to computer
    areas
  - DEA employees are not required to wear identification badges

The report concludes that these security weaknesses endanger the lives of
federal agents and need to be corrected immediately.

Car break-in ring cracked; youth shows the way

By Tom Alex - Register Staff Writer

[I have only entered the paragraphs that containted computer information]

	Des Moines police this week broke a sophisticated youth theft
ring that was using license plate numbers and state records to locate
cars for late-night break-ins.
	The youths would spot cars with expensive stereo gear in
parking lots during the day and then use Iowa Department of
Transportation computer records to determine where cars would be
parked at night.
	With the license plate numbers, the teen-ager went to an Iowa 
Department of Transportation office at Park Fair Mall and used public
access computers to learn the home addresses of the owners of the
vehicles.
	He and his cohorts didn't want to break into the vehicles when
there were a lot of potential witnesses around, police said, so they
found addresses from registration information and visited the victims
at their leisure.
	Security problems with public access computers cropped up
last year shortly after the computer terminals were installed, said
Jan Hardy, assistant office director with vehicle registration.
	A case worked in the juvenile system reported having a client
who had been using the terminals for illegal activities.
	Sortly afterward, officials developed a security system to
help curtail illegal acts. People wishing to look up license plate
numbers must identify themselves to the computer.
	"If they use the front counter terminal and sign on
themselves, that does provide at least some tracking of inquires,"
said Hardy.

	STANFORD, Calif. (UPI) -- Stanford University Hospital removed its new
robotic transportation devices from service Thursday after one of the
units went awry and fell down a set of stairs.
	Associate hospital director Louis Saksen said no one was injured when
the robot veered off course and tumbled down the steps.
	Stanford purchased three of the units to perform simple tasks, such
as delivering food trays to patients and transporting X-rays and
supplies around the hosptial.
	The facility has been phasing in the units for use this fall and has
had no problems with the robots during their first weeks of the trial
period.
	Officials said they had no idea what caused the robot to malfunction
when it returned from delivering a food tray to a patient.
	Saksen said the robots are designed to free hosptial workers from
routine duties to do other, more vital work.
	The battery-operated devices have been used for similar duties in
several hospitals across the United States.

   [David Cheriton remarks that it was probably garbage collecting at the time.
   That's the logical thing to do after delivering food.

I left Pittsburgh for a meeting in Chicago on Wednesday, September 30th.  I
returned on Friday, October 2nd.  In between the old Pittsburgh airport closed
and the new one began to operate.  According to a friend who changed planes in
Pittsburgh on opening day (Thursday), things went smoothly.  That may have
been true for folks hubbing at the airport, but for those Pittsburgh bound it
apparently was not.

In order to more easily retrieve my car I had parked with one of the
off-airport parking services.  Upon return I asked the van driver how things
had gone the day before.  He said that everything had gone pretty smoothly,
except for baggage claiming.  He said that delays were around 40 minutes in
the morning, but had stretched to two hours by the afternoon.  The supposed
reason: the airport has a new automated baggage handling system that reads bar
codes off luggage.  A Britsh Air 747 had arrived with uncoded luggage, and the
machinery didn't know how to cope.

&gt;In the quest for tools one encounters the debate on provability and formal top
&gt;level specification. Virgil Gligor referred to "formal top level specification
&gt;as an unmitigated waste of time," saying that data structures and source may
&gt;not map to the top level, there may not be enough relevant details provided,
&gt;and excessive false illegal flows may occur. ...

A point of clarification: He didn't say that formal top level specifications
were a waste of time, but that doing covert channel analysis on them was an
_unmitigated_ (his emphasis) waste of time.  His point was that you had to do a
CC analysis on the source code anyway (since channels would appear in code that
didn't show up in the specs).  Since any channel found in the analysis of the
spec would also be found in the analysis of the code, and you have to do the
latter, anyway, doing the former is not useful.  (This, of course, flies in the
face of the principle that it's much cheaper to find a bug found early in the
development process than late, but that's another discussion.  Perhaps doing
the covert channel analysis is more expensive than fixing a specification bug
when you are done with the code.)

On another topic...

I think that the most surprising new proposal came in the session on the FBI's
Digital Telephony Initiative.  (This is the proposed legislation that would
require telephone and data transport providers to build wiretap capabilities
into their systemms.)  Someone pointed out that the really bad guys would just
use encryption for their data transmission, and that wiretapping wouldn't gain
any information on them.  (The FBI doesn't want to deal with encryption right
now.  They'll think about that when (if) they get the current proposal passed.)
Dorothy Denning suggested that anyone using high-level encryption over a public
network be required to register their encryption keys with some agency.  This
agency would then distribute the keys when an appropriate court order was
presented.  The risks of this are fairly obvious.

                             ESORICS 92

                          Final Programme

          European Symposium on Research in Computer Security
                November 23-25, 1992, Toulouse, France

Computer security is concerned with the protection of information in
environments where there is a possibility of intrusion or malicious
action. The aim of ESORICS is to further the progress of research in
computer security by establishing a European forum for bringing
together researchers in this area, by promoting the exchange of
ideas with system developers and by encouraging links with resear-
chers in related areas. To achieve this aim under the best condi-
tions, ESORICS 92 will be a single track symposium and the selected
papers will be presented in a conference hall whose capacity is 290
attendees. ESORICS 92 is the second symposium of a series started
with ESORICS 90 held in Toulouse in October, 1990.

Symposium Chair: Gerard Eizenberg (ONERA/CERT, France)

From Sat 24 Oct 1992 `Guardian', no author given.  It is perhaps not too
surprising that this has not received the attention that it deserves, given the
political situation in the UK at the moment.  The British Government is
currently in the process of lurching from one crisis to the next.  [See Brian
Randell's contribution in <A HREF="/Risks/13.44.html">RISKS-13.44</A> for background.  PGN]

	    Computer software blamed as RAF pilot bombs Ark Royal.

  An RAF Harrier jump-jet pilot on exchange with the Royal Navy bombed the
  carrier Ark Royal, injuring five crew, because of a computer software
  anomaly, it was disclosed yesterday.  Four of the injured have returned to
  work following the [20 April 1992] incident when the 28lb practice bomb tore
  through the flight deck and exploded in one of the mess decks.  The fifth ...
  is still receiving medical treatment.

  The incident happened when four Sea Harriers were practicing dropping bombs
  on a target towed 600 yards behind Ark Royal during training ....  The RAF
  Flight Lieutenant, described as highly experienced, lost radar contact twice
  with the ship.  He `locked on' for a third time just seconds before going
  into the loft manoeuvre.  He did not know that the automatic aim-off was not
  programmed to cut in within such a short period of time because of an anomaly
  in the computer software.  The bomb was aimed at the ship and not the target.
  The pilot will receive a formal warning and training using loft-mode attacks
  has been `put into abeyance'.''

What interested me in particular was that, in a roundabout way, the pilot is
being faulted, even though the software is blamed.  It is worrying that the
evaluation of the software (which I assume took place) did not pick this up.
Of course, it could well be that the real problem was much more complicated
than the article suggests.  It would not be the first time the press has
simplified a story involving modern technology.  Does anyone know more on this?
It does, however, bring home the reality that computers control life and death
situations.

In the investigation of the process against the Brazilian President (Fernando
Collor de Mello), the Federal Police found (and confiscated) an IBM-PC clone in
the enterprises of Paulo Cesar Farias.

In the hard disk of this computer were found dozens of indications of the
corruption of Collor de Mello and P.C. Farias.

The "folklore" that runs in Brazil now is that the disks were actually erased,
but the FP bought in USA a software that allowed the examination of the disk
and the recovery of the files. It seems that this tale is true.

I would like to know which software was used, and what kind of work the FP did.

From: martin@NISC.JNVC.NET (Steve Martin)

        This is to inform you that Merit (NSF) has experienced a fiber cut in
East Orange, New Jersey.  As a result of this, JNvCnet's T3 access to the NSF
net is temporarily out of service till repairs can be made.

        All traffic to the NSF net is now being routed through the
9.6k backbone node and will be returned to the T3 as soon as possible.

  [The following message came from Pandora Berman at MIT via Jerry Leichter

  originally from Paul M. Wexelblat &lt;wex@cs.ulowell.edu&gt;, who noted the
  original CACM item ...  PGN]

I stumbled across this little item in the current (October 1992) CACM:

  BANKS UNDERDRAWN... The banking industry spent over a billion dollars on
  technology last year, yet they are not even close to employing leading-edge
  tools.  A new survey ... indicates that over 75% of bank computer programs
  are still written in Cobol and 84% of banking software is designed for
  mainframes, not PCs.  Moreover, 80% of the software used by banks is over six
  years old and only 37% of their locations are networked.  The report reveals
  most banks are simply not investigating new advances in computer applications.
  [Communications of the ACM, Vol 35, No 10, NEWSTRACK, p.9]

Here is a rough translation:

  BANKS CONSERVATIVE... The banking industry spent over a billion dollars on
  technology that works, rather than the latest glitzy play toy.  A new survey
  ... indicates that over 75% of bank computer programs are written in a
  language appropriate to the task as opposed to trying to force their models
  into the latest Object Oriented fad and 84% of banking software is designed
  to run on systems that have low mean time between failures, juggle hundreds
  of users, handle huge databases, and push megabytes at high rates, not tiny
  little machines that crash with great regularity, are designed for a single
  user, if even that, have minuscule disks, and have bandwidth the
  approximating that of a sclerotic soda straw.  Moreover, 80% of the software
  used by banks has been fairly well debugged and only 37% of their locations
  are open to attack by thirteen year olds with modems and a lot of time on
  their hands.  The report reveals most banks are simply not chasing the latest
  fad in confuser science and piddling their money away on recoding working
  applications unnecessarily.

David Willcox said

  Dorothy Denning suggested that anyone using high-level encryption over a public
  network be required to register their encryption keys with some agency.  This
  agency would then distribute the keys when an appropriate court order was
  presented.  The risks of this are fairly obvious.

I believe this risk can be reduced to about zero.  For example, using a
public-key system, your key could be encrypted under the public key belonging
to, say, the Justice Dept.  The encrypted key would be given to and held by an
independent agency.  But, the key could be decrypted only by Justice.  Thus, if
somone gains access to a key held by the key agency, they wouldn't be able to
decrypt it.

To use a key, law enforcers would have to go through these steps:

1.  Get a court order.
2.  Submit the court order to the key agency and get the encrypted key.
3.  Deliver the encrypted key to Justice with the court order; get back
    the plaintext key.
4.  Take the court order to the service provider in order to activate the tap
    and get the bits.
5.  Listen in and decrypt the communications.

I believe this scheme is pretty tight.  Silvio Micali has evidently invented
another method of safeguarding the keys in a registry, called "fair
cryptography", but I don't know the details.

&gt;It took the action of citizens banding together to file a civil lawsuit to halt
&gt;the abuses after their complaints were rebuffed by the Colorado secretary of
&gt;state's office and the local district attorney.

There is an interesting point related to this particular story.  The Colorado
Secretary of State does not have criminal powers.  So in the case of vote fraud
like that in Costillo County, the Secretary of State may have to turn the case
over to the District Attorney.  The District Attorney may have been elected
with the aid of the vote fraud (s)he is supposed to prosecute.  The other
choice of prosecuting authority would be the Attorney General (depending on who
had jurisdiction), another elected official.

It is difficult to see how telephone voting will do anything but further
exploit existing problems in authenticating voters and prosecuting vote fraud.

"Anonymous" mentions in RISKS DIGEST 13.84 that the Department of Defense
conducted an investigation when an message marked "T*p S*cr*t" was found on an
unclassified computer system.  (The asterisks are a way of ensuring that the
investigation is not triggered by the words in *his* message, I guess.)

I don't think merely putting the words "Top Secret" in a message is the
problem; putting it in in such a way that it appears to be classified data
*is*.

I have, in the past, held both Department of Energy and Department of Defense
clearances, and if I learned anything it is that the security personnel of both
agencies take their jobs very seriously and do not have much of a sense of
humor where security violations are concerned.

In my initial briefings for these clearances it was emphasized that classified
information must be strictly controlled, and in fact we were given specific
procedures for what to do if we found unattended classified documents lying
around.

It appears that [the author] thinks that the "system wide disclaimers that said
systems are not to be used for classified work" should have been sufficient to
prevent action.  I feel that the exact reverse is true -- the appearance of an
APPARENTLY classified message on an insecure* computer is exactly the kind of
security violation that needs to be investigated immediately.

In fact, I can remember one company that sent out "Top Secret" press releases
to their customers -- which included some DoE and DoD sites -- getting an
unpleasant visit from men with dark suits and sunglasses that didn't smile
much.  (The gist was "Don't *do* that".)

"The Hacker Crackdown: Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier", Bruce
Sterling, Bantam Books, November 1992, ISBN 0-553-08058-X, 328pp, US$23.

Book Review by Dave Barker-Plummer (plummer@cs.swarthmore.edu)

"The Hacker Crackdown" is Bruce Sterling's term for a series of seizures of
computer equipment which took place during the summer of 1990.  The
circumstances surrounding these raids, the individuals and communities affected
by them, and the consequences for the computing community and society at large,
are the subjects of this book.

Sterling, a cyberpunk author, is at his best when he is telling stories.  He
adopts a revelatory style and writes in a tone of wonder and bemusement as
events take one unexpected turn after another.  Particularly intriguing is his
telling of the Craig Neidorf/Knight Lightning story.  Neidorf was prosecuted
for electronically distributing an edited version of a document copied without
permission from a BellSouth computer.  Sterling documents the history of the
document as it was sent across the Internet many times, its publication in the
"Phrack" newsletter, the arrest of Neidorf, the charges against him and the
eventual collapse of the trial.  As the story unfolds, one realises that truth
is indeed stranger than even Sterling's bleak cyberpunk fiction.

There are many other stories in the book: the story of Steve Jackson, whose
legitimate games company was raided under sealed warrant, and all of his
computers seized; the story of The Legion of Doom, a group of hackers who
assemble in cyberspace to brag about breaking into computers and sharing stolen
access codes and credit card numbers; the story of the founding of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation by Mitch Kapor, author of Lotus 1-2-3, and John
Perry Barlow, sometime lyricist for The Grateful Dead; and closing the book,
the story of the Computers, Privacy and Freedom conference of 1992, in which
hackers, law enforcement, and civil libertarian groups met to talk about these
issues with unprecedented openness.

Sterling attempts to make these stories take second place to the culture, or
more correctly cultures, of cyberspace.  He chooses to structure his book in
four main parts, each dealing with one of these subcultures.  While hacker
stories have been told before, this examination of cultures has been neglected,
and Sterling is to be praised for attempting it.  However, Sterling does not
seem to comfortable in his self-appointed role.  Try as he might, the events
keep overtaking the people, and the book ends up feeling somewhat confused ---
but then the whole subject is rife with confusion: cultural, technical and
ethical.

Although Sterling fails to give it the emphasis it deserves, the main theme of
this book is power.  In the first part of the book "Crashing the System",
Sterling describes the power of the telephone companies.  From the fledgling
technology of the telephone, through the rise of AT&amp;T, and the significant role
that it played in government and industry, to the break up of the Baby Bells.
The picture that Sterling paints of the contemporary telcos is that of a power
base that is under threat, and which is struggling to preserve its grip on the
power that is being threatened by the more widespread availability of
technology, not to mention the breaking of the economic monopoly.  Lest this
sounds like dull reading --- there's not a sentence in this book that can be
described as dull --- I should mention that Sterling brings this history to
life by taking us in detail through the duties of a switchboard operator, and
observing that in the early days of the telephone teenage boys often played
this role until they were found to be "hacking", when they were ejected from
the system.  There are intriguing parallels between the time just after the
introduction of the telephone --- which Sterling identifies as the creation of
cyberspace --- and the contemporary era, which represents the settling of that
"place".

The second section of the book, "The Digital Underground", documents the hacker
subculture.  Sterling steers a journalistic middle course: on the one hand
stressing the illegality of hacking and debunking the myth of the talented
genius, while at the same time pointing out that the typical hacker is not a
hardened criminal but a teenage boy.  Sterling explains the feeling of
technical power for a hacker when he uses a computer to break into a voice mail
PBX, or to break into a password protected system, to gain access to hitherto
inaccessible regions of cyberspace.  Sterling makes much of the isolation and
cultural powerlessness of hackers: they are typically teenage boys who grew up
in the Reagan era and have come to believe that all institutions are corrupt,
and who see their computer and modem as weapons against those institutions,
even if it is only to steal insignificant documents, or do no more than
irritate those institutions.  He also describes the material available on
"underground" BBSs, illustrating the anarchistic stances adopted by these elite
children of elite families, and debunks the myth that there are "gangs" of
hackers working in concerted effort to bring about the downfall of the
technocracy as we know it, but asserts that their's is typically a solitary
"game".  This isolation leads to their need to brag of their exploits to other
hackers, in order to build a reputation, and often thereby to their swift
arrest.  Isolation also accounts for the fact that almost every hacker arrested
cooperated fully and informed on his contacts in cyberspace.  There is no
hacker community, Sterling implies, and no honour among hackers.

In the third section, "Law and Order", Sterling describes the world of the law
enforcement officers.  If one thing comes through from this picture it is that
the law enforcement agencies in this country were/are ill-prepared to
investigate and prosecute computer crime.  Sterling remarks that he, a not
particularly computer-literate, author has more computer power in his home than
the typical computer law enforcement officer (of 1990).  Sterling describes the
modus operandi of a typical hacker bust, the seizure of everything that looks
like it might be relevant including CDs (that might store data and be disguised
as music CDs), and Sony Walkmen (because they are electronics, I guess).  In
his article "Crime and Puzzlement", John Perry Barlow writes "In fairness, one
can imagine the government's problem.  This is all pretty magical stuff to
them.  If I were trying to terminate the operations of a witch coven, I'd
probably seize everything in sight.  How would I tell the ordinary household
brooms from the getaway vehicles?".  While Sterling's description of the
problems facing the under-funded, under-equipped and under-skilled government
agencies is sympathetic, he does not seek to justify the excesses in the events
of 1990.  He carefully makes and maintains the distinction between hackers from
legitimate computer users, and describes how members of both of these groups
were equally punished by the Hacker Crackdown.

Finally, in "The Civil Libertarians" Sterling describes the response of the
Silicon Valley and Austin computer culture to the strange events of the hacker
crackdown, which culminated in the formation of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation.  In this very upbeat section, Sterling describes how the computer
elite used their technological power to network and organize, to seize the
public relations advantage, to file suit in defense of Steve Jackson and Craig
Niedorf and to set themselves up to defend civil liberties in cyberspace.  In
the view of the civil libertarians, the hacker crackdown was the first skirmish
in the battle for control of cyberspace.  The Electronic Frontier is a new
"place" that is currently being populated and the rules that will govern this
place are up for grabs.  The civil libertarians are concerned to guarantee
important rights for the citizenry of cyberspace, in particular: freedom of
expression, freedom of association and privacy: in effect a constitution for
cyberspace.

"The Hacker Crackdown" taught me much about the events of the early 90s and it
is entertaining and provoking by turns.  I recommend it highly, for its
discussion of the contemporary struggle for technological power, illustrated by
unbelievable, but true, stories of law and disorder on the electronic frontier.

Today I bought gasoline and discovered that the station had some fancy new
pumps with credit card readers built right in.  You can drive up, insert your
card, pump gas, and drive away, without even dealing with a clerk.  The pump
prints a little receipt when you're finished.

The problem is the receipt.  It comes out behind a small clear plastic door
(presumably the door is to protect the printer from the weather); you have to
slide it open so that you can fish the receipt out, slightly awkwardly, with
your finger.  If you don't notice the receipt at all, or if you're in a hurry,
or if you aren't in the habit of saving receipts anyway, you could easily leave
it behind.

On the receipt is printed not only your credit card number and type of card
(VISA, MC, etc.), but also your full name, as retrieved from the magstripe.

If Bonnie S. Thomason happens to read this, you forgot your receipt after
buying 13.855 gallons of unleaded at 7:59 this morning, but I promise I won't
use or disclose your credit card number.

Wandering around checking these receipt slots would be reminiscent of wandering
around checking pay telephone coin return slots, but potentially much more
lucrative.

Besides RISKS, I'm writing a letter to the oil company in question today.
     
     [This is of course an old problem for RISKS readers, but it is perhaps
     worth including here as a reminder that it recurs continually.  PGN]

    Scope

The importance of understanding Computer System failures, in terms of their
fault and error models, failure patterns, and characteristics cannot be over
emphasized.  This understanding is critical in influencing the research and
practice of fault-tolerant computing.  It is the kernel upon which evaluation
methods, experimental verification, modeling, algorithms and techniques are
developed.  In recent years the relative mix in the causes of outage has
shifted from what it was a decade ago.  Studies indicate the dominance of
software as a cause of outage, closely followed by maintenance and environment.
However, the industry lacks data and understanding of faults, errors and
failures in these dimensions - severely impacting the progress of
fault-tolerant computing as a research discipline and a practice.


This workshop is intended to bring together experts from industry, academia,
and government.  The goal is to develop the needed insight, define and
calibrate models, and gain knowledge to guide research and practice in
fault-tolerant computing.  This workshop will be highly interactive.  It will
be run as a workshop, and will not have a conference flavor.  It is intended
that at the end of the two day meeting, there will evolve a substantial
accomplishment towards these goals.  These results are intended to be the
starting point of a sequel to this workshop, on fault-injection.  The
fault-injection workshop, also sponsored by the Technical Committee on
Fault-Tolerant Computing, is planned to be held in Sweden in June 1993.

    Submission

To participate in this workshop, submit seven copies (or use email) of a two
page abstract describing the contribution you will make to the workshop.  The
program committee will review the abstracts and notify you of your acceptance.
To enhance interaction the attendance at the workshop will be limited to a
maximum of fifty.

			   CALL FOR PAPERS
		COMPUTER SECURITY FOUNDATIONS WORKSHOP VI
			  June 15-17, 1993
		     Franconia, New Hampshire
		Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers in computer
science to examine foundational issues in computer security, with emphasis on
formal models that provide a framework for theories of security and techniques
for verifying security as defined by these theories.

We are interested both in papers that describe new results in the theory of
computer security and in papers, panels, and working group exercises that
explore open questions and raise fundamental concerns about current theories of
security. Possible topics include access control, covert channels, information
flow, database security, secure protocols, verification techniques, integrity
and availability models, interactions of computer security requirements with
other system requirements such as dependability and timing, and the role of
formal methods in computer security.

The proceedings are published by the IEEE Computer Society and will be
available at the workshop. Selected papers will be invited for publication in a
special issue of the Journal of Computer Security.

Instructions for Participants:  Workshop attendance will be limited to 
thirty-five participants.  Prospective participants should send four copies
of a paper (limit 7500 words), panel proposal, or working group exercise to 
Catherine Meadows, Program Chair, at the address below. Please provide email
addresses and telephone numbers (voice and fax) for all authors.
The contact author should be clearly identified.

IMPORTANT DATES: Author's submission:        January 29, 1993
                 Notification of acceptance: March 10, 1993

Several people on the west coast of the US reported that their Unix
systems failed to switch from daylight savings time to standard time
yesterday, 25 October 1992.  The reason?  When they originally
configured their systems, they were asked to choose one of the
following time zone rules:

	US/Alaska	US/Central	US/Hawaii	US/Pacific
	US/Aleutian	US/East-Indiana	US/Michigan	US/Pacific-New
	US/Arizona	US/Eastern	US/Mountain	US/Samoa
	...

Some people chose `US/Pacific-New' instead of `US/Pacific'.
After all, who wants the old version when you can have the new version?

Unfortunately, `US/Pacific-New' stands for ``Pacific Presidential Election
Time'', which was passed by the House in April 1989 but never signed into law.
In presidential election years, this rule would have delayed the PDT-to-PST
switchover until after the election, to lessen the effect of broadcast news
election projections on last-minute west-coast voters.  Thus, US/Pacific-New
and US/Pacific have always been identical -- until yesterday.

This problem comes from combining Arthur David Olson's deservedly popular time
zone software (which you can FTP from elsie.nci.nih.gov in pub/tz92b.tar.Z)
with some overly terse vendor-supplied installation procedures.  No doubt Olson
did not use a more informative name like `US/Pacific-Presidential-Election'
because of the 14-character file name length limit in many Unix file systems.
In view of yesterday's experience, though, it seems unwise to make the
hypothetical choice available under any name, since it gives free rein to
Murphy's Law.

In the Los Angeles Times business section on Monday, 5 October 1992, there was
an article describing some of the difficulties of Symantec, a publisher of
software for the Macintosh and IBM-PC markets.  One of the more interesting
situations for the company was a criminal complaint and civil suit filed by
Borland International charging a former Borland vice president with passing
trade secrets.

&gt;From the article:
   (Eugene) Wang, disappointed after a management reshuffle two months earlier,
resigned from Borland earlier the same day [that Symantec announced he had been
hired as a vice president].  Acting on a tip, Borland officials searched
records of electronic mail that Wang had sent via MCI Mail.  They found ten
messages he had sent to Eubanks and others that allegedly contained proprietary
information on Borland's product plans.
   Normally, that might lead to a civil suit.  Such actions have become
relatively common in an industry where the expertise of a few people is often a
company's key asset.
   But Borland took matters a step further, filing a criminal complaint with
the Scotts Valley Police Department in addition to a civil suit.  Police said
they found the information in the messages sufficient grounds to seek a search
warrant [for Symantec's offices and Wang's home.]...
   Legal experts who aren't involved in the case don't know what to make of it.
``At first blush, it seems like they (Borland) must have had some pretty good
evidence,'' said Kaufman of [Brobeck, Phleger, and Harrison, a San Francisco
law firm].  ``But it's bizarre -- Wang, a premier computer scientist, doesn't
know that when you use MCI mail, it's recorded?  It's a very strange set of
facts.

There is an article on risk in today's (Monday, 26 October 1992) UK
Independent newspaper (p14) which RISKS readers may find interesting
entitled "The chances of being run over by a bus" by Tom Wilkie. It
advertises two reports which sound as if they are worth looking at:

"The Tolerability of Risk from Nuclear Power Stations", HMSO,
PO Box 276, London SW8 5DT, UK. (12 pounds sterling.)

"Risk: Analysis, Perception and Management", The Royal Society,
6 Carlton House Terrace, London SW1Y 5AG, UK. (15.50 pounds sterling.)

The latter values "a statistical life" at 2-3 millions pounds sterling
(c $4 million) in that this is the sort of amount of money that should
be spent on saving one life. However the article states that John
MacGregor, the Secretary of State for Transport, for his department
values a life at only around 500,000 pounds sterling.

(Of course, the value of a human life in the UK has been devalued by about 10%
recently. :-)

"Designed as a textbook for courses in ethics, this book provides the material
needed to understand the accidents in which more than 700 people were killed--
accidents that many believe were the result of unethical actions and inactions
by individuals, organizations, and government agencies.  An introduction to
ethical analysis and discussions of the ethical responsibilities involved are
also provided.  The case study offers material for a sustained inquiry into
every level of ethical responsibility reflecting the rich complexity of actual
events.

"_The DC-10 Case_ presents these issues through a collection of original and 
published articles, excerpts from official accident reports, congressional 
hearings, and other writings on the DC-10.  The authors allow the readers to 
examine the ethical issues of airline safety as they actually occur, taking 
account of the circumstances in which they arise.

Of course, as RISKS readers know, getting rid of information is very difficult.
On the PC erase only erases the name of a file not the contents.  With proper
backup, as Oliver North discovered, it is very hard to remove all copies of
data.  There are also other caches such as email pools where one might be able
to retrieve recent data.

There is a more general issue of living in a society with a very good memory.
It is one thing to knowingly do something illegal and leaving a trail.  A more
subtle danger is a changing society that might look back at an innocuous act
and ex post facto, decide it was reprehensible.

The software used here is probably very simple.  When a computer file is
"erased", actually only the directory entry is changed, and the sectors used
are marked as again being available for use.  The file can easily be
"undeleted": numerous utilities exist for this purpose, including (I am
assuming, from the original posting, that the computer in question uses MS-DOS)
one that is part of the MS-DOS 5 system.  In fact, such utilities need not be
used: if no changes have been made on the disk, the FAT can be changed manually
with a sector editing program.

If the file cannot be "undeleted" in this manner, part of the file may still
exist on the disk, and can be read with a sector editor or viewer.  (I recently
checked a diskette with the CHKDSK utility, and found portions of files that
had been deleted three or four years ago.  This particular disk has been in
daily use with three or four large files being written to it each day.)

The fact that files are not actually "destroyed" has come as a shock to a
number of people.  I seem to recall that this fact had some significance to
Ollie North.  Also, Prodigy scared the pants off some people by creating a
large "swap" file area on disk without "clearing" it first.  Portions of
deleted files were, of course, found within it, leading to (somewhat
unjustified) charges that Prodigy was somehow violating system security.

The fact that erased files may still physically exist is one that some
antiviral programs try to address.  When an infected file cannot be
"disinfected", some antivirals will delete the existing file ... and then
overwrite the area previously occupied with standard characters.  There are
utility programs which will do this with files you wish to keep secret: some
make five or more passes with different characters each time.

&gt;In my initial briefings for these clearances it was emphasized that classified

Political columnist William Safire told the story that he would get his
personal documents past government security officers by putting a printed
heading on each document.  The heading came from a very high security level
document that he once saw as part of reporting.  All went fine for a long time
because he could take his "protected" document that contained his notes into
meetings.  Unfortunately, one day a security person confiscated the document
because he wasn't supposed to have such a highly secret codeword on it!

This is analogous to protective coloration in nature...

COMPUTERS SECURITY AND THE LAW, 
A CONFERENCE TO BE HELD AT THE UNIVERSITY OF YORK
31 March - 01 April 1993

The conference will be run by the Department of Computer Science at the
University of York in association with the Licensing Executives Society and the
Society of Computers and the Law.

The aim of the conference is to highlight some of the important legal issues
that surround the use, and abuse, of computer technology in a way that should
be accessible to the non-specialist, such as lawyers or computer scientists.

The target audience for the conference are senior managers and others in both
public and private sector organisations who wish to improve their knowledge
about the legal aspects of buying, using or creating computer related products
and services. The conference will be of interest to the police, the civil
service, banks, insurance and building societies.

The programme will take place over two consecutive days.  The first day will
deal with the legal aspects of intellectual property rights, copyright and
contract law as it relates to computer products and services. The second day
will deal with the topics of computer crime and its prevention, security, data
protection and privacy.

The conference dinner will be held at the end of the first day with a keynote
speaker who will provide the link between the themes. Delegates will be able to
register for either of the two days separately if they wish.

Proceedings of the conference will be published and available to participant
after the conference.

FEES: Fees will range from #275 for the full conference to #165 for one day.
Discounts are available for early booking.

THE UNIVERSITY OF YORK is situated in Heslington, two miles away from the
centre of York. The campus has been described as one of the finest examples of
twentieth century English romantic landscape architecture. Its main feature is
a large man-made lake supporting a wide variety of wild fowl.

The Department of Computer Science has an international reputation for being at
the leading edge of developments in the fields of Software Engineering, Safety
Critical Systems, Human Computer Interaction and New Computer Architectures It
has recently expanded both its teaching and research to include the many
faceted and dynamic field of the application of Information Technology to
Business Management and maintains many contacts in both industry and government
agencies.

LICENSING EXECUTIVES SOCIETY
The Society is committed to providing education and information to present and
future users of licensing, and gladly supports the University of York in this
conference, which will answer an ever increasing demand in the business and
licensing communities for up-to-date information on this important subject.

SOCIETY OF COMPUTERS AND THE LAW
The Society was founded in 1973 as a forum to promote the effective and
profitable use of computer technology for lawyers.  The Society informs and
promotes interest both in the development of information technology for the
practice and teaching of law, as well as in the law relating to computers - not
only for Society members but also for members of the public at large.

... &gt;5. Listen in and decrypt the communications.

With all due respect to Mrs. Denning, I suspect that item number five would not
be "Listen in and decrypt the communications" but rather "Listen in and
discover that a secondary encryption was also used".

Anyone intelligent enough to realize that a process for disclosure existed
would be intelligent enough to use the approved scheme to mask the real
encryption, or even just to use a different key from the "approved" one if they
really had something to hide.

The only advantage to the suggested scheme would be to the "bad guys" since
steps 1-5 would have to be processed before the deception would be discovered -
or is there a suggestion that "someone" should randomly test messages to see if
the approved key is sufficient to decrypt ?

Point is, the technology exists to encrypt transmissions, even if it is as
simple as the DE knowing that when I say "stop" I really mean "go". Legislating
breakability has about as much chance as commanding the sun to rise in the
East: it will appear to be effective only until it is tested.

1) Can you trust the criminals to provide the keys to their data and to use

   what's the point?

2) If you send mangled random data (garbage), can you be prosecuted for not
   giving the Gov't the proper keys?  Will they believe your assertion that
   your transmission was truly meaningless?

3) What exactly are the anticipated benefits of registering keys with a federal

In Risks 13.86, Dorothy Denning claims that it is easy to set up a government
depository into which all decryption keys for all encrypted messages send over
public networks which would be safe from non-court ordered government
interception.  I must disagree.  Her plan is (quoting):

     [U]sing a public-key system, your key could be encrypted under the public
     key belonging to, say, the Justice Dept.  The encrypted key would be given
     to and held by an independent agency.  But, the key could be decrypted
     only by Justice.  Thus, if somone gains access to a key held by the key
     agency, they wouldn't be able to decrypt it.

     To use a key, law enforcers would have to go through these steps:

     1.  Get a court order. ...

However, if the _Justice Department_ gains access to a key held by the agency
(or the agency's whole database), they would indeed be able to decrypt traffic.
For Dr. Denning's scheme to work, I have to trust the "independent" agency not
to collude with the Justice Department.  I certainly would not trust any
executive branch agency not to cooperate with another executive branch agency.
It is also extremely unlikely a "key agency" would be formed outside of the
Executive.  The only precedent I can think of is the Federal Reserve system,
and even its independence in circumstances of significant interest to the
executive (e.g. interest rates around election time) is suspect.

In my personal opinion, Dr.  Denning's proposal does not adequately address the
issues raised by socio-political context of her weak encryption scheme.
Without extremely stiff penalties and personal liability for illegal decryption
in addition to a technical system that identified decrypting parties, it is
hard to imagine how any system could require key registration and still offer
some protection against nonwarrant government surveillance.  The political
difficulty of passing legislation that involves the potential for such
penalties to be applied to law enforcement officers suggests to me that all
"weak" schemes are unlikely to offer such protection.

But there is in fact no such agency in the federal government, which means
that all such discussion is empty theorizing.  Judging the events of the
last several decades make me pessimistic that we could ever have one (again?).

The top news item in the UK last night on the main BBC television news
programmes, and this morning in the national papers, was the trouble at the
London Ambulance Service, in particular with their computer-based ambulance
dispatching system. (These problems have featured on RISKs before.  [Yes,
<A HREF="/Risks/13.38.html">RISKS-13.38</A>, 42, 43]) However previous complaints, warnings and campaigns about
delayed ambulance dispatching had had little effect, so that the situation has
been allowed to reach a crisis point, with what sound to be credible reports of
a number of deaths being caused this week as a result of introducing the latest
stage of computerization. No doubt many more stories will follow, but below is
the entirety of the front page report in today's Independent.  Brian Randell


  AMBULANCE CHIEF QUITS AFTER PATIENTS DIE IN COMPUTER CRASH
  By Ian MacKinnon and Stephen Goodwin

  The Chief executive of the London Ambulance Service resigned yesterday over
allegations that up to 20 people may have died because of the collapse of a new
computer system controlling emergency calls.  Virginia Bottomley, Secretary of
Sate for Health, was forced to announce an external inquiry into the 36 hours
over Monday and Tuesday which led to delays of up to three hours in ambulances
arriving.

Nupe, the public employees' union which represents ambulance staff, said that
the resignation of John Wilby was recognition of management failure, but the
Government was to blame for years of underfunding.  Mrs. Bottomley's response
to the "teething troubles" with the 1.5m computer system introduced in stages
since January drew angry responses from both backbenches.  David Blunkett,
Labour health spokesman, demanded that outside managerial expertise be brought
in and accused Mrs. Bottomley of failing to respond to the clear signs of
crisis which has been building up for months.

Despite union warnings management brought the computer-aided dispatch system
fully on stream at 3a.m.on Monday giving cross-London coverage for the first
time.  The capital had been divided into three sectors - south of the Thames,
north-east and north-west - with teams sending ambulances in their area by a
combination of two-way radio and telephone, and computer displays in vehicles.
Attempts to introduce the system partially in March collapsed.

The full introduction of the computer system effectively did away with the
radio and telephone calls to stations, with the computer dispatching crews to
answer calls.  But within hours, during the morning rush, it became obvious to
crews and control room staff that calls were going missing in the system;
ambulances were arriving late or doubling up on calls.  Distraught emergency
callers were also held in a queuing system which failed to put them through for
up to 30 minutes.

Chris Humphreys, Nupe's divisional officer, said that it was hard to verify how
many people might have died because of the delays but it could be as many as
20.  However, the ambulance service contradicted claims that one 14-year-old
boy had died of an asthma attach after waiting 45 minutes.  It said that the
call was dealt with in 28 minutes - although the Patient's Charter has a target
of 14 minutes.  A man of 83 was also said to have died before the service
reverted to the old system at 2p.m. on Tuesday.

Management said initially yesterday that control room staff had been overloaded
by the new system as they tried to respond to the extraordinary level of calls.
But in the Commons Mrs. Bottomley conceded that the computer system "broke
down" and that the old system would remain in operation until the problems had
been solved.

Martin Gorham, deputy chief executive of South West Thames Regional Health
Authority, is to take over from Mr. Wilby until a replacement is found.  Mrs.
Bottomley said that chief executive of another metropolitan ambulance service
would be appointed to head the inquiry, which would be made public as soon as
possible.  But her responses and earlier failures to act on numerous warnings
left MPs dismayed.  David Mellor, MP for Putney, called in his first Commons
contributions since resigning as Secretary of State for Heritage for "top to
bottom reform".

The UK media have had a field day in the last four days with the inauguration
of the new Command and Control System for the London Ambulance Service. The
press concentration has centred upon the delays experienced by people calling
the service (up to eleven hours in a few cases). One distraught ambulance
driver was interviewed and recounted that the police are saying "Nice of you to
turn up" and other things. As of 23:00 last night Oct 28 the LAS instigated a
backup procedure to ensure that calls were handled in a timely fashion.

Several issues that the press did not cover were:

   o There appears to have been NO backup procedure at all.
   o The design of user interface was inadequate.
   o No consideration was given to system overload was made.

The good news is that the first seems now to have been recitified. 

However, the second problem is the one that worries me the most. Much of the TV
coverage centred upon shots of the Control Room itself.  Wow, this is full of
the latest technology---lots of fancy graphic screens showing maps and other
goodies.  There are trackerballs for the operators to play with.  The
utilisation of all of this stuff is however flawed.  Many times the newscaster
quoted operators saying this like:

   o there was no way to scroll back through the list of calls to ensure
     that a vehicle had actually been dispatched
   o the exception list just kept growing
   
(I'll stop typing their comments as it just becomes too depressing.)

The estimate is that 20 people are now dead who would otherwise still be alive.

The International Conference on Structural Failure, Product Liability and
Technical Insurance, held every 3 years in Vienna, was last held in July 1992.
This year's conference covered a wide range of topics.  An incomplete list:

 - failure case studies (e.g. lots of bridges)
 - failure analysis using mathematical models and computer
   simulations (e.g. NW Detroit MD80 crash)
 - the influence of computer animation on court decisions
 - international liability law
 - corrosion
 - not much on computer risks though

It turned out to be a real interdisciplinary(engineers of many disciplines +
lawyers ) and very international event. Some of the presentations were very
professional, e.g.  those of lawyers describing the use of computer animation
at court.

Proceedings announced to appear in Elsevier later this year.

In the November, 1992, issue of ONLINE, is a horrifying article (pp. 103 - 105)
in the "Legal Briefing" department by one Teresa Pritchard-Schoch, entitled,
"Information America: A Tool for the Knight in Shining Armor."  The author
gushes on about what a wonderful boon the Information America database service
is for lawyers (her "Knights in Shining Armor") and others.  A few extended
quotes:

  "In one interesting case we (the research staff at a law firm)
  investigated an entire jury's background before the members were
  even selected.  The case involved three affluent plaintiffs. . . .
  Our goal was to find a jury who would not have any sympathy for
  the plaintiffs . . . .  By checking a motor vehicles license
  database and real estate property records, we were able to compile a
  jury whose members all except one drove cars more than six years old.
  Moreover, no one on the jury owned any real estate.  Online sources
  also revealed facts about the jury members' likes and dislikes which
  were subtly used to influence them at trial.  The opposing counsel was
  completely unaware of the tactics our firm used and probably still
  wonders why he lost that case. . . ."

  "Information America databases for investigative services include
  Sleuth, Asset Locator, Executive Affiliation, People Finder, Business
  Finder, and Litigation Prep.
  
  "Sleuth searches millions of public records from both state and county
  sources, including corporate and limited partnership records, UCC and
  lien filings, . . . assumed and fictitious names. . . .  The
  relationships between individuals and business would be almost
  impossible to duplicate manually. . . ."
  
  "Asset Locator search real property records, aircraft registration
  . . ., stock holdings . . ., and personal property locators. . . . A
  real property search for transfers, rather than holdings, is also
  available. . . ."
  
  "People Finder accesses 111 million names, 92 million households and 61
  million telephone numbers.  The profile obtained includes the current
  address, telephone number, residence type, length of residence,
  gender, date of birth, up to four household members and their dates of
  birth, and up to ten neighbors and their names and addresses.  The
  sources of information . . . include telephone directories, the U.S.
  Postal Service's change of address file, direct marketing records,
  publishers' address files, driver's license files, voter registration
  records, birth and wedding announcements, etc."

The author acknowledges that "many . . . feel somewhat unsettled" about her
accounts, and that "Others are uneasy about increasing availability of private
information about their personal lives."  But, she argues, "this information
has always been available."

I know that commercial credit-reporting firms, such as TRW, must make
individuals' files available to them for inspection and correction.  Do such
laws apply to database services such as Information America as well?  Do any
states provide individuals with rights concerning the commercial use of
personal information identified with them?  (In the case of credit services,
you usually sign away any privacy rights when you apply for credit, but I
wasn't aware that subscribing to a magazine resulted in the same forfeiture.)
Are there any other services such as this that provide comprehensive access to
a wide range of personal information about private citizens?

I have found that a single user can use up all the shared memory
segments that any Sun's kernel allows.  (Typically 100 segs of 1MB each,
max).  If these are not deallocated correctly, they linger until
the machine is rebooted.  Talk about "persistent" environments.

I noticed the article entitled "The NSF Net cable-cut story" in <A HREF="/Risks/13.86.html">RISKS-13.86</A>.
It clearly looked bogus (9.6k?  Come on!), so I asked around a bit.  Doug
Humphrey had the answer.  I have appended his description of the real story
below (with his permission).

The RISK here is in believing everything you read...

&gt; Subject: [jgs@merit.edu: Re: .0045 mbits/sec]
&gt; 
&gt; Concerning the message in RISKS, here is the story; I hope
&gt; that you find it as funny as I did.
&gt; 
&gt; A guy from JvNCnet sent out a message about the T3 being cut, 
&gt; and mentioning that traffic was being routed over their T1
&gt; connection until the "backhoe fade" was over.  Just for fun, 
&gt; I modified the message and sent it to a private mailing list.
&gt; The mods that I made were the name of the org (I called if JNvCnet)
&gt; and the speed of the backup feed (I said 9.6k rather than T1)
&gt; and of course I gave it a title of .0045mbits per second.
&gt; I also changed the name of the sender to Steve Martin (a famous
&gt; comedy person).
&gt; 
&gt; In any case, I sent this to a small, private group of network
&gt; heavies, to whom it would be grand fun.  Imagine my surprise 
&gt; when people from around the world start forwarding copies of 
&gt; RISKS to me with congrats on having such an obvious spoof 
&gt; published as fact!  Obviously one of them liked it enough
&gt; that he sent it to RISKS.
&gt; 
&gt; In any case, the original sender name is lost to time; I don't
&gt; remember it.  It really was a pretty routine message from them,
&gt; ignoring the mods that I made.
&gt; 
&gt; So, that is the story.  I hope that helps explain it!

  ... indicates that over 75% of bank computer programs are written in a
  language appropriate to the task as opposed to trying to force their models
  into the latest Object Oriented fad and 84% of banking software is designed
  to run on systems that have low mean time between failures

By an amazing coincidence, I've been talking to people at a bank about their
current technology, and they are in something of a crisis. This is a large bank
that's in the process of taking over smaller banks, and they're currently
buying banks at the rate of 3-4 a month, but they're only able to deploy
systems at the rate of one every 3-4 months. They're also in a state where most
of their software was originally written in the early 70's, and now consists of
mostly patches to the original. Their solution? To hop on the OOP bandwagon,
and target PC's as the delivery vehicle.  Unfortunately, their idea of rapid
deployment is instead of taking 5 years to deploy a system to do it in 3, and
they're unwilling to give up their ingrained programming structure so they've
got 5 people spending six months on a program that took me an hour to
prototype.  (Not that I'm claiming to be a hot-shot programmer, only that if
you put too many people to solve a rather simple problem you're not going to go
anywhere) They've got the right idea, but the implementation sucks. It's also
interesting to note that the people who will be responsible for accepting
whether the new technology works are the people currently running the old
technology systems...

For some time, since the Electronics Communications Privacy Act was passed, it
is been a Federal crime in the U.S. to listen to communications carried out
over cellular telephone.  Only a handful of people have been prosecuted, mostly
cases where someone has taped a politician talking about things (sometimes
illegal things) over a cellphone and passed the tape on to the media.

More recently, manufacture and import of devices capable of receiving cellular
transmissions have been banned by the FCC.  Naturally this has resulted in a
run on radios which are 800MHz capable, or which can be easily modified to to
be so capable.

The reason the ban on both listening and making equipment capable of listening
is that the cellular phone lobby wants to be able to assure their potential
customers of privacy.

Comments about facist gov't aside, the risks should be obvious: if people
assume that a medium is secure, when in fact it is not only NOT secure, but is
rather heavily monitored, they are likely to say things they don't mean, or
which shouldn't be (literally) broadcast.  Currently the police use cellphones
extensively, as do drug dealers.  Court cases have stated that cordless phones
(the type which talk to the base-set in your house) are *not* protected under
the ECPA, and may be legally monitored, although there is reportedly a law in
CA which makes it illegal to do so.  In at least one case police have monitored
communications on a cordless phone, with a readily available scanner, and have
used evidence so gathered to prosecute an individual for drug related crimes.

Another interesting note is that the law specifically prohibits "scanning
receivers" which are, or may be made, cellular capable.  How this affects test
equipment, non scanning receivers, other cellphones, etc., remains to be
interpreted by a court.

Here is the partial text of the law.

In response to my earlier message about registering encryption keys, some
people have asked how can I be sure that criminals won't use non-registered
keys.  I don't have a foolproof answer, but consider phone calls.  Most people
who want to encrypt will buy a commercial product with a built-in key.  The key
could be registered when the product is bought.  Yes there could be a black
market in non-compliant products, and the likelihood of that increases every
day that we fail to take action on this issue.

Peter Boucher also asked about the benefits of registering keys with a federal
agency.  After discussing this problem with law enforcement officials and
criminologists, I am convinced we are facing a potential crisis in law
enforcement if we lose the capability to conduct court authorized taps.  The
economic value alone of conducting lawful electronic surveillance is estimated
in the billions.  Much of this is related to organized crime.

Larry Hunter asked how can we be sure that the key centers won't collude with
the Department of Justice and give out the key.  If the relationship between
the phone companies and DOJ is any indication, this won't happen.  The folks at
the phone companies are so fussy about court orders that they send them back if
the semicolons aren't right.  And don't forget that even if the key center
(which I envisioned as a non-governmental agency) and DOJ collude, they still
need to get the bit stream from the phone companies.  But if this doesn't
satisfy you, Silvio Micali has an even tighter scheme that would allow your
private key to be broken up into five piece and shared with 5 trustees.  All
five pieces would be needed to restore the key, but the pieces could be
verified as allowing proper restoration without the need to actually put them
together.  He calls this "fair public-key cryptosystems."

&gt;1) Can you trust the criminals to provide the keys to their data and to use
&gt;   those keys (and no others) when transmitting incriminating data?  If not,
&gt;   what's the point?

Actually, my favorite solution to this criminal problem is to use a one-time
pad. Then it is possible to come up with two keys. One that decrypts the
conversation into a benign one and one that decrypts it into the real message.

For instance:

Message:   P  L  U  T  O  N  I  U  M  R  E  A  D  Y

Key # 1:   1  4 10  5  7  8 12 19  4  3 10 19 21 10

Crypttext: Q  P  E  Y  V  V  U  N  Q  U  O  T  Y  I

Key # 2:  10 24  0 24  2 19 13 25 14  6  3 19  5  4

Message 2: G  R  E  A  T  C  H  O  C  O  L  A  T  E  

So the criminals send key #1 to their cohorts and register key # 2 with the
Federal Key Exchange Registry. When the cops bug the line all they hear about
is the stories about their trip to Hershey PA.

Of course non-one-time-pad systems can't work this way.  DES can't be rigged
this way.

In Risks-13.87 a few people expressed concern that how one could trust a single
"independent" agency and whether such an agency exists or could ever be formed.
It seems that Prof. Denning's scheme could be easily extended to use threshold
schemes (including threshold signature schemes) so that such trust is spread
among many (and perhaps mutually hostile) agencies to reduce the chance of
corruption and collusion.

&gt;I believe this scheme is pretty tight.  Silvio Micali has evidently invented
&gt;another method of safeguarding the keys in a registry, called "fair
&gt;cryptography", but I don't know the details.
&gt;                                                 Dorothy Denning

The scheme is not tight.  This assumes that the Executive branch:

1.	has a right to eavesdrop on citizens
2.	can be trusted not to exceed its authority

If you assume that the government agencies are those of the Nixon
Administration -- or worse, those which we would have had if Watergate
hadn't been exposed -- you need a much tighter protocol to prevent abuses.

You need to specify the characteristics of the key agency and the key
acquisition process so that even if the Executive branch is completely corrupt,
the rights of the citizens are protected.  You should probably also allow for
the possibility of collusion by the Supreme Court, given what we've seen in
recent years.

So, how about a protocol in which approval of all three branches of government
-- and probably both the house and senate -- hopefully with a majority vote in
each -- is needed for each specific key -- or better yet, for each message in
each key?  Let those branches cooperate in decrypting the session key for a
message and let them deliver the decrypted message (or session key) to the FBI.
If that were part of the protocol, then I'd believe that you're getting close
to the kind of protection which US citizens deserve.

Of course, the proper solution is an amendment to the Constitution
guaranteeing a right to privacy for all citizens -- probably prohibiting
all wiretaps, in the process.

I'm told that the State of Alaska has a guaranteed right to privacy.

If that's true, are wiretaps allowed on calls within the state?

Given the attitude of the FBI/NSA/DEA/et al., as to warrantless searches, the
ability of NSA to tap most communications without the service providers
knowledge and the current circus of everybody investigating everybody WRT
Iraqgate, I fear Ms. Denning places a little too much trust in the
trustworthiness of the Federal Government.

Incidentally, she appears to overlook the risk after step 3: my key, in
plaintext, is available to anybody with access to the paperwork for the
triggering investigation.  Furthermore, given the propensity of the Federales
to engage in "shotgun" type investigations - witness Operation Sun Devil - my
crypto security may be compromised for completely fallacious reasons.

It just *so* happened that I was in France last week (on something completely
unrelated: an ISO meeting). I dropped into the office of a certain lawyer in
Paris on my way out and back.

On the way out, he gave me a photocopy of an article in "Le Canard Echaine", 
about Michel Asseline's book about the Habsheim crash. On the way back, he 
gave me two photocopies of articles in "L'Alsace" (regional newspaper serving 
Habsheim and surroundings), and "Le Monde", which had appeared that very day 
(Friday 30th Oct.) or the day before. 

The last two articles are detailed accounts of the "descente intempestive" 
which has been reported recently. If what the articles say is true, then it 
looks as though all bets are off regarding Bangalore, Strasbourg, AND the 
A300 and A310 crashes in Kathmandu. 

To summarise: When "rate of descent" mode is selected, (as opposed to "flight 
path angle"), a fault in the FMGS software occasionally causes the aircraft to 
descend at **2 or 3 times** the rate selected by the pilots. 

They don't even NEED to confuse "rate of descent" and "flight path angle"!!! 

This was reported by several crews who were able to recover the situation 
because they weren't flying over mountains at the time. 

The FMGS software (I *think*) is NOT regarded as SAFETY-CRITICAL!!!! 

If this is so, then it is NOT certified to RTCA/DO-178A level 1. 

The SAME FMGS is in use on A300, A310, and A320 (at least, *basically* the 
same)!! 

The French pilots' unions are up in arms about it, and in France generally, 
all hell seems to be breaking loose. 

Typically, in the UK press, the silence is deafening. (Presumably none of 
their French correspondents can speak French! :-) 

The other thing that my French lawyer colleague gave me was a signed copy of 
Michel Asseline's book about Habsheim: "Le Pilote - Est-il Coupable?" 
(You've guessed! He's Asseline's solicitor! :-) 

Since I read French even more agonisingly slowly than I read English, you'll 
have to wait a while for my detailed review. In the meantime, I will try to 
find time in the next few days to translate the three newspaper articles. 

If anyone sees anything in the media (French, UK, US and all points between),
let us all know.

Pete 

PS: If anyone knows of a publisher willing to handle the forthcoming English 
translation of Asseline's book, let me know about that, too.

&gt; Apparently, so I am told, CFCs have been replaced in these aerosols by
&gt; flammable propellants. 

Come back CFCs, all is forgiven! 

Actually, I suspect that most of the CFCs that hit the ozone layer come from 
decommissioned refrigerators or industrial waste, and not from you or I 
spraying our hair or computer screens. (Prince Charles is reported to have 
banned the use of CFC aerosols in the Palace. "Every little helps!", as the 
wren said when she pee'd in the ocean! :-) 

Why not go for the "Pump and Spray" approach adopted by a certain manufacturer 
of hair laquer? The lid of the can activates a pump. You push it up and down a 
few times to pressurise the can, and then spray out the contents with a 
propellant no more polluting (or inflammable) than compressed air.

&gt; In a three-month study of the Metro Toronto area earlier this summer, Bell
&gt; found that 80 percent of all cellular telephone traffic is monitored by third
&gt; parties.  Even more eye-opening is the fact that 60 percent of monitored calls
&gt; are taped for closer scrutiny and culling of marketable information.

I would very much like know how Bell Canada obtained these figures, given that
the monitoring of cellular telephone calls from the privacy of one's home is
essentially undetectable.

&gt; After discussing privacy laws, legalities, and realities, Flinn notes that at
&gt; Scanners Unlimited in San Carlos, CA, "about a quarter of the customers are
&gt; interested in telephone eavesdropping."

This problem will soon be stopped cold, as Congress recently passed a law to
outlaw the manufacture of scanners capable of receiving cellular telephone
calls. A truly inspired solution to the problem, comparable to the "B-Ark"
people in "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" burning down the forests to
solve the inflation problem caused by making leaves legal tender.

Not in my experience. (See RISKS about a year ago.) I simply forgot to take the
money, and the machine swallowed it. To get the amount credited to my account,
I had to 'phone the bank personally, and the amount was only repaid after the
till had been (manually) balanced, and the excess cash in stock verified.

I realize that this may be a bit out of the ordinary for a RISKS posting but
since Rob Slade raised the issue in RISKS yesterday, I have gotten quite a few
questions.

First, it is my belief that much of the RISKS of dial-up access points is
increased by the ease of discovering such points. War Dialer and Exchange
Hacker programs are plentiful and have contributed to a number of notorious
cases recently (the MOD is said to have used this method of discovering such
lines).

The problem is that with all current systems that I am aware of, it is first
necessary for the modem to answer the telephone before any authentication can
take place. By doing so, the line may be positively identified as having a
modem even if call-back or other rigorous identification means are in use.
Once such line have been identified, serious penetration attempts can take
place.

When announced, it was realized that Caller-ID provided an answer to this 
dilemma that was much better than the "ATS0=7" which I previously advised.
(This command instructs a modem responding to the "AT" command set not to
answer the phone until the seventh ring - typically about 40 seconds after
connection starts. Since most War Diallers allocate only 30 seconds to each
number, this is an effective, if annoying, answer).

Caller-ID places a 1200 baud digital signal on the telephone line between
the first and second ring signal. The important factor is that the phone
does not have to be answered to received this information. Some modems
are able to pick up this signal and present it to the host computer.

What I did last weekend was to create a PROCOMM PLUS script file using their
ASPECT language to do the following:

1) When the telephone rings the calling number is captured.

2) The number is recorded into a "LOG" file and then a scan of a database
   of "approved" numbers (flat ASCII) is done.

3a)If the number is found in the "approved" file, PROCOMM is instructed to
   enter its "HOST" mode - an effective single line BBS emulation that
   supports uploads/downloads/mail/and "chat" and the phone is answered.

or

3b)If the number is not found, the line is not answered

4) After the caller hangs up, the system resets.

Given this, even if the "bad guys" know the number, they will still have to
find a way to induce the modem to answer the line. Certainly if this were in
widespread use, much of the plot of "Sneakers" would have had to be re-written. 

Yes, I know that there are problems, particularly with "roving" people. If
however 80-90% of all access could be handled in this manner (e.g. for
telecommuters), the balance could use extraordinary means.

Right now the capability is limited to a PC running PROCOMM Plus 2.01
and equipped with a Supra Corp. SupraFAXmodem having the Caller-ID
ROM upgrade. I haven't tried any others.

Why did I choose this combination ? - because I had them (both were privately 
purchased) and they would do what was necessary - this is all a hobby 
to me. In theory any Caller-ID unit with an RS-232 output could be used
as could any scripting BBS software. What was desired was a "proof-of-
principle" not a commercial product.

The PRIVACY concern is easily handled: you can block your number from
Caller-ID (star-6-7 in most places) but I reserve the right not to have
my computer answer the phone if you do.

IMHO this capability is still in its infancy but is important and easily
implemented, we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg now.

Right now the biggest drawback is the limited availability of Caller-ID
though IMHO again it will be nationwide in two years (law enforcement
agencies already have a wider coverage so the holdup is political, not
technical).

RISKS ? To me the most important is the question "Could an individual
use star-6-7 to block the telco's ID and send their own 'approved'
1200 baud stream ?" The consensus so far is "NO" and I have some friends
at GTE experimenting.

In any event, the script is FreeWare for anyone who might be interested,
just be aware that I do not have any distribution means (might be able to 
send as E-Mail) and negative free time.

The importantance of this is that it is no longer theory, it is now fact, CHEAP
fact.

For further commentary on this issue, see the recent Forbes magazine article by
Mitch Kapor.  It raises the issues of how the ECPA Act and similar California
privacy legislation might apply to this case.  It will probably make a number
of lawyers rich and drag on for years, but there are some very complex legal
issues involved.  The issue involves MCI's responsibility as an e-mail provider
under ECPA and whether Borland was or was not authorized to have access to
Wang's mail.  I doubt that all the relevant facts are yet public.

There are two topics in <A HREF="/Risks/13.87.html">RISKS-13.87</A> that are actually related.  Someone asked
about software that could have been used to get the deleted files from the
Brazilian president's disks.  There was also a mention of the Symantec/Borland
suit over theft of trade secrets.  The Wall Street Journal had the most
complete article about the latter (I don't have the date handy) and mentioned
that Borland used a copy of a Symantec product, Norton Utilities, to recover
erased files that are being used as evidence in the case against Symantec.
Apparently Norton Utilities is widely used by law enforcement agencies for
gathering evidence in cases involving PCs.  The product also includes a utility
for ensuring that deleted data cannot be recovered, but many people seem to
think that if they "delete" a file and it seems to be gone, then that's what
really happened to it.  There's always a risk when a user's model of what the
computer is doing behind the scenes is a simplified one which is adequate for
doing their work, but not for predicting the outcome of unusual circumstances.

David Honig remarks on his discovery that users of SunOS can allocate shared
memory resources and fail to delete them properly, thus effectively rendering
them unavailable to later programs, which fail.  Only a reboot will resolve the
situation.

A couple of remarks:

	a)  All the Unix System V IPC objects have this property.  Allocating
		and failing to free shared memory segments, semaphores, or
		message queues, all of which exist in limited numbers and
		cannot be replenished, can also cause later numbers to fail.

		Mr. Honig remarks that there are typically 100 memory
		segments.  There are typically considerably fewer semaphores
		or message queues.

	b)  This is not a SunOS problem; it's inherent in System V, which
		defines a set of IPC facilities which allow objects to persist
		even though no one is using them.  Programs probably exist
		which rely on this, so I doubt it can be changed.

	c)  It IS possible to recover from this without rebooting, since root
		can attach to the "lost" objects and delete them.  Of course,
		you have to find them first.  At least on Ultrix, and probably
		on most other systems, there is a program (ipcstat, I think)
		which displays a list of all IPC objects in the system.  It
		would remain up to a human being to decide which ones can
		be deleted safely, however.

	d)  Given (c), the situation is, in a way, analogous to running out
		of disk space because the disk is full of old junk.  This
		similarity, however, is tenuous, for several reasons:  Disks
		are much larger than the sets of IPC resources available;
		the names of files being created are generally known, except
		for temporary files - which as a matter of policy are treated
		as expendable after a short time, and automatically cleaned
		up; and people regularly see directory lists, but they rarely
		if ever have reason to run ipcstat.

First, I should hate to think that my right to safety from illegal search and
seizure and/or illegal eavesdropping on my telephone conversations rested on
the good will and integrity of a phone company!

Second, it's difficult to envision a non-governmental agency, created by the
government but not really government.  The Post Office purports to be a
non-governmental agency but isn't.  It's employees still look and act like US
Civil Servants, and the P.O. can easily conduct a "mail cover" for a
governmental agency without a court order.

You must remember that court orders, search warrants, and the like are useful
only when the information or evidence gathered under their aegis is to be used
in court against a suspect.  If information is being gathered for political
purposes, to blackmail someone, or to subvert the law (Watergate, Iran-Contra,
the Italian bank, etc), the information will never see a public forum.  Thus,
the constraints of court orders are obviated.

The FBI needs to fund its own R&amp;D out of its budgetary resources, just as the
rest of the government at all levels must do.  There is talent that can "red
team" modern telecommunications and find trapdoors when necessary.

You must never forget that the gravest threat to our freedom is, and always has
been, government itself.

In the exchange over Dr. Denning's proposed key registration agency, I have
learned that there are civilized countries out there (eg., Finland) where it is
illegal for the government to do a wiretap.  Even getting phone records in
Finland (for traffic analysis) apparently results in the target's being told.

Sadly, we're not that civilized, it seems.

I can imagine some large company (one of the Baby Bells, perhaps) making a line
of scrambled, digital phones -- perhaps cellular -- perhaps just wireless, but
with digitization and end-to-end encryption done in the handset.  I could see
this line of phones using RSA (1000 bit) to pass triple-DES keys around (DES
with 3x56 bit keys and 3x64 bits of random IV for CBC mode).

I can imagine that large company offering to register keys for the FBI --
just to keep from being hassled by the Gov't.

Were that to happen, I might even buy such a phone -- knowing that it's
insecure but also knowing that my neighbor won't be listening in on her
wireless phone.

However, it's important that the agency which releases keys not release the RSA
keys (in this case) but rather the session key (360 bits of DES key and IV) of
a particular conversation.  Releasing the RSA key makes the phone in question
insecure for all time, past and future.

(No, I don't advocate key registry -- but if it looks like we end up having it,
let's have it limited.  Meanwhile, it's perfectly reasonable to have an audit
trail of all such taps made available to major news organizations immediately
and eventually to the person targetted -- so that any Nixon-like abuses would
get caught and prevented.)

&gt;From Daily Californian 6 November 1992

A misaligned Votomatic machine may have caused hundreds of Berkeley voters to
cast their ballots for candidates and propositions they never intended to 
support, according to Alameda County Registrar of Voters Emmie Hill.

Votomatic machines align a pre-scored data card with numbers on a printed
picture of the ballot.  Voters make their choices by punching a stylus 
through designated holes, thereby punching a data card.  In this case, the
holes were still within the printed squares on the ballot, but were actually
causing holes to be punched in other locations on the card.

An alert voter reviewed her completed ballot and noticed the discrepancy, but
precinct workers did nothing until late afternoon, when a troubleshooter from
the Registrar's office, acting on the voter's complaint, checked the unit and
confirmed the voter's complaint.

I had never thought of this type of error being possible - the ballots look
so neat when they come out of the machine.  Should we add a second definition
to GIGO, namely Goodness In, Garbage Out, to cover such cases?

A group of Boulder residents has been actively campaigning for phone voting.
As a consequence, the Boulder media has followed phone voting efforts
elsewhere.  Below is a summary and excerpts from an article by Carol Chorey in
the Boulder Daily Camera on 9 Nov 92 about phone voting developments in New
Mexico.

   "New Mexico was spurred to develop a phone voting system by `lots of voter
frustration in getting to the polls,' said Russell Barnes, director for
information systems with the New Mexico secretary of state's office.  Members
of his office started talking to the security experts at Sandia [National Labs
in Albuquerque] last March because `we thought we had the expertise with Sandia
Labs' so close at hand."  Scientists at Sandia took on the work as a commercial
project rather than a federal one.  The labs...are converting from federal to
commercial work because they have lost much of their funding."

	The goal is to have phone voting as an option to voting at the polls in
the same way that voting absentee by mail is currently an option.  Thus, one
would have to apply to vote by phone and the presumption is that not everyone
would do so.  Just like absentee voters, phone voters would have two to three
weeks to call in their votes before election day so phone lines won't be
overloaded.

	Security?  " `Voting by phone is not really the issue--it's a simple
technology,' Barnes said.  `The problem is people feel it is very unsafe
because it's so easy to tap into the phone system."  "With the help of computer
security experts at Sandia...,the secretary of state's office is developing a
system officials say will be uncrackable."  :-) As a test, the prototype system
was used in a mock election involving 2,300 high school students and their
parents on a facsimile of this year's NM ballot.  During the week-long mock
election, "Sandia `black-hatters'--experts at breaking into telephone
systems--were unable to crack the identification system and could not create
duplicate votes."  The article includes this cryptic comment: "An encoding
system still needs to be developed to make sure the system will be safe from
mass fraud."

	New Mexico is spending about $2 million on the system. 
They hope to recover these costs by selling the system to other
states.

  The legal side catches up on the (lack of) quality ...
  CAP loses legal battle:  Computer weekly, Thursday, 29 October, 1992

  The Salvage Association has won its year-long battle with CAP
  Financial Services over a botched computerised accounting system.
  The Salvage Association, which processes marine insurance claims,
  commissioned CAP to develop a bespoke accounts system based on
  software from relational database supplier Oracle in 1988.  But
  the finished system was riddled with over 600 errors and had to
  be scrapped in 1989 after repeated attempts to modify it failed to
  produce a usable version.

  Last week Judge Thayne Forbes ordered CAP, now part of Anglo-French
  services group Sema, to pay the Salvage Association 662,926 UK pounds
  in damages.  Further damages will be awarded next month when interest
  charges and legal costs will be taken into consideration ...

I wouldn't be surprised here if the damages exceeded the development costs!
Really bad code probably has an error about every 50-100 lines suggesting that
the package might be around 30,000-60,000 lines.  At around 5000 lines per
programmer year for this kind of stuff and say 50,000 pounds per year for a
programmer all in, the development costs would be around 360,000-600,000
pounds.  I guess that this kind of thing will get much more frequent.

An article that appeared in the Guardian (7th October, 1992) suggests that the
British Government is unable to monitor trade sanctions imposed on Serbia
because there are no official trade figures:

    Computer flaw lets Serb sanction-busting slip
         
    David Hencke, Westminster Correspondent, The Guardian, 7th October, 1992

    Details of Serbian sanctions busting are being wiped out every month by
    the erase button of a Whitehall computer, undermining Britain's pledge
    to the United Nations to root out and record the illicit trade.
    Embarrassed Customs and Excise officials admitted to the Guardian
    yesterday that they keep only one month's illegal trade figures for
    Serbia and Montenegro because they have no back-up system to hold the
    information for longer than 28 days.

    ``We weren't prepared for Yugoslavia to break up.  We did not have a
    programme for separate republics,'' an official explained.
    ``We don't keep the information because our principal client, the
    Central Statistical Office, which records overseas trade figures, 
    intends to keep Yugoslavia as a single country until next year.'' [...]

I do not think it was clear in the article exactly what was going on, but my
interpretation is that the people who normally receive trade figures, the
Central Statistical Office, do not want them.  The people who generate the
figures, Customs and Excise, are unable to save them because of an inadequate
computer system.  This is convenient, because the article went on to state that
what trade figures are known show that trade has increased dramatically in a
number of areas, including the export of telecommunications equipment and
petrol (no specific figures quoted, so we could still be talking small
numbers).

This article caught my attention for several reasons:

    - the standard of reporting (lack of firm detail, choice of language)
    - people hiding behind inadequacy of computer systems (as usual)
    - political capital out of the inadequacy of software

Periodically I will remind you of TWO useful digests related to privacy,
both of which are siphoning off some of the material that would otherwise
appear in RISKS, but which should be read by those of you vitally interested in
privacy problems.  RISKS will continue to carry higher-level discussions in
which risks to privacy are a concern.

* The PRIVACY Forum Digest (PFD) is run by Lauren Weinstein.  He manages it as
  a rather selectively moderated digest, somewhat akin to RISKS; it spans the
  full range of both technological and non-technological privacy-related issues
  (with an emphasis on the former).  For information regarding the PRIVACY
  Forum, please send the exact line:

information privacy

  as the BODY of a message to "privacy-request@cv.vortex.com"; you will receive
  a response from an automated listserv system.

* The Computer PRIVACY Digest (CPD) (formerly the Telecom Privacy digest) is
  run by Dennis G. Rears.  It is gatewayed to the USENET newsgroup
  comp.society.privacy.  It is a relatively open (i.e., less tightly moderated)
  forum, and was established to provide a forum for discussion on the
  effect of technology on privacy.  All too often technology is way ahead of
  the law and society as it presents us with new devices and applications.
  Technology can enhance and detract from privacy.  Submissions should go to
  comp-privacy@pica.army.mil and administrative requests to
  comp-privacy-request@pica.army.mil.

There is clearly much potential for overlap between the two digests, although
contributions tend not to appear in both places.  If you are very short of time
and can scan only one, you might want to try the former.  If you are interested
in ongoing detailed discussions, try the latter.  Otherwise, it may well be
appropriate for you to read both, depending on the strength of your interests
and time available.

You might want to turn into next week's Beverly Hills 90210 to catch the hacker
subplot.  Last week on 90210, One of the main characters obtained a password to
the high school computer grade system via social engineering.  Later he and a
freshman computer dude (this is California after all) broke into the school and
attempted to adjust school records.  The password "JESTER" seemed to work at
first; however, the system locked up and shutdown after a few minutes.  The two
kids fled.  It will be interesting to see if there is an audit trail...

In reference to Dorothy Denning's five-step sceme to protect the government
holding encryption keys:

The Justice Department (and FBI) could dispense with steps 1-3 by the simple
expedient of disregarding the use of due process.  (It wouldn't be the first
time.)

Step four can be eliminated with standard well-known intercept techniques.

This leaves only step five:

"Listen in and decrypt the communications."

Doesn't sound too tight to me.

&gt; Dorothy Denning suggested that anyone using high-level encryption over a public
&gt; network be required to register their encryption keys with some agency.

(I assume this is supposed to mean decryption keys, not encryption keys.)
The discussion of requiring the registration of decryption keys raises the
question of whether "encryption" can be defined precisely enough to make
this proposal workable.  Can translating a message in a different language
be called "encryption"?  We would not normally use the word in this way.
But if a bad guy wants to send a message to a crony without having the
government be able to understand it, he can send it in some extremely
obscure language (suitably transliterated into a standard character code if
necessary) that they happen to know (or take the trouble to learn a little
of).  Will the government decide to outlaw all communications in foreign
languages?  Or publish a list of approved languages?

Take this a step further.  What's to stop the bad guys from creating their
own language?  (Say something like Esperanto but based on Navajo instead of
Italian.)  Let's say that the language is given a greatly simplified syntax,
to make it easy to learn and remember.  Can translating messages into this
language be defined as encryption?  If so, what is the appropriate
decryption key?  If the language changes fast enough, translation into it
resembles the use of a one-time pad.  Will the law attempt to distinguish
between "real" and "artificial" languages and allow only the former?  If
so, would real languages that are now extinct be allowed?  Would a language
be allowed only if a written dictionary and description of its grammar
exist in some more widely known language?

To summarize, is it possible to define a precise distinction between
encrypting a message and translating it into a different language?  Is
it possible to outlaw the former while permitting the latter?  Remember
that there will always be people pushing the limits of the law.

HOW TEFLON JOHN COPED WITH KEY REGISTRATION.

1. Teflon John registers DES key K1 with the FBI and announces that he is using
4-bit cipher feedback, IV to be a preamble to message.

2. Teflon John gives MAC the KNIFE a second DES key K2 and a software package.

3. Teflon John wants to tell MAC the KNIFE to make an offer that LOUIE can't
refuse, but he doesn't want to spoil the surprise to LOUIE or the FBI. Moreover
he does not want to involve near MAC the KNIFE, who can read easy words but
can't write real good, in complex codebook systems.  The scheme must be
virtually transparent to both sender and receiver.

4. Teflon John produces plaintext " Give Louie a nice present at 6 pm on
Monday' encrypts it with K2 giving ciphertext C1.

5. Teflon John's problem is that although the FBI can't decipher C1, they will
get suspicious if they tap a message that cannot be decrypted with K1.  He has
to find a mechanism of transmitting C1 so that it appears to be an innocent
message when decrypted with K1, but a true message when decrypted with K2.

6. Teflon John breaks C1 up into 4 bit messages and produces a host, about
30-40, of innocent messages I1 - In.

7. The messages I1 to In are encrypted with 4 bit cipher feedback using K1. The
first 4 bits of each message are scanned until one is found with the same first
4 bits as C1.  Since there is a 1:16 probability that two four-bit messages are
identical then with 32 messages there is an 87% probability that a match can be
found. Just keep generating messages if necessary until match message Im is
found. The encrypted message eK1(Im) is transmitted. The FBI decrypt a harmless
message, MAC the KNIFE uses the software package to retain the first 4 bits of
the ciphertext eK1(Im).

8. Next get the second nibble from C1 and search through the ciphertexts
eK1(Ip) for the second innocent message to be transmitted i.e., the one whose
second nibble is identical with the second nibble of C1. MAC the KNIFE's
software package retains the second nibble of this message.

9. Proceed in this manner until MAC the KNIFE has C1 which is then decrypted
with K2, and goodbye Louie.

10. Now the same innocent messages can be used over and over again, they will
be simply sent in a different order. If the FBI are getting suspicious then
variants of the message can be made, any variation after the 4 bits used will
not affect the process.

I guess that the FBI cryptanalysts could get suspicious about the burst of
similar innocent messages preceding expensive funerals, but their prosecuting
attorneys would not have an easy job, particularly if Teflon John had a good
key management scheme for K2. The only prosecution evidence would be a set of
ciphertexts that they claimed represented evil intent, but they could not
produce the corresponding plaintext messages.

11. Everybody is happy with the system, Teflon John is getting his messages
through securely, the FBI assures itself that it is doing a good job keeping
Teflon John on the straight and narrow, and AT$T is getting a much larger
telephone income from Teflon John. Louie is not so keen but nobody liked him
anyway.

12. The 4 bit cipher feedback allows Teflon John to reduce his phone bill with
more sophisticated approaches where more than 1 nibble is used per message.
With 4 bit cipher feedback there is more control over the ciphertext so that
the messages can be modified easily to produce the requisite nibbles
corresponding to the ciphertext used by MAC the knife.

Dave King &lt;71270.450@compuserve.com&gt; and Peter G. Neumann talk about the
"Privacy" issues of cellular phones.  They point out that cellular phones are
not private and mention many incidents where this is illustrated.

  [Technical note: the Dan Quayle call was probably not cellular phone but a
  dedicated or airphone frequency.  Cellular from aircraft is illegal because
  the aircraft can "see" too many cells at once.  JV]

It should be obvious to anyone that using radio to communicate over distances
of many miles is never private.  The real RISK involved is why people think it
can be private in the first place.  In the US we have laws specifically
outlawing listening to cellular phone calls and they recently passed a law
banning the sale of scanners that can receive cellular phone.  But even banning
new scanners will not eliminate the millions already sold or even older UHF TVs
that can tune those frequencies.

These laws can not change the laws of physics but they will promote the *myth*
of privacy.  People using cell phones are led to believe that it is just like a
wire phone.  Cell phone vendors fought for a law that cannot be enforced rather
than a law that requires them to warn their customers that there is no privacy.
It is cheaper for them to bury their head in the sand then to invest in digital
technology that will offer privacy.

And for conspiracy theorists: remember the discussion where the FBI and NSA are

The Times of 5 November 1992 reports that Britain's biggest ambulance service,
the London Ambulance Service, yesterday reverted to full manual control after
another failure in its computer management system forced senior management to
concede it could not cope with its task.

It reports that the health secretary Virginia Bottomly was studying a letter
from a York-based computer consultancy claiming that tenders for the contract
from experienced providers of command and control systems were ignored in
favour of the lowest bid.

Control room staff had noticed early yesterday that system response was slowing
and computer back up procedures had failed to solve the problem. Because of the
faults, there was a 25 minute delay in dispatching an ambulance.

Ten days earlier, the service's chief executive, John Wilby, resigned following
allegations by the public sector union NUPE that a similar failure could have
contributed to the loss of 20 lives. The LAS has challenged NUPE to
substantiate its claim.

Martin Gorham, acting chief executive of the LAS said that yesterday's problems
occurred when demand was low, and not as a result of system congestion as had
been the case previously. In a statement he said "Since the problems with the
computer system at the beginning of last week, the LAS has been operating extra
back-up systems, including paper duplicates and voice confirmation to crews. In
addition, the staffing of the control room has been significantly increased. As
a result of these measures, call answering times have substantially improved,
leading to greater efficiency in allocating ambulances."

The London Ambulance Service computer fiasco rumbles on.

According to "Computing" (5 Nov 92) the senior officials of LAS were warned
that the system would be an "expensive disaster" by Michael Page.  Page's
company submitted a competing bid which was rejected last year, and he wrote a
series of memoranda to LAS in June and July 1991 warning that the mapping
subsystem (which tracks ambulances and dispatches the nearest to an incident)
was not up to the requirements.  "The rule-based, analytical approach used by
the LAS cannot deal as well as an experienced operator with the small minority
of difficult cases.  The system wrongly reduces the influence of operators".

Meanwhile Mike Smith, systems manager at LAS stated "One thing that did not
fail was the computer.  What seems to have gone wrong is that the people
working on the system were flooded with exception messages - we don't yet know
why.  We may have lost local knowledge by breaking up sector desks at the
weekend."

LAS have now gone back to a hybrid system using human expertise to dispatch
ambulances rather than a computer.  The two days of chaos last week may have
cost up to 20 lives, although exact figures are of course impossible to obtain.

I had an experience earlier this week that indicates that banks hereabouts
(Connecticut -- but probably at least the Northeastern US in general) are aware
of this problem, and have realized a `solution'.  I believe the ATM machines
with the `jaws' are Diebold TABS machines, but I might be wrong.  In any case,
I ran into one of these machines with a rather shorter than usual timeout
period, grabbed for my money just as it was pulled back, and didn't get it in
time.  I then found that my account had _not_ been credited for the money I
hadn't received, and had a fair bit of difficulty getting the bank in question
to credit me for it when I showed up the next day to complain.  I suppose that
since one doesn't get credit for the money the machine takes back in, it's
impossible to take part of the money and run.  On the other hand, why is it
even necessary for the machine to pull the money back at all, if it's not going
to give credit for it?  This `fix' seems to me to be blatant opportunism on the
part of the banks.  I know that among the readers of this list are some ATM
programmers; any comment?

I don't know the legal situation in other countries. But if I understand it
correctly in Belgium the bank can't refuse to give you your money when you
state that you didn't receive it. This is because you don't sign a note when
getting money from a cash dispenser. So the bank has no prove that it handed
the money out to you. Counting the remaining money in the till and checking
with the balance does no good since the money could have been taken by the
following client.

The Russian government is going to pass a law requiring furniture manufacturers
to build microphones and radio transmitters inside every sofa, chair, and table
manufactured.  A high official from the Russian government was reported to say:

  We just aren't able to function any more without a law like this.  After the
  Soviet Union ceased to exist, the United States government has hired over 50
  percent of the KGB staff and we are losing the ability to watch criminals.
  They have the need, and they have the money, and they value experience you
  couldn't have gotten anywhere else.  Thus, our law enforcement has suffered.
  When this law passes, we can catch all criminals even before they have time
  to commit the crimes.

It is planned that at a later stage when Russia has the technology to do it, a
similar law will be passed for dentists to install the same hardware in tooth
fillings.

For people who have doubts that this would be a return to the former Soviet
Union policies of watching for political dissidents, the official says:

  Absolutely not.  We have learned from our past mistakes.  It is only natural
  that we want to maintain our ability to catch criminals in the changing times
  -- the changes in the job market are taking all our KGB men for a country
  where there's money and where there's a flourishing job market, and it's only
  fair we should keep our law enforcement at the high level we have managed to
  get it.  Thus we are not even increasing our resources, we are just keeping
  them the same.  The tapes will be used only to catch criminals, and a court
  order will be required before we will listen to the tapes.  Trust us, we're
  the Government and we are here to help our citizens.

The law also requires that if anyone sitting on a sofa or a chair, or at a
table, speaks any other language than Russian, she or he must be able to
provide an interpreter who will translate his talk to Russian if the law
enforcement decides there's a legitimate need to listen to the tape of the
conversation.  To make this possible, the name and address of the interpreter
must be clearly said aloud in Russian near the table/sofa/chair before each
conversation in any language other than Russian.

(Really Paul Robinson -- TDARCOS@MCIMAIL.COM)

Article Summary, "The Credit Thieves" (Washington Post, Nov. 9, Page D5),
"They Take Your Identity, Then Your Good Name."

In "The Credit Thieves" article author Stephen J. Shaw asks if you have checked
your credit rating lately; some thieves have been known to find people's
personal information, then create new identities - and new credit histories -
for some people.  Apparently name and address is enough to be able to "borrow"
someone else's credit information.  Some so-called "credit doctors" charge $500
to find someone else with the same or similar name and a clean record, and give
the buyer that person's credit record.

Shaw declares personal exposure to credit fraud: his credit rating showed
"almost $100,000" in credit, services and merchandise ("loans, credit cards,
personal bank loans, plane tickets, home-entertainment systems, computers,
clothes, furniture, cellular telephones and a slew of other consumer goodies")
granted to "him" even though he lives in Washington DC, and the credit granted
to "him" was to someone in Orlando Florida, and he's never heard of the things
claimed to be charged to him.

He only found out about the incident when he applied for credit with an
organization and they asked him why he didn't declare all the OTHER credit
cards and such that he has.

Apparently almost anyone with access to a computer terminal with access to a
regular credit reporting agency can probably find out your credit history.

His "Credit Double" was only caught because he tried to buy a house using
Shaw's name.  The Secret Service is the agency that handles trying to catch
people who do this.  The "credit mugger" is in jail awaiting trial for four
counts of bank and credit fraud.

Happy ending, eh?  NOT.  Now getting rid of the inaccurate and fraudulent
credit requests is a job in and of itself.

"Equifax had deleted five of the bogus accounts, kept another four on my report
and added three new ones.  TRW told me that most of the disputed accounts had
been deleted because the creditor had not replied to TRW's inquiry, but added
that the 'creditor may re-report item.' stating , in effect, that the accounts
could reappear in future editions."  Trans Union did not have the incorrect
accounts, but still had the Florida address.  TRW also has his address listed
as Florida.

A New York State agency found six out of 17 credit reporting agencies which
advertised would sell credit histories without any attempt to verify the
purpose of the request.  An executive at TRW told a 1991 Congressional hearing
that "if someone is willing to lie to get a consumer report on another
individual, there is nothing in the present law to act as a deterrent."

Apparently it's not all that hard even to get someone's credit report legally.
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) allows anyone with "a legitimate business
need for the information" can get your report; this includes prospective
creditors and employers.  "This loophole covers anything from renting an
apartment to paying for something by check to joining a health club or a dating
service.  Reports can be ordered legitimately by employers checking on
employees, insurance companies writing policies, someone trying to collect a
debt, and government agencies deciding to grant any form of assistance or
licenses."

The article notes one can request not to be put in the list of "pre-screened"
or "targeted" people that credit reporting agencies sell to companies that
sometimes offer credit.  You can also ask to be taken off mailing lists by
writing the Direct Marketing Association, Mail Preference Services, 11 West
42nd St, Box 3961, New York, NY 10163-3861.  They can also take requests just
to remove your telephone number from some lists.

The article recommends contacting each of the three major agencies twice
yearly, and at least 6 months before a major purchase, because some of them
don't get what the others have.  If something is wrong, contact the creditor
directly as well as the reporting agency.  If you can't get something
corrected, ask to have a statement inserted in your record.

If you're not satisfied, you can write the Federal Trade Commission at
Correspondence Dept, Room 692, Washington DC 20580.

The major credit reporting agencies are:
 - Equifax, Box 740241, Atlanta GA 30374    1-800-685-1111
 - Trans Union, Box 7000, North Olmsted, OH 44070

Tue, 10 Nov 92 06:39 CST
</i><PRE>

I have been a regular reader of the RISKS forum for quite a while now, and the
situation seems to be that more and more people are becoming aware of the risks
associated with modern technology.  However, also increasing is the amount of
life-threatening accidents/near-accident/malfunctions/errors in computers and
related other electronics. Some people have proposed measures to make sure
certain quality standards are met. I can still remember the proposition for
having software professionals register themselves as such. Much was said at
that time, and the proposal got bombed. ISO has a set of standards (the 9000
series) for quality, which we adhere to within the company I work for. Others
have proposed plans, but none really seem to get the attention they deserve,
and if they do, they die a certain death after a while.  After having read 'Zen
and the Art of Motorcycle Maintainance' (highly recommended) and the ideas
about quality described in that book, I think technology desperately needs to
get in touch with reality again. I have thought about this, and have come up
with a set of situations that can adversely influence the quality of a project
or new technology. Furthermore, I would like to hear your views on the
countermeasures I propose. Just to be clear, I am in no way a quality-expert,
just a programmer who tries to keep in touch with reality, and reports as such.
The way I see it, the following are major contributors to bad quality of a
project/product:

Before implementation:

1) Concessions during design w.r.t. costs, politics, human factors.
   I realise some consessions must be made sometimes, but I have seen
   a lot of projects go down because of too many concessions.

2) Too rigid a view of what is possible/impossible. 
   As seen often here, some systems think it's impossible for
   people to have 1-letter names, resulting in chaos. Others think
   it is possible to positively identify people by just a subset of
   their personal data available. Many more examples are to be found,
   but basically they all boil down to the fact that the input/output
   requirements are context-sensitive. Don't forget the Fringe-Factor (TM)!!

3) Future needs are disregarded too often.
   "Works as designed" is a standard way of getting out of this, but
   isn't a solution. Some thought *must* be given to future needs
   when designing a project

4) Compatibility needs.
   If a product is intended to work together with a different product,
   it should be clear during design exactly how the other product operates. 


During implementation:

1) On the fly changes to the design, usually a result of too high a cost
   or implementors just not being up to their task. If you have a good
   design, stick too it, or change it only when it *adds* quality.

2) The tools to do the job turn out to be defective. In stead of
   replacing the tools, too often implementors are forced to use
   the old ones, thereby reducing quality of the end-product.

3) Mis-communication between implementors and supervisors of a project.
   Things are heard like "You want it next *week*?? I thought you said 
   next *month*!!" Several variations on this theme come to mind :-(

4) Loss of oversight over project. Every implementor must have a 
   general view of the totality of the project. The final quality
   is *his* responsibility. Details are OK, but don't loose the "feeling".

After implementation:

1) Incomplete testing of the product before delivery. Too little time
   is taken to test the product, and a product will be under-developed
   when it reaches the marketplace. Combined with point 2 this
   leads to extremely counterproductive results.

2) Rigidity of supplier.
   After the product has been delivered and installed, a provider
   should support the project with a total commitment to quality.
   Usually this is done by means of a maintenance-contract or
   an update-contract, but I think it shouldn't stop at that.
   Too often a product is only then corrected, if the customer
   reports the failure, even if supplier knew about it long ago.
   A supplier should do everything in its power to ensure the
   integrity of the product. Alas, usually the supplier won't do
   anything, even if told frequently.

3) Untrained personnel handling the new product/project. 
   After said product has been delivered, unknowledgeable personnel
   often get thrown in at the deep end, sometimes with disastrous results.

While all these points are pretty straight-forward, when seen as a list, it
immediately becomes clear where most manufacturers fail.  While they don't
cover all points, I believe the following countermeasures could increase
overall quality.

1) Start design from specifications which are as context-insensitive
   as possible. 
2) As I said before, don't forget the Fringe-Factor (TM).
3) Survey possible future needs *before* design. 
4) Make sure you stick to the design, once it is accepted. If it costs
   more, you have failed in the initial estimate, and you should ensure
   that you can continue the project. It will pay off.
5) Check methodology and tools before implementation.
6) Make it exactly clear which secondary requirements there are to
   a project. Both the implementors and supervisors should have the
   best communication about this.
7) Make sure every developer of a product is aware of what part
   of the project he is working on, and why. Ensure he has at least 
   a good working knowledge of the other parts of the project.
8) If the product is complex, then supplier should provide the 
   client with an opportunity to give the clients employees and future
   users  of it's product a training in the use of this product.

If these points are taken well, I think we would see better products, which are
not necessarily more expensive. Note that I haven't touched the subject of user
interaction, but that's because I think it's a completely different field, and
is more subject to psychology than technology. Maybe some net.psychologist can
shed his/her light on this? Oh, BTW, if you plan on sending me email replies on
this, do so to:
                          accucx.cc.ruu.nl!hairy%knoware.ruu.nl

It is my private email account, so my email won't clog up AT&amp;T's machines.

  New emphasis for SDIO

  The US Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) has moved
  to cut its funding for space-based systems in order to increase 
  its ability to deploy a ground-based system in conformity to the United
  States Missile Defense Act of 1991.
  The system proposed by this Act would be in compliance with the Treaty
  on anti-ballistic missiles  and would have the goal of providing 
  a ground-based SDI system by 1996 with the capacity to defend most 
  of the continental United States. This has lead to reductions in 
  funding the "brilliant pebbles" space-based intercepter programme.

This on my opinion seems extremely dangerous since 

1) It speaks explicitly of a *deployment* program.

2) It is in *compliance with ABM Treaty*.

3) It speaks again of *defending most of the US*.

4) Being ground-based and after the (supposed) "success" of patriots
   in the Gulf War it may claim for *more credibility* than space-based SDI.

It is my feeling the Scientific Community should once again mobilize as it
did against SDI, being also conscious that its task will probably be harder
this time (see points 2 and 4).

I am taking an introductory Accounting course (enough groaning! :-) and
actually its quite a bit of fun --- since accounting is basically an exercise
in managing the risks of having and not having accurate information to run a
business.

Of course, the accountants try to be as exact and consistent as possible to  
uncover any inconsistencies (e.g., theft, loss, mistakes).  However, only so  
much can be done before the costs outweigh the gains, so only so much is  
*really* done --- with the hope that that's enough and that everything will be  
alright.  (This "constraint" principle is that of "Cost-benefit --- the value  
of a financial item reported should be higher for the decision makers than the  
cost of reporting it" [Fundamentals of Financial Accounting, 6th E., Short and  
Welsch, page 159].)  Of course, this seemingly cut and dry principle is  
*really* a matter of judgment --- what may *appear* as diminishing returns may  
actually be very valuable information.  To sum up, accountants *try* to walk  
the line between valuable information (on one side) and diminishing returns (on  
the other side) with as accurate, relevant information as possible.

Unfortunately, accounting systems are easily abused by crooks.  So, accounting  
also covers "Internal Controls" (this week's lecture :-), especially of cash  
handling (but other stuff too, e.g., inventory, supplies).  The main approach  
to avoiding misappropriation of cash is the division of responsibility for cash  
collection and accounting (and other responsibilities too).  A commonly  
observed example of this separation of duties:

  At most movie theaters, one employee sells tickets and another employee
  collects the tickets.  It would be less expensive to have one employee do 

  both jobs, but it would be easier for an employee to steal cash.
  [FoFA, p. 356]

As you can see, these measures are very important and, unfortunately, can be  
very expensive to implement.

So this week, our instructor (who is full of great anecdotes from his  
banking/loaning experience) related the story of a merchandise business where,  
despite separation of duties, the delivery person found a way to defraud the  
company.  The scenario follows:

The delivery person delivered goods to customers in return for checks and cash  
which he was supposed to hand over to the bookkeeper to record (separation of  
duties :-).  Then the bookkeeper gave him the checks and cash to deposit at the  
bank --- with a slip from the accountant for the amount of the deposit  
(separation of duties).  Instead, the delivery person withheld a check from the  
accountant and picked up a deposit slip for the reduced amount.  Then, on the  
way to the bank to make the deposit, he "cashed" his pocketed check in via the  
deposit cash --- thereby maintaining the validity of the bookkeeper's deposit  
slip (but coming away with the cash equivalent of the "cashed" in check from  
the company's payments).  The only inconsistency left by the scheme is that  
customers who have paid for goods, are recorded by the company as having an  
unpaid balance (when they have actually already paid).  I don't know how long  
this scheme had gone on, but I imagine small discrepancies are overlooked by  
larger companies (cost-benefit constraint again :-).

Ironically, as long as everything goes well, the thief gets away with his  
scheme.  Of course, the error here is believing the "Internal Control" system  
is not flawed --- but practically speaking, cost-benefit constraint kicks in  
and keeps apparently working systems from being scrutinized (or the old,  
simplistic maxim "If it ain't broke, don't fix it").

However, eventually, our ever vigilant but imperfect bookkeeper made a mistake  
on the deposit slip (where an even number was odd or somesuch).  I don't know  
the details (at all) but apparently the thief didn't catch the error (or it  
didn't matter whether he did or not) and eventually the bank and company had to  
do research to resolve the problem.  Of course, the research led to discovering  
how customers thought they had paid but were recorded as not paying, etc., and  
the fraud and thief were discovered.

I found the case amusing and apropos to RISKS since Accounting is a formal  
attempt at reducing risk through cost-effective, relevant information  
(trade-off flag immediately waving :-), "Internal Control" systems which are  
subtly subject to abuse, and the ironic *value* of making a mistake once in a  
awhile (perhaps even on purpose) to highlight areas taken for granted.  In this  
case, "If it ain't broke, break it" [to make sure it *really* isn't busted]  
seems a propos!

Of course, technology may help address these issues (while creating fresh ones
of course :-), e.g., electronic verification of paid and unpaid balances
between the company and its customers or even electronic payment (e.g.,
CheckFree), etc..

The Boston Globe, 9 Nov 1992, had a human interest story illustrating some good
uses for the ubiquitous cellular phones.  In many places you can dial *SP for
the State Police, and this had been credited with getting rapid assistance to
accident and crime victims, as well as apprehending a dangerous escapee. They
mentioned problems with routing 911 calls.

What I found more interesting was a discussion about the Coast Guard preparing
to adopt *CG as a maritime cellular distress number.  A local official was
quoted as saying that the existing broadcast channels will remain in operation
because anyone nearby will hear you and the CG operates Direction Finding
stations to pinpoint your location. Okay...

But then he went on to say that cellular calls "only give you a point to point
channel", leading one to the wrong belief that they couldn't DF a cellular
user, and that nobody else could listen if they wanted to.

-BCNelson

P.S.: After a PGN talk at MIT recently, someone in the audience claimed that
      the FBI has multiple "trunks" attached to the local cellular hub in
      Boston and they can monitor both sides of a conversation by just typing 
      in your number.  Thank goodness that this is a democracy.  :-^

Recently D.LONGLEY@qut.edu.au wrote about "How Teflon John Coped with Key
Registration" which got me to thinking about _other_ ways to beat key
registration, namely a cipher group method. (i.e. an "innocent" word has some
other word or sentence associated with it).

In that case, our criminal could send to his associate, "How is your dear Uncle
Joe."  The associate, or his computer, looks in the code table and sees that
"your" = liquidate "dear" = soonest and the intended victim is (by
pre-arrangement) the next name mentioned.  The FBI could crawl all over a
message like that with a microscope and not discover a thing.

I can't see why this wouldn't work (unless it becomes illegal to write about
non-existent relatives :).

I welcome comments, since the sum total of my crypto experience comes from
reading the spy novels on occasion.

Actually, the FBI is very technically proficient. James Bamford tells
a story about their cryptographic prowess in _The Puzzle Palace._ Apparently,
the agents determined that the _only_ way communication could be 
leaving the criminals is through the shirts they sent out to be laundered.
The FBI kept track of the shipments with great patience and finally
figured out that the number of shirts of each color encrypted the message.

12. The 4 bit cipher feedback allows Teflon John to reduce his phone bill with
more sophisticated approaches where more than 1 nibble is used per message.
With 4 bit cipher feedback there is more control over the ciphertext so that
the messages can be modified easily to produce the requisite nibbles
corresponding to the ciphertext used by MAC the knife.

The clever ruse that Dennis Longley discusses doesn't differ substantially from
simply using a code within the cipher.  If you're going to load encrypted
information into the first few bits of innocent messages, you might as well
just redefine the innocent messages.  For example, "buy soybeans" might be code
for "kill tough tony".

Jerry Leichter follows up on David Honig's discussion of the SunOS shared
memory resources by noting that it is possible to recover from resource
exhaustion by using various programs to locate shared memory segments which are
(a) were not properly deleted and (b) are not in use.  In particular, he
mentions Ultrix's "ipcstat", which displays a list of known IPC objects. (The
corresponding SunOS program is called "ipcs"; I believe that it's functionally
equivalent.)

The problem is, though, that the situation is worse than either David or Jerry
mention.  It is not only possible to create shared memory segments which
persist when they should not, but it is also possible to do so in a way that is
*invisible* to ipcs--but visible to programs like top and pstat, which can
measure available memory.  We discovered this by accident when attempting to
diagnose a resource exhaustion problem that our principal in-house application
appeared to trigger.

The scenario works like this: the basic operations permitted on shared memory
segments are creation, deletion, attachment, and detachment.  In normal use, a
master program would create a shared memory segment, and various subprograms
might attach to and detach from it as they needed to.  Eventually, the master
program would delete the shared memory segment before exiting.

However, if one process creates a shared memory segment, and a second process
attaches to it and then deletes it *while still attached*, the segment is not
freed, even though it is marked as such and is thus invisible to ipcs.  (It's
not freed when the processes exit, either.)  It's possible to start another
process which can still locate and attach to this ostensibly non-existent
segment, which is surprising.  It can be deleted without a reboot by running a
program which iterates through all possible shared memory segment identifiers
and attempts to delete each one, regardless of whether or not it appears to
exist, but this is a rather drastic solution.  (We've also discovered some
additional scenarios which lead to roughly the same problem; all of this was
under SunOS 4.1.1.)

At the September 92 Seminar of the American Society for Industrial Security
(ASIS), I attended a lecture by the office of the Inspector General of Health
and Human Services (HHS-IG).  They are normally tasked with tracking down
people who cheat on Medicare and other assistance programs. Last year they
cited $15 million in penalties in over 2500 cases.

The lecture was about "Operation Private Trust" -- catching people who
abused their official computer access.  In mid-1990 HHS noticed that a
company in Florida was offering personal information which could
probably not be legally obtained as fast as they were providing it.
They called themselves "Nationwide Electronic Tracking" service, NET.

NET offered everything from credit checks in an hour ($10) to a 10-year
employment history ($175) in five days.  A scale of prices included
$7.50 to get someone's home address based on their Social Security
Number in under two hours.  They also offered info on a variety of
topics including your official criminal records, employers, neighbors,
post office box, driver's license and car registration, workmen's
compensation claims, etc.

There are normally 200,000 legitimate external IRS queries every year,
but processing them normally takes 2-4 weeks, providing a niche for a
criminal entrepreneur.  How do you identify the illegal queries?

To make a long story short: They laid a trap wherein a NET "customer"
requested information based on a certain SSN.  HHS then asked the IRS to
quietly monitor their system for a query.  It popped up two hours later
in Phoenix.  (The IRS had to modify their system to trace the identity
of the person requesting the information.) Investigators then did other
types of queries and soon discovered a large nationwide network of
middlemen with sources working at various government agencies.  Dozens
of government employees were selling information to which they had
online access.  Systems included IRS tax returns, and the FBI's NCIC.

In some cases the "customers" were drug dealers who were trying to check out
backgrounds in order to find undercover investigators.  Some of the "middlemen"
also turned out to be former IG and other HHS agents who were aware of the
records' accessibility and lack of system security.  The middlemen made huge
tax-free profits.  Where NET customers paid $100 for a report, the clerk who
did the access might receive only $5 for the effort.

As a result of the investigation, the US Attorney in Tampa issued ten
indictments against fourteen people, and 11 of them pleaded guilty.  They were
charged with over 30 counts of conspiracy, unauthorized disclosure of tax
return information, theft/conversion of government property (records), aiding
and abetting a crime, bribery of public officials, making false official
statements, and fraudulent access to Federal computers (18 USC 1030(a)(4)).
There were details of literally hundreds of illegal overt acts (some of which
were probably recorded on wiretaps).  Additional indictments were filed in New
Jersey with more to follow soon.

The IRS systems have now been tightened up so that fewer clerks have valid
access rights.  Audit records are now scrutinized monthly and clerk transaction
profiles monitored. The FBI is said to be "examining the problem" of user
authentication on their systems.

The moral of the story was: If you're given special access to online federal
information and you abuse it, you may have to pay the consequences which
include ten years in federal prison and a $10,000 fine.  No end-users of the
illegally obtained files were indicted and there continues to be a large market
for private information held in government computer systems.

A paper describing the details of what really happened with the Therac-25,
including detailed descriptions of the software bugs and the response by users,
government agencies, the manufacturer, etc. is now in review for publication
and available as a technical report.  This is the result of three years of
detective work by myself and Clark Turner (my student) and the collection and
distillation of several large boxes of documents.  Many of the previous media
accounts and papers have been incomplete, misleading, or plain wrong.

To order, call or write to UCI (Info. and Computer Science Dept., University
of California, Irvine, CA 92717) or to UW (Computer Science and Engineering,

        last December.  It has been long awaited, and I expect it will be a
        best-selling technothriller, even if it is completely NONfiction.  
        (Truth is often stranger than fiction, anyway!)  However, I hope RISKS

From an article by Daryl Kelley, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer, Nov. 11, 1992:

Chagrined Ventura County [CA] election officials confirmed Tuesday [Nov 10?]
that they had fed inaccurate vote tabulations on 13 state ballot propositions
to the secretary of state's office last week.  The foul-up, which reversed
Ventura County's YES and NO votes for each proposition, did not involve enough
votes to change the outcome for any of the statewide measures, state officials
said.

"I don't know of any other county that screwed up, but I did," Ventura County
elections chief Bruce Bradley said Tuesday. "I linked their YES [computer line]
to my NO, and vice versa. So on Thursday when we found out, we corrected it."
The error was made only on the ballot measures, Bradley said.  Ventura County
tabulations in other state and federal races, such as the two for U.S. Senate,
were fed accurately to Sacramento by computer lines identified with the names
of the candidates, he said.  All the results for local ballot measures and
races were accurate, Bradley said.

Melissa Warren, spokeswoman for the secretary of state, said the error did not
affect the outcome of any proposition because Ventura County's voting trends
generally jibed with the rest of the state and because Ventura County voters
are a small part of the state total.

The closest ballot measure was Proposition 162, which shifts control of funds
in the public employees' retirement systems.  The measure won by 187,101 votes
statewide, according to semiofficial results, It lost by 5,528 votes in Ventura
County.

Such mistakes are not rare, Warren said.
==== ======== === === ===== ====== ====  [emphasis added!]

Over the next three weeks, California counties will count late arriving
absentee ballots and provisional and damaged ballots, Warren said.  Then they
will file a final count with the state by Dec. 1. An official count is expected
to be released Dec. 14.

John Flynn, chairman of the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, said he had
just congratulated Bradley on a particularly smooth election when he learned of
the mistake Tuesday.  "It's regrettable," Flynn said. "But these are human
beings who run these things."

This sounds quite like the system used here in Detroit, MI.  I always
spot-check a few important items to a) make sure that they are correct and b)
give me confidence that the rest of the ballot is punched correctly.  This is
possible because the correct box numbers are printed on the ballot.

So, for instance, in the recent election I verified the holes on the card with
the numbers on the ballot for: President, Congressional Representative, and the
four major ballot proposals here in Michigan; but not for all the minor and
judicial offices.  I also looked at the ballot before I put it in the machine
to make sure no holes had been accidentally punched.

Some may consider this excessive, paranoid, or simply inconsiderate of
others who were waiting for my voting booth (we had a record turnout,
and I had to do it in the booth since I needed to be looking at the
ballot to compare the numbers), but considering how quick and easy it
was and that no perfect voting machine will ever be built, I think that
double-checking by the voter is the only prudent course.

Note also that checking would be impossible if the correct numbers were not
given on the ballot, as they are here in Detroit and apparently were in
Berkeley.

    When I went to college (University of Maryland at College Park) our school
got a new voice mail system to keep up with the times.  This system offered a
message area for each user accessible from any phone so long as you knew the
passcode for that particular number.  The problem was that all the passwords
were set to 12345 at the beginning of the semester, so the people who first got
to campus started having a ball changing friends, enemies and strangers
passcodes.  By the time I got to campus, I had several messages that I could
not get to because the passcode had been changed(remember this was before
classes began so students had lots of time on their hands).  I had no way to
figure out my code except to go to the phone building on campus (though it
never came to that because a friend confessed to doing it and gave me the
number).
    Another risk was the students were never explicitly told that all the
numbers were the same, so some students left their number the same and as a
result people would "fish" for numbers to listen to the messages of.  If any
sort of security was there to protect the information (logs or the like) no one
I knew who did this ever got caught, and castigated.
    The final problem was the message append function.  What people could do
is the same as E-MAIL reply, except with the original message appended.  People
would send these messages back and forth until they filled your mailbox, then
they would send the message to every number they could think of(if you knew
someone in a dormitory, all the hallmates numbers clustered around their
number and so all of them might get the message).  
    During my final year there, when the system was installed these problems
were never noticeably addressed, including at the end of the semester being
asked to change the passcode back to 12345.
    Well, this is just a warning to system engineers to better recognize the
users of a system to better handle these shortcomings.

A "Viewpoint " piece in  The Institute, November 1992

Balancing National Interests

  The September/October issue of The Institute carried a front page story
reporting that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is promoting legislation
that would require all telephone systems to be designed in such a way that they
can be wiretapped by law enforcement officials.  The argument is that
wiretapping is a key tool in much of law enforcement, particularly in fields
such as drugs, racketeering, conspiracy and white collar crime, and that unless
care is taken in the design of future telecommunications systems, this tool may
become difficult or impossible to exercise.  To solve this problem the FBI is
promoting legislation that would establish design requirements on future
telephone systems.  Not surprisingly, civil liberties groups and telephone
companies are reported to be less than enthusiastic.

	While interesting and important in its own right, this controversy is
perhaps even more important as a symbol of a broader set of conflicts between a
number of important national interests. As a country, we want to promote:

  * Individual privacy (including the right of citizens and other residents of
the U.S. to keep personal records private, hold private communications with
others, and move about without being "tracked".)

  * Security for organizations (including protection of financial transactions,
and the ability to keep corporate data, plans, and communications
confidential.)

  * Effective domestic law enforcement (including the ability to perform
surveillance of legitimately identified suspects, and the ability to audit and
reconstruct fraudulent activities.)

  * Effective international intelligence gathering (including the ability to
monitor the plans and activities of organizations abroad that may pose a threat
to the U.S. or to other peaceful states and peoples.)

  * Secure world-wide reliable communications for U.S. diplomats and the
military, for U.S. business, and for U.S. citizens in their activities all
around the world (including the ability to maintain and gain access to secure,
reliable, communications channels.)

	Just as with most of our society's other fundamental objectives, these
objectives are in conflict.  You can not maximize them all because getting more
of some involves giving up some of others.  A dynamic tension must be created
that keeps the various objectives properly balanced.  That socially optimal
point of balance may change gradually over time as world conditions and our
society's values evolve.

	An electrical engineer who thinks for a moment about the problem of
achieving any particular specified balance among the various objectives I have
listed will quickly conclude that communications and information technology
design choices lie at the heart of the way in which many of the necessary
tradeoffs will be made.  We would like easy portable communications for all,
but doing that in a way that allows people to keep their legitimate travels
private poses significant design challenges.  Banks and other businesses would
like secure encrypted communications world-wide, but promoting the general
availability of such technologies all around the world severely complicates the
signal intelligence operations of intelligence organizations.

	The troubling thing about the FBI's legislative proposals is not that
they are being made, but that we lack a broader institutional context within
which to evaluate them.  In making such choices, we need to look systematically
at all the legitimate interests that are at stake in telecommunications and
information technology design choices, consider the ways in which technology
and the world are evolving, and integrate all these considerations to arrive at
a reasoned balance.  In the old days, if things got too far out of line in some
balance (for example, between freedom of the press and protection against
liable), the courts simply readjusted things and we went on.  Today, and
increasingly in the future, with many of these balances hard wired into the
basic design of our information and communication systems, it may be much
harder to readjust the balance after the fact.

	There are several organizations that should be working harder on these
issues.  On the government side the Telecommunication and Computing
Technologies Program in the Office of Technology Assessment should be doing
more systematic studies of these tradeoffs to help inform the Congress; The
National Telecommunications and Information Administration in the Department of
Commerce (or some appropriate interagency committee) should be doing similar
studies to develop more coherent and comprehensive executive branch policy; and
the Office of Policy and Plans in the Federal Communications Commission (which
is an independent regulatory agency not directly subject to executive branch
policy) should be giving these issues more attention so it can better support
the Commissioners when they confront such tradeoffs.  On the non-government
side, the Office of Computer and Information Technology at the National
Research Council might appropriately mount a comprehensive study.  There is an
ideal opportunity here for a private foundation to fund an independent
blue-ribbon commission.  Finally, the computer and telecommunications
industries, both individually and collectively through their industry
associations, should be taking more interest in how the country will strike
these all important balances.

Encryption key registration risks

David Willcox spoke of the obvious risks of registering encryption keys with
some agency. Dorothy Denning responded in <A HREF="/Risks/13.86.html">RISKS-13.86</A> that the "risk can be
reduced to about zero" and described a mechanism. Yet neither elaborated on
just what specific risks are to be protected against.

Denning chooses to ignore one obvious class of risks: defective warrants,
incompetence and/or outright corruption in the government and the key
registration agency. The government has abused its wiretap facilities in the
past (e.g., Operation Shamrock) and will do so again until the widespread use
of strong cryptography stops it.

Anyone who thinks that the warrant is a meaningful safeguard ought to consider
what happened recently in Poway, California (just northeast of San Diego).
Customs and DEA agents broke into an innocent man's house at midnight and
exchanged gunfire with the owner, who quite reasonably thought his home was
being invaded (the agents did not identify themselves). Last I heard, the owner
was in critical condition in the hospital. After the shooting, neighbors
overheard the leader telling his troops "Now get this straight. He shot first!"

The sole basis of the warrant? A "tip" from an informer, already known by
Customs to be unreliable. He admitted the next day that he had merely picked a
house at random when the agents pressed him to "produce".

The judge who approved this particular warrant obviously didn't scrutinize it
very closely despite the clear potential for serious injury to an innocent
person. It's not hard to imagine a judge being even less critical of an
application for a wiretap warrant. "After all", he'll reason, "what harm can to
you really do to an innocent person by just listening to his phone calls?  It's
not like the agents are asking for permission to break his door down."

That's the whole problem with government wiretaps. They're easy and (from law
enforcement's perspective) almost risk-free. Break down the wrong guy's door,
and there's no way to keep it out of the papers.  But tap the wrong guy's phone
and he may never know. Warrants?  Don't bother -- they leave paper trails, and
are unnecessary unless you want to produce the recordings in court. There are
many other uses for wiretaps that need not reveal one's "sources and methods".

This is especially tempting with radio. ECPA or no ECPA, the fact is that it's
incredibly easy to intercept analog cell phones and very hard to get caught
doing it.  Indeed, the government successfully opposed meaningful encryption in
digital cellular, even though it would only protect the air link -- the land
side of the call could still be tapped with the phone company's assistance.  I
wonder why.

Okay, so maybe I'm paranoid. But I don't think so. A healthy distrust of
government, particularly of those functions that are not always open to public
scrutiny, is essential to a free society. Or so the authors of the Constitution
seemed to think, even if the average person wouldn't mind repealing the Bill of
Rights to help fight the drug war.

But let's assume that we've found some saints to populate the entire Executive
branch, so we can safely pass a law requiring crypto key registration. Exactly
how would it be enforced? Routinely scan all private telephone conversations
looking for bit streams that cannot be easily decoded? What about certain rare
natural languages - ban them too? (Recall that the US military used Navajo
radio operators in the Pacific during WWII as "human crypto machines" against
the Japanese).  So much for the First Amendment.

Suppose you find an undecodable conversation that you actually have good reason
to believe conceals criminal activity. How would you compel the users to reveal
the key, if indeed they used a protocol that could be compromised in this way?
According to several lawyers I've asked, including a law professor at the
University of Wisconsin who specializes in the Fifth Amendment, a memorized
crypto key would clearly be considered "testimonial" evidence that could not be
compelled without a grant of immunity. So what do we do -- repeal the Fifth
Amendment too?

It is absolutely obvious to me that any attempt to control the private use of
cryptography could not help but impinge on some very basic Constitutional
guarantees. And yet it probably still wouldn't have the desired effect. It's
already a cliche, but it's still true: when cryptography is outlawed, only
outlaws will use cryptography. (And no, I *don't* believe the same is true for
guns.)

Suppose both parties ("Joe Teflon" and "Louie") have a ".gif" picture of
something, say Yellowstone Falls, exchanged by disk.  An encrypted message
could be overlayed as "noise" on the video image, recovered easily on the other
end, while appearing innocuous to anyone intercepting the image.

(To tease, one could use politically incorrect images.)

Attempts to defeat encryption will defeat only the stupid.  Maybe that
is worthwhile.

It is not surprising that few people notice the cryptic messages hidden in
RISKS.  The longevity of the Forum itself attests to the fact that few people
notice even the obvious messages of RISKS.

Thanks, Robert.  By the way, I think we have about mined this one out for the
time being, so let's see if I can end it without opening up more discussion!
Thanks to Dorothy Denning for having opened up a difficult debate at the
National Computer Security Conference, Rebecca Mercuri for having brought it up
in <A HREF="/Risks/13.84.html">RISKS-13.84</A>, and all the rest of you who contributed.  The problems are very
deep, and the risks of simplistic solutions are extensive.  This is probably
one of those cases in which "there are no easy answers."  However, just because
a supposedly "easy answer" got included in RISKS, don't assume it was correct,
or reasonable, or realistic -- even if it went unchallenged.  I did not include
ALL of the messages on this subject.  There were simply too many.  PGN

There is a comment in "Risks of Cellular Speech" in <A HREF="/Risks/14.02.html">RISKS-14.02</A> which, I
suspect, is not correct.

While I believe that it is true that the use of Cellular phones is prohibited
in aircraft (at least those operating under Instrument Flight Rules), I seem to
remember that the rationale is aviation related, not Cellular Phone related. To
be exact, my recollection is that the frequencies used by Cellular are fairly
close to some of the frequencies used by the avionics.

In any event, the prohibition is, I believe, a blanket one, not based on, for
example, altitude. If the problem were caused by cell overlap, then there would
need to be a ban on the use of Cell phones at any altitude where more than one
cell site would be over the horizon.

I seem to remember a discussion on this subject a couple of months ago in
rec.aviation, but I don't have easy access to an archive.

In <A HREF="/Risks/14.03.html">RISKS-14.03</A> I saw mention of an earlier post in which I described my
discovery that BSD shared memory segments persist; people who know better will
be reassured to find out that I have since understood 1) that this persistence
can be a feature, not a bug and 2) the SysV libraries allow one to use mmap()
calls to implement shared memory, without the 100 segments of 1MB each
limitation (*).

But I discovered along the way two interesting things: first, you can't
trust the man pages' SEE ALSO section to give you complete cross-referencing
on all related topics, especially between the BSD and SysV camps.  Second,
the Net and Local Smart People (who turned me on to the mmap() calls) are
really great resources.

(*) It was pointed out to me that the BSD segments can be made contiguous,
which is helpful; but I also might conceivably need more than that (yes,
seriously.)

Our voting machines are a series of buttons on the outside of a continuous
sheet of paper.  You can go page to page with buttons.  each button is supposed
to point at a candidate/proposal.  It didn't work that way.

When I went through the ballot I found several pages that pointed at the lines
between the selections, and not at a selection.  I found that it was not
possible to push the button for Clinton, but was possible to push the button
above Bush.  I also found that went I paged forward, and back that the lit
buttons didn't point at the people I had voted for.

I pointed this out to the election judges and was told that "They
only deal with the totals, and therefore it would all average out"

The 12 November 1992 issue of the weekly UK newspaper "Computing" has a three
page spread (pp18-21) on safety-critical systems entitled "Safe Conduct" by
Clair Neesham. In particular, new piece of EC legislatation, the Machine Safety
Directive, comes into effect in the UK on 1 January 1993. This encompasses
software and if there is an error in the machine's logic that results in injury
then a claim can be made under civil law against the supplier. If negligence
can be proved during the product's design or manufacture then criminal
proceedings may be taken against the director or manager in charge.  There will
be a maximum penalty of three months in jail or a large fine.  (This actually
sounds rather low to me.) Suppliers will have to demonstrate that they are
using best working practice including, for example, risk analysis and project
planning. The DTI-funded (Department of Trade and Industry) Safety-Critical
Systems Club is helping to raise awareness of the issues in the UK with regular
meetings and a newsletter.  A knowledge of relevant standards is important
(e.g., ISO9001, 00-55 &amp; 00-56, DO-178, ...). Formal methods (e.g., Z, VDM and
B) are cited as one way of improving matters, but judging from the "site study"
boxes in the article, there is still considerable scepticism in industry about
their applicability at the moment, due to lack of trained personnel, problems
of scaling up, worries about extra cost, etc.  However, they are seen as
promising for the future.

I number of years ago I was called in as a consultant to look into a suspected
case of fraud.  The reason for the belief that there was fraud involved was
that one of their low paid clerks had retired, and at the end of the year they
give out attendance awards.  They wanted this person to pick up his "20 years
without a sick day" award at the awards banquet, and attempted to invite him.
They found out that this guy had been living it up as a jet setter.  Someone
decided to find out how he could afford it.  It was not hard to figure out.

This guy was in charge of all office supplies for the Corp (a large
multinational).  This meant that he was in charge of ordering and then
confirming receipt of supplies.  He was supposed to keep an inventory on hand,
(central management to the max) and ship out supplies as needed.  The supposed
control was the the office managers were supposed to confirm that they received
what he said he sent them.  He was able to set up a phony company and order
goods from it he then receipted in the goods, and include these in shipments.
If he had missed just one day he would never have been caught.

By the way he basically got a way with it.  I return for keeping his mouth shut
about where he got the money he got to keep all of the interest, and way not
prosecuted.

(Based on an article in Vrij Nederland of 31 October, 1992.)

For years the Dutch banks have stated that they do not store the PIN code
required for many transactions using cards.  They imply that if somebody
reports illegal use of the card plus PIN code this is only because the owner of
the card has not been careful enough with his code.  They also told us that
there is no way to calculate the code given an account number only.  And they
also imply that a 4-digit PIN code is sufficient for security (as many know,
this is not true).

It has now been revealed that some banks routinely tell customers their PIN
code if they did forget it.  There is one case on record where during a
criminal investigation the police wondered whether a particular number written
down by the person under investigation was the PIN code connected to a
particular account.  They just asked the bank for the PIN code for the account
and received it back, the number as written down was just the code in reverse.

More interesting is here that even though the banks do not store actual PIN
codes (and as such are technically correct in some of their statements), some
have the data available to calculate the code even if the card is not
available.

They still maintain the system is safe.

When I talk on cellular phones, I already take precautions by making 
allusions to other events and taking full advantage of the shared context so 
that the message is innocuous the the casual listeners. This is the norm for 
aware people in any case where there is a concern about the possibility of 
being overheard.  Teflon John wouldn't be caught dead (or would be dead if 
caught?) being too direct over a potentially public (i.e. tappable) channel.  
This technique works even without intent to be secret -- just listen to two 
MIT students planning their courses for the following semester.

The real issue is exchanging large amounts of data or regular transmissions
such as financial transactions among a large community of users so that all the
information about the techniques is public and all that is hidden are the keys.

BTW, it has long been the case that encryping over Telex by using code words, 
or even nonEnglish words, has been illegal in many countries.

Mr. Robert Gezelter writes in <A HREF="/Risks/14.04.html">RISKS-14.04</A> about cellular phones being used "in
aircraft (at least those operating under Instrument Flight Rules)".

First of all, the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) leaves the decision of
the use of electronic equipment in aircraft up to the operator of the aircraft.
This means, essentially, the aircraft's owner: either me, in the case of my own
plane, or the company operating the aircraft: American Airlines, for instance.

The frequencies that cellular phones operate on do not directly conflict with
aviation frequencies, but some poorly designed phones could emit RFI (harmonics
of the carrier, or IF frequencies for example) in frequencies that could
interfere with navigation equipment.  Usually this is not a problem, though, as
most avionics gear is tolerably well shielded.

Secondly, the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) is the one that bans
cellular phone use in aircraft, whether under Instrument Flight rules or not.
It turns out that when a cellular phone at, say, 20,000 feet tries to make a
call it will wake up cells for hundreds of miles around and badly confuse the
system, which is expecting to get a signal from only a few cells at once.

The blanket ban *is* due to cell overlap, then, and my guess is the reason
there is not an altitude restriction is that it's too hard to figure out; the
number of cells reached is a complex function of altitude, position of the
aircraft and cells, and the topography of the surrounding landscape.  I can
just picture the FCC bureaucrat saying ``Hell, that's too hard.  Let's just ban
'em all.''.

CMARTIN@nswc.navy.mil wrote about the then-new voice mail system installed at
Maryland, and the problems which ensued when students discovered that all the
pass codes were set the same.  One lesson he suggested from this was to the
engineers, who should either make the codes different, or make a better attempt
to warn users about the situation.

The education needs to be given regularly to new employees and also visitors,
else they can become special targets of locals who already "know the system".
As case in point, I cite one of my own (many) experiences with the UM voice
mail system that CMARTIN mentions.  A few months ago I was given a new office,
whose previous occupant had been a prestigious visitor.  My own phone number
lagged behind the move by a few days, so I temporarily got use of phone account
of our visitor, Nancy Leveson.  Guess who didn't get the word to change the
default passcode!

Don't worry, Nancy, none of the messages sounded urgent.  :-)

I discovered you can learn a lot about someone by playing with their
intelligent phone system.  The "redial" button suggested a last user might have
ordered a carry out meal from Cluck-U-Chicken, a popular campus town eatery at
the time.  (If the place had used caller-ID like so many carry-out businesses
these days, then I suppose I could have just ordered the "usual" and found out
the previous user's tastes too.)  I thought it best not to see where the "speed
dialing" buttons got me.  But does anyone know of stock brokers or doctors
offices use caller-ID as a check for letting callers request a transaction or
access info?

CMARTIN did not report the most fun aspect of the voice mail system, which was
not generally open to students.  It was (notice past tense) "call pickup"....
intended, I presume, as convenience in a large office, it lets you answer a
call to your number from someone else's phone. After hearing a distinctive
ring, say while you are down the hall, you can hit one button and get the next
incoming call, picking it up.  Well .... as we know so much in this business,
"programming in the small" is not the same as "programming in the large".  The
call pickup feature does not scale, as we demonstrated empirically.  Some
thoughtful soul had spec'd call pickup in our new system, but, to save money
set up the entire CS department on the same "group". (We were told this was to
save money...  one paid per group, where "group" was a set of numbers within
which the pickup feature would work.)  The net result of this was that whenever
a professor got bored, he or she could play call-pickup-roulette ...  that is,
pick up the phone, punch the "pickup number" and see if anyone was calling
*anyone* in the building.  That is, you could intercept any incoming call with
lucky timing.  (I should note that John Gannon had demonstrated a keen
proficiency in this technique.)  The entertaining part of this was how you
handled the call, which I leave to the reader's imagination.

John has a fertile imagination, especially when egged on by his office
neighbor.  The feature didn't last long.

Here is a chance to help get some equipment which will be widely used by the
public to work right from the start.  A friend of mine in the communications
industry is a member of a committee made of representatives of equipment
manufacturers.  They are not experts in designing or testing protocols, but are
designing several which will be used to accept messages from the public, carry
them between equipment made by the several companies, ending in a radio
receiver interfaced to the end user's computer.  If things go as they have in
the past, the protocols may be far from robust.  I am not identifying the
parties involved, and I hope that none of them take offense.  None is intended.
Learning to design protocols is not so easy.  Just being smart is not enough.

No doubt the "obviously difficult" parts, like the radio forward error
correction, will be done properly.  It is the "easy" parts involving
asynchronous communications that are likely to be defective in nonobvious ways.
One likely defect is that not every manufacturer's equipment will work properly
with the others.  This is a source of cost, and is the primary reason the
question of validating the equipment and protocols came up.  But of course, if
that sort of defect can arise, probably others which cause the public harm
might also arise.

Anyway, I will capture and forward any e-mail I receive on the subject to the
committee.  Maybe they can be persuaded to publish the protocols in a suitable
Usenet newsgroup, or elsewhere, for comment.  Maybe they can also be persuaded
to make eavesdropping difficult.  Recommendations of books, papers, testing
software, or qualified experts, is solicited.

&gt;It's already a cliche, but it's still true: when cryptography is outlawed, 
&gt;only outlaws will use cryptography. (And no, I *don't* believe the same 
&gt;is true for guns.)

Realizing that anyone who wants it can recover it, I have excised the signature
from this quotation because the author only made himself a representative of a
large class of fuzzy thinkers when he wrote it.

Consider the proposition:

If X is outlawed, then only outlaws will {have|use} X.

The hypothesis of that proposition is merely a statement that some legislative
body has declared the consequent to be true.  The proposition is a tautology,
true for all possible values of the variable X.

In particular, it is true for typewriters.  I believe the samizdat caused at
least one legislative body to substitute typewriter into the proposition for X.
It is true for photocopiers.  It is true for orange peels, though I don't know
of any legislature that has outlawed orange peels.

Most of us are in professions where logic is of some importance.  It hurts
credibility to declare in public, "I *don't* believe" a tautology.

Credit fraud is a particular concern of mine because I'm going through a
similar situation.  What I found interesting about the article posted by Mr.
Robinson was a parallel to previous well known computer system failures.

In his October 20 talk at MIT, Mr. Neumann pointed out [some of the problems
of] not learning from our mistakes.  The 1980 ARAPANET failure and the 1990
AT&amp;T failure were both caused by propagation of invalid packets across a
network (conceptually speaking, at least).  Cleaning up a corrupted credit
record is a similar problem.  Given the sharing of credit data, one has to
remove the incorrect information from all credit database simultaneously, or
it's likely to spread throughout the system again!

In addition, there's a security risk: the owner of any credit database can
insert faulty information and it will then be propagated throughout the system.

I just thought that readers of RISKS might like to know that IBM Australia has
a newly installed phone system that shows the calling number much of the time.
There has been no public comment (that I have seen) about the availability of
such information, or any way to turn it off. Most people I have talked to don't
know that the feature is available.

I spoke to our Telecom representative. Both ACCI and IBM Australia are ISDN
customers, and Caller-ID is a standard feature of ISDN.  Individual customers
get to enable or disable outgoing caller identification at the time they get
the service. By default the outgoing information is the phone number, but the
PABX can be programmed to send alphanumeric information, such as the caller's
name!  (According to the techie I talked to, most ISDN customers do allow their
identification information to go out, although some don't.  Either way, the
customer has to specifically address the question.  ACCI allows the Caller-ID
information even though our own handsets don't have display capability.)

Caller-ID for non-ISDN customers is technically available on most newer
exchanges, but AUSTEL, the regulatory authority now that Telecom has
competition, has not yet allowed general access until they address the privacy
issues.

I was impressed by this answer, both that it seems Australia is addressing the
issues pro-actively rather than waiting for a hoo-haa to occur, and also
because it was not particularly difficult to get the information.

McMinnville, OR (AP, 17 Nov 1992) -- The Yamhill County clerk discovered a
computer programming error that reverses the election results of the county's
district attorney's race.  Incumbent District Attorney John Mercer didn't lose
in the November election -- he won by a landslide.

Clerk Charles Stern said the computer error occurred because the program failed
to list the candidates in alphabetical order, as they were on the ballot.
Mercer had supposedly lost to Bernt "Owl" Hansen, 16,539 votes to 8,519 votes.
On Monday, the clerk's office told him Hansen's votes were actually his votes.

Mercer said he was astounded at the turn of events.  "The feedback I was
getting everywhere during the campaign was very positive.  And that's why it
was such an emotional extreme to see that I'd lost," Mercer said.  "But this is
really just as shocking the other way."

In high school I campaigned for a Democrat in a town near Buffalo with a
Republican "machine".  He said the the single most important thing to do on
election day is to get someone to EVERY voting machine at the very hour the
polls open, to cast their own votes but also to *test* the machines.  And if
ANY problem is found, you demand the machine's closure, and telephone the Board
of Elections just to make sure.

In our case every voting machine in town was set up to allow only straight
party-line voting.  Hurried calls to the county Board of Elections [run by the
Democrats] got the machines closed until they were set right, later the same
morning.

To keep this relevant, in the example RAY cited it was quite evident that the
voting system was not working properly, but in general can *-electronic-*
voting and tabulating systems be checked by users for correct operation ?  If
so, RISKS readers can offer their services for the morning of polling day, to
the party of their choosing.  If not, don't be surprised when "accidents"
occur.

                   Time-out costs BA dear 

   Its computer system may have cost the airline millions in lost earnings, 
   missing spare parts and legal expenses.  Chris Blackhurst, Independent
   on Sunday, 15th November, 1992

That was the headline over an article relating to a computer system called
`Total Inventory Management Engineering' (Time) which British Airways (BA)
introduced in July 1987, at a cost of 10M UK pounds.  Time, designed in-house,
governs BA's aircraft parts and stock control operation, handling 250,000 parts
worth 400M pounds.

It is suggested that problems have arisen because when Time was installed it
was initialised with inaccurate current stock levels taken from the original
manual stock system (known to be as much as 45% out), and these have apparently
never been corrected.

The article claims that this has affected BA in a number of ways:

a) General Electric took over servicing aircraft engines for BA in 1991.  BA
initially claimed the transfer of 53M pounds worth of spare parts.  General
Electric have nearly finished counting them, and have found only 30-35M pounds
worth.

b) In October 1991, BA submitted an insurance claim for a fire at its Gatwick
(London) warehouse.  The claim included 50M pounds worth of spare parts.  The
loss adjuster's report hints that BA's figures are not entirely reliable, and
valued the lost spares at 28M pounds.

c) The prosecution of 12 people on theft of aircraft parts and conspiracy was
based substantially on evidence from Time.  9 were acquitted, some of whom are
bringing legal proceedings against BA for wrongful arrest.  During
cross-examination, the person managing Time admitted that when it was installed
in 1987 40,000 items, including 94 complete aircraft engines each valued at
250,000 pounds, were found to be missing.  (The article is not too clear on
this point, but I presume it means to imply that concern over accuracy of the
data produced by Time contributed to the collapse of cases against some
individuals.)

d) Lack of confidence in the reliability of Time has lead to it being ignored
in some instances.  In one particular case, an engineer did not consult it when
refitting a cockpit windscreen.  As a result, he used the wrong bolts, and the
windscreen blew out in flight, almost sucking the pilot to his death (June
1990).

BA dispute the interpretation of events referred to in this article, suggesting
that there is no disagreement with General Electric, and that in the case of
the fire an initial `guesstimate' had later been revised.

The British magazine _New Scientist_ has in its issue of November 14, 1992,
two articles of interest.  The first relates to the recent discussion of
the London Ambulance Service.  The article states that the review began
last week and a report is due in February.  The article begins:

   "An overcomplicated system and incomplete training for control
    staff and ambulance crews are the likely causes of the collapse
    of London's computerised ambulance dispatch service two weeks
    ago.  One software company says that the London Ambulance Service
    (LAS) underestimated the pressure placed on staff at the control
    center, and that it makes working there `like a wartime action room.'"

The article continues with general observations about system complexity and a
description of the process of ambulance dispatching that the system was
intending to automate.  The computer consultant working on the review panel,
Paul Williams ("from the City firm Binder Hamlyn"), is described as having 13
years experience but he has never reviewed a safety-critical system.  He
intends to compensate with "expert help from his firm and the computer
industry."
                                            [The Tied Typer of Hamlyn?  PGN]

The second article is a four-page discussion entitled "Battling on with veteran
computers."  The major theme is the problems that are created by trying to keep
aging software and hardware going.  Examples discussed include the Patriot
missile system, IBM's Customer Information Control System package, the recent
upgrade to the Space Shuttle on-board computer system (we're up to a whole
megabyte of memory now!), porting the software for power distribution in
Britain from archaic Ferranti Argus 500 machines to modern equipment --

(I interject here a wonderful vignette:

   "The software for the initial system was written in a language
    called April, which disappeared long ago.  But the problem was
    not the rarity or age of the language, it was the lack of 
    documentation.  Three years after the system was delivered [1969],
    the CEGB [Central Electricity Generating Board] decided to develop
    its own software.  Today the system is maintained by a lone 
    programmer who has been working on the system in assembler for 20
    years.  Ask Derek Roberts, the group head of control facilities at
    the national centre of the National Grid Company what would happen
    if that person fell under a bus, and he pauses.  Then he replies:
    `we don't like to think about that.'"

We now return to our regularly scheduled programming.)

and the early flight control system for the Boeing 747-400.  According to the
article, so long as there are three copies of any aircraft type still flying in
the US, the avionics manufacturer is required by law to continue support -- so
Honeywell (which bought Sperry Flight Systems some time ago) is still cranking
out gauges and regulators for DC-3s.

Something new to add to everyone's burgeoning files.

According to Marketplace on American Public Radio, a stock on the New York
Stock Exchange (I don't remember the company) closed above 10000 on 16 Nov.
This is the first time any stock has been above $10000, and as you might
expect, the stock exchange's computers couldn't handle the 5 digit price.

The price rise wasn't incredibly fast, as the stock was up 400 for the day, so
one hopes they saw this problem coming and dealt with it, but the report I
heard had no further details.

There's nothing particularly surprising about this report, as we've seen lots
of similar examples.  After a while it's more depressing than surprising to see
the same mistake over and over again.

The NewYorkTimes Magazine had an article on October 18 about CHIPS, the
financial clearinghouse for major American banks, which handles one
trillion dollars electronically every day.  Although 85 percent of all
transactions are still made in cash, and only 2% electronically, the
electronic payments make up 85% by value.

The article examines some of the possible risks in this system.  The
hardware is run off of storage batteries, in a room with a Halon fire
extinguishing system.  But on Oct 1981, "a hardware breakdown took out
both New York computers" and "processing was interrupted for five minutes"
until backup systems (on an "independent communications grid") in New
Jersey were brought up.  Users "would never have known" if they hadn't
been told.

Messages are verified/encrypted in such a way that someone intercepting a
message couldn't just change a dollar amount.  Once, in 1989, some
criminals (with inside help at a Swiss bank) used CHIPS to help steal
$20M(illion).  They wired money from the Swiss bank (entering a fake
deposit on the books) to Australia, and quickly spread it around.  Though
they have been caught, only $8M has been recovered.  The electronic system
merely helped them disperse the large amount quickly.

The bigger worry is a loss of confidence.  Unlike in the similar European
system, all debts are netted at the end of the day.  Each bank either owes some
amount to the center, or is owed money.  If one bank fails to meet its
obligations, all transactions involving it that day are supposed to be
"unwound".  This could, of course, lead some other bank to no longer be able to
meet its own obligations for the day, causing a cascade.  CHIPS does allow each
bank to set a limit on how much it is willing to be owed by all other banks;
this limit is monitored continuously, and so a cautious bank could avoid
problems.

The Federal Reserve runs a similar system, and once had to make an overnight
loan of $24 billion to the Bank of New York "in order to settle the day's
accounts on transfers of Government securities that got fouled up in a software
snafu."  Of course, these days such securities are really just electronic
entities stored with the Fed, so the overnight loan was well collateralized,
and evidently the situation was fixed the next day.  The article says this
could not happen on CHIPS, because each transfer must be originated by the
payer.  [I don't know what this implies about the Fed system.]

The article concludes that "what all the experts fear is what they do not
know."

		BANK SYSTEM IN CHAOS AS MICROCODE BUG STRIKES
		By Randall Jackson

November 1, 3pm: a date and time users of Tandem's CLX systems around the world
won't forget in a hurry.  That's when a microcode bug struck, sending system
timers incoherent and causing chaos in applications such as EFTPOS and
automatic telling machines.  The bug was discovered first in New Zealand, which
is the first country to greet the new day.

"Literally, a bit seemed to fall off the field and the timers went incoherent
and began talking to themselves," says Ken Hennessy, chief manager at
Electronic Transfer Services (ETSL), which manages EFTPOS in New Zealand.
"They took the date back to December 1983."

There are five CLX installations in New Zealand, including Westpac, whose ATM
system crashed at the same time as EFTPOS.

Hennessy says Australia was the next affected, then Asia.  "I believe Japan was
a hell of a mess.  "We had been in touch with Australia because ETSL operates
contracts there, and they started to notice the problem.  They contacted Tandem
and the Americans became involved.  "By midnight, Tandem had worked out a way
of getting around the problem."

That was important, because Tandem was able to advise all its users in
America and Europe and prevent systems crashing there.

Hennessy says EFTPOS in Wellington was up and running again by 6.30pm.  "We
turned the clocks back two years to give us a clearance into 1990 at least.
Then we had to raise each host and hope it didn't cause problems of
irreconcilability.  It didn't, because it was day-to-day, month-to-month.  "Our
Auckland node came up at 9:40pm and in the early hours of Monday morning we got
back to 1992."  Hennessy says that there were two fixes: rolling the clocks
forward past 3pm then shifting them back so 3pm wasn't hit, or waiting until
3pm rolled around, and doing a cold start.

Typically, New Zealand businesses affected on a Sunday were supermarkets and
petrol stations.

Foodstuffs Wellington retail systems manager Alistair Garvie syas the loss of
EFTPOS was a major inconvenience.  "One of out largest stores does 25% of its
business through EFTPOS, and customers were complaining about having to pay
cheque fees instead," he says.

BP spokesperson Beppie Holmes says there was some inconvenience but the company
was able to revert to paper based transactions.  "Where it did affect us was in
our ability to provide cash to customers, which has an effect on residual
business," she says.

Tandem New Zealand manager John Simms says it took about four hours to work out
an answer to the problem, then communicate it to customers.  "There was a
microcode defect that caused the internal clock to be read incorrectly.  It
affected different applications in different ways," he says.  "It was a field
where at rollover the bug caused the data to be interpreted wrongly.  "We got
our customers to cold load and then reset correctly."

Simms says Tandem acted quickly to provide a fix.  "It would happen again in
2001 if we hadn't fixed it," he says.

The following material is from "Space Digest" v15 #425,
distributed as "Space@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu"

The article deals with the newly available, from the RUSSIANS, satellite photo
imagery with resolutions of 1.5 meters.  This is good enough, to pick out
individual cars in parking lots (although not to read the apocryphal license
plates).

They expect a bit more sharpness after some technical problems get resolved.

This is a curious "RISK."  On the one hand, it makes all sorts of overhead
photographic info available.  On the other hand, it also makes it (almost)
available to the general public.

Is it a "RISK" to find out how many Japanese fishing trawlers are out there?
What about which cars are parked overnight at the take-a-buck hot sheets motel?

article follows:

4- RUSSIAN MILITARY SPACE OBSERVATION DATA ON THE MARKET

   [Ran across a couple of interesting notes, with interesting ramifications.]

   Central Trading Systems in Arlington, Texas has a new product.  Digitized,
very high resolution Russian "Earth Observations" data.  This data showed up
about a month ago when some demonstration data was circulated within the
industry to see if there was some interest in buying it.  Folks who've analyzed
the data say it's in the 1.5-2 meter resolution range.

   At that resolution, you can pick out the Christmas tree in front of the
White House, or pick out individual cars in the Pentagon parking lot on the
demo tapes data.  Some rumors circulating in the industry claim the data could
have even a higher resolution quality, but the data has been poorly digitized
from photos.  This data is obvious from a former "strategic asset" of the
Soviet Union.

   Central Trading systems, can't identify what satellite generated the photo
data, but that the Russians call it a "DD5" system, for Digital Data 5.  As a
representative of the data seller Central Trading Systems is offering global
coverage with an extensive data archive of digital images.  If the scenes are
in the archive, customers can have the images on data tapes within 2 weeks,
delivered by Federal Express.  If new scenes are required, they can be
delivered with 45 days, weather permitting. Central Trading Systems thinks the
data is delivered digitally in Russian, transferred to photos, and then
re-digitized.  His offers the possibility that resolution can improve as more
advanced digitizing and image processing systems are applied.

   Cost for the data is $3180 (including shipping and handling) for a 13 x 13
Km, 8-bit scene, of 40 mps at 1600 bpi.  Demand is reportedly high.

   As a side note, on 2 October, a top Russian space commander stated the
Russian military space program will only survive by sharing its expertise and
hardware.  Col General Vladimir Ivanov was quoted in a Krasnaya Zvezda
interview as recommending Russian military space systems be used for commercial
and civilian purposes.  In particular, he was reported to have stated
"Reconnaissance satellites can be successfully used for long-distance probing
of the Earth's surface and for ecological monitoring without impairing their
main task."

   [Commentary: New competition in the Earth Resources market area.  There are
reportedly warehouses of high-resolution Earth observation data on both sides
of the ex-Iron curtain.  Different organizations have been selling ex-Soviet
observation data in the 10-meter resolution class, but the data availability
and market response has been poor, partially because the data was only
available sporadically or only in photographic form.  (For obvious reasons, the
preference is for data in digital format.)

    But if true, a marketable archive of global 2 meter or better data could be
a market gold mine. And the Krasnaya Zveda quote could indicate regular
availability to high-resolution data from Russian military systems could become
official policy and routine.

   SPOT and Landsat data is about an order of magnitude more coarse, with some
gaps in the digital data coverage available.  The Russian data prices are also
very competitive. I expect if the initial expectations are proven for this
Russian data, then it will capture a large share of the market within a few
years.

   Again, there can be a substantial commercial market pact from an ex-Soviet
system.  Due to policy considerations, the US government has been reticent to
release high-resolution Earth Observation data, and has encouraged the use of
100-meter resolution Landsat Data for commercial or non-critical government
needs.  It was only last month the US Department of Defense even officially
revealed the existence of the office which controlled such space assets.

   Similarly, SPOT, which has a very large ownership share by the French
government, has not striven to achieve the maximum resolution in its system.  A
higher resolution has been expected in the French military HELIOS observation
system under development.

   Perhaps the sale of high-resolution Russian data will encourage the release
of high resolution data by Western governments.  But this will also decimate
the existing SPOT or Landsat/EOSAT data markets, when they still have not
reached a critical mass for full commercial viability.  The best result would
be the encouragement of the construction of commercial Western systems with
equivalent capability, which is well within the capability of the industry.

   As it stands now, there are still significant unknowns in the future of
commercial Earth observations data.  This new source of data, if it is proven
as reliable and accurate, could substantially change some of the market
assumptions for Earth resources data.]

&gt;From the December issue of Popular Mechanics, Tech Update column 

(paraphrased)

Workers are installing on all 2400 Greyhound buses an on-board radar system 
made by VORAD Safety Systems.  One radar beam will scan ahead for obstacles
while a second will probe the driver's blind spot.  Steering, braking, speed
and obstacle closing rates will be recorded by a 'black box'.

VORAD is already testing a system on passenger cars that links the radar and
cruise control, enabling the car to maintain a constant distance away from the
vehicle ahead.  (no longer paraphrasing the magazine) "The next step, says
VORAD, is to connect the radar directly with the brakes, to decelerate the car
before the driver has time to react to an obstacle."

The RISKS seem obvious enough to me...

&gt;From the Dallas Morning News Friday Nov 13 issue, in the Line One column
(an advocate column of sorts):

Person's problem:  (paraphrasing salient points)

Person went to renew their driver's license during lunch; paid; was
photographed and taken to the back.  There they were informed of an outstanding
warrant and told to either pay the fine or be arrested.  Person admitted to old
speeding ticket which was allegedly paid.  Previous queries of driving record
and traffic stops did not reveal anything about the warrant nor was any
notification received by mail.

Response from Texas Dept of Public Safety: (again paraphrased)

Signature on citation is promise to contact/appear in court by date on
citation.  Failure results in issuing the warrant.  Issuing trooper enters
warrant into the Warrant Data Bank (WDB).  Warrants are placed in WDB are for
traffic citations issued only by the Dept.  Anytime license record is checked,
outstanding warrants will be indicated.  Some police depts. do not serve
warrants on license checks so a person may not be notified at a stop.  Warrant
information is not provided on driver's record checks.  With the start of the
WDB, the Dept. no longer sends mail to advise of issuing a warrant.

I recently heard from someone who *works* on British Airway's flight booking
system that it is only lack of access that keeps hackers out - the system it
runs is completely unprotected - a multitasking system where every task can
access the memory of other tasks.  And they're scared to make major changes to
it in case it falls over.

So he told me.  Season with salt as desired.

The coin collecting column in the Books section of the Chicago Tribune of
Sunday, Nov 8th is about counterfeiting paper money. Among other things it
says:

  Meanwhile, Canon USA has reported that it soon will add either one or two
  counterfeit deterrents to its new color copiers in an attempt to thwart
  would-be forgers.

  One technology places an invisible code on every copy made so that police
  could trace the machine that duplicated a dollar bill or other documents. The
  company also might produce machines that print black copies of greenbacks and
  other bank notes because of information programmed into the machine's
  computer memory.

I see a risk that these "invisible codes" will be used not only to track
counterfeiters but also whistleblowers, government critics, and those who only
want to be able to communicate privately. The risk increases if (when?) the
authorities require that each color copier/printer's "invisible code" be
registered.

I'm also unhappy with the idea that my printer will try to enforce laws about
what I can and cannot put on paper. How accurate will it be? Also, the scheme
creates the risk that more color copies of money will be produced. Who could
resist trying to fool the censor-in-the-machine?

Just discovered a feature that will probably amuse other readers of RISKS.

A certain very-popular-workstation-tape-storage-device will reload its firmware
upon finding a firmware-reconfiguration tape within its maw upon power-cycling.
Presumably it reads whatevers loaded upon start up and upon finding the right
code, interprets the data as destined for its EEPROMS.  Totally convenient but
amusing to a reader of RISKS.

The November 92 issue of Scientific American has an interesting article on the
risks of computers and proposes three different mechanisms to limit them.
Nothing there that regular readers of this forum won't have seen before, but
spelled out in clean language that anyone can understand.

Note that this is a case of circular reference, since the article ends by
recommending this forum as a good place to learn more about risks.

I browsed some of the recent postings on RISKS regarding what appeared to be
voting "anomalies" and had been keeping my typing fingers firmly clenched in my
fists for fear of provoking another flame war (now that the Denning one seems
to have abated).  As I had published recently on the subject of electronic
voting (CACM Nov 1992 Inside Risks; Virus &amp; Security Conference, March 1992),
have been involved in voting matters for close to a decade as an elected
official (committeeperson), and have provided expert witness testimonies, your
moderator requested that I comment on this subject.  Here then, is my advice:

1. Read the state and local election codes (they may differ). 
	You may find that in your municipality it is perfectly "legal" to 
	have misaligned ballots and other more egregious problems, simply 
	because the law does not specifically preclude such things. Copies
	of the laws should be available at your county or city courthouse.

2. Raise a LEGITIMATE protest.
	This might include:
	a) Lobbying to get the laws changed if you think they are inadequate.
	b) Petitioning the courts to have elections thrown out, or recounts,
		if you think that there has been a breach of the law.
	c) Getting press coverage.

3. Get involved at the grass roots level.
	Although many municipalities saw a &gt; 80% turnout of _registered_
	voters at the polls this November, the Spring primaries will likely
	see &lt; 20% of those same voters returning. It is typically in the 
	off-year races where people who will be appointing the members of your
	Boards of Elections (who oversee the process) will be getting elected.
	Vigilance is a year-round process. Although it is quite eye-opening to
	work at the polls THROUGHOUT election day (not just at the beginning or
	end of the day), what occurs during the other 363 days of the year
	often sets the stage for what happens at the polling places. If you 
	have no idea how to get involved, start by perusing your telephone 
	book for the numbers of local officials, and your newspapers for
	announcements of political or civic gatherings.

And while I am on the soap-box...

4. Spend considerably more time WORKING for the causes you care about than
   you do reading or writing about them (on bbs or email).
	The problems of elections and computer risks (as well as poverty, 
	unemployment, hunger, discrimination, violence, ...) are not going to
	be solved if we sit here at our terminals relaying anecdotes around
	the world at NSF (and other government-funded) expense. If you are 
	not ACTIVELY contributing to the solution, you are part of the problem.
	Many of the RISKS postings point to the inadequacy of software
	engineering methodologies and practices, yet few colleges and 
	universities offer COMPREHENSIVE courses in SW Eng. and far fewer
	REQUIRE them as part of core curricula for the next generation of EE 
	and CS professionals. Many of the problems with computerized vote-
	counting are directly related to failures in verification, validation
	and auditability (all familiar words to Software Engineers). If you are
	concerned about reducing risks, get out there and make it happen.

I regret, in advance, that I will not be able to reply to private emails
relating to the above posting, as my bandwidth is severely impacted due to
writing a dissertation.  If you feel moved to comment, please relay such to
RISKS and Neumann will filter them as appropriate. I hope that at least one
person will write (in a few months, because that is how long it will take) that
they did ALL of points 1, 2, 3, and 4 and report on their results.

electronic eavesdroppers, finally won a degree of privacy in a federal
appeals-court ruling.

The Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a criminal case, said that when
such phone users reasonably expect their conversations to be private, the
government can't listen in.  But the court said the Fourth Amendment privacy
right must be evaluated case by case, depending on such factors as whether the
phone user had sought privacy by purchasing devices intended to foil
eavesdroppers or by using phones known to be more difficult to tap.

The ruling is apparently the first in which a federal court has allowed
cordless-phone users any privacy rights.  Previously, other appeals courts have
said the phones are so easy to eavesdrop on - with an AM/FM radio or even with
another cordless phone - that any expectation of privacy was ridiculous.

The Eight U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the late 1980s that
eavesdropping was allowed, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the
decision.

The New Orleans court noted that the previous opinions are all several years
old, and that the technology has since advanced in the $1.39 billion
cordless-phone market.  Some phones on store shelves now, for instance, come
with scrambling devices made to combat high-tech eavesdroppers.  Other phones
work within shorter ranges, so their frequencies can't be as easily intercepted
as they were in the past.  More than 18 million cordless phones are expected to
be sold this year....

"The reasonableness of expectations of privacy for a cordless phone
conversation will depend, in large part, upon the specific telephone at issue,"
the court said.  It declined to spell out the technological features it
considered most relevant.

[The actual drug conviction, based on information recorded by a neighbor, was
upheld since no evidence about the phone had been introduced.]

Privacy-rights lawyers applauded the broader ruling, which they said is a step
toward preventing eavesdropping by private citizens as well as police.  The
lawyers noted that cellular-phone conversations already are protected [though
technically they are as easy to intercept.] ...

[N]ow that cordless phones are more secure, they should be treated the same as
cellular phones, Ms. [Janlori] Goldman [of the ACLU] said.  "People who use
these different kinds of phones do not make these kinds of distinctions," she
said.  "One circuit is willing to recognize that this might be an absurd
distinction." ...

[For those interested, the case citation is U.S. vs. David Lee Smith, Fifth
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, New Orleans, 91-5077.

Can we expect future Willie Horton's who beat the rap to get hired by the maker
of their phone to tout it as "private - and a court agreed?"]

A problem with risks is that it is difficult to communicate information about
risks to people. If, for example, a doctor says to a patient "there is a very
small risk that this pill will cause liver problems" then many patients
interpret this as if the doctor had said "there is a large risk that this pill
will cause liver problems". So doctors usually do not tell the patients such
information, because the patients so often misinterpret the information.

Any comment on how to communicate risk information so that people get a correct
understanding, especially when you are informing people about very small risks?

	Recently in Auckland, Aotearoa (New Zealand) the police were involved
in an unusual case.  It seems that several people burgled a house and among the
items taken was a set of videotapes. The tapes contained home-made pornographic
movies involving the inhabitants of the burgled house.  The burglars then
attempted to use their possession of the tapes to blackmail the "actors" into
paying for the return of the tapes.  Unfortunately when the burglars arrived at
the payment drop off point they were met by the NZ Police, who seized them and
the tapes.
	Any sighs of relief that the "actors" might have had were short-lived.
The burglars counter-charged that the tapes contained scenes of child
pornography and bestiality which made them indecent under NZ Law.  The result
was that several police "had" to view 40 hours of video recordings to verify
whether these claims were or were not correct (it turned out that the
recordings did not contain any child pornography or bestiality).
	The tapes were returned to the, by now, extremely embarrassed "actors".
With the increase in home computers capable of using frame grabbing software to
create digitised pictures and the almost insatiable desire of the networks to
spread any and all such pictures, the "actors" involved in this case were very
lucky that their images didn't end up adding to the network traffic statistics
for alt.sex.pictures.erotic.
	Of course, if the original tapes had been encrypted, this embarrassment
would never have occurred... or would it?

      Incident during the descent of an Airbus A-320 of Air Inter 
      -----------------------------------------------------------

The crew of an Airbus A320 who were making in September a flight between
Clermont-Ferrand and Paris-Orly were surprised to witness an aberration in the
vertical speed of descent of the equipment. Having chosen a mode of descent of
550 meters per minute, they noticed that the plane was losing 750 meters per
minute, and that when they tried to correct that value to 450 meters per
minute, the rate worsened to 850 meters per minute.  The pilots at that point
changed their procedure and chose an angle (rather than a rate) of descent and
everything went back to normal.

The cause of the incident can be imputed to defective design in the interface
between the flight controller and the auto-pilot, both developed by the French
Sextant-Avionique and by the German BGT and with which other types of planes
such as the Airbus A-300 and A-310 are equipped with. This kind of fault is not
frequent, but it is one of the anomalies that the crew is trained to correct.

This incident would have passed unnoticed if certain pilots had not made it
public to point out a relationship to the aerial catastrophe of Mount
Saint-Odile which happened in January, when 87 persons were killed in the crash
of an Airbus A-320 of Air Inter. The first findings of the commission of
inquiry had perhaps made it appear that the crew was mistaken in the choice of
descent mode towards the airport of Strasbourg and that they had not monitored
their trajectory.

Judge Francois Guichard, in charge of the investigation of the accident of
Mount Saint-Odile, which killed 87 last January 20, indicated on Thursday
evening in Toulouse that the recent incident in the descent mode of an A320 of
Air Inter "Could a priori appear to be one of the reasons that caused the
accident". The magistrate referred to the failure of the electronic control
systems for the mode of descent of an A320 of Air Inter which, in September,
took a much steeper descent than that chosen [by the pilots].

&gt; To: paul@nova.house.gov
&gt; Subject: DC-3
&gt; 
&gt;    In a recent Risks digest, you mention that if more than three production
&gt; aircraft are still flying, it's a requirement that avionics become available,
&gt; and use the Honeywell equipment for the DC-3 as an example.  This is not a
&gt; good example at all, since there are almost two thousand DC-3 aircraft flying
&gt; in the US alone, as well as many more abroad.  The DC-3 remains a reliable
&gt; workhorse of an aircraft; easy to fly and inexpensive to maintain.  A large
&gt; amount of current cargo lines still have DC-3s for use to smaller airports
&gt; where larger jets cannot land, and in fact there are still turboprop retrofit
&gt; kits available for the DC-3.
&gt; 
&gt;   Nonetheless, this is not as much of a problem as you might expect, both
&gt; because most avionics are fairly standardized, and because the low production
&gt; volume means that most of them are handmade on a one-off basis.
&gt; --scott

After receiving the message above, I went back to my posting in <A HREF="/Risks/14.06.html">RISKS-14.06</A>.
Those who aren't able to find the article could very well misinterpret the
comment about avionics support requirements.  My summary improperly tied actual
system problems in various applications to a different concern about long-term
support for aircraft avionics.  The author cited the DC-3 (Dakota to
Englishmen) as the example of how long the a company might find itself in
harness to produce vintage equipment.  Dorsey is, of course, correct about the
treasured status of the venerable DC-3, and the profit to be made from the
large number of planes left.  The article's discussion focused more on the
close fit between autopilot and aircraft necessary for certification and the
likely difficulties this would pose as the more computer-literate aircraft of
the jet age continue to carry us around the world and the avionics firms try to
keep the control systems up-to-date.  I did a poor job of setting the context.

This will have very important consequences for UK industry. For example, none
of the UK motor industry considers computing in cars as safety critical, and
hence do not use appropriate techniques for developing software ("a bunch of
cowboy hackers" was one description of the software developers in one company).
Of course, with this new law (which is EC wide) it won't be up to the industry
to deign if something is safety critical or not, it will be up to the law
courts. If I were an executive in the car industry I would be quaking in my
shoes at the moment..

There are, in fact, two separate risks involved here, and two separate
regulations to control them.  In-flight users can impose an excessive load on a
a cellular phone system by accessing many cells at once; therefore the FCC has
recently prohibited airborne use of cellular phones (see 57 FR 830).

There is also a more general risk of any portable electronic equipment
used in aircraft, since it has not been tested for interference with
the electronic systems in the aircraft.  FAA regulation 91.21
therefore prohibits the use of portable electronic equipment (with
minor exceptions) in an airliner unless the airline has determined
that it will not cause interference.  Many airlines have issued
blanket permission for items such as tape players and laptop
computers, but I am unaware of any that yet allow the use of cellular
phones, even on the ground, where they would otherwise be legal.

&gt; ... To be exact, my recollection is that the frequencies used by
&gt;Cellular are fairly close to some of the frequencies used by the avionics.

	This is my understanding too, but note that this was extended on some
airlines to laptop computers and even some hand-held video games.  Midwest
Express, a rather expensive but high-quality business-oriented airline, has
cellular phones in each seat.  I suspect it's not the frequency of the cellular
phone transmission that worries the airlines, but rather the electro-magnetic
or RF interference it might play with the IFR systems or possibly the
electronic controls on the aircraft.

	The risk here would be allowing non-certified phones on board, whereas
airline-supplied phones can be easily tested by the airline.

Just how might a regulation be written that would allow cellular use from

The security services are using a lot of very expensive resources to decrypt
intercepted messages (Spycatcher revealed that all telephone traffic and all
radio traffic was routinely monitored and recorded in the 1950s to 1970s -
so this is probably still true, or close to true).

If you don't *need* your messages to be secure from the Government, why not
give them a break and agree to a key registration scheme? Arguments that
this will always be defeated by the criminals seem to ignore the help that
the law-abiding can give by making the unco-operative easier to identify,
and thereby freeing decryption effort.

Isn't there a balance between distrust of Government,(however justified) and
a need to help the law-enforcers to enforce the laws that keep society
civilised?

We are the experts in this technology. What can we propose that gives a
proper balance between privacy and law-enforcement?

&gt;Most of us are in professions where logic is of some importance.  It hurts
&gt;credibility to declare in public, "I *don't* believe" a tautology.

in a very aptly-titled Risks submissions, Dan Herrick purports to make a
contribution to a serious social discussion (the effectiveness of gun control)
with a trivial "logic" analysis. this is the kind of argument that gives
technical people a bad name.

the statement "When guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns" isn't a
tautology on anything but the shallowest reading (hint: people usually don't
bother to assert tautologies).  it's an assertion that dangerous, threatening,
bad people will have guns and good, honest citizens won't be able to defend
themselves.  some people believe it, some don't; only extreme technical
blindness would allow someone to think the question could be dismissed with a
puff of logic.  *that's* what hurts credibility (and that's perhaps the least
of its risks).

On the subject of "RISKS of technical people disengaging brains", I'm afraid
Mr. Herrick has fallen victim to over-literalism.  I've used this expression
more than once, and I'm perfectly aware of the tautology.  The point he is
missing is that many natural languages contain grammatical constructs which if
analyzed grammatically, are either tautologies or self-contradictory.  This
doesn't automatically make them nonsense or their users fuzzy-thinking fools.
I think most native English speakers understand intuitively the implied clause
which follows statements of the form "If/when they outlaw X, only outlaws will
have X".  If he doesn't, I'm sure he can find any number of people (possibly
even without advanced degrees) who would be more than happy to explain it to
him.

It's not a tautology.  One reasonable interpretation of the statement is that
"if X is outlawed, only people who are already outlaws of other types will use
X".

I suppose this indicates a RISK of some sort, though I don't really feel like
phrasing it fully.

Dan Herrick, dlh%dlhpfm@NCoast.org, misses the deeper meanings of the statement
"if X is outlawed, only outlaws will use X".  Of course, there is a tautologous
interpretation, explained by Herrick.  But when X is refers to guns, this
statement has been used to imply many things that are not tautologies.
Far-right lobbying groups have used this slogan to imply that any waiting
period, or other reasonable restriction on the purchase of deadly weapons,
would lead merely to difficulties for "law-abiding citizens" while having no
effect on criminals.

I'm sure the original author (Phil Karn, karn@qualcomm.com) was merely trying
to disassociate himself from such "fuzzy thinking", by pointing out that what
might be true for cryptography might not be true for guns.

Statements in a language like English are very rarely tautologies: they
always carry around extra baggage.

Actually, this statement is not, strictly speaking, a tautology.  It isn't
even, strictly speaking, a statement of logic.  Why?  Because its truth value
depends not on its logical form, but on the meaning of its terms.

In particular, the meaning of the term "outlaw" is telling.  It is one thing to
break the law.  It is quite another to "be an outlaw."  Ordinary citizens break
laws.  Some even scoff at certain laws, and other still skirt the letter of the
law while seeing its value and holding to its intent.  But "being an outlaw"
implies a habitual disdain or disregard for the law--which is why the clever
originators of that slogan use that word in order to frighten ordinary citizens
into opposing restrictions on their ability to purchase guns.  It's funny how
much less impact the slogan has when you replace "guns" with "encryption."

While it's true that if you make codes or guns more difficult to obtain, only
those with stronger motivation will obtain them.  Nevertheless, one need not be
an outlaw to vehemently desire both protection and privacy.
                                                                  -r

I recently had a terrible experience (involving loss of several hours of work
time and much swearing) with a print spooler program for the Macintosh.  As
with many such programs, you put it on the system by running an installer
program.  The installer performs all sorts of modifications to the system
software, and basically you just gotta cross your fingers and hope the software
works okay.  This one didn't.

As soon as I attempted to print something, the system no longer saw my printer
and the printer would go into an alarm condition every time I tried to print
something.  Calling the software company was no help, I probably spent 1/2 hour
listening to an NPR station in Louisiana hoping they would pick up the phone.

I tried de-installing the software, by putting the old system up from backups
and tracking down all the files the installer had inserted into my system.
This was a lot of work, and had no effect on the problem.  This is an important
point I'd like to make: any installer program should also have the capacity to
de-install, so that the user has at least one back-tracking path if something
goes wrong.

A de-install feature probably wouldn't have helped me out, though.  The problem
turned out to be that the program accidentally changed one of my system
defaults.  Without asking, it activated Applelink (the networking system) which
normally uses the line printer port.  That caused my default printer port to
switch to the modem port.

Recent discussion of problems with election equipment and software has not
included any mention of the efforts of the Federal Election Commission and
National Association of State Election Directors (NASED) to promote the
development of standards and certification testing of election systems.

NASED just recently recognized the first national Independent Testing Authority
(ITA) to conduct testing of election equipment and software.  Election
Technology Laboratories (ETL), a joint operation of Stevens Institute of
Technology and U.S. Testing Company, is now ready to conduct hardware,
electrical, environmental, package, software, and human factors testing of
election systems.

We are very interested in learning about election system breakdowns.  Since
election officials do not typically advertise the breakdown of election
systems, it would be good to hear from anyone in the RISKS FORUM about their
experiences.

There is a great body of literature about the way people make decisions and the
systematic biases in their thinking.  Just to cite one example, people tend to
be risk-taking when a question is framed in terms of possible gain, but
risk-aversive when the question is framed in terms of possible losses.

Perhaps the best single reference on this is the book "Judgement Under
Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases", edited by Kahneman, Slovic, and Tversky.
(My copy is almost 10 years old, but it was published by Cambridge University
Press, ISBN 0-521-28414-7).  Kahneman and Tversky in particular have spent a
long time analyzing the systematic biases in peoples' judgement and have
published many papers on the topic.

I highly recommend studying their work if you are in a position either of
having to present probabilistic risks to others or of having to evaluate such
risks presented to you.

&gt; Any comment on how to communicate risk information so that people get a correct
&gt; understanding, especially when you are informing people about very small risks?

Perhaps a good way to communicate information about risks is to tell people the
odds and compare them with the odds of various every-day disasters.  For
example (off the top of my head):

   Odds of dying in a car accident in the next year: 1 in 10000
   Odds of a mother dying during childbirth:         1 in 10000
   Odds of middle-aged adult dying in the next year: 1 in 1000
   Odds of a young child dying in the next year:     1 in 100
   Odds of a baby dying during childbirth:           1 in 100

People are usually given insufficient credit for being able to compare risks
themselves, perhaps because they are seldom handed straight numbers by experts.

Xavier Xantico asks how to communicate risk information to the public in a
meaningful manner.

Suggestion: it would be nice to see the "automobile accident" and the 
"cigarette smoking" standards.

Examples (purely fictional):
"The risk of your child seriously injuring himself in 3 hours of
playing with this toy is about the same as that of being an automobile 
passenger for 4 minutes."

"The risk of long-term liver damage from this medication is approximately
the same as the risk of cancer from smoking 2 packs of cigarettes."

I realize that there would be serious problems in accurately calibrating
such "standards," but I think they would be very valuable in giving
people a clear understanding of risks.

In a previous article, Xavier Xantico (?) writes about the difficulty of
communicating statistical risks to ordinary people.  The Richter scale seems to
be successful in allowing people to think about and compare seismic events
(earthquakes); perhaps we can develop a similar scale for statistical risks.

I suggest a logarithmic (base 10) scale based on the expected lifetime
frequency of the event (and population) in question.  To avoid confusion, a
"lifetime" should be defined as a fixed duration, 80 years perhaps, since many
interesting events will be fatal.

Thus, an event scoring 0 on this scale would be expected to happen once per
lifetime (per person), an event scoring +1 ten times, etc.  The event "dying in
an airline crash" might score -6, "dying of cancer" -1, "hearing a campaign
promise" +3, and so on.

The approximate useful range of the scale would be -14 (a 1 in 5000 chance of
occurring once in the lifetimes of 5 billion people) to +11 (expected to
happen tens of times per second for each individual).

One or two canonical events could be chosen for each integer on the scale to
make the scale easily accessible to nonstatisticians (such as myself).

&gt; Any comment on how to communicate risk information so that people get a 
&gt; correct understanding, especially when you are informing people about very 
&gt; small risks?

Well, what you *don't* do is say: 

       "Every time you do X, it knocks n days off your life!" 

Such statements are hopelessly misleading to anyone not familiar with the 
concepts of "distribution of time to failure" and "mean time to failure". 
It is unfortunate that many government health education statements are 
couched in precisely those terms. 

Other than that, you must get across a few of the basic ideas of probability 
theory. The "urn" model is quite intuitive: a 0.01 probability is the 
probability of pulling the black ball out of an urn containing 99 white balls 
and one black ball. 

The best introduction to probability for the non-mathematical reader that I 
have read is "How to take a chance" by Darrel Huff (perhaps better known for 
his other popular book "How to lie with statistics"). 

Also try: 

"Making Decisions", D.V. Lindley, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2nd Ed., 1985 

Lindley is a bit more demanding than Huff. (Also Huff teaches you how to play 
good poker! :-) 

To see if the ideas have been understood, ask the "student" what is wrong with 
the following: 

A businessman, who needs to fly a lot in order to do his job, is terribly
afraid that there will be a bomb on board one of his flights. He asks his
friend (a probability theorist) what to do about it.

"Well!" says the friend, "What do you think are the chances that there 
will be a bomb aboard your flight?" 

"Judging by recent statistics," says the worried flyer, "it could be about 
1 in ten thousand." 

"So what would be an acceptable risk?", says the friend. "How about 1 in 
100 million, which is the probability of two separate bombs being on board?" 

"Yes, that would be OK." 

"Fine! So all you have to do is, every time you board a flight, make sure you 
carry a bomb!"

One thing you have to remember is that the risk of something happening isn't
the only factor to be considered when deciding whether or not to accept that
risk.  The consequences of the event, its preventability, and the likely
consequences of alternative actions also have to be considered. To return to
your example, I have a fungal infection in the nail beds on one of my feet.
The only cure is to take tablets that ensure there is a fungicide in your
blood, and hence fungicide reaching the nailbed. Now this drug occasionally
destroys the liver, and doesn't always work. Without a liver I would be dead.
The risk is low but the benefits from the drug are minor, I can live with
tickly toenails, especially as I can treat the itch.  It isn't worth the risk
in my opinion. If I had a mestasised cancer on the other hand and the drug of
choice could destroy my liver I would take it.

I once went to a talk on people's assessments of the risk of having a
handicapped baby, and how likely people were to risk amniocentesis/chorionic
villi testing (which has a risk of inducing a miscarriage).  The lecturer was
startled that the willingness to be tested varied with whether or not people
already had a handicapped child, how many normal children they had, and the
severity of the handicap as well as the risk that the child was handicapped.
He didn't see that the greater impact the care of a handicapped child would
cause of the more important it was that it didn't happen and the less important
the relatively fixed "cost" of a miscarriage became.

He was also horrified that people who didn't want an abortion would want to be
tested.  I think that makes sense.  Knowing gives you time to prepare, and
there may be a miscarriage (even if the latter option isn't admitted to
themselves).

Basically what I am saying is that people aren't misjudging risks as often as
is assumed by professionals, they are taking other factors into account as
well.

I don't normally read comp.software-eng. (It takes up enough of my time reading 
comp.risks and a couple of others!) However, your message was passed on to me 
by Dave Bolton in the Computer Science Department here. (Thanks, Dave!) 

I hope you don't mind, but I have sent this reply, including a copy of your 
original message, to comp.risks also, since it is relevant to a recent 
discussion there. Perhaps you could forward it to comp.software-eng as well, 
since I am not sure of the distribution address for that list, and I'm too

I just had an interesting discussion with a peer who is an electrical engineer.
It was about our reliability budget in which we have set a goal of a certain
number of service calls per year upon the introduction of the instrument.  She
asked if there was a methodology followed in calculating reliability for
software.  One of the examples we were discussing was code that resides in a
PROM.  If there was an error in the software and our service representative
will have to replace the PROM, how would that be looked at?

I told her point blank that I was not aware of any process used to
calculate software reliability.  Is there one?  I would be very
interested to know how the reliability is measured in an application
programming environment as compared to how it is determined for a
device driver, for example.
 
Any insights would be appreciated.  Thank you very much
 
Janet C. Figueroa, figueroa@serum.kodak.com

----- End Included Message -----

&gt; She asked if there was a methodology followed in calculating relaibility for
&gt; software. 

There certainly is!  Basically, you observe the software during its later test
and trial phases, when it is reasonable to assume that it is being run under
conditions which are a fair approximation to its eventual operational
environment.

You record the execution time and the failures. You diagnose the cause of each
failure, and strip out from your data set solely those failures which are due
to activations of *new* faults (i.e., your final data set consists of instances
of detecting new faults over execution time).

Unless something is wrong with the environment in which you are running 
your software, you will observe a decreasing rate of finding new faults 
over execution time. You can do a statistical analysis of the growth in 
reliability as you debug the software, and estimate such quantities as:- 

  - current rate of finding new faults, 

  - number of faults that will be found in a given period, 

  - median time to failure, 

  - extra testing time required to get to given target levels of any of the
    above.

To do the analysis, you can apply various software reliability models. The
estimation process involves estimating the values of the model parameters from
the observed history of finding faults.

Be warned! :- 

1. Different reliability models sometimes give different predictions based 
   on the same set of data. (However, there are statistical methods which 
   can measure the bias in the predictions from each model, correct for this, 
   and so reconcile the predictions.) 

2. The whole procedure depends *crucially* upon the observations being made 
   in the same operational environment as that in which the software will be 
   used in service. 

3. The measure of "execution time" employed must be a meaningful measure 
   of the degree to which the software has been used, taking account of the 
   type of software and its application. 

4. Serious problems arise if very high reliability is required. (Basically, 
   the statistical methods require a reasonably large data set of faults 
   found in order to work with any degree of accuracy. For ultra-high levels 
   of reliability, such as those required for safety-critical systems, the 
   observation of even one failure during the trial period means that the 
   software is not good enough!) 

Apart from the restriction regarding ultra-high reliability requirements, 
the methods can be applied to any type of software, whether resident in a 
PROM or not. They have been applied "in anger" to all types of software where 
a modest failure-rate is acceptable, including operating systems and 
application software, and have given reasonably accurate predictions. 

Given that you are envisaging a situation where support representatives *will* 
be deployed (i.e., this system *is* going to fail, isn't it? :-) these are 
exactly the sort of methods you should be employing. 

Logistical calculations can be based on the reliability estimates. 
For example: How do we decide when to issue a "bug-clearance" release on a new 
PROM, in order to achieve the maximum cost-effectiveness of our support 
operation?

There is a voluminous literature on all of these problems, and CSR has 
specialised in them for a number of years. If you require any further 
information, copies of papers, etc., do not hesitate to get in touch.

Every year, in the 12 countries of the European Community, some 55,000 people
are killed in road accidents. The European vehicle manufacturers have joined
together with component suppliers to share research on improved safety and
traffic efficiency.

A team at Lucas is collaborating with Jaguar to develop collision avoidance
systems suitable for fitting to the majority of road vehicles. Basically, the
system will use various sensing methods -- optical, infrared, and radar -- to
detect where the road is, and the location of other objects (vehicles, people,
stationary objects) that are likely to cross the path of the vehicle equipped
with the system. The system then assess what threat these objects pose, and
assists the driver in selecting the best course of action.

Enormous processing power is necessary to extract edges in the video image, 
before detecting vehicles and road or lane edges. Some 3000 million 
operations per second must be carried out for real-time working. The next 
stage of the project will investigate the fusion of microwave and infrared
sensors to provide a more reliable view of the world around the vehicle.

All are welcome to come to this seminar on Wednesday the 25th November, 
from 2 - 3 pm in A230. We are very fortunate to be able to listen to 
Raglan Tribe, of Lucas Automotive Ltd., who will also be presenting a

I am looking for a PhD program in Computer Science or in Technology and Public
Policy programs in the US or Canada in which one could specialize in the topics
familiar to RISKS readers.

So far, I have only heard of the Computing, Organization, Policy and Society at  
UC Irvine. Dr. Rob Kling heads a program on RISKS and related issues.  It  
sounds good.

Any others out there?

                   ERRORS IN LARGE DATABASES AND THEIR
                           SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS

                      Prospectus for a special issue
                    of the Information Society Journal

With the growth of information technology over time, we are becoming
increasingly affected by data in electronic databases.  The social and business
premise is that electronic databases improve productivity and quality of life.
The dark side of all this is that these databases contain errors, most trivial
but in some cases they contain errors that by their nature impose a penalty on
society.  The penalties can range from minor annoyance and modest
administrative cost in having a record corrected, to more serious cases where
more costly consequences ensue, to conceivably, loss of life or major loss of
property.

The consequences to society of errors in electronic databases can be expected
to increase, probably at an increasing rate.  Some factors contributing to this
expected increase are the increasing extent, in both size and coverage, of
existing databases; increasing capture of data by automated transaction
systems, from text and image scanners and the like; greater coupling of
databases, either by administrative agreements or by more sophisticated search
processes; more "amateur" database administration with increasingly widespread
use of information technology; increasing use of heuristic search techniques
that lack "common sense;" and probably other well-meaning but pernicious
influences.

The purpose of the proposed issue is to accomplish the following: (a) increase
recognition of, and awareness of the growing nature of the problem of errors in
electronic databases that are increasingly becoming regulators of modern life;
(b) encourage greater attention to the collection of error rate data and to
quantitatively assessing the social and economic costs deriving from those
errors; (c) foster theoretical and empirical studies of the propagation of
errors through the coupling of, or joint search of, multiple databases; and (d)
encourage the formulation of measures, in both technology and policy domains,
designed to limit the costs accruing from the inherent growth in size and
connectivity of electronic databases.

We seek papers for the issue that will focus on the following aspects of the
problem addressed here: (1) an enumeration of socially relevant databases,
whose errors can have important consequences, either from a large number of
small unit cost consequences or a small number of high cost consequences; (2)
quantitative data on errors in databases, classified by the nature of the
errors and their derivative costs; (3) obstacles to a full and open discussion
of the problem such as those deriving from concern over legal liability and
loss of business from "owning up" to the problem; and (4) proposals for
technical and policy measures that can limit the growth of the problems
addressed.

The premises of the journal issue are: (1) that the problems of errors in
databases can not be minimized until they are adequately recognized and fixes
explored by the professionals in the field; and (2) that we must move from the
anecdotal level, where horror stories abound, to a quantitative level where the
economics of fixes, either in quality control at the point of data collection,
or the quality control of the output of database searches, can be sensibly
analyzed.

Your interest in contributing to this special issue is invited.  Suggestions
for possible topics, authors, or an interest in contributing should be
communicated to one of:

Tue, 24 Nov 92 13:43:16 GMT
</i><PRE>

RISKS readers with long memories or good archives may remember the piece I
submitted about an incident at the British Nuclear Fuels plc plant at
Sellafield (<A HREF="/Risks/12.65.html">RISKS-12.65</A>). I recently noticed that the official report by the
Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) had been published in July and I now
have a copy. It is summarised below.  As will be seen at the end, this is a
real `text-book' incident.

First, the complete text of the Health and Safety Executive's quarterly
Statement of Nuclear Incidents relating to this incident.  This was dated 3 Jan
92. The NII are part of the HSE.

  In September maintenence work was taking place within a monitoring cell at
  British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) Sellafield Waste Vitrification Plant, which is
  used to handle containers of highly active vitrified waste. To facilitate the
  maintenence two shield doors, normally closed during cell operations, had
  been opened to allow access.

  On 15 September, a container of the vitrified waste was raised into the cell
  remotely by a process worker who had been instructed to restart operations.
  The worker then observed on a TV monitor that both sets of shield doors were
  still open and took action to close them, reinstating the shielding. No
  workers were in the area at the time.

  The matter was reported to the HSE's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate
  (NII), which immediately started an investigation to determine the causes of
  the incident. A similar investigation was also set in train by BNFL. The
  plant will remain shut down until the results of these investigations are
  known and any necessary modifications to the equipment and changes to
  procedures have been completed to prevent a recurrence. The NII will monitor
  the implementation of these changes to both plant and procedures.

This is a very bland statement, just saying `two doors were open'.  The
incident was considered serious though. There are about 3 incidents reported
via this mechanism every quarter but I can't remember another case where a full
report was published.

To the report itself. Knowing that nobody was irradiated or otherwise hurt you
can enjoy the comedy of errors that follows.

The cell involved was a room with a robot in it. Freshly cast blocks of
vitrified waste were cooled and decontaminated on the level below the cell,
then lifted by a crane through a hatch door in the floor, given a final scrub
down by the robot, and then passed up trough another door, the gamma gate, in
the ceiling.  The two shield doors allow access into the cell for people to fix
the robot, using the doors like an airlock.

When the plant was designed it was not expected that much fixing would be
needed and it was though acceptable that only one door would be open at a time
during maintenence. The system that ensured this was a Programmable Logic
Controller (PLC) driven by a key exchange box. This is a partly mechanical
thing that ensures that the key needed to open the outer door is trapped in a
dummy lock until an external key from the Permit Foreman's office is inserted
and the key to operate the inner door is put in a dummy lock and the inner door
is closed. It would seem to be enough in itself to ensure that only one door is
open at at time.  There is also a hardwired interlock to prevent the outer door
opening if a gamma monitor inside the cell detected high radiation.

During the initial commissioning of the plant it was discovered that the robot
needed a lot more fixing than at first thought, and it was also decided that it
would be better if people working inside the cell could get out quickly by
having both doors open at once.  An additional keyswitch was added to the key
exchange box to bypass the existing arrangement, with another key which was
normally held in the Permit Foreman's office.

In mid 1990, still during commissioning, more changes were made.  Hardware
changes were made to ensure that the doors could only open in the correct
sequence and that the hatch door in the floor could not open if the new
override key was in use. Software changes were also made to prevent the hatch
door opening when the inner door was open `however, instead of being achieved
directly, this was effected by a complicated set of conditional relationships
intended to ensure that the inner door could only be opened if the in-cell
crane was parked next to the inner door'. If the crane was parked there it
could not be lifting anything through the hatch.

During commissioning of these mods. a further change was made to the PLC
program. This was designed to prevent the hatch door opening when the inner
door was open. `However it has since been shown to contain a coding error: a
"+" sign had been missed out, which rendered it completely ineffective.' This
did not cause the incident, but if it had been correct it would have prevented
it.

There are procedures under the nuclear site licence from the NII that
modifications should be categorised according to their safety importance and if
they are significant they should be checked and the NII informed before
proceeding. All of these mods. were categorised as minor, partly because they
were designed to improve things and partly because no single mod. could have a
serious effect as there were multiple protective systems. As a result, they
were not comprehensively checked, nor was the NII informed.

The scene was set for the incident by the need to fix the robot and also to
replace some hydraulic hoses in the cell. The Foreman's log shows that at 22:00
on Thursday 12 September 91 the outer door was in the closed position.

The conditions for entering the cell, laid down in the written cell entry
procedure, included the isolation of the gamma gate in the ceiling and a mobile
decontamination tank below the hatch door in the floor, first checking that the
tank was not below the hatch. Isolating the gamma gate also isolated the supply
to the switch indicating the gate was closed. This meant that the in-cell crane
could not be moved, as the signal saying the gamma gate was closed was not
present. This was not recognised at the time.

The cell entry procedure states that the inner door should be opened first.
However, the Foreman's log at 06:30 on Friday showed that the outer door was
open. The Foreman tried to open the inner door and failed, because:

a. The outer door was open and the software in the PLC would not allow
   the inner door to open in this condition
b. The in-cell crane was not parked just inside the inner door, which
   the PLC also required to see before opening the inner door.

The Foreman thought the inner door was actually faulty and got the maintenance
department to look at it. They spent most of Friday morning trying to find a
fault, before realising that the doors were being opened in the wrong sequence.
They then shut the outer door.  The inner door would still not open as the
in-cell crane was parked above the hatch door, and it could not be moved
without re-energising the gamma gate.

After thinking about this for a while the Shift Manager decided to place a
temporary override on the PLC to fool it into thinking the crane was in the
correct position just inside the inner door.  `This course of action was
quicker to implement. The decision was probably influenced by the fact that the
engineer responsible for robot repairs worked on dayshift only: there might not
have been time to complete the necessary repairs if the other systems had been
re-energised to move the crane and then re-isolated in accordance with the
checklist.'

He authorised a Temporary Plant Modification Proposal (TPMP) and got the door
to open. The details of this TPMP were added to the shift log, the permit to
work, and a TPMP book, but the entry in the shift log did not get carried
forward to subsequent shifts.

The robot engineer fixed the robot. The doors were left open as the hoses still
needed replacing. `During the night shift little work was done in the Control
Cell as the replacement hoses were found to have the wrong end fittings.'

Work restarted about Saturday lunchtime and was probably finished by about
18:00 on Saturday. The cell could not be re-energised yet as there was no
electrician on duty who could do this until the night shift.  The Shift
Manager's log noted that the doors were still open and the Foreman's log said
that the outer door was open and the cell still needed re-energising. The TPMP
was not mentioned at this handover to the Saturday night shift. Shortly before
midnight the electrician was authorised to re-energise the cell. The TPMP
remained in place.

The incident itself happened when an operator raised a container of waste
through the hatch door into the cell. His written instructions had nothing
about checking the state of the doors, his control panel had no indicators for
the doors, and it was almost impossible to see the doors from his control
position. He did have a TV monitor to provide another view of the cell and as
he raised the container he noticed in the background that the doors were open.
He went to another control panel about 5 metres away and managed to close the
inner door. The TPMP gets an honourable mention here as without it the PLC
would not have allowed the inner door to move.

Nobody was in the room outside the cell. Four people were in the next room and
they were warned by an alarm in the room outside the cell.  These people were
not intending to enter this room at all.  Nobody was found to have received any
radiation exposure from the incident.

During the subsequent NII investigation it was discovered that:

- The changes to the key exchange box for the doors had resulted in its design
becoming unsafe. The added override key was not held captive in the box so it
could be removed at any time, and if it was removed it restored power to the
hatch door. Also, once the outer door was open the keys could be removed from
the box by reversing the normal sequence but with the outer door still open.
These defects had not been discovered during any of the commissioning stages.
It was not discovered when the keys had been removed and returned to the Permit
Foreman's office.

- The permit to work was signed off based on the keys being returned without
any physical check of the state of the doors.

- The logic controlling the crane did not care that the crane appeared to be in
two places at once, where it really was and where the TPMP said it was. The
logic still allowed the crane to lift the container of waste into the cell in
this condition.

- The PLC modification to prevent the hatch door opening if the inner door was
open, described above, had the coding error involving the + sign.

The NII made various technical recommendations, but their first
recommendation bears repeating:

  The incident graphically illustrates the need for:

  (a) those who design and operate such plants to ensure that the protection
  systems provided are, so far as is reasonably practicable, independent of the
  control systems for the plants. The design and operation of such systems
  should be made as simple as possible.

The NII are also discussing with BNFL and the IAEA to get this incident
included as one of the case-book examples on the International Nuclear Event
Scale for Nuclear Reprocessing Plants.

I forward to you the following, which contains a good discussion, from a
professor of medicine in Minnesota, of why doctors are resisting a drive for
(seemingly innocuous) computerization of billing procedures.  John Bonine

&gt;From: Paul Kleeberg &lt;PAUL@gacvx1.gac.edu&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Last Thursday Gerald M. Phillips &lt;GMP@PSUVM.BITNET&gt; said:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I was working with AMANET when it collapsed because doctors wouldn't use it.
&gt;Out of curiosity, did you aver ask the doctors why?  I used it and found the
&gt;interface somewhat non-intuitive and was disappointed that there was never
&gt;any type of gateway established with the Internet.  The current iteration of
&gt;AMA/Net =&gt; U.S. HealthLink also is free standing though I am told they are
&gt;looking into an internet gateway.  Same non-intuitive interface.  Many of us
&gt;who would most wish to use the system (rural physicians) have to pay long
&gt;distance phone charges on top of access charges.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Now the HCFA is mandating computerized recordkeeping, but doctors are
&gt;&gt; fighting it tooth and nail.
&gt; 
&gt;The family doctors on my list (Fam-Med) are concerned about a number of
&gt;things.  Among them: confidentiality of patient records, who is going to pay
&gt;for this change and has it ever been shown to improve outcome or patient
&gt;care?
&gt; 
&gt;Regarding the confidentiality of patient records, the paper chart assured
&gt;confidentiality since it could never be found.  An electronic chart can be
&gt;accessed by several people at once from distant locations and since payors
&gt;are one of the groups who are strongly supportive of an electronic record, I
&gt;might be just a bit concerned as an individual.  Given payors propensity to
&gt;exclude preexisting conditions, a simple keyword search of an electronic
&gt;chart could unearth all sorts of interesting data about an individual with
&gt;little effort.  It would further interfere with the physician-patient
&gt;relationship causing patients to be even more cautious about the types of
&gt;information that got into their chart.
&gt; 
&gt;Who is going to pay for it?  Gov't has told us in no uncertain terms that we
&gt;physicians should.  For those of us in struggling rural practices, that
&gt;added burden will be all that it takes to cause some of us to close up shop
&gt;and join a HMO in a metropolitan area (Better pay, less call, fewer
&gt;administrative hassles and better cultural quality of life) or just retire.
&gt;For those of you in urban areas that may not sound like much but out here in
&gt;rural America, where communities and hospitals depend on having a physician,
&gt;it can mean economic survival of the community as well as life or death for
&gt;the individual.
&gt; 
&gt;Has it ever been shown to improve outcome or patient care?  We all believe
&gt;it will but I do not believe it has ever been studied.  Nothing like going
&gt;full tilt investing megabucks in systems we *believe* should work without
&gt;first evaluating the costs or measuring the benefits of implementation.
&gt;Lets look at the systems in use today.  What difference have they made?
&gt; 
&gt;You can be sure that if a computer can be shown to help a physician see more
&gt;patients in a day, reduce the cost of providing services or enable her to
&gt;provide a higher quality of care to her patients, it will be quickly adapted.

I experienced an interesting failure of an ATM network over the weekend.  Using
a Mastercard supplied by an out-of-state (OUS) bank, I accessed an ATM at my
usual personal bank, NationsBank (NC). I was attempting to get my bank card
balance. The ATM had me enter my PIN, then asked for the transaction type. I
pressed "Acct. Balance" (actually, a series of buttons), and the ATM paused
briefly, then dutifully spit out a receipt with a balance on it. The
interesting thing was that the balance, to the best of my knowledge, was about
$1200 high, just over my credit limit. I was NOT amused.  I assumed I might
have been subjected to a fraudulent use of my card, so I went home and called
the 800 number for OUS. I reached a call director, which among other things,
allowed balance requests. I asked for my balance, and was given a number right
in line with what I expected, about $2000. Further, the automated system stated
that this WAS the current balance as of that day, Saturday.

Monday morning, I called OUS Customer Service and spoke with one of their
representatives. I related the problem I had had over the weekend. She checked
the balance herself, and indicated that the automated system gave the correct
number, and the ATM gave an incorrect number. Her response was: 'it's an ATM
failure, so you need to contact that bank about it...'.

I called the local branch of NationsBank, the same branch where the ATM is
located. They had me call an 800 number for NationsBank. The person there
looked at a few things, including my current CHECKING balance, just in case the
ATM had printed THAT number by mistake (!). Nope, not even close. After leaving
me on hold for awhile, she stated that her supervisor felt that I should speak
to someone in their ATM division. I was transferred there to yet another
front-line service rep. After I explained the circumstances again, she thought
about, then said it was OUS's problem since they were the issuing bank for the
card and I should take it up with them (of course).

Ignoring the customer service runaround, there are several interesting points
here:

1) My ATM is getting (or giving me) an incorrect balance for a Mastercard,
despite being part of the Mastercard ATM net. Note that the normal failure for
a request not handled by the network, or the bank in question, is to say "Not a
valid transaction type" (or something like that). I've had this happen when
attempting a balance request for a card from yet another bank.

2) If my balance request is being mishandled, what about cash withdrawals?
What number actually gets relayed between the banks?

3) The printed receipt has the correct Mastercard number on it, along with the
text:

   CC INQUIRY
   FR CREDIT CARD
   BALANCE       $too.many

so it thought it was doing the correct transaction, with the correct account.

4) The only numbers I enter are for my PIN (4 digits).

5) Off the topic, but interesting, is the fact that my bank-supplied PIN is
identical to the third group of digits in the account number.  This may be a
strange coincidence, or an example of gross stupidity.

A. Urken posted some comments in <A HREF="/Risks/14.08.html">RISKS-14.08</A> regarding the FEC's and NASED's
joint efforts in "development of standards and certification testing" for
election equipment and software. This is a somewhat misleading statement. The
"standards" that have been issued to date are not standards, only suggested
guidelines. They need to be adopted by the individual states before they are
accepted as standards. This is a lengthy process, and some states have been lax
in doing so. Furthermore, upon investigation of these documents, it will be
revealed that the rigorous security standards work of NCSC, which takes the
form of the rainbow series, seems to have been largely ignored by the FEC and
NASED to date.

Note that election equipment does not come under the Computer Security Act,
and hence it is not required to conform to any Orange Book standards. The
question that concerned citizens have been asking for years is: WHY NOT? 

Although Independent Testing Agencies are now becoming "certified," the purpose
of ITAs is presently dubious.  SRI [a consultant to N.Y.C. and the system
evaluators] had its hands tied by two non-disclosure agreements (one 6 years,
and one 30 years) by one manufacturer of election equipment, during an
(ongoing) examination process. The policy of the FEC is to allow secrecy in the
examinations, in order to preserve trade secrets claimed by the manufacturers.
Perhaps someone can explain how an ITA can be "independent" while being
prohibited from disclosing certain information they discover in the course of
their testing process to the intended purchasers?  Yes, the manufacturers know
that they can protect their property with copyrights and patents, but some have
claimed that such filings would "provide a road map to rigging elections" and
so rely on and impose trade secrecy.

Found in rec.humor:

  Here are The Three Laws of Secure Computing (TLSC)

  1) Don't buy a computer

  2) If you do buy a computer, don't plug it in.

  And, finally,

  3) If you do plug it in, sell it and return to step 1.

Just encountered yet another hazard of modern life.  In a certain new office
phone system, unplugging the phone from the wall jack disables it.  It won't
work after its plugged in again, though after a moment it does tell you the
time.

Also, hidden in the manual is a line telling you not to reprogram certain keys.
Of course, someone tried it, not having memorized the manual, and this disabled
not only the phone but also the receptionist's master phone.

Pretty neat, huh?

Some news related to the London Ambulance Service fiasco.

This week's edition of Computer Weekly had a small article from the chief
executive of the British Computer Society. The implication was that had the
programmers and analysts from the LAS project participated in the society's
Professional Development Scheme then this fiasco would not have happened.

I doubt his conclusion very much because I've been a member of the BCS for the
last 15 years and during that time I have received nothing substantial about
the PDS. What I know about the scheme has been gleaned from Computer Weekly and
Computing rather than from the BCS themselves. If those involved in the LAS
fiasco would have benefitted from such a scheme it is unlikely that they would
have discovered that the scheme existed.

        THE INSTITUTE OF MATHEMATICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
             THE MATHEMATICS OF DEPENDABLE SYSTEMS
                    1st--3rd September 1993
  Royal Holloway, University of London, Egham, Surrey, United Kingdom

            PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS

The construction of dependable systems, by which we mean systems providing 
high levels of reliability, availability, safety and/or security, is a problem
of considerable concern to both providers and users of information processing 
systems of all types.  Historically, different aspects of system dependability
(e.g. reliability and security) have been studied quite independently, albeit
that many of the goals are similar.  For example, the notion of certifying 
functionality assurance levels applies equally to reliable systems and secure 
systems.  In addition, users will often require some combination of security 
and fail-safe operation.

The purpose of this conference is to consider the mathematical aspects of the 
provision of dependable systems, one goal being a comparison and possible 
unification of mathematical techniques for providing safe, reliable and secure
systems.  A number of different mathematical approaches have been taken to the
overall problem, including probabilistic/statistical reasoning, formal models 
of safe, secure and reliable systems and logics of authentication and access 
control/privilege delegation.  Papers on all these areas are solicited, the 
unifying theme being the application of mathematical techniques to the overall
dependability problem.  Hence papers will be particularly welcome which cross-
fertilise the application domains.  The conference will consider dependability
for both hardware and software systems.

In the Nov 23 (today) edition of "The Ottawa Citizen", there is a story
attributed to the "SouthamStar net". The story talks about the problems of one
Steven Reid - there appears to be two people by that name, with the same
birthday, living in the same city (Montreal). The story talks about the usual
identity mix-up and problems well know to the readers of this forum. The scary
part is the quote attributed to Lt. Gerard Blouin of the Montreal Police:

  "it's up to him to change his name somehow. If he can modify his name,
   just by adding a middle initial or something, it would help him."

For those unfamiliar with Canada, Ottawa is the capital and Montreal along
with Toronto are the two biggest cities in Canada, each with millions of
people. One would have expected the computer system to be able to deal with
this problem; but it would appear that in at least one public institution, the
computer rules supreme.

Peter Ilieve gives a wonderful summary of the implementation changes which
led to a near-incident in Britain.  In the US, we used to have a process
which was supposed to avoid this.  Hearings and design reviews were held
before a plant was to be built and then a second set of hearings and reviews
were held after the plant was built before licensing took place.

Unfortunately, and with very little fanfare, the Congress bowed this year to
pressure from the Bush Administration and the nuke industry and passed a law
which (among other measures) eliminates the post-construction hearings and
reviews before licensing takes place.  Thus we now have a system which is
guaranteed to produce unknown flaws from implementation changes such as the
door-interlock changes Ilieve reported on.

&gt;Note that election equipment does not come under the Computer Security Act,
&gt;and hence it is not required to conform to any Orange Book standards. The
&gt;question that concerned citizens have been asking for years is: WHY NOT?

The implication of Ms. Mercuri's rhetorical question it that the Computer
Security Act should apply to computer-based machines for recording,
tabulating, or reporting votes, that the Orange book would then apply to such
systems and that all of that would be helpful.  (Be careful what you ask for,
you might get it.)

The explicit purpose of the Computer Security Act was to limit the influence
of the Department of Defense over non-defense uses of computers.  While
assuming that NIST would not re-invent the wheel, it provided that standards
for non-defense government and the private sector would be promulgated by
NIST.  However, control over voting procedures is reserved to the states.

The Orange book was developed almost two decades ago to respond to a
Department of Defense problem.  It deals with the protection of national
security classified data in "shared resource" (i.e., multiuser) computing
systems.  It was intended to deal primarily with the operating system on the
assumption that the policies of interest could be most effectively and
efficiently enforced there.  It was not intended to deal with problems, like
those in vote recording, tabulating, and reporting, that are specific to the
purpose for which the computer was being used.

While we have learned a great deal from the Orange Book about how to enhance
the trust in computers, neither the Orange Book nor any of its progeny is
directly applicable here.  Any attempt to apply them would be, at best,
misguided and inappropriate, perhaps, counter-productive or even mischievous.

To a great extent, the Orange Book has been overwhelmed by changes in computer
economics and styles of use.  It was based upon the implicit assumption that
computers were expensive; it did not anticipate cheap computers.  It assumed
that operating systems were dear, limited in number, and practically free from
non-management interference.  It assumed that the operating system could be
made trusted, at least for limited purposes.  It did not anticipate operating
systems of millions of lines of code that sell in the tens of millions of
copies for tens of dollars and that are not under the control of management.

It assumed that the portions of the operating system that were responsible for
controlling access to operating system resources could be separately
identified, isolated, and so limited in scope and complexity that they could
be made effective and reliable and demonstrated to the satisfaction of a third
party (not user or vendor).  It assumed that all of these things could be done
cheaply enough to be covered by the reduction in risk that would result.

It assumed that control of access to the resources known to the operating
system would be sufficient, i.e., that all of the resources of interest were
identified to and known by the operating system.  It assumed that applications
could not be economically be made trusted and that uses that required that
they be so were intractable.

It assumed that preserving the confidentiality of data was the problem of
interest.  While it dealt with the integrity of the operating system, it was
essentially silent on the integrity of the data or of the results produced by
the application.  Of course, these are exactly the problems of interest in
recording, tabulating, and reporting votes.

The requirement for trust in the use of computers for recording, tabulating,
and reporting votes is very high.  Such systems must be developed with
extraordinary, not "standard," rigor and they must be developed in the light
of independent scrutiny.  While the operating system, if any, must protect the
application controls, it is the controls specific to and implemented in the
application that are of interest.  The problem is much more analogous to the
problem of ATMs than the class of systems dealt with in the Orange Book.

These systems should be enabled and adopted under law that is specific to
them, not generalized across more generic problems.  While the Computer
Security Act and the Orange Book have much to teach, they are neither
applicable to nor sufficient for this problem.

      A tale from my first experience as a poll worker last Tuesday:

          On Election Day the sash cord broke on one of the voting
      machines in the precinct where I was working as a poll
      worker.  The curtain couldn't be closed to permit a secret
      ballot.  The Judge of Elections took the machine out of
      service and sent for a technician who arrived an hour later
      and spent about 10 minutes working on the machine.  As he
      came out of the polling station another poll worker asked:
      "Well, is the machine fixed?"

          The technician replied as he hurried on to his next
      assignment:  "Now, now, we don't like to use the 'F-word' on
      Election Day.  The word is 'repaired'."

Steve quotes from the December issue of Popular Mechanics on the installation
of on-board radar to identify obstacles in the path of a vehicle and to
monitor steering, braking, speed, and closing rates.  He reports on work to
link the radar and cruise control, then the radar and the brakes.  He
comments:

   "The RISKS seem obvious enough to me..."

I grant the risk.  Again, however, I make a plea for identifying the risk of
NOT doing something like this.  At present, there simply is no way for
authorities in certain western and southwestern states to know of near
zero-visibility (due to fog, sand, dust,...) on some portion of an interstate
highway.  This deficiency leads to multiple, telescoping collisions involving
dozens of vehicles and severe injury and death.  The risk not doing something
like this is the unabated continuation of such injury and death.

This is one of those features/flaws that occur in user friendly (ha) systems.
I installed the new MS Windows 3.1 and discovered that the drivers for my
Brand-X video controller didn't work under 3.1.  No problem, temporarily I can
use the system in bigprint mode.  So I call the Brand-X distributor.  No
problem, they'll send me the new drivers as soon as they come in.  "I dunno,
maybe a few months."

Who makes the chips on the Brand-X board?  Trident.  Aha! a reputable company.
I call Trident.  No problem, they'll ship the W/3.1 drivers immediately.

(A few days pass).

The drivers install easily, but guess what, the otherwise quite adequate
documentation doesn't list Brand-X so which of the various options shall I
select?  I call Brand-X.  "Oh, _those_ drivers?  Yeah, we have them."
Documentation?  No problem, they'll ship it to me in a few months...  Customer
assistance?  "Sorry, we don't make that model any more.  Just try whatever
resolution you want."

So I use the hyper-handy install-it-yourself function under Windows.  No
problem, the driver installs fine.  Oops!  It was an unsupported driver, the
screen is 100% rectangular garbage.  How do I back off?  Easy, just delete all
of Windows and install it all over again.  Since I can't read the screen, that
good old install-it-yourself utility is unusable.

Turn sharply left twice in France, Brand-X!

Mike Coleman recommends an analogy to the Richter scale as a means to relate
risks to ordinary people

&gt; communicating statistical risks to ordinary people.  The Richter scale seems
&gt; to be successful in allowing people to think about and compare seismic events

While his proposed risks scale may be useful in this respect, it would not
reflect the success of the Richter scale.  As a seismologist who has attempted
to explain quake magnitude to laymen on countless ocassions, I can vouch for
the fact that it does not communicate well to laymen.  Few understand the
concept of logarithms, and beyond that, they have a very hard time
understanding what is being measured.

The Richter scale was developed as a device to aid in cataloging quakes, based
on analogy to star magnitudes; it was not designed with the public in mind.
It measures the "size" of a quake based on the amplitude of shaking it
can induce (with many constraints).  It does not measure energy, frequency,
duration, etc., (although these can be related to magnitude).  Yet I have
met few layman that understand why uttering "That felt like a magnitude 6!"
after feeling a quake makes no sense.  The notation is difficult, too, without
knowledge of logarithms "If a 6 is 10 times as big as a 5, then is a 5.5
5 times as big?"  I find that it is the single most misunderstood aspect
of seismology.  I suspect that the problems (logs and what value is measured)
would similarly be problems with risks reported this way.

It seems to be successful in demonstrating that newspeople are ignorant of
logarithms. Many times I have heard a newsperson say knowingly that an
increase of 1 on the Richter scale represents an increase of 10 in the
strength of the quake. This is incorrect.

The equation defining the Richter scale is log E = 11.4 + 1.5M, where E is the
energy released in ergs and M is the magnitude. Thus a delta M of 1 represents
an increase of 10^(1.5) or about 32 in the amount of energy released. People
who say otherwise do not really know what they are talking about.

In Risks 14.08, several contributors (Stuart Wray &lt;scw@cam-orl.co.uk&gt;), 
(Rob Cameron &lt;cameron@cs.sfu.ca&gt;), (coleman@rocky.CS.UCLA.EDU (Mike 
Coleman)) suggest a standardized table of comparative risks.

The problem with presenting potential of risk by analogy is with the 
implications of the analogy.

Even though, statistically, one is as likely to be killed in an airplane 
collision as to identify a blade of grass and then hit it with a golf 
ball, one _seems_ more probable than the other.  Airplane collisions are 
real tragedies many people are continuously working to avert, the silly 
golfing bet is trivial and may have never happened.  Although these 
events suggest extreme differences in emotional content, almost any two 
events of similar possibility can carry different implications based as 
much on personal experience as on general significance of the event.

Citing the very small odds for an absurd situation (hitting the blade of grass)
as being similar to those of failure for an item one is defending can make the
chance of failure seem absurd.  When the mathematics cannot be fudged, their
relevance can be changed through the context in which they are presented.  The
audience could then determine the significance (to them) of the event
regardless of the odds and decide if the risk is worth taking.

<A HREF="/Risks/14.08.html">RISKS-14.08</A> contains a number of suggestions about how to inform people about
technological and other risks.  Those interested in the professional literature
about the subject should look at various books and manuals by Peter Sandman and
his colleagues.  The state of the art in implementing such "risk communication"
schemes is (believe it or not) the "CAER" (Community Awareness and Emergency
Response, pronounced "care") program of the Chemical Manufacturers Association.
I personally have grave reservations about this entire field, but it's
certainly much better than what it replaced.

Stuart Wray &lt;scw@cam-orl.co.uk&gt; suggests that we "tell people the odds and
compare them with the odds of various every-day disasters".  This is a very
common approach, and something that Sandman (for example) tends to recommend
against (though not as strongly as he recommends against comparing the odds of
getting cancer from your local factory to getting cancer from eating a peanut
butter sandwich, which tends to infuriate people).  One of the many problems
with numbers like Wray's (for example, "Odds of dying in a car accident in 
the next year: 1 in 10000"), is that they're not very meaningful.  They don't
reflect "my risk" of dying in a car, but rather the average across some large
population (Wray doesn't say which one).  If we computed the statistics for
incrementally more closely defined groups (urban, light drinker, no previous
accidents, and so forth), we would get a lot of different numbers, some of
which would probably be more impressive than others.

My impression in talking to people who communicate risks professionally is that
auto-accident statistics (and many others, especially drowning for some reason)
are a form of urban myth.  The numbers circulate among the community of people
who, for one reason or another, tend to think of risks from industrial
activities as minimal, and they serve largely as self-reassurance, since
ordinary people have a strong tendency to reject such statistics as
self-serving nonsense.  (On this subject I strongly recommend the organizing
materials of the Citizens' Clearinghouse on Hazardous Waste, which you can read
about in William Greider's brilliant and highly relevant new book, "Who Will
Tell the People?: The Betrayal of American Democracy", New York: Simon and
Schuster, 1992.)

On the subject of how to inform the public of risks:

ABC news had a story this week about work in progress to fit automobiles with
computerized roadmaps and sensing/control systems which are intended to
automate car driving -leave even the driving to the computer. They quoted one
man involved (I didn't catch who it was or who he was with) as saying
(paraphrased):

  .a certain. (high) percentage of auto accidents are caused by driver
  error. If we can replace the driver with a computer then we can
  reduce the accident rate accordingly.

Ah yes, the computer to the rescue -again -replacing us fallible humans with
the perfectly functioning machine, and reducing the accident rate due to
operator error (who or whatever that operator may be) to zero.

Perhaps this is best filed under "Risks of assuming non-sequiters".
Regardless of which school of thought we subscribe to re: software quality
measurement/safety assurance, this kind of simplistic and misleading language
-and thinking -should never be heard coming from systems designers.

In <A HREF="/Risks/14.08.html">RISKS-14.08</A> Rob Cameron suggests the following risk-metaphors for
"communicat[ing] risk information to the public in a meaningful manner":

&gt;"The risk of your child seriously injuring himself in 3 hours of
playing with this toy is about the same as that of being an automobile
passenger for 4 minutes."&lt;

&gt;"The risk of long-term liver damage from this medication is approximately
the same as the risk of cancer from smoking 2 packs of cigarettes."&lt;

Despite this being essentially a good idea he could not have picked two worse
metaphors. The perception, on the part of the majority of the general public,
of these two activities - smoking and riding in cars - is about as slanted as
it can possibly be by an endless barrage of moral homilies from the health &amp;
fitness weirdos and the environmentalist ban-it-all brigade, who have singled
out the cigarette and the automobile, respectively, as Global Enemy No. 1.

Mr. Cameron seems to be idealistic enough to imagine that people will read the
numbers and possibly even calculate with them. They will not. They *may* see
that the risks of the toy can be compared in some way with those of cars - and
leave the toyshop at once. They *may* see that the risks of the medication can
be compared in some way with those of cigarettes - and sue the doctor (unless,
of course, they are unregenerated and unrepentant smoking drivers like me!).

For myself I do not believe that there is any point in attempting to convey
numerical, let alone statistical, information to a 'general public'
increasingly deskilled, de-educated, aggressive and litigious.

An example of the perceptions of the general public: European food
manufacturers, who are subject to labelling requirements, find it expensive to
produce a different label for each country, translating the complex chemical
names of food additives for each language group.

Solution: give each additive - they are more or less standardised - a European
code number (e.g. "E123"). This can then be looked up in a language-specific
list to provide the chemical name in the required language, if anyone is
really that interested.

Result: the general public, egged on by extremely ill-informed and
sensationalist 'consumer investigative journalists', boycott products that are
now labelled as containing what they call 'E-numbers' - exactly the same
additives as they placidly accepted previously. Indeed, the term 'E-numbers'
is now used by the general public to describe universally vile, infallibly
carcinogenic and, above all, *secret* additives with which mad-scientist
food-technologists try covertly to poison their kiddies.

Consequence: the food manufacturers, shaking their collective heads in
disbelief, are rapidly going back to printing complex chemical names in each
of the European languages, and passing on the cost of this exercise to their
few remaining customers.

The company with the $10,000 share price is Warren Buffett's
Berkshire-Hathaway.  He personally owns enough stock to control the company
and doesn't want a lot of shareholders, so he refuses to split the stock.
It's been trading in the thousands for years (shoulda bought a share or two at
$7K) so it's pretty stupid if the exchange didn't see a $10K price coming.

For quite a while, its price has been at least an order of magnitude greater
than the next most expensive listed stock and its entry in newpaper stock
price lists, which are invariably generated by computer from data sent by the
Associated Press, is often mangled.

Share prices in the thousands of dollars are quite common in unlisted stocks
and foreign companies.  The Swiss drug company Hoffman-Laroche long ago had a
share price in the $12,000 range.

[...] Then let's tell everyone the solution so they can avoid this mistake in
the future.  How many bits should the internal representation be?

Seems like all you have to do to answer is predict the future.

Some years ago the most expensive stock on the NY exchange was Superior Oil,
which sold for around $800/share.  Clearly an order of magnitude bigger than
that should be plenty, right?  And it would have, for about 20 or so years.
Now, two decades later, you can point out how terribly nearsighted that design
decision was.

OK, let's fix it once and for all: let's make it two orders of magnitude
bigger than Berkshire is now; 7 digits should work.

Uh oh, what about the growing international market?  What if the NY market
starts providing quotes on Japanese stocks in yen and Italian stocks in lira
(or quoting US stocks like Berkshire in lira)?  So maybe we do need a few more
orders of magnitude.  Ok, let's use 11 digits; surely there won't be a currency
with more than 10,000 units to the dollar.

Ooops, here comes Eastern Europe with 15,000 Polish Zloty to the dollar.

Ok, so maybe we can figure no currency will have more than 100,000 units to
the dollar... and then someone gets hit with hyperinflation....

The point should be clear: hindsight provides perfect vision for criticizing
design decisions.  That's the easy part.  The difficult part is making design
decisions now, attempting to design a system for now and the future.

This is in response to Rebecca Mercuri [<A HREF="/Risks/14.09.html">RISKS-14.09</A>] and Bill Murray
[<A HREF="/Risks/14.10.html">RISKS-14.10</A>] on the subject of the applicability of the Computer Security Act
of 1987 (P.L. 100-235) to computerized voting systems.

The purpose of the Computer Security Act was to create, according to Section 2
(a) of that act, "a means for establishing minimum acceptable security
practices" for "improving the security and privacy of sensitive information in
Federal computer systems."  Systems containing national security, i.e.,
classified, information are excluded from the purview of the act.  In Section
2 (b), the act assigned to the National Bureau of Standards (now the National
Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST) "responsibility for developing
standards and guidelines needed to assure the cost-effective security and
privacy of sensitive information in Federal computer systems..."  By assigning
primary responsibility to NIST for providing the necessary guidance, the act
limited the influence of DoD, as Mr. Murray states, although that was only one
of the purposes, not "the" explicit purpose.

The Computer Security Act of 1987 applies to "Federal computer systems," where
such a system, in the language of the act "means a computer system operated by
a Federal agency or by a contractor of a Federal agency or other organization
that processes information (using a computer system) on behalf of the Federal
Government to accomplish a Federal function."

Now, Mr. Murray is incorrect when he states that "control over voting
procedures is reserved to the states."  That is specifically untrue in the
case of Federal elections.  Federal elections are elections for President,
Vice-President, U.S. Senators, and U.S.  Representatives.  The U.S.
Constitution provides, in Article I, section 4 that the Congress may "at any
time by law alter such regulations" that the State Legislatures impose for
determining the time, places, and manner of holding [Federal] elections.  In
addition, in Article I, section 5, the Constitution states that "each House
[of Congress] shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications
of its own members."

A number of Constitutional Amendments and Federal laws have changed (expanded)
voting rights.  In the most recent Congress, a bill was passed mandating very
specific procedures for voter registration.  The bill would have become law if
not vetoed successfully by President Bush.  While such laws affect only
Federal elections, the states invariably apply them to their own state
elections, because they cannot afford two sets of procedures.  This was
specifically true for the amendment granting voting rights to 18-year-olds, as
well as for the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

As the President, Vice-President, and members of Congress are Federal
officials remunerated through appropriations of the Federal budget, the votes
cast for them on a state or local government computer system is a "system
operated by ... [an] other organization that processes information ... on
behalf of the Federal Government to accomplish a Federal function."

Clearly, votes in Federal elections are sensitive information, under the
Computer Security Act.  The reason that vote-tallying in Federal elections is
not covered is that the act mandates actions by Federal agencies to implement
the act.  However, the definition given to "Federal agency" given in the act
specifically omits the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives.
These are the agencies ultimately responsible for Federal election data, and
they have excluded themselves from coverage of the act.  Thus, the only
sensitive Federal data omitted from coverage is the most important for
continuation of our democratic government.

In response to William Hugh Murray's posting in RISKS Forum 14.10:

First of all, let me state that I agree with much of what was said.  Some of
which has even appeared in my earlier writings on this subject, most notably
the observation that DREs are similar to ATMs (which I comment on extensively
in my March 1992 paper published in the Proceedings for the Fifth
International Computer Virus &amp; Security Conference), the statement that
"control over voting procedures is reserved to the states" (which also appears
in that same paper), and I had also alluded to the insufficiency of security
standards and theory applicable to this problem in my recent (November 92
CACM) Inside Risks column. So it appears that we are in agreement here (with
sufficient citations in evidence of this fact).

Readers should note that my use of the phrase "Orange Book" was intended more
generically (as is common) than to the specific book itself. The primary
intent of my posting was to make the public aware of the fact that the FEC and
NASED have not made sufficient use of the ongoing work by NCSC in their
establishment of guidelines and controls for voting equipment. I was not
suggesting that the NCSC documents would BE SUFFICIENT for voting
applications, only that they should be consulted as it is the largest body of
standards work to date regarding computer security and MUCH (not all) of the
rainbow series material IS applicable to the voting area (as well as in
banking, where it is certainly considered), regardless of the original
intention of the Act.

Where Murray and I are not in agreement is in his assertion that the shared
resource problem is not applicable to vote recording, reporting and tallying.
He may have conceived of computerized voting as taking place on independent,
stand-alone systems, but in actuality this is often not the case. Many
computer systems used for voting purposes are networked and time-shared. The
RISKS implications of this should be obvious, now that I have pointed this
out.

A recent voting machine security document that I was asked to review contained
the following statement:

	"The proposed DEC computer operating system (VMS) is one
	 of the most secure systems available today. Security
	 features that comply with the National Computer Security
	 System (NCSC) C2 classification have been built in as an
	 integral part of the operating system."

I include these sentences not for their merit (with which I have considerable
difficulty), but to point out that the operating system problem is ALSO highly
applicable to the voting problem.

Both Peter Neumann and I are well aware of the ramifications of getting what
is asked for. We have each publically called for greater care in developing
voting systems with, as Murray said, "extraordinary, not standard, rigor and
... in the light of independent scrutiny." But I must bring to light the fact
that this is not presently the case. I also agree that the laws which affect
voting machines should be specific to their manufacture, and have personally
lobbied to improve these laws, but as some states have failed to adopt even
weak regulations, there must be some place to start, and an existing Computer
Security Act might be a good place to at least look. Note that Congress IS
responsible for overseeing FEDERAL (Presidential and Congressional) elections,
and such SHOULD be considered a matter of national security. Congress did,
though, exempt itself from the CSA and hence it does not apply to elections at
present.

Due to time constraints I am not at liberty to iterate at length on this
subject, but numerous documents and publications are available that will
confirm the fact that electronic voting systems are not being administered
with the care that should be given, that current laws are inadequate,
standards are lacking, and rigorous theories are needed in this area.  CPSR is
a good place to contact if one would like to become more fully aware of this
problem, and then I hope that more individuals will join the effort to ensure
that accurate, anonymous voting is guaranteed.

Rebecca Mercuri.

I am working on a research project and book involving the process by which
some people have been able to "invent" computer and other high tech crimes.
The issue that I am trying to understand is how people adopt new technologies
for purposes other than those envisaged by the developers.  Specifically, some
people are very skilled in what I call thinking like a thief.  They see
technology from a particular perspective, based on how it can be used for
anti-social, deviant, and/or criminal acts.  A counterpart to this are those
who come up with new applications for technology, which may also be viewed as
negative by developers but can often lead to new applications (and even new
industries).

It could be quite important to establish how other technologies have been used
for "inventing" crimes.  How do technologies get expanded and changed,
especially by "non-official" people, i.e., they do not work for the original
technology developers or owners? These "non-official people" see new
possibilities, whether for a positive or negative use.  I know that the terms
positive and negative raise many definitional and value difficulties.  Yet, I
am interested in how people view technology, how they are able to frame
questions about other uses, how this information gets spread to others, and
the positive as well as negative consequences of this process.

Drawing on my background in criminology, sociology, and information security,
I have collected examples on how other crimes have developed and been
responded to by technologists and law enforcement. Some examples that come to
mind include how the car was relatively quickly adopted by bank robbers to
improve their chances of getting away from the crime scene.  This led to
police forces having to become motorized, which had many other consequences
for command and control of police deployment and changes in how the police had
involvements with citizens.  The Xerox or photocopying machine certainly led
to better protection of documents by allowing the making of file copies but
was quickly understood by some that it could also be used to steal copies as
well as to leak documents to unauthorized sources, e.g. the Pentagon Papers.
The automatic dial system was invented to Strowger to prevent Kansas City
telephone operators from depriving him of business by giving busy signals or
wrong numbers to potential customers.  Ithiel de Sola Pool, in his book on the
telephone, discusses how the telephone was portrayed as both the promoter and
the conquerer of crime.  "Call girls" and obscene callers were at least two of
the ways that telephones were viewed as contributing to moral decay while the
first electric police-communication system of record was installed in 1867.

Answering these questions could help establish some clues as to how computer
crime is developing and areas that require particular security attention.  We
have not been very prepared for the "Post-Hacker Era" and we have not been
raising questions about the crime potential of new technologies.

Any ideas, reactions to these comments, and suggestions of any social
historical studies about these issues are welcomed.  I will post a summary of
responses.

Mr. Wexelblat points out that recent legislation (mostly) eliminates
post-construction hearings from the nuclear plant licensing process.

I believe the second stage review was often used as a platform by intervenor
groups to delay plant licensing; adding millions, even billions to plant
costs.  Utilities pass these costs along to ratepayers, who must either reduce
their consumption of electrical energy or reduce spending on other things to
pay increased electrical bills.  In the southeastern U.S., many people have
begun heating their homes with wood or (unvented!) kerosene heaters, which
expose them to potentially substantial risks.

I would like to see a comparison of safety benefits (in terms of expected
lives saved, property saved, or whatever) resulting from intervenors'
interventions with the safety detriments which have resulted from increased
electrical bills.

Unfortunately, a de-installer is likely to introduce its own risks if it is 
written by the writer of a buggy installer, e.g.,
  a. It might not deinstall everything which should be deinstalled
  b. It might deinstall something which should not be deinstalled
  c. Something else might go wrong.

Sometimes I think Macs are too smart, there are times when I would like some 
manual intervention in automatic processes such as Mak describes.

I recently installed Microsoft Windows for Workgroups on a Toshiba T5200
"portable" computer.  (I say "portable" because the machine is a few years
old, and hence measures 37x10x40cm and weighs nearly 9kg.)

The machine is connected to our Novell Netware network, and so the process
included installation of Netware and Ethernet drivers.

Windows for Workgroups detected the Ethernet card automatically, and
presented a dialogue box suggesting that it was a Novell NE2000 Anthem card. 
This was absolutely correct, so I confirmed it.  The installer then presented
another dialogue, this time with the DMA address and IRQ interrupt number. 
The DMA address was correct, and I reasoned that since the machine had worked
everything else out it probably had the IRQ number correct also.  I hit the
OK button.

A warning box appeared stating that the IRQ number on my Ethernet card would
clash with the machine's second serial port, and would have to be changed if
I wanted to use that port.  I'd never used it before, but I did want to now.
I abandoned the installation.

Twenty minutes, three technical reference manuals, twelve fixing screws and
three removable covers later, I had the Ethernet card in my hands.  I
peered at the card.  It was set to address 320, IRQ 2.  Windows had reported
this as address 320, IRQ 3.  I left it exactly as it was, put the machine
back together again, and went through the install once more.

The risk, of course, is that because the install program seemed to know
exactly what sort of Ethernet card I had and what DMA address it used, I
automatically assumed it knew what it was talking about when it told me the
IRQ number.  In my defence, I must say that Windows had been spot-on at
working out the IRQ number for the card in my Elonex machine.

The message for authors of install programs is that perhaps they should avoid
making their programs supply default values using guesswork if the software
can't actually read the value.  If the program makes a couple of lucky
guesses, the user might be tempted to believe that the program knows
something he doesn't.

The message for users is: even if an install program tells you exactly what
hardware you have attached to your machine, never trust it to pick correct
settings based on that information.

Several years ago, public safety messages would appear prior to major holidays
warning drivers in the U.S. about accidents.  The messages said (paraphrase)
"350 people will die this Thanksgiving holiday.  Don't be one of these
fatalities.  Drive carefully."  Researchers from the Safety Council found that
these risk messages were not helpful at all.  Drivers thought that an accident
would not happen to them.  The risks became someone else's problem.

The Safety Council then decided to personalize risk.  They ran ads directed at
kids suggesting that the kids ask their parents to drive safely and to use
seatbelts.  This approach to risk was much more successful and may have been
one of the many reasons why traffic fatalities have declined over the years.

One contributor to the discussion about describing risks made two alarming
comments.  I read both comments as arguing (basically) "since ingredient
labels pose certain problems, we should eliminate them and thereby eliminate
the problems".  The comments struck me as a good example of creating a major
risk to correct a minor one, perhaps because I'm more interested in this issue
as a consumer of food than as a producer of food.

Here's the first comment:

  I do not believe that there is any point in attempting to
  convey numerical, let alone statistical, information to a 'general
  public' increasingly deskilled, de-educated, aggressive and litigious.

In essence, since the 'general public' can't be trusted to interpret
facts properly, better not to tell them.  

The writer would presumably not include himself in the 'general public' that
he characterizes as so unpleasant; no doubt he could interpret the facts
properly.  But unless the information is on the carton of whatever he's
buying, he won't have access to that information either.  Realistically, the
choice is between making the information available to everyone or making it
available to no-one.  The writer will not be able to go to a special store
(reserved for those who pass a test of numerical skills) to buy goods with
labels describing their contents.

On to the second alarming comment:

  An example of the perceptions of the general public: European food
  manufacturers, who are subject to labelling requirements, find it
  expensive to produce a different label for each country, translating
  the complex chemical names of food additives for each language group.

  Solution: give each additive - they are more or less standardised - a
  European code number (e.g. "E123"). This can then be looked up in a
  language-specific list to provide the chemical name in the required
  language, if anyone is really that interested.

  [goes on to describe that consumers didn't like this]

This is a dreadful solution, and I can understand why consumers would be less
than thrilled about it.  The purpose of ingredient labels on goods is to
convey information to potential purchasers, and this code-word scheme
definitely conveys less information in the real world.

An analogous argument would eliminate ingredient labels altogether, and
require only that the manufacturers provide a telephone number to call for the
ingredients.  After all, the information is still "available", just much less
convenient to check when you actually need it.

If I've learned that I must avoid products containing monosodium glutamate
because of an allergy, I'm going to be unhappy when I need to learn a new code
name for it.  The convenience for the manufacturer is balanced by an
inconvenience for me.

And frankly, the whole business seems like a fraud to me.  It's not just
chemicals that have different names in different European languages, it's also
simple things like water, sugar, salt.  Either all of those get code numbers
(at which point the ingredient labels become utterly useless) or else the
manufacturers still have to produce multiple labels for an identical product.

Any application that does not allow for fifteen-digit international telephone
numbers is a potential risk today, and will become a real risk on January 1,
1997.

The following information from Stentor Canadian Network Management, the
consortium of major Canadian telephone companies, was distributed through the
Canadian Department of Communications' Terminal Attachment Program Advisory
Committee as TAPAC bulletin 92-13.

Advance Notice of Change in the Maximum Length of International Telephone
Numbers

Beginning midnight December 31, 1996, CCITT Recommendation E.164 will be
implemented.  This recommendation allows the expansion of international
telephone numbers from 12 to 15 digits.  Although the North American Numbering
Plan will not change, some foreign administrations may assign numbers up to 15
digits long to subscribers. Therefore, terminal equipment originating calls to
these subscribers must be able to handle the additional digits.

For more information on this change, please contact:

Note from NDA: I think the "international telephone number" in this context
includes the country code but excludes the access prefix, such as 011 in
Canada and the United States.

Readers in the United States should presumably contact the North American
Numbering Plan Administration at Bellcore rather than Stentor.

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS FOR A NEW BOOK Tentatively titled:
		"Humour the Computer:
	Humorous Writings concerning Computing"

We seek contributions of a humorous nature for a new book called `Humour the
Computer', an anthology of the comic, amusing and laughable aspects of
Computing. It is scheduled to be published by MIT Press early in 1994.

Topics of interest include:

* computing experiences: e.g. `a day in the life',
  computing jobs - industry, commerce, teaching, research, etc;
  getting funded in the 90's, getting a job in the 90's,
  home computing, how computer people relax, exam marking stories,
  getting published, office politics

* the history of computing: e.g. the mistakes, the disasters, the egos
  gone mad (with names changed to prevent law suits), folklore (not
  necessarily true)

* the future of computing 

* computing in the Real World: e.g. in the media, computer salesmen,
  misconceptions about computing, the misuse (abuse) of computing, faulty 
  software/hardware, the `training' course 

* fake journal articles: e.g. AI, expert systems, machine architectures
  software engineering, new programming languages, semantics;
  surveys of `important' fields: Virtual Reality, neural nets,
  OO, what-ever, etcl

* jokes and cartoons (these will only occupy a small portion of 
  the book)

* suggestions for a better name for the collection

Contributions will be judged on clarity, insignificance, irrelevance,
incorrectness, originality, but most of all for their ability to make the
editor laugh. Authors should make their papers understandable to a broad
audience - not too many `in-jokes' please.

Authors should submit three (3) copies (preferably double-sided) of the
prospective article to the editor; people without access to a photocopier may
submit a single copy. Electronic submissions are *not* encouraged.

Each manuscript should have a title page with the title of the essay, full
name(s) and affiliation(s) of author(s), complete postal and electronic
addresses, telephone number(s), and a 150 word summary.

Contributions must *not* exceed 4000 words (approximately 8 A4 pages typeset
10-point on 16-point spacing, or 12 pages if typewritten double-spaced).
Shorter articles will be viewed more favourably than longer ones.

Previously unpublished material is preferred. Contributors of published
material must have copyright to it. All contributors will be asked to sign a
permission letter giving MIT Press the right to print the material but NOT
transferring copyright.

Submissions must be received by April 3rd, 1993. Authors will
be notified of acceptance or rejection by July 1st, 1993. Full
versions of the accepted articles must be formatted according to MIT Press
conventions, and camera-ready copy must be received by the editor
by August 24th, 1993.

Danger from personal computers?  Most people think of electromagnetic fields
or getting zapped while monkeying around inside the box.  Nothing immediately
threatening could happen while just printing a spreadsheet.  Right?

That's what I thought until last week when my wife was severely bitten by our
kitten as it was hanging in mid-air by the tip of its tail.  It all started so
innocently.  Our 8-month-old kitten likes to lie on top of our Apple Personal
LaserWriter LS.  We have tried to get him off, but he keeps getting back up on
it.  He must like the hum.  My wife was printing a few pages in the
background.  While she was talking on the phone, there suddenly was a shriek
from the kitten.  The printer was only about 2 feet away from her, luckily
turned the opposite direction.  The kitten was sprawled stiff on top of the
printer, like he had been stuffed.  We just had him declawed, but his teeth
were grabbing at anything in sight, including my wife's arm as she tried to
turn off the printer.  The party on the other end of the phone thought that
both the kitten and my wife were being murdered.

After a few deep bites, the printer was off, but the tail was still stuck in
the top roller that ejects the paper from the printer.  Apparently, the hair
on the tip of his tail had gotten inside the roller and was sucked in as the
paper was being fed out.  While my wife was getting a towel to prevent further
injury, the kitten jumped off the side of the printer.  The top of the desk is
slightly waxed and the printer nearly slid off.  It would have landed on top
of him.  Can you imagine how hard it is to figure out how to open a printer
under these conditions?  Before she got the towel around him, the kitten took
a few more deep bites out of my wife's leg through her bluejeans!  After what
must have seemed like an eternity, my wife got the printer open and freed the
kitten.

A $27 trip to the vet informed us that we had a real lucky kitten.  If he had
been a little older and heavier, the tail would have separated and required
amputation.  If he still had claws, my wife would have had to have been
stitched back together.  What if it had been a child's long hair?

So Apple, how about a Kitty Guard?  Unfortunately, Cats don't read the generic
warnings that came with the printer.  I really like the quality and value of
the printer.  How much extra would I pay for more safety?  At least $27.  I
knew I was cutting corners when I bought the printer since it did not include
PostScript, but I really didn't expect this.

Several other companies also use the same type of printer case.  They all have
a max speed of 4 pages/minute and a cut-out in the top for the paper to
reverse stack or innocent kitties to take a nap.  Some have different paper
feed mechanisms, so the eject roller may also vary.

In case you were wondering, the kitten has been avoiding the printer the 
last few days, but was seen standing on it once while it was off.

This is an editorial comment against the tendency among Risks contributors
to take a rather simplistic view of things.

I assume that Risks readers shudder when they read a description of some new
technological advance that ends with the phrase "the benefits are obvious."
You should.  But you should shudder equally at the complimentary phrase "the
risks are obvious."  (Sometimes this seems to be said only in order to justify
submission of an article and get it past the eagle eyes of our esteemed
moderator. It is as if the person says, "I came across the following cute
story I wish to share. Why Risks?  Oh, well, umm, the risks are obvious."  Not
to me.)

Not only are the risks not always obvious to me, but I worry about the risk
of believing that complex things can be judged along simple,
uni-dimensional values. The risk of the alternatives, including that of not
doing anything, must also be weighed (here I simply repeat Brint Cooper's
plea that people who submit such claims should do a more thorough analysis)

Life is complex.  Life presents us with a series of tradeoffs: each benefit
comes along with some risks.  And many risks come along with some benefits.
We are doing society no favors if we simply emphasize the risks instead of
a more careful -- and more difficult-- analysis of the tradeoffs, both
good and bad.  You might still conclude that the item in question is dangerous
and immoral: the careful analysis will then strengthen the claim.

There was a similar over-simplistic view of things in the recent discussion of
the inability of people to perceive the correct odds for low-probability
risks.  Readers rushed in with well-intended, but simplistic solutions. In
fact, people -- most people, including you, very sophisticated risk readers,
cannot properly judge these low probability events.  This is well known in the
professional field that deals with these events -- even those professionals
have problems.  Human psychology simply cannot match probabilities in the
10^-3 to 10^-6 range with everyday experiences. Not only that, but it is well
known in cognitive science that human memory and decision making is biased
toward particular events and does not do a good job of matching real
probabilities. In fact, it is probably a counter-productive evolutionary
strategy to do so.

Describing one unlikely event as being similar or more or less risk than some
other low-probability event (that we similarly cannot understand the risks of)
helps, but does not solve the difficulty.

Everyone is an expert in folk psychology, for everyone has observed themselves
-- and others -- for their entire lifetime. Alas, folk psychology often has
little to do with real psychology.  Risks at times seems to degenerate into a
field day for amateur psychologists, where professionals in one discipline --
who understand that it took years for them to reach that level of
sophistication in their chosen field -- ignore that a similar level of
commitment and level of expertise is required to make professional judgments
in the human sciences.

Sorry for the editorial.  I like Risks, but at times I wish it had a higher
level of professional standards. [I make the above statements wearing several
hats: professional debunker of technology; professional praiser of technology;
Professor Psychology and former chair of a psych department; former member of
a team doing of nuclear power plant probability risk assessments (I was the
expert on human reliability -- the result of this exercise was to completely
distrust all such exercises, while admitting that I couldn't think of any
better method).]

&gt;    "The RISKS seem obvious enough to me..."
&gt; 
&gt; I grant the risk.  Again, however, I make a plea for identifying the risk of
&gt; NOT doing something like this...

I do not believe we should talk or think in terms of all-or-nothing
propositions on this issue.  First, a computerized driver-advisory system is a
very different kettle of fish than a computer-driven car, since the advisory
system is passive and can not through its actions kill anyone.  Second,
computer-driven cars would pose a number of risks to the public socially in
terms of law enforcement and other Big Brother problems.  I do not believe
that a computer-driven car solves many problems that a computer advisory
system could not, and it creates a whole slew of new problems that a passive
system can't.

This is a request for solutions.  A recent Risks article pointed out the
confusion in databases when people had the exact same names and birthdate.
In this case, the contributor stated:

"The scary part is the quote attributed to Lt. Gerard Blouin of the Montreal
Police:
  'it's up to him to change his name somehow. If he can modify his name,
   just by adding a middle initial or something, it would help him.' "

Well, in this case, I sympathize with the police.  Let me ask all of you folks
-- how should society deal with this? I believe myself to be one of the most
fervent publicists of the notion that technology must adapt to people, but
there are some real problems to be faced that technology cannot solve. Names
are not just for the benefit of the individual: they are also to benefit
society. Asking people to select unique names doesn't seem all that
outrageous.

Names, you realize, are a technological invention to make it easy to identify
people uniquely. At first, people only had single names. This didn't work
beyond the village level: hence longer descriptions that eventually became
standardized as last names (well, family names, which is some cultures are
written first). Middle initials were part of the attempt to fully describe the
lineage, and they also helped discriminate among otherwise similar names.

Today, with world-wide commerce, full names are not enough. So we now use
longer descriptions to identify people: sometimes full name plus birthdate; or
full name plus parents' full names plus birthdate and birthplace and
.........? The problem with all these schemes is that they are arbitrary.
Without standards, they simply lead to chaos. And without standards there are
bound to be more confusions. But standards are easy to abuse, to turn into
national identification numbers for evil purposes. Some countries use unique
identification numbers, assigned at birth (in the US, the social security
number is more and more serving this purpose, regardless of the legality of
such usage). Many rebel against some universal identification number -- and
for good reason -- but there are cases where they would really come in handy,
cases where they are really essential. What are the alternatives?

In the case before us, asking each person to get a middle name is a temporary
fix. It won't always work -- I happen to know of at least one other person
with the same name as I have -- including middle name (although not the same
birthdate).  With billions of people in the world, amazing coincidences will
happen, even ones that have a probability of "one chance in a billion."

Would a world-wide registry for names work? Supose that before I can assign a
legal name to a newborn child (or change the name I already have), I must
check it out with the registry. The risks of this are obvious (isn't that a
wonderful phrase?), but so are some of the benefits. It can even work
smoothly: In California: I can assign myself any license plate I want as long
as it is less than 7 characters, not confusable with others, and not on the
socially-prohibited list. I think of a possible name, the name gets typed into
a computer, and I am told immediately whether or not I may have it. Several
tries later, I have my choice. Suppose the database only contained names, no
other personal information. Perhaps a successful database entry would give me
a certificate or other authorization that I had permission to use that unique
name, but suppose that was it -- the database wouldn't even know who had made
the request -- just the fact that the request had been made (it would
obviously know the location of the terminal as well). Would such a scheme work
for names?

This is a serious request. how can we invent unique identifiers for people that:
 1. Make it easy to select a name
 2. Work for an entire country and potentially scale to the entire world
 3. Do not violate civil liberties 
 4. Do not make it possible for others to misuse the system

In other words, how to we get the benefits and avoid the risks?

In a recent RISKS, Stanley Chow reports on yet another case of "name
confusion": One Steven Reid of Montreal has been repeatedly confused with
another person of the same name, with the same birthday, living in the same
city.  He describes as "scary" a quote attributed to a police officer
suggesting that it was up to Mr. Reid to "change his name somehow", say by
adding a middle initial.

The problem of name confusion is neither new, nor related to computers, and I
for one find nothing scary or in any way troubling in the police officer's
suggestion.  Any society has to have a way to identify individuals.  At one
time, when the scale of society was small, a single name, plus perhaps a city
of origin, or a parent's name, or a job name, was enough identification.
Even when it wasn't, most transactions were of a personal nature, and if I
personally knew both "John of Dullville"'s, it really made no difference
to me that they had the same name.

Later, as the scale of society grew larger, the ambiguities became more of a
problem.  We began to use two names, initially just as a conventional form of
the older identifications by parent (in names like "Johnson") or by social
role (names like "Baker" and "Smith"); later simply as link to a family within
which one could probably assume that first names would not be re-used too
often, at least within a locale and generation.

Today, the scale of society is global and "first and last name" has long
become useless as a unique identification.  There are not all THAT many
additional natural identifying features we can use.  Adding the full birth
date is actually quite good; sometimes mother's maiden name is useful.  But
where can we go beyond that?  Use the address, hearkening back to the old
"John of Dullville"?  In today's mobile society, that's not a very useful
identification marker.  Should Mr. Reid perhaps identify himself as "Steven
Reid the taxi driver" (or whatever he is)?  People change jobs much more than
they once did, too.

Computer technology has helped us create and maintain a very large-scale
society, in which we long ago stopped relying on personal contact as a
reliable means of identification - we can't possibly personally know all
the people we will have to interact with.  The ambiguity of names is a result
of that social change, not of computers; it would appear in exactly the same
form in manual databases.  Just let them be large enough so that their users
have no personal knowledge of the people described, a threshold that was
probably crossed a hundred or more years ago.

There's an easy solution to the name ambiguity problem: Just assign everyone a
unique id number.  This is a trivial thing to do, with or without computers.
We could even make the id "number" be a pronounceable sequence of letters, or
of words.  Hell, we could even use first a last names, just requiring a check
of the database to make sure they are unique.

Many organizations have used this solution for years, with great success,
ranging from the military of any country you want to name to, say, any large
health care system, private or government-run.  In the US and Canada, we have
for various cogent reasons chosen not to use this solution, at least not for
a wide variety of interactions we have with government:  When identifying
ourselves to the police, we expect to be able to use our names, not our
"national ID numbers".

Any choice has costs.  The fact that one does not like the alternative of a
national ID number does not make the costs of using our traditional naming
system go away.  At one time, there was a significant monetary cost in keeping
and looking up records under alphabetic names.  The power of today's computer
systems makes that irrelevant - but the underlying ambiguity hasn't gone away,
and WON'T go away.  As long as it is there, as long as "Steven Reid, born on
xx/yy/zzzz" is unrealistically expected to uniquely identify an individual,
these problems will continue to arise.  No solution can possibly exist without
Mr. Reid's cooperation: If he stands by his insistence that "Steven Reid, born
on xx/yy/zzzz" is all the identifying information he will give, he cannot
expect to be distinguished from the other Mr. Reid who just as adamantly
insists on his right to identify himself in the same way.

Living in a society has both benefits and costs.  Since Mr. Reid, as a member
of society, has chosen the benefits of a police record system that does not
require us to provide our national ID number, or perhaps even a set of finger-
prints, on demand, he will necessarily bear the cost of somehow distinguishing
himself from his doppelganger.  No one else can possibly do it for him.

The Sunday Times (London) yesterday printed a piece about how easy it was to
get hold of people's bank and credit card statements.

They paid 200 pounds a time to private detectives for personal dossiers on
cabinet ministers, including their addresses and private telephone numbers,
and their last few months' transaction details.

This is highly security sensitive information: if you are an IRA sympathiser
and want to blow up the UK minister of defence, it is quite useful to know
what his favourite restaurant is.

With a bit of luck, the government will now take its own legislation 
seriously. I understand it is an offence for the various banks to make client
information available to unauthorised persons in this way, and indeed the
negligence of the UK banks about computer security is well known.

Essentially, by making account enquiry facilities available to tens of 
thousands of low-level staff, the banks make it virtually certain that there
will be at least one bent staff member who has access and who is prepared to
sell the information on to private detective agencies.

In France, on the other hand, at least one bank I know of has a system which
rings a silent alarm whenever a staff member makes an enquiry about an
account held at another branch. Anyone who started selling the database would
be caught quickly.

In Britain, on the other hand, they even have the cheek to charge you if you
draw funds at another branch.

Not everybody in government was unaware of this abuse: it was mentioned in
the newspaper article that the head of MI6, Sir Colin McColl, and the head of
MI5, Stella Rimington, had taken measures to ensure that their own bank
accounts could not be read (maybe they bank in France).

The abuse was also well known here at Cambridge: a speaker described it at 
our fraud seminar about a month ago, before it was even a story in the press.

What odds will you give me on any of the bank directors going to jail? I'm 
sure that if I, rather than the banks, had leaked this sort of information,
I'd have got ten years under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, and another
stretch under the Data Protection Act. Still, there's one law for the rich,
as they say, and another for us poor dogs.

May I suggest that next time you write to your bank manager, you demand that
he gives you a list of all persons (by name) who have access to your account
details? If enough people ask for this, it might make a difference,

&gt;"Call girls" and obscene callers ... 

&gt;Any ideas, reactions to these comments, and suggestions of any social
&gt;historical studies about these issues are welcomed...

These two paragraphs conjoined have suggested a likely area of crime.
Once comms bandwidths improve enough to start sending videophone around
the world, it'll be pretty easy to ship any sort of information.

Now obviously a lot of governments don't want certain sorts of
information to get around. There are the more obvious political sorts of
information which totalitarian governments don't want spread around, but
the same thing applies to more mundane sorts of info like pornography.

There's already been a few press scares about pornography and obscene
gifs on usenet. In the uk it's illegal to import pornographic videos or
magazines, where the government idea of pornography more or less amounts
to having two naked people in the same picture.

Naturally, since this is illegal in the uk, and legal in continental europe,
folks import these for the high prices you can obtain on illegal items.

At the moment though, importation amounts to actually carrying
magazines, or video masters through customs with the consequent risk of
being searched, caught, and arrested.

However, with higher bandwidth comms in the future, there's no real
reason why they couldn't just mail the digitised files over and produce
the videos (or magazines?) from the files. Since these files could also
be encoded, it'd be damned difficult, if not impossible, to detect.

A mundane, though profitable, sort of crime, and not dissimilar to your
"call girls" example above.

On the plus side, it's gonna be a lot harder for governments to control
information.

For reasons I still don't fathom, I was watching Saturday Night Live this
week.  It was a repeat from a year or so ago.

One of the skits was a commercial spoof.  A man in an obviously cheap hotel
room dials a number from a phone book, and says, 'Mrs. so and so?  At
such-and-such address?'  The other person, a woman, said yes, and the man
replied, 'You have won a free trip to the Bahamas.  We just need a credit
card number to verify who you are.'  Classic scam, right?

The woman then asks for his phone number, and the guy hesitates.  She then
says, not to worry, I already have it, and presses a button on a little
thing next to her phone, and then reads the guy's phone number back to him.

He hangs up, and then says, "Hm.  She knows my phone number.  I guess I'll
have to kill her now."

Fade to black, and a logo that says "U S FON -- Maybe we're the right
choice," with a voice-over of something like, "We don't have it, so maybe we
are the right choice."

All in all, I think it did a passable job, accidentally, of pointing out a
risk of caller-id.

Brad Dolan &lt;71431.2564@compuserve.com&gt; repeats some commonplaces from nuclear
industry advertising to the effect that the costs of nuclear power have been
vastly inflated by the costs of citizen intervention in licensing.  RISKS is
not the place for a debate on nuclear power economics, but I don't want to let
this dubious claim pass unchallenged. The book "Safety Second" by the Union of
Concerned Scientists presents a strong case for the contrary opinion. 

Mr.  Dolan concludes as follows:

&gt;I would like to see a comparison of safety benefits (in terms of expected
&gt;lives saved, property saved, or whatever) resulting from intervenors'
&gt;interventions with the safety detriments which have resulted from increased
&gt;electrical bills.

This is a rather naive plea, in my humble opinion and technological innocence
is a significant source of risk. Risk assessment is at best a very inexact
science, and there are zero grounds for believing that such a comparison would
illuminate anything more than the presuppositions of the assessor. For a
survey of the complexities involved in risk assessment for nuclear power, see
the Brookhaven/EPRI workshop on "Health and Environmental Risk Assessment"
(Pergamon Press, 1985).

Blackmail risk from GP thefts (The _Times_ (of London), 2 Dec 1992)

A sharp rise in the theft of computers from doctors' surgeries has led to
increasing numbers of patients' medical records falling into the hands of
burglars and potential blackmailers.

In the past six months, the number of general practitioners seeking advice
from the office of the data protection registrar after the theft of a surgery
computer has risen by nearly 700 per cent.  Officials fear that files could
include information about public figures that buyers of stolen computers might
use maliciously.

The office, based in Wilmslow, Cheshire, has heard of 20 thefts during the
past six months but believes there are many more as holders of personal,
electronically held information are not legally required to report a theft.
Previously there had been about six thefts a year.

The Data Protection Act's eighth principle does, however, require GPs to have
tight security to protect patient records held on computers.  Eric Howe, the
data protection registrar, yesterday warned GPs to review their security.

PCL's comments:

There are a number of interesting observations to be made on this report.
First is the classic scare-statistic fallacy.  A 700% increase sounds
dramatic, and is doubtless significant.  However, an increase from three to
twenty is much less startling.

More important, is the lack of any requirement to notify the authorities of
the theft of equipment containing personal information.  If this is really the
case, it would appear to be a serious loophole in the Data Protection Act.  As
I understand it, the implication is that you are only responsible for the
security of your data until your security measures are broken!

Finally, one must seriously ask: why was the data not encrypted?  I strongly
suspect that the thefts are for the equipment, not the data.  If all data were
DES-encrypted (for example), at the very least it would be protected from the
prying eyes of amateur thieves.  Let me re-phrase that: (possibly)
professional thieves, but amateur cryptanalysts.  I'm prepared to bet a small
sum, at moderate odds, that the database systems that are in common use do not
have easily used encryption, designed for reasonable security but for use by
non-experts in cryptology.

Perhaps a requirement for databases to be used by GPs and the like is the
automatic encryption of all records held on disk.  Only government action
could force such a requirement.

During the entire 5 years of undergraduate work at San Jose State, I was a
member of the marching band.  Each year the Band-Aides, a group of 8 or so
young ladies who danced with the band, sponsored one of their members for
homecoming queen.  Each year, that young lady won the election.  I found that
quite interesting since there were only 120 men in the band and a few
additional hanger ons in a 20,000+ person student body.

I also ran the college computer center for the last 3 years and had the
"honor"of opening up the computer center for the committee that counted the
votes for the homecoming queen election.  Each ballot consisted of one
mark-sense card from which one nominee was selected.  The cards were run
through an IBM 519 to convert the pencil mark to one punched hole on the card.
A special program was written, author unknown, to count the votes and
determine the winner.  The entire counting process started about 1800 hours
and ran until about 2200 hours.

The first year I watched this process, one of our journalism students managed
to get one of the San Francisco TV stations to run a live special about this
unusual use of computers.  So the main part of the computer room was filled
with the TV crew and their equipment.  Not wanting to be part of the show, I
retreated to a separate room to the side of the computer that had window
access to see the computer console.  Near the end of the count, while the
journalism student was describing the process live on TV, the computer
"crashed".  I was not able to determine why, but the program was used for
other similar counting tasks without problems.  However, not all was lost.
The operator stated that he had just looked at the counts and knew what they
were.  He would restart the program, restore from memory the counts, and the
counting could continue as if nothing had happened.  A big deal was made about
how a human had saved the day.

About that time I recognized the operator as a fellow band member.  Sure
enough, our candidate won with a resounding margin.

Several weeks ago, I completed a 2000+ mile offshore trip to relocate my home,
a 36 foot Pearson sloop, the Shearwater, from Houston, Texas to Washington DC.
Just prior to the trip, I purchased a Magellen Global Positioning System (GPS)
receiver as an aid to navigation.  The Shearwater is already equipped with a
Micrologic Loran, so, in a sense the GPS was a backup - and the Loran was
already a backup to Dead Reckoning - and a sextant.

Somewhere off Port Eads in the Gulf, the GPS began reporting high speeds (70+
knots) and a position far from my current location.  I contacted the Coast
Guard to request a GPS report - and they had no indication of errors.
 After some discussion to assure them that I was in no danger - and knew
where I was, I logged the incident and was about to go back to sleep. 
[others were on watch]

Five other boats contacted me to report that they, also, were seeing GPS
position and velocity errors.  I recontacted the Coast Guard to tell them
it was probably not my receiver - although I neglected to ask the others if
they were on different receivers.  They were unable to accept a report and
forward it to GPS control for conformation.

What is the risk?  For a boat using GPS for navigation (that is long-range
position confirmation), the risks are small, especially with sufficient backup
devices).  Since the outage only lasted about 3 hours and I only went about 18
miles during that time, the inconvenience was very minor.  Suppose, however, I
had been piloting - rather than navigating - that is entering a harbor or
avoiding an obstruction with only a small margin of error.  And suppose, also,
I had only one means of navigation and had not maintained an accurate dead
reconing plot - the normal case for most recreational sailors - and apparently
major oil tankers.  Well, this could have been a more serious incident.

Now, suppose I was an aircraft depending on GPS for navigation.  Even if you
don't use it as the sole means of navigation, GPS (or Loran) is so friendly,
so precise, and correct so often that is very easy to fall into the trap of
believing it when it is incorrect.

The risk, I believe, is twofold.  First, the Coast Guard was not aware of the
outage and once informed had no means of informing others or the GPS control
station.  Loran outage reports are accepted, coordinated, rebroadcast and
followed up by the Coast Guard first getting the report.

Second, unlike Loran, my GPS (and the others operated by the folks I spoke
with), reported correct operation, high accuracy, and acceptable performance -
that is good geometric separation.  Thus, if you were flying and were reported
in a place different than you believed, you might believe the report -
especially since it was, in one of the cases, close enough to be believable
under flying speeds/conditions.

I see a problem in the making and don't know who to tell.   /Stu Bell

... It does behoove us, from a safety standpoint, to correct what are known as
"insidious hazards" around the home and office.  Doug mentions the eject
roller on his laser printer.  My own suggestion is to take a plastic car
windshield scraper that has the nylon bristles for removing snow, cut the
handle with the bristles to length, and glue it to the top of the printer
ejection area.  The paper easily pushes under the bristles, but little to
nothing penetrates them when trying to enter that area.  I've done this on my
Imagewriter II when I discovered a curious ferret had lost whiskers when
inspecting the printing head as it whipped back and forth.  Cost?  $1.95 or so
at Kwik Shop.

If you have long hair, such as I, a piece of nylon cut from some ladies
hosiery and taped over the fan exhaust will do little to impede air flow and
does work well to keep hair from being chewed up.  If it is placed on the
input side, it also makes a dandy dust filter.  For those with metal desks or
work benches, did you run a ground strap off the desk before playing with that
flakey monitor?  As my Occupational Safety instructor would pound into us,
"It's the little things that'll get you!"  Luckily, most of these are very
inexpensive and quite simple to fix.  In some companies, such fix suggestions
are worth their weight in gold as they lower insurance premiums and prevent
injury downtime.

To best see just how sly and innocuous these hazards can be, I suggest reading
a book for new parents that goes into detail on how to child-proof the home.
Many of these things apply to offices as well.  Your friendly OSHA
representative, next time he stops by, will also be happy to point out hazards
that might not be covered under OSHA regs.

The November 30th issue of _AutoWeek_ details the risks of using radar to
prevent bus accidents.

Greyhound has developed a system called VORAD to warn a bus driver if there is
a car hidden off his right or if he's following too closely.  The problem is
the system sends a radar signal 10 times a second.  An _AutoWeek_ reader and
bus driver reports that more than once he's been passed by a car moving at
speeds in excess of the speed limit and watched their radar detector light go
off.  Unfortunately the speeder usually pulls in front of the nearest large
target (you can guess what) and *slams on the brakes* to fool the non-existent
Smokey.  And, of course, busses go a lot better than they stop...

I find it funny that a system designed to prevent accidents could potentially
cause accidents by encouraging other drivers to make unsafe maneuvers.

[This is from the latest issue of Airliners (Winter 1992); I'm amazed I
haven't seen anything about the incident elsewhere.  I'm posting the article
to sci.aeronautics.airliners as well and will pass along any RISKS-related
discussion that comes up there.  KS]

A310 Aerobatics

Following an autopilot-coupled go-around, the pilot attempted to counteract
the autopilot's programmed pitch-up by pushing forward on the control column.
(In most circumstances pushing on the control column disengages the autopilot
but automatic disconnect is inhibited in go-around mode.  The autopilot should
be disconnected or a mode other than go-around should be engaged through the
FCU - Flight Control Unit.)

As a result of the control inputs, the autopilot trimmed the stabilizer to -12
degrees (nose up) to maintain the go-around profile, but the elevator was
deflected 14 degrees (nose down).  After climbing about 600 feet (to around
2,100 feet) the autopilot captured its preselected missed approach altitude
and disconnected as the go-around mode was no longer engaged.  In the next 30
seconds, the grossly mistrimmed A310 pitched up to 88 degrees and airspeed
dropped to less than 30 kt.  (The stall warning activated then canceled itself
as the airspeed fell below usable computed values and the autothrottle system
dropped off.)  At 4,300 feet, the A310 stalled, pitching down to -42 degrees
while the pilot-applied control inputs showed full up elevator.  Airspeed
increased to 245 kt then the aircraft bottomed out at 1,500 feet, pulled +1.7
g, then climed rapidly.

The second pitch-up reached 70 degrees followed by a stall 50 seconds after
the first.  The nose dropped to -32 degrees and airspeed rose to 290 kt and
the aircraft bottomed out at 1,800 feet.  On the third pitch-up (to 74
degrees), the A310 climed to 7,000 ft then stalled again, about 60 seconds
after the second stall.  This time airspeed reached 300 kt in a -32 degree
nose down attitude before the aircraft leveled off at 3,600 feet.

The fourth pitch-up reached 9,000 feet but this time the crew's use of thrust
and elevator control (and very likely retrimming the stabilizer) prevented a
stall and the A310 leveled off at 130 kt.  Speed then increased accompanied by
another milder pitch-up to 11,500 feet where control was eventually regained.

All aircraft systems operated in accordance with design specifications.  The
reaction of ATC (the incident happened at Moscow) or the passengers is not
recorded.

Scope

The area of interest of this journal centres on the integration of
processing, storage and communication subsystems within a distributed or
networked system.  The emphasis will be on distributed rather than parallel
processing and on practical engineering papers rather than theoretical
approaches. We particularly welcome papers from industry and those which
are based on implementation experience. 

Distributed Processing

        Distributed processing architecture
        Distributed operating systems and environments
        Standards and open distributed processing (ODP)
        Configuration and management of distributed systems
        Computer architecture support for distributed processing
        Language support for distributed processing
        Algorithms and protocols to support distributed processing

Computer Networks

        Local, metropolitan and wide area networks
        Network architectures and protocols
        Network management
        Communications and network standards
        Open networking and open systems interconnection (OSI)
        Multiservice networks

Storage and Databases

        Data modelling
        Distributed data bases
        Distributed transaction processing
        Information retrieval and transformation
        Object stores
        Information and file servers
        Hypermedia systems

Information Systems &amp; Applications

        Advanced home, business and industrial systems
        Computer support for cooperative work
        Distributed programming support environments
        User Interface design

These four main areas would be linked by consideration of system
dependability, fault tolerance, security, performance engineering,
timeliness or other architectural issues.

Akron BBS trial update: Dangerous precedents in sysop prosecution

You may already know about the BBS 'sting' six months ago in Munroe Falls, OH
for "disseminating matter harmful to juveniles." Those charges were dropped
for lack of evidence. Now a trial date of 1/4/93 has been set after new felony
charges were filed, although the pretrial hearing revealed no proof that *any*
illegal content ever went out over the BBS, nor was *any* found on it.

For those unfamiliar with the case, here's a brief summary to date.  In May
1992 someone told Munroe Falls police they *thought* minors could have been
getting access to adult materials over the AKRON ANOMALY BBS. Police began a
2-month investigation. They found a small number of adult files in the
non-adult area.

The sysop says he made a clerical error, causing those files to be overlooked.
Normally adult files were moved to a limited-access area with proof of age
required (i.e. photostat of a drivers license).

Police had no proof that any minor had actually accessed those files so police
logged onto the BBS using a fictitious account, started a download, and
borrowed a 15-year old boy just long enough to press the return key. The boy
had no knowledge of what was going on.

Police then obtained a search warrant and seized Lehrer's BBS system. Eleven
days later police arrested and charged sysop Mark Lehrer with "disseminating
matter harmful to juveniles," a misdemeanor usually used on bookstore owners
who sell the wrong book to a minor. However, since the case involved a
computer, police added a *felony* charge of "possession of criminal tools"
(i.e. "one computer system").

Note that "criminal tool" statutes were originally intended for specialized
tools such as burglar's tools or hacking paraphernalia used by criminal
'specialists'. The word "tool" implies deliberate use to commit a crime,
whereas the evidence shows (at most) an oversight. This raises the
Constitutional issue of equal protection under the law (14th Amendment). Why
should a computer hobbyist be charged with a felony when anyone else would be
charged with a misdemeanor?

At the pretrial hearing, the judge warned the prosecutor that they'd need "a
lot more evidence than this" to convict. However the judge allowed the case to
be referred to a Summit County grand jury, though there was no proof the sysop
had actually "disseminated", or even intended to disseminate any adult
material "recklessly, with knowledge of its character or content", as the
statute requires. Indeed, the sysop had a long history of *removing* such
content from the non-adult area whenever he became aware of it. This came out
at the hearing.

The prosecution then went on a fishing expedition. According to the
Cleveland Plain Dealer (7/21/92)

    "[Police chief] Stahl said computer experts with the Ohio
Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation are reviewing
the hundreds of computer files seized from Lehrer's home. Stahl 
said it's possible that some of the games and movies are being
accessed in violation of copyright laws."

Obviously the police believe they have carte blanche to search
unrelated personal files, simply by lumping all the floppies and
files in with the computer as a "criminal tool." That raises
Constitutional issues of whether the search and seizure was legal.
That's a precedent which, if not challenged, has far-reaching
implications for *every* computer owner.

Also, BBS access was *not* sold for money, as the Cleveland Plain
Dealer reports. The BBS wasn't a business, but rather a free
community service, running on Lehrer's own computer, although extra
time on the system could be had for a donation to help offset some
of the operating costs. 98% of data on the BBS consists of
shareware programs, utilities, E-mail, etc.

The police chief also stated:

    "I'm not saying it's obscene because I'm not getting into that
battle, but it's certainly not appropriate for kids, especially
without parental permission," Stahl said.

Note the police chief's admission that obscenity wasn't an issue at the time
the warrant was issued.


Here the case *radically* changes direction. The charges above were dropped.
However, while searching the 600 floppy disks seized along with the BBS,
police found five picture files they think *could* be depictions of borderline
underage women; although poor picture quality makes it difficult to tell.

The sysop had *removed* these unsolicited files from the BBS hard drive after
a user uploaded them. However the sysop didn't think to destroy the floppy
disk backup, which was tossed into a cardboard box with hundreds of others.
This backup was made before he erased the files off the hard drive.

The prosecution, lacking any other charges that would stick, is using these
several floppy disks to charge the sysop with two new second-degree felonies,
"Pandering Obscenity Involving A Minor", and "Pandering Sexually Oriented
Matter Involving A Minor" (i.e.  kiddie porn, prison sentence of up to 25
years).

The prosecution produced no evidence the files were ever "pandered". There's
no solid expert testimony that the pictures depict minors. All they've got is
the opinion of a local pediatrician.  All five pictures have such poor
resolution that there's no way to tell for sure to what extent makeup or
retouching was used. A digitized image doesn't have the fine shadings or dot
density of a photograph, which means there's very little detail on which to
base an expert opinion. The digitization process also modifies and distorts
the image during compression.

The prosecutor has offered to plea-bargain these charges down to "possession"
of child porn, a 4'th degree felony sex crime punishable by one year in
prison. The sysop refuses to plead guilty to a sex crime. Mark Lehrer had
discarded the images for which the City of Munroe Falls adamantly demands a
felony conviction. This means the first "pandering" case involving a BBS is
going to trial in *one* month, Jan 4th.

The child porn statutes named in the charges contain a special exemption for
libraries, as does the original "dissemination to juveniles" statute (ORC #
2907.321 &amp; 2). The exemption presumably includes public and privately owned
libraries available to the public, and their disk collections. This protects
library owners when an adult item is misplaced or lent to a minor. (i.e. 8
year olds can rent R-rated movies from a public library).

Yet although this sysop was running a file library larger than a small public
library, he did not receive equal protection under the law, as guaranteed by
the 14'th Amendment. Neither will any other BBS, if this becomes precedent.
The 'library defense' was allowed for large systems in Cubby versus
CompuServe, based on a previous obscenity case (Smith vs. California), in
which the Supreme Court ruled it generally unconstitutional to hold bookstore
owners liable for content, because that would place an undue burden on
bookstores to review every book they carry, thereby 'chilling' the
distribution of books and infringing the First Amendment.

If the sysop beats the bogus "pandering" charge, there's still "possession",
even though he was *totally unaware* of what was on an old backup floppy,
unsolicited in the first place, found unused in a cardboard box. "Possession"
does not require knowledge that the person depicted is underage. The law
presumes anyone in possession of such files must be a pedophile. The framers
of the law never anticipated sysops,or that a sysop would routinely be
receiving over 10,000 files from over 1,000 users.

The case could set a far ranging statewide and nationwide precedent whether or
not the sysop is innocent or guilty, since he and his family might lack the
funds to fight this--after battling to get this far.

These kinds of issues are normally resolved in the higher courts-- and *need*
to be resolved, lest this becomes commonplace anytime the police or a
prosecutor want to intimidate a BBS, snoop through users' electronic mail, or
"just appropriate someone's computer for their own use."

You, the reader, probably know a sysop like Mark Lehrer. You and your family
have probably enjoyed the benefits of BBS-ing. You may even have put one over
on a busy sysop now and then.

In this case; the sysop is a sober and responsible college student, studying
computer science and working to put himself through school. He kept his board
a lot cleaner than could be reasonably expected, so much so that the
prosecution can find very little to fault him for.

    [The original message from David contained a plea for contributions
    for an independent legal defense fund, with any overflow to EFF.  RISKS
    does not include such solicitations here, so I have excised those 
    paragraphs.  However, if you are interested in further info, you may
    of course contact David, or else Mark directly.   See below.  PGN]

Help get the word out. If you're not sure about all this, ask your local
sysops what this precedent could mean, who the EFF is--and ask them to keep
you informed of further developments in this case.  Please copy this file and
send it to whoever may be interested.  This case *needs* to be watchdogged.

Please send any questions, ideas or comments directly to the sysop:

Here are two books that subscribers to RISKS may consider reading over the
holiday vacation.  Neither one is directly concerned with computers, but both
are deeply concerned with the social management of risk, technological and
otherwise.  I think it would be well worthwhile exploring their consequences
for our emerging understanding of computer risks.

Brian Wynne, Risk Management and Hazardous Waste: Implementation and the
Dialectics of Credibility, Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1987.  This book is the
report of a project at the IIASA in Vienna on the politics of regulation of
hazardous wastes.  This is a fascinating enough topic on its own, but what's
particularly relevant about this particular study is its attention to the
administrative dimensions of regulation and risk.  Wynne et al spell out in 
a sophisticated and sustained way an argument already made by Charles Perrow
and others, that "risks" are located not exactly in technologies but in the
institutions (and by extension the larger cultures and social arrangements)
that contain them.  This view has many consequences (at least, several more
than I had thought about myself), which Wynne explains with some force.

Lorraine Daston, Classical Probability in the Enlightenment, Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1988.  This is a detailed and scholarly history 
of early modern mathematical ideas of probability.  Though not really a social
history, it focuses on the developing practices of life insurance, lotteries,
and gambling, tracing the shifting ideas about the morality and rationality 
of these things.  It was not until the early 19th century, for example, 
that insurance ceased to be understood as a variety of gambling.  And Daston
explores at length various explanations for the great slowness with which
insurance companies came to use probabilistic models rather than individual
interviews and judgements.

Her central argument, though, concerns the rise of the idea of large-scale
statistical regularities.  She says: "Whereas De Moivre took the order
revealed in stable statistical frequencies as incontrovertible evidence that
an intelligent agent was at work in the world, Poisson argued that such order
was only to be expected; we should suspect divine tinkering only when it was
absent.  For the mathematicians, the clock no longer implied a clockmaker.
The ascent of statistical regularities ultimately marked the decline of the
reasonable man, as probability theory shifted its sights from the psychology
of the rational individual to the sociology of the irrational masses (page
187)."  "Consequently, the targets of persuasion also differed: Quetelet
wanted governments to change their ways on the basis of his figures, not
individuals.  But both sorts of probabilistic rationality presupposed the
stable, orderly phenomena that made calculation possible, even if they singled
out different *kinds* of phenomena as quantifiable.  Classical probabilists
believed that judicial decisions, but not traffic accidents, were regular;
their successors believed just the reverse (page 385)."

Phil Earnhardt has pointed out that the two books I recommended in RISKS
DIGEST 14.08:

"How to take a chance" by Darrel Huff, and 

"Making Decisions", D.V. Lindley, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2nd Ed., 1985 

are not listed in _Books in Print_ in the US. 

Thanks for the information, Phil.  Both books are fairly old, so may well be
out of print.

The ISBN of Lindley's book is: 0 471 90803 7, in case that helps you to find
it. I bought it through our local university bookshop about 2 years ago, so
I'm surprised that it's out of print, but it's possible.

I don't have a copy of Huff's book to hand, so I can't quote you the ISBN.

                   of the European Communities (CEC)
                   Organized by Formal Methods Europe 
 
1.  Symposium Programme 

The first FME Symposium will be held at Odense Technical College in Denmark,
during the week of 19. to 23. April, 1993. It is being organised by Formal
Methods Europe, as the successor to the last four VDM symposia, to promote the
interests of users, researchers and developers of precise mathematical methods
in program development. This symposium will focus on The Application of
Industrial-Strength Formal Methods.

The symposium is divided into two parts for which registration, symposium fees
and proceedings are separate. The first two symposium days consists of two
parallel tracks with tutorials on formal methods.  The last three symposium
days offer presentations of refereed papers, in parallel with presentations of
project experience reports, short presentations of tools and presentations of
European projects dealing with formal methods.

The FME'93 symposium programme features 8 half-day tutorials, 32 papers, 3
invited talks, 6 project reports, 20 tool presentations and exhibitions.

The papers to be presented cover a broad range of interests: among the formal
methods represented are VDM, Z, LOTOS, RAISE, and B.  They also come from
different backgrounds, both industry and academia, and from 15 different
countries.

FME'93 will be an intense and important event, and you are advised to submit
your registration as soon as possible.

     I recently learned a hard lesson about the risks of superficially similar
user interfaces. Most of the time I use GNU Emacs for editing, but my home PC
is too low-powered top run the DOS version with acceptable alacrity, so I
usually use Multi-Edit for files on my PC.

     Now, when you exit GNU Emacs with C-x C-c, it prompts you to save the
file you've been working on, like so:

          Save file /path/filename? (y or n) 

     And when you exit Multi-Edit with Alt-X, it prompts you to save the file
you've been working on, something like:

          FILE NOT SAVED! Exit?
          Yes     No    Save file and exit

     There's a superficial similarity in that both programs ask for
confirmation before exiting with unsaved files, but the Emacs confirmation
confirms saving, while the Multi-Edit confirmation confirms exiting. So to
exit and save changes under Emacs, it's C-x C-c y; to exit and save changes
under Multi-Edit, it's Alt-X s. It should come as no surprise that my fingers
got ahead of my brain and I ended up exiting my Multi-Edit session with Alt-X
y, and lost about an hour's worth of work.

     Ah! But all was not lost. For I knew, that somewhere in my PC's RAM,
large portions of my file might still be waiting. I immediately ran a small
utility program called Corelook, and searched the memory for character strings
that might be from my file. I wrote them down on a handy pad of paper, and
between what I recovered from my PC's memory and what I dug out of my memory,
I re-assembled the file.

     But what if this hadn't been _my_ file to start with? Open PC labs are
becoming more and more common on university campuses. Assume I was an
unscrupulous computer science student. Pretend I saw a classmate working on a
project in one of these open labs. When he was finished, I might just grab the
PC he was using and search its RAM for anything that might be of interest. If
the PC is running Windows, or any other program that uses virtual memory,
looking at disk used for swap space could also prove very interesting.

     Or, for those who are in the habit of leaving their PCs on at work 24
hours a day, after-hours snooping in your machine's RAM by a corporate spy
disguised as a mild-mannered custodian could give your competition a few clues
about what you're up to.

     RISKS has seen some recent discussion of the use of supposedly deleted
files on a disk; it's worth remembering that what's left in your RAM might be
interesting to others as well.

Two correspondents, Don Norman and Jerry Leichter, have indicated their
sympathy with the police in the situation of a Canadian citizen who was
confused by the police with another person of the same name.  Specifically,
they indicated sympathy for the statement of the police representative who
said the onus was upon the victim to change his name so as to avoid confusion.

While it would be prudent for the victim to modify his name for governmental
as well as for commercial and other non-governmental purposes, he has done
nothing wrong.  In the U.S. specifically, and possibly in other democratic
countries such as Canada, the individual is innocent until proven guilty, and
government is the servant of the people, not the reverse.  While there may be
extenuating circumstances that could absolve the police, we have statutes
providing compensation for false arrest and for violations of civil rights.
Certainly, the two individuals with the same name lived at different
locations, had different appearances, had different families and friends,
engaged in different occupations or worked at different locations, and had
different (Canadian equivalents of our) social security numbers.  In this
country, it is up to government agencies to get it right; it is not required
of an innocent victim to do anything except obey current law.

An activity for which personal identification is essential is voter
registration. If the bill on this subject passed by Congress in its previous
session had become law (it was successfully vetoed by President Bush), the
driver's license would have become the fundamental voter identification and
registration document.  Persons would have been required to register to vote
when they obtained or renewed their driver's license unless they *declined in
writing,* a fundamental shift in attitude about the concept of citizen
participation in voting.  As this bill is very likely to be introduced in the
new Congress, I may revisit this subject in the near future.  

    [Don Norman will also.  He has prepared a lengthy response to many of
    the contributions that have come in recently, but which have not appeared
    in RISKS.  It will follow in a special double issue of RISKS.  PGN]

There was an interesting case in the UK in the mid-80s. The Data Protection
Act (DPA) had recently come into force, providing persons whose details were
stored in databases (known as Data Subjects) with certain rights.

A woman applied for a job with a local Council. She thought she was ideally
suited and was surprised to be turned down. Her friend who already worked for
the Council investigated for her and found that for the job concerned, the
Council made a routine check with the Police National Computer (PNC). We don't
want criminals in certain positions of trust. The PNC had claimed that she had
been convicted for shoplifting.

The woman had no criminal record, so she sent her nominal fee to the PNC 
people and asked for her record. It was the record of another person with
the same name, who had been convicted in the 1960s. As she had been denied
employment on the basis of the false statement made about her, she decided
to take the PNC people to court and obtain compensation, as allowed for in
the DPA. 

Then the Police lawyers came out with a wondrous bit of sophistry. Data
Subjects are indeed entitled to compensation for losses caused by
mis-representation of their records, but in this case, the woman was not a
Data Subject. The other woman, with a criminal record, was a Data Subject, but
our heroine had no criminal record. As she was not a Data Subject she could
not have been mis-represented, and was entitled to no compensation.

The Police won the case.

The following report has been paraphrased from the EDPACS Newsletter for
January 1993:

InformationWeek reported that someone described as a disgruntled former
employee of the Toronto Stock Exchange telephoned a local TV station newsroom
and claimed that he had placed a computer virus in the exchange computer
system due to activate at 9-30 the following morning.  An all night search of
the system did not reveal any infection, and trading proceeded on the
following trading day without interruption.

This risk is similar to the risk of bomb scares on flights.  Seems that all
systems vulnerable to threats that cannot be detected without considerable
work are vulnerable to the risk of false alarms.

I couldn't have invented a better reason to encrypt EVERYTHING on one's
computer system than this. It's sad that it would ever be necessary, but until
civilization matures a little more I don't see much of an alternative.

The law is at present an awfully unreliable safeguard of one's right to
personal privacy.  Even when one wins (is acquitted) one almost always loses -
in lost time, personal anguish, diminished reputation and, of course, legal
fees.

I agree with John Gilmore -- I have far more confidence in the ability of
physics and mathematics to protect my privacy than in laws passed by a
government that can violate or ignore them at will.

In a previous posting, we read how a BBS sysop was being "unjustly" accused of
various crimes.

Just to balance things out, I would like to refer to the following articles:

This first article appeared in the Providence Journal Bulletin in April 1991.
(Sorry, I don't have the exact date.)

"Computer Guru faces Sex Counts
 Networks Abuzz Over Charges Against Bulletin Board Czar
 By Christopher Rowland
 Journal Bulletin Staff Reporter

 Warwick - Michael P. Labbe reigned as a kind of supreme talk-show host for
 Rhode Island's home-computer buffs, allowing thousands of hobbyists to
 communicate electronically through an array of equipment in his basement.

 But Labbe's network crashed last week, when police arrested him and an
 associate and charged them with sexually assaulting two teenage brothers
 whom he befriended using his computer.

 The arrest has left the state's largest computer "bulletin board" in tatters,
 crippling a popular source for computer enthusiasts of technical information,
 business news, computer-game updates and gossip.

 It also has stunned Labbe's subscribers, who have engaged in a steady 
 electronic discussion of the allegations on various alternative bulletin
 boards.

 Labbe, 25, and Jeffrey L. Whitman, 23, were released on bail after a bail
 hearing yesterday in Superior Court. They had been held at the
 Adult Correctional Institute since their April 15 arrest.

 Labbe's system, established in 1984, was shut doen after his arrest. It was
 revived yesterday after his release, but without its crucial link to a
 national and international information network.

 Labbe and Whitman are charged with first- and third-degree child
 molestation.  Authorities allege that Labbe molested the youths during 1989,
 1990, and 1991. Whitman is charged with molesting them in 1990.

 Authorities said Labbe first contacted the two boys, ages 16 and 14, through
 his computer bulletin board, the "Eagle's Nest" - so dubbed because Labbe was
 active in Boy Scouts as a North Providence High School student and achieved
 the rank of Eagle Scout.

 Warwick police said the victims were frequent visitors to Labbe's house,
 which visitors described as being an electronic showcase."

 [...The article then goes on with testimonials about "what a good boy" he was
  and how "shocked" the interviewees are at the charges...]

Well, time passed.  Until a few months ago, nobody knew what happened. That
is, until this story was published:

"Warwick Man Sentenced On Felony Morals Charge
 (no byline)

 Warwick - A founding member of one of the state's largest computer bulletin
 board networks received a seven-year suspended sentence after pleading no-
 contest this week to a felony morals charge involving two teenagers whom
 he befriended using his computer.

 Michael P. Labbe, 26, of Warwick was sentenced Thursday after reaching a
 plea agreement with the attorney general's office. The victims, who were
 15 and 16 at the time of the offense, were present in the courtroom and
 had agreed with the sentence.

 Labbe and Jeffrey L. Whitman of Cranston were each arraigned in District
 Court in April 1991 on charges of first-degree child molestation and third-
 degree sexual assault. First-degree child molestation, which carries up to
 life in prison, involves children 14 years or younger.

 When the case was sent to the Superior Court, the attorney general's office
 amended the charges to a felony morals offense, which carries a maximum
 10-year sentence. Whitman pleaded no-contest to the same charges last fall
 and also received a seven-year suspended sentence.

 Labbe founded his computer bulletin board "Eagle's Nest" and contacted the
 victims through the network. The network, which Labbe operated with Whitman,
 was the oldest and largest bulletin board in Rhode Island and was geared
 to general hobbyists and teenagers.

 As part of the plea agreement, both men were ordered to undergo counseling
 and to have to contact with either of the boys."

This case was depicted by many people on the local BBS scene as an attempt
to "taint" Labbe's image, as part of an attempt by other BBS sysops who 
were "jealous" of him to 'take over BBSing in Rhode Island'. However, in
the long run we see that in fact this wasn't the case, that Labbe did 
indeed engage in questionable activity with these underage boys, and
eventually pleaded guilty to reduced charges to avoid a prison term.

The Risks in the case are numerous. First, as a parent, you should know
what your children are doing, especially on computer bulletin board systems.

Second, Mike Labbe and the Eagle's Nest BBS is still a participating member
of the RIME network. As Eagle's Nest BBS caters primarily to the under-age
teen user, and the controlling members of the RIME network are aware that
Labbe pleaded guilty to the charges, clearly they continue to support him
and his 'actions'.


In a nutshell, it is important to read beyond the hype and disinformation
which is presented by both sides of the issue and get down to the truth of
the matter.

Some time ago I was made aware of a company that was developing a
software-based session encryption package that would allow remote dial-up
users to authenticate both ends of the connection and prevent eavesdropping by
a simple wiretap. At the time my opinion was that it was something that a
great many companies and agencies needed.

With the current proliferation of "wireless LANs" the danger becomes even
acute since a physical connection is unnecessary for capture of traffic.

One of the real advantages of the system was that it was purely software based
making it much more portable and potentially far less expensive than hardware
devices.

Recently, I found that the development of the product had ceased from a lack
of funds. It seemed that the FBI wiretap proposals had given their sponsor
cold feet.

It is particularly bothersome since the proliferation of error correcting
modems has removed the only real barrier to full session encryption (line
noise causing loss of synch).

With all of the RISKS of bringing to market a fully featured software product
(actually developing the driver is not that difficult, it is the user
interface, compatibility testing, and quality control that really adds up in
time and effort), we must now add intimidation of the backers to the list.

ps for anyone who might be interested, the company is CRYPTECH in Jamestown,
   New York (716)484-0244. I have no other knowledge of the company besides
   having seen the demo.

I share your concern about the risk, but it is far too easy to get complacent
about the protection afforded by encryption since the medical community isn't
apt to be as sophisticated as members of the computing community when it comes
to password security (selection of good passwords, not writing them down,...).
The human element is normally the weak link in cases like these; it might be
easier to subvert an office worker for a key than for a medical record itself.

To be effective, a records encryption scheme would need to be both powerful
(ideally using different keys for different records), easy to use (so it
doesn't make the job of the legitimate users significantly more difficult),
and robust (resistant to subversion by either malice or ignorance).  I have
often used a diskette file (that can be separately physically secured) to load
a password (or set of keys) into memory on system startup; other schemes will
undoubtedly come to mind.

If the thefts are for the equipment, not the data, today, it may not be too
long before the thieves find it profitable to pass the equipment on to the
professional blackmailers rather than the usual fencers of hot equipment.

Seeing a couple of postings from Don Norman in a recent RISKS reminds me that
I haven't seen mention of his book(s) here.  I got a copy of "Turn Signals are
the Facial Expressions of Automobiles", a collection of essays on the
interaction of technology and society, a few months ago, and found it so
engaging that I lost sleep reading it in one night.  I haven't read his
earlier book "The Design of Everyday Things".

Norman's essays touch on topics like misleading user interfaces (on things
as simple as doors), the trend towards experiencing life through recordings,
low-tech fixes for confusing airplane cockpits, the estimation of low-
probability risks, and the ramifications of international computer
networks.  Of course, this is not an exhaustive list.

This Wednesday through Friday mornings (2-Dec through 4-Dec), NPR's Morning
Edition ran an extended story on environmental problems and the present and
future of the EPA and environmental laws.  Unfortunately, I only caught the
tail ends of two of the segments.

Of particular interest to this group - and I wish I'd heard the whole thing! -
was Thursday's segment.  At least the part I did hear discussed the problem of
tradeoffs:  With limited resources, how do we decide which risks are the ones
most important to deal with?  Much of the discussion centered on a question
that has been recently discussed in RISKS:  Is "the common man" competent to
answer such questions in a rational way?  The answer of the people they spoke
to was basically, "yes".  As has been discussed here, people do not look only
at probabilities in deciding the importance of various risks; but they do
follow an understandable, not at all arbitrary, procedure.

One interesting study they cited:  If asked to rank the "danger of death" from
a variety of causes, such as (say) smoking or driving, people come up with an
ordering that does not match the probabilities of death from those causes.
However, if the same people are asked to rank the "CHANCES of death", they
produce the "correct" ranking.  The "incorrect" ranking is not based on
ignorance!

I seem to recall seeing messages from someone on NPR in RISKS.  Anyone out
there who could get a transcript of this segment for RISKS readers?

San Francisco.  A man sent his ex-wife (who had apparently asked him to
retrieve some inaccessible files) a computer diskette that destroyed her
entire hard disk, including software and manuscripts, and then displayed a
vengeful limerick.  James Welsh, a 32-year-old accountant has pleaded not
guilty to three counts of "introducing a virus" into the computer.  He could
face three years in prison if convicted.  Welsh's ex-wife, writer Kathleen
Shelton, said she had a problem with a computer they formerly owned together.
Welsh apparently sent her a computer disk with instructions for correcting the
trouble.  Police said, "She followed Welsh's instructions, which resulted in
the destruction of approximately $8,000 worth of software and manuscripts,
leaving only a limerick explaining Welsh's actions against her."

                "A lying bitch named Kathleen,
                 Made in the courts quite a scene.
                 To have her ex, the hacker,
                 Enjoined not to smack her,
                 So I wiped her whole hard disk clean."

Detectives searched Welsh's home, seized $4,000 worth of computer hardware and
allegedly found evidence of the "virus".  Welsh's lawyer, Annette Lombardi,
said: "There's not as much damage as charged.  It's basically the cost of
getting a guy to fix the computer and install new software."  [Presumably a
DIFFERENT GUY this time..., maybe someone who can write poetry that scans.]

Ralph Moonen (rmoonen@ihlpl.att.com) writes in <A HREF="/Risks/14.03.html">RISKS-14.03</A> that he's concerned
about making concessions during design.  He includes human factors as a
concession, when it is, in fact, a prime design requirement in most systems.
After all, humans operate most of the systems we design!

I'm a human factors engineer, and have seen incredibly bad designs built to
meet schedule or performance requirements, with no regard to the human
operators.  People are part of the system, not merely users.  And just because
a designer can operate a system doesn't mean a typical user can operate a
system.  This has been proven time and time again.  And the lesson has not
been learned yet.  Just reading through RISKS provides many examples of poor
user design: bad interfaces, mental models foreign to current users, and
systems not meeting users' needs.

Systems, including computer systems, must be designed with the human as the
main enabling part of the system.  The system should take advantage of humans
strength and not overload human weaknesses.

Mr. Moonen's comment that they will see better products by following his
points, but that he hasn't "touched the subject of user interaction"
illustrates the problem: designers are designing for themselves rather than
for the users.

&gt;Lorraine Daston, Classical Probability in the Enlightenment, Princeton:
&gt;Princeton University Press, 1988.  This is a detailed and scholarly history 
&gt;of early modern mathematical ideas of probability. 

I second the recommendation for reading Daston's histories.  For those with
limited time, I recommend as a shorter course this wchapter:

  Daston, L. J. The domestication of risk: Mathematical probability
  and insurance 1650-1830.  In L. Kruger, L. J. Daston, &amp; M.
  Heidelberger (Eds.), The probabilistic revolution: Volume 1.
  Ideas in history (pp. 237-260). Cambridge , MA: MIT Press, 1987.

It is interesting to look back and see the probabilists scratching their heads
trying to understand the boneheadedness of both users and designers of
insurance systems (e.g., the Bank of England almost went broke by selling
lifetime annuities at a fixed price _not_ conditional on age).  I think
readers of RISKS often scratch their heads in the same way trying to
understand the boneheadedness of both users and designers of computer systems.
The good news is that the insurance companies finally got it right with
respect to probability.  The bad news is that it took a long time and required
some fundamental shifts in thinking about probability and uncertainty.  RISKS
readers may therefore find some lessons in Daston's work on what must occur
before designers and users of computing systems (ironically, of course, the
insurance companies are now big users) more appropriately deal with the risks
of computing.  Alas, the Bank of England was near bankruptcy before they wised
up so the message may not be comforting.

</i><PRE>

In <A HREF="/Risks/14.12.html">RISKS-14.12</A> (30 November 1992), Jerry Leichter and I independently
discussed the problems of name confusion -- where two different people might
have identical names and (in at least one case) identical birthdates.  Our
contributions produced a large number of responses -- it took 76 single-spaced
pages to print them all out!  Peter Neumann, moderator of RISKS, asked me to
provide a summary. This is it.

Before I review the individual comments, let me summarize my own views, which
have become much enriched by this interaction. Because the topic is so
complex, they can only be dealt with fairly by a rather lengthy, complex
review. I apologize for the length of this contribution to RISKS, but not only
would a shorter treatment be unfair, but this may be too short to do justice
to all the issues.

First: an executive summary, in bullet format:

* No single, simple solution is possible. The issues are too complex. They
involve legal, moral, religious, and cultural factors that vary radically
across the United States, North America, and the world. The choice of names
creates intensely emotional responses: names define a person's self image and
culture.

* Names serve two functions: 1. Cultural and self-image; 2: Societal
identification. If we separate these functions, then the discussion is much
simplified

* Societal identification leads to issues of privacy. Privacy issues are
complex. Privacy is a culturally-based notion. What one person considers
intensely private, another might consider public business. Some cultures
simply cannot understand another's concern for privacy in some matters and
lack of concern in others. 

* Privacy also divides into several distinct areas: 1. Reliability and
accuracy; 2. Misuse; 3. Privacy. Discussion of these issues is simplified
if the different concerns are separated.

* Finally, once again, the issues are so complex that no single, simple
solution is possible.

  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

This debate started with an analysis of the non-unique character of names
and the statement that it didn't seem too onerous to require individuals to
select unique names. Note that the suggestion still allowed people the same
freedom in their choice of names as they now have, adding only the
requirement that they be unique. I am now convinced that this belief is
wrong -- names are critically important for a person or the family's self
image and cultural values. It would indeed by onerous to establish
artificial conventions -- now matter how well intentioned and gently
enforced -- to name selection.

People's names derive from a wide variety of sources and serve a wide variety
of purposes. Today, they are an essential component of self identity and
self-image. It is dangerous to tamper with them. The real issue is that names
serve so many functions that coupling the problem of unique identification
with that of a person's name simply adds confusion.  If we separate the
self-image, self-identity function of the name from that of societal
identification, then the problem simplifies. Let people be free to assign
their children or themselves any reasonable name consistent with their
culture, religion, and self values (and that are not deemed immoral or
improper by society). It would not matter if there were multiple people with
the same name. But then we must devise some other means of identification for
society. Moreover, there is no need to have a single scheme: we might have
different identifications for different purposes, thus helping thwart possible
misuse. (Credit: The suggestion to separate the identification aspect of a
name from its self-identity comes from several correspondents: the texts of
their suggestions are appended to the latter part of this message.)

This now raises the question of how we can invent a unique identification
scheme that addresses the problems of accuracy, misuses, and privacy. I also
believe strongly that the identifier be a humane one -- easy to learn, easy to
use. And it had better be one that is difficult to counterfeit. I suspect that
this means that the identifier will have to have several versions: A simple
one for non-critical usage (e.g., checking out library books or charging small
amounts of money), but more complex and with more encryption and other
personal identifiers when it comes to critical items.  Here I can imagine the
identification supplemented by various cryptographic schemes (the FBI and NSA
permitting), including the use of random voice segments, or
retinal/fingerprint/DNA scans -- the technical issues should be discussed
elsewhere. Many would argue that databases for different functions be
separated, not allowed to be interconnected (maybe with different, encrypted
identification schemes so as to avoid possible misuses).

UNIVERSAL IDENTIFICATION

The discussion about names soon became a discussion about universal
identification and the many issues associated with that. So now, a digression
into those issues. Concern about access to personal records can be divided
into at least three areas: accuracy, misuse, and privacy. These three
different topics often get confused in discussion, but I think we will make
more progress if we separate them:

ACCURACY OF RECORDS: If we rely on databases for credit ratings, police
checks, medical records, and other aspects of modern life, then those
records must be accurate. All too often they are erroneous, either by
having incomplete, inaccurate, or fallacious information or by combining
records of different individuals.

MISUSE: When people ask me what the problem is when others have access to
personal files, I do not have a good answer. The problem, I think, is that in
the United States, we do not practice what we preach. We claim that we have
religious, political, sexual, and racial freedom, but we do not. If we really
had that freedom, then maybe we wouldn't need so much privacy. If people wish
to be adulterers, or gay, or communist, or purple-skinned, or to subscribe to
(legal) pornographic magazines or films -- whatever --they should not be
ashamed to let others know. But that is not our society, regardless of what
the laws might state: Their lives would become intolerable if people knew (or
thought they knew) that kind of information.  Similarly, people shouldn't care
if their employer knew their medical history. Unfortunately, they have to
care, because they might get fired because their employer had erroneous
beliefs about the implications of the history.

One common complaint is that it is possible to learn a lot about someone and
then pretend to be them, gaining financial or other benefits (at their
expense). But this is not a problem with open access to records. Rather the
problem is that of insufficient verification of an individual's identity.  To
solve the identity problem we need other means -- a complex issue, but
nonetheless, one that in principle can be separated from the general issue of
privacy.

PRIVACY: Part of the privacy issue comes from the potential for misuse. But
some of it is because some people wish to keep their activities known only
to themselves or their close associates. Presumably this should be
permitted within the bounds of public safety and public good and as long as
their activities do not violate the laws of the country. The problem is
that many will argue (correctly, in my opinion) that the definitions of
"public safety" and "public good" are vague and question who has the right
to make those decisions; others will question a person's rights when the
laws of the country are thought to be immoral or improper. The reverse of
privacy is secret collection of information -- when the person about whom
the information is collected is not permitted access to the material, or in
some cases, is even unaware of the fact that such a collection exists.

UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS

But even given all these concerns about privacy, geopolitical groups and
countries will need unique identifiers for its citizens, if only for
legitimate societal concerns -- e.g., licensing for some activities (for
driving, flying, voting, being a medical doctor, ...), or keeping track of
people (voting, social security benefits, income tax). The convenience of
credit cards requires some unique identifiers. All this seems to require some
sort of central clearing house to ensure uniqueness. However, unique
identifiers have both virtues and difficulties, perhaps best summarized by
Peter Neumann (not as RISKS moderator, but as contributor, in a private note):

  There is no easy answer.  User Identification systems (UIDs) can
  disambiguate and could have staved off many of the ugly false arrest cases
  and other mistaken identities (e.g., see my CACM Inside Risks column of Jan 
  1992), if they were used properly.  UIDs can also create many disasters,
  particularly when they are abused or not used properly."

One interesting fact I discovered was that the United States Social Security
Number (SSN) is NOT a good choice of personal identifier for technical
reasons. Forget all the civil libertarian concerns -- it is simply a crappy
piece of technology, poorly implemented at that. Think about it: only nine
digits to register 250 million people -- that's only a factor of four leeway,
much of which is used up by non-used digits, etc. No check-digits, and such a
dense packing of the encoding that any random guess or simple typing or memory
error is apt to lead to someone else's account.

Chris Hibbert supplies an excellent discussion of social security numbers
in his FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions). SSNs are intended to be unique but
they goof now and then (it's happened in fewer than a hundred documented
cases). When the Social Security Administration discovers this, they issue
a new number to one of the people.

SUMMARY OF SUBMISSIONS
Note that I have not included all submissions, just the ones that made
unique points. I have deleted considerable material from each response
(else this document would run 70-90 pages), but aside from deletions, a
spelling-check (I did correct spelling errors), and a few minor
typographical edits, I have made no alterations.  [PGN did a little
cosmetic work as well, and caught a few more mispelings.]

Any line preceded by "&gt;" comes from my original contribution to RISKS (except
for the notorious Internet mail scheme that will precede the word "From"
with "&gt;" if it is the first word on a line -- another hack reminding us of
our UNIX legacy.) All comments by me are preceded by the phrase: 

COMMENT BY DN: 
At times, it may be difficult to distinguish the boundaries of the
contributions and my comments from the summaries. In an ideal world I would
use indentation and different type fonts to make the distinction clear. But
Internet is restricted to plain ASCII, so different fonts are out. And my
mail system (Eudora), for all its virtues, is not WYSIWYG, so I can't use
indentations -- not reliably anyway. (Sometimes I dream I am still using
Emacs, but then I pinch myself and wake up.)

NAMES AS SELF-IDENTITY

From: Will Taber &lt;Will_Taber@dgc.com&gt;

The most important function of any name is to identify us to ourselves. A
person's name is a significant factor in how they come to see themselves.
At some level, parents tend to pick names that reflect the person that they
hope that their child will become. My wife and I had a hard enough time
deciding on names that we liked. I am sorry, but any kind of global
registry is just out of the question. Some things just are not worth
changing for the convenience of database designers.

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

From: "George Buckner" &lt;GRB@NCCIBM1.BITNET&gt;

Excuse me, but are we now proposing to have all names verified for uniqueness
through a central database? What about the freedom of expression that would be
restricted by such a scheme? I would insist that it is the arbitrary
assumptions underlying the program logic (or lack thereof), not the persons
name, which needs to be changed.

This is really another example of "risk of invalid assumptions". We see
examples posted here all the time (i.e. programs which assume that no
transaction will require more than N digits to accommodate). In this case an
assumption was made that the full name, together with the birthdate and city
of residence, would guarantee uniqueness.

... the problem is in assuming that you can guarantee uniqueness via a
combination of name/birthdate/hair color/zodiac sign/whatever. It is these
assumptions which impose arbitrary restrictions on data values. As Jerry
Leichter pointed out, the safest way to handle this is to assign a unique
number to each instance of an object in a file. This is nothing new
-businesses have been assigning unique customer ids/account numbers to people
for years.  Thus it doesn't matter how many John Q. Smiths, born on the same
day, living in the same city, are contained in the database.

&gt; Would a world-wide registry for names work? 
Perhaps, but it is quite unnecessary, and quite undesirable:

"I'm sorry sir, but the computer has rejected the name you have chosen
 for your child. It isn't unique."

&gt; This is a serious request. how can we invent unique identifiers for people
&gt; that
&gt; 1. Make it easy to select a name
 Select whatever name you choose. To hell with arbitrary
 programming assumptions. Incorporate a separate field to hold
 the unique ID.
&gt; 2. Work for an entire country and potentially scale to the entire world
 Moot question, if globally unique identifiers, SEPARATE FROM THE
 NAME, are used. If it's unique globally then by definition it will
 be unique within a country.
&gt; 3. Do not violate civil liberties
 This is a matter of coordinating policy with implementation.
 Use of unique numbers (SSN) doesn't NECESSARILY infringe on civil
 liberties, though it may make such violations easier. Likewise,
 absence of these identifiers doesn't guarantee that our liberties
 are safe.
&gt; 4. Do not make it possible for others to misuse the system
 This is related to point #3 above, and is thus another matter of
 coordinating policy with implementation.

&gt; In other words, how do we get the benefits and avoid the risks?
 Yes, we always want to have it both ways, and to some degree, perhaps
 we can. But remember that we are trying to accommodate two quite
 divergent (if not mutually exclusive -at least on the surface)
 imperatives.

 And the price of liberty is STILL eternal vigilance.

* There are also cultural factors. In some communities (I think Australian
Aborigines, but I may be mistaken), people take on different names in the
course of their lifetimes. For example, if a close relative dies, the
survivors may change their names.  After a mourning period, the survivors may
change their names again and may not go back to the original names.

* Icelanders still use the father's or mother's name as their last name, with
the "daughter" ("dottir") or "son" (""sson") suffix.  Thus, the last name
changes for every generation (by sex). I think Russians may still have part of
their names based on this. Also, Spanish names typically use the mother's and
father's last name, I believe.  These naming schemes may be tied into a
person's cultural identify.  In such a case, these people may not want to
change.

* Many immigrants to the USA had their names changed at the border by
insensitive/confused immigration officials. Many people hold a strong cultural
identity in their names. It seems that your proposal would hinder this.

* What about people who wish to name their children, especially sons,
after their parents? (Just read 100 Years of Solitude to see a lot of 
common names :-) Some examples:
 William William Williams, Sr. (Bill Bill Bill :-)
 William William Williams, Jr.
 William William Williams III

* Marriage: This is still a touchy issue in the USA. Many people desire to
change their last name when they marry (many also do not).  In such cases,
people won't care much about your national/international name registry. Even
if the names were unique in the beginning, the changed name may not be. Do you
think the religious right will go for this?

* Religion: Some people change their name when they a) convert religions or b)
go through some religious experience. To use an example from a current movie,
Malcolm Little changed his name to Malcolm X when he converted to Islam (or at
least to the Nation of Islam's Islam).  The "X" also had political
significance (the theory--at least from X's autobiography--was that the TRUE
last name was wiped out by whites in the past, so that the X acts as a
placeholder until--presumably-- God will provide the real name. After Malcolm
X went on the Hajj to Mecca, he changed his name again (to something like
El-Hajj Malik Shabazz, his wife still calls herself Betty Shabazz). Many
people also want to name their children after religious names (Rebecca,
Matthew, Joseph, etc.). Eduard Shevardnadze recently was baptized in Georgia
(the country, not the state). His new religious name is Georgi.

.....

An identifier should be static data, names are dynamic. Within a computer
database, a personal name should be considered as stable as such things as
weight, height, or hair color. Nobody would think of making these the primary
identifiers of a person in anything other than short-term databases.

Just in mainstream U.S. culture, there are an unending number of events that
may lead to a change in name: birth, Catholic confirmation, marriage,
Amerindian rites of passage, divorce, adoption, etc. Taken in combination, it
is nearly impossible to predict how many names an individual may have, and
what these names may mean to them and to their peers.

It is not up to me as an individual to ensure that my name is convenient to
somebody's database, even, or perhaps especially, if that database is
maintained by the police. If they have a need to enter me in their data, it is
their responsibility that that entry be distinguishable from others.  All of
the other data you suggested (birth date, birth place, etc.) are much better
identifiers than my personal name, as it is unlikely that I will be able to
change my birth date once it has occurred!

In order to provide any serious answers to Don's serious request for a way to
invent unique identifiers for people, we need to decide what these identifiers
are going to be used for.

For casual conversation, there is no problem, we already know how to do this.
"John Smith. No, not that one, John Smith from Poughkeepsie. With the blue
eyes."

In written form, we have also solved the problem.
"Don Norman from the Cognitive Science Department of the University of
California, San Diego at La Jolla."

This leaves open the need for identifiers in databases (whether computerized
or not). The requirements of these identifiers differ for different databases.
Do they need to be unique for all individuals in the world? In that case, the
identifier probably needs some location information. Do they need to be
inherently bound to an individual? In that case, there probably needs to be
some birth, fingerprint or other static information in the identifier itself.

None of these requirements imply that personal names would make a good
identifier for such purposes.
....

P.S. Along the lines of databases asserting control over personal
information, if you were receiving this message directly, instead of in a
digest, you would see that my email address had been changed from
rowan@sea.east.sun.com to brian.hawthorne@East.Sun.COM and that my name had
been changed from Rowan Hawthorne to Brian Hawthorne. This is because the
corporate machine (at least the human parts) fails to understand that some
of us have an additional name, known as a "nickname". My friends call me
Rowan, people on the net call me rowan, but since the IRS considers me to
be Brian the company follows suit. I suppose I could change my name legally
to Rowan, but I enjoy having the two different names for different
purposes. Forcing me to either abandon my nickname, or adopt it in all
situations seems a bit draconian.

....
I would NEVER grant any authority the right to select a name for me, but I'm
quite comfortable having my ADDRESS assigned by someone. 
...
Norman states that "Names.. are a technological invention to make it easy to
identify people uniquely." Jerry Leichter suggests something similar: "Any
society has to have a way to identify individuals.  At onetime, when the scale
of society was small, a single name, plus perhaps a city of origin, or a
parent's name, or a job name, was enough identification..." But names do much,
much more. Names define who we are emotionally, socially and spiritually. I
know a family that named their daughters Hope Faith, and Charity. My family
named the three boys Robert, Ronald, and Russell for quirkish reasons. And
what about names like "He Who Conquers" or "Dances With Wolves." Something
more than a unique identifier here.

Addresses, however, fit the description that Norman and Leichter use. They are
bureaucratic, assigned by others. We can accept an address that has something
like 05667 or @UCSD.EDU. I'm quite comfortable with AMINZADE@UVMVAX.UVM.EDU,
but I doubt my parents would have been willing to give me that name. Makes it
lots easier to develop a unique identifier.

A personal "address" begins to make sense when telephone, mail, and other
information services are smart enough to route our communications to the
person rather than to the device. We're at the threshold of being able to do
this now, so perhaps now is the time to talk about personal addresses.

COMMENT BY DN: I start with a question:

From: Bob_Frankston@frankston.com
....
 In countries that do allow the use of national identifiers in databases, are
they universally used to avoid name confusions?

COMMENT BY DN: I forwarded the question to Chris Hibbert. He responded:

From: hibbert@xanadu.com (Chris Hibbert)

This is a very broad question, but there's a little bit that's worth saying.
Countries that have good universal unique identifiers fall into two camps,
mostly free, and mostly not. In the ones that are mostly free, (Canada, e.g.)
the SIN is used in government databases, but cross-matching isn't routinely
allowed, and private companies don't seem to use the same number as the
government. (I don't actually have solid references to back this up, but I've
read the annual reports of the Canadian Privacy Commissioner, and am
extrapolating from the kind of complaints they do and don't get compared to
the US.)

In more intrusive societies, the same identifiers are used throughout the
government, and the government pushes for the efficiency that results from
consolidated databases, so data matching isn't even a concern. The government
of Thailand (I think) has a single database which all the government
departments share access to. This makes it possible for someone in one
department to make a decision based on your interactions with another
department. (This generalization is based on even less information.)

Anyway, my bottom line is that I believe there's a lot of benefit in not using
the same identifier in our dealings with different parties.  That's behind a
lot of my attention to SSNs. They wouldn't be a problem if they were only used
by the IRS or the SSA, but the fact that my employer can find out about my
medical history, or (in some states) someone who sees my driver's license can
find out my credit rating or pretend to be me and ruin it is a real weakness
of this system.

From: xanadu!hibbert@uunet.UU.NET (Chris Hibbert)
...
Jerry Leichter lays the problem at the feet of the individuals being
identified. 
    If [Steven Reid] stands by his insistence that "Steven Reid,
    born on xx/yy/zzzz" is all the identifying information he
    will give, he cannot expect to be distinguished from the
    other Mr. Reid who just as adamantly insists on his right to
    identify himself in the same way.

In my experience, (e.g., the case of Terry Dean Rogan) people in this
situation are eager to be distinguished, and go to enormous trouble to
convince the authorities to support them in this.  The problem becomes
intractable when the authorities involved insist that they have to treat the
identifier stored by their computers as if they provide secure unique
identification.  If the computer systems were made more flexible they could
store more information and allow people to work around the problems when they
arise.  In other situations, the relevant authorities ignore the extra
distinguishing info that is there.  Robert Ellis Smith's compendium of Privacy
War Stories lists numerous cases where the authorities arrested someone with a
name similar to one on a warrant, even though the physical descriptions were
very different.  (As much as a foot in height, 100 pounds in weight, differing
hair color, etc.)  What's a person to do if using any variant of your own name
is close enough to match against someone the police are looking for?

The Montreal police also need to realize that in a metropolitan area like
that, they have to be aware that names aren't close to unique.  I don't know
if they have a large Korean or other Asian community there, but common names
there are much more common than in groups descended from western european
societies.  And in these cases, physical descriptions aren't going to help
much.  (I didn't say "they all look alike", I said our western system of
classifying people doesn't distinguish orientals at all.  Hair color, eye
color, height don't vary in the way we're used to, and most caucasian police
are much worse at guessing ages of orientals who turn gray, go bald, and
wrinkle in different ways than whites.

</i><PRE>

Having lived most of my life in a country that uses the national id system, I
find it quite useful. I also find it hard to understand what harm there is in
such a system, let alone that it constitutes an "obvious" risk to human
rights.  ....

&gt;In other words, how to we get the benefits and avoid the risks?

We can't. Since the development of technology will sooner or later make
such a system inevitable, we'd better be prepared to take both benefits
and risks.

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

From: J. Brad Hicks &lt;mc/G=Brad/S=Hicks/OU=0205925@mhs.attmail.com&gt;
 
My life has been complicated horribly by name confusion, so I've put a lot
of thought into this. There are two theses I would like to put forward:
 
 1) If you manage to make name, or name plus any other attributes, a
 unique key, then you will acquire all of the problems that go with
 a national identity number.
 
 2) There is nothing that can be done to names, as socially used, that
 will make them adequate unique keys.
 
UNIQUE NAME = NATIONAL IDENTITY "NUMBER"? Let's suppose that you have an
application for which you wish to track people by their National Identity
Numbers, whether for good or ill. Being a sensible programmer, and knowing
that NIN formats could change, you make it a nice long alphanumeric field.
Then let us suppose that name alone, or name plus date of birth plus number,
or name plus some combination of attributes, turns out to be sufficient to
accurately identify anybody. What's to stop you from putting that string into
the key field? In that case "JAMES BRADLEY HICKS 07/11/1960 1" =becomes= my
National Identity Number. If it is unique, it can be used for database
lookups, just as efficiently as a number.
 
NAME CAN'T BE PART OF A UNIQUE KEY? Let's take the hypothetical case of
Jonathan Quincy Customer, of 1234 Main Street, Springfield, NI 66666.  Even if
there are no other Jonathan Quincy Customers anywhere else in the "target
area" (city, country, world, whatever), you're going to run into problems
looking him up by name. (1) What if he signs it John? or Johnny? (2) What if
the clerk misspells it "Jonathan"? or "Jon"? (3) What if it's actually
"Johnnathon" or some other non-standard spelling?  Then you'll never untangle
it, since the clerks everywhere "know" how to spell it and will screw it up
all the time.
 
(Maybe you think that you can solve this problem with training. When US cities
began converting from candlelight to gas lamps, people frequently BLEW UP
THEIR HOUSES at night, killing everybody inside, because deep down in their
reflexes they "knew" that you turn off a wall light by blowing it out. With
their LIVES on the line, it took many of them YEARS to be trained not to do
this. If your system requires people to unlearn things, even as minor as
spellings of names, your system will not work in the real world.)
 
(4) What if he routinely goes by his middle name?
 
The credit bureaus, I'm told by a friend who used to program for one, "solve"
problems 1-4 by using as their primary key last name + first initial of first
name + first letter of street name + "city", i.e., standard metropolitan area.
(I live in Maryland Heights, a suburb of St.  Louis. For such purposes, they
would use "Saint Louis" not "Maryland Heights", presumably by lookup on ZIP
code.) (5) What happens to his records if/when he moves? Or the city renames
the street?
 
Then of course, as with the X.400 spec, really ugly things happen when you try
to parse the name string into separate fields, such as "last name" in the
example above. Which one is the "last name" or "surname"? If he is of Latin
American origin, it could be =either= Quincy =or= Customer. In China, the
patronymic would be "Jonathan", and "Quincy Customer" the given name. (In the
X.400 spec, if the name is "Jonathan Quincy Customer" and Quincy is the
surname, how should the rest be recorded in the given name field? "Jonathan
Customer"? Won't half the systems in the world reconstruct that as "Jonathan
Customer Quincy"? Is this why there's a separate initials field?) (6) So
knowing all of this, what would the clerk type in to the "last name" field?
 
(What =do= non-Europeans who run into this idiocy say when they're asked
for their "first name, middle initial, last name"?)
 
Even assuming you parse it right, (7) what about Jonathan's cousin Jane who
lives across the street? OK, some of them untangle this by using house numbers
as well. (8) Somebody had better warn him not to name his first child "Jane"
or "Janet" or "James" or "Johann", or he'll get what happened to me. As soon
as Johann grows up enough to apply for a credit card, while living at the same
address, the two files will be cross-linked inextricably.
 
My name is James Bradley Hicks. My father is James Bedford Hicks.  Observe,
the name is an adequate identifier in these cases, but no, I am NOT "James B.
Hicks, Jr." But almost all of the computers out there use first name, middle
initial, last name for an identifier, and as I've said, the credit bureaus
don't even use that much. For us, it's no problem: he's Jim (or to some people
who've known him since The War, "Bud") and I'm Brad. But when he and I were
both working for IBEW Local 1, both of our work hours got credited to his
pension account; they turned out to be flatly incapable of untangling this
other than by "renaming" me as Brad J. Hicks.
 
Then, the other day (thanks to a tip in RISKS) I requested my TRW report.  ONE
HUNDRED PERCENT of my report is in error. You see, item 1 was just a query,
and item 2 was an "address and SSN correction", because they saw on some
report that I had as a previous address "1371 Broadlawns" in St.  Louis (I
grew up there), and they were still getting credit reports from "1371
Broadlawns" ... my father, of course. They even "corrected" my social security
number ... to his. From then on, there were no separate files for us; if I had
any credit activity, their search didn't find it, and all of his showed up
when they searched for mine.
 
I'll work with them to correct this, but there is no way under the current
system to stop it from happening again, so for the rest of our lives, our
credit records are going to be screwed up.
 
Speculation:
 
Whatever the problems are of having a "national identity number", we've got
them already. When the cop pulls you over, he can and usually does ask for
your driver's license, which almost certainly has enough information on it to
find you in any database that he cares about. You show that same id, with name
and address, to anybody who you want to cash a check. You even have to show it
on some cash transactions, like gun purchases or renting a hotel room. Banning
the use of National Identification Numbers (to the pitiful extent that this
was even done) did not solve the problem.
 
Since not having an NIN didn't solve the problem, having an NIN won't make
things any worse, and they =will= make one thing better: if there are
ambiguities or things that are easy to mis-key on your existing identity card,
right now you can get confused with a deadbeat or a fleeing felon, with ugly
results. With an NIN with adequate check digits, it seems to me that you would
acquire no problems that we don't have now and eliminate the problem of false
identification.

COMMENT BY DN: I have been deleting signatures in order to save space, but
this particular signature actually is relevant: it points out one of the
fears of universal access to databases. (And the fact that the e-mail
address requires explanation is another sign of the difficulty of getting
unique -- and understandable -- addresses.)

From: tarl@coyoacan.sw.stratus.com (Tarl Neustaedter)

As you can tell from my email address, I am not one of those people whose name
gets easily confused with someone else's. But having a unique name is not the
same as having a standardized unique identifier that everything uses. The
former is a comfort and a privilege, the latter is a frightening idea.

With computerized databases today, merging databases is trivial as long as
you can make the associations between entries. A standardized identifier which
is validated at time of data entry (e.g., SSN), will permit this association.
A unique name, when the name isn't guaranteed to be unique, or guaranteed to be
correctly spelled, does not permit such an association. And thus the barriers
to a centralized database of everything are still high.

With my name, I get to observe the process first hand with junk mail. I give
to various political causes and some charities, most of which have variously
misspelled my name. When I receive new junk mail, I will frequently receive
three or four identical pieces of mail addressed to slightly different people.
The new purveyor of junk mail has purchased several databases, and done an
imperfect merge - the possibilities of instead generating databases describing
the individuals are fairly clear.

 O.K.. - Mr. 57Zy65zz; it says here that you have given money to both
 the NRA and HCI, you are currently taking prozac, you checked into a
 drug rehab unit last year, and I just stopped you for crossing a solid
 yellow line. Clearly, you are so screwed up as to be a danger to
 yourself and others - I'll have to take you in.

Fantasy? Sure. But we have shown ourselves, as a society, to be unable to limit
use of data for the purpose that it was collected. So we shouldn't be asking
how to generate unique standard identifiers for individuals, but instead 
should be asking how to prevent bureaucracies from doing so.

WHY USE OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS IS A PROBLEM

COMMENT BY DN:: The following is an excerpt from Chris Hilbert's

 What to do when they ask for your Social Security Number

 by Chris Hibbert

Why use of Social Security Numbers is a problem

The Social Security Number doesn't work well as an identifier for several
reasons. The first reason is that it isn't at all secure; if someone makes up
a nine-digit number, it's quite likely that they've picked a number that is
assigned to someone. There are quite a few reasons why people would make up a
number: to hide their identity or the fact that they're doing something;
because they're not allowed to have a number of their own (illegal immigrants,
e.g.), or to protect their privacy. In addition, it's easy to write the number
down wrong, which can lead to the same problems as intentionally giving a
false number. There are several numbers that have been used by thousands of
people because they were on sample cards shipped in wallets by their
manufacturers.

When more than one person uses the same number, it clouds up the records.
If someone intended to hide their activities, it's likely that it'll look
bad on whichever record it shows up on. When it happens accidentally, it
can be unexpected, embarrassing, or worse. How do you prove that you
weren't the one using your number when the record was made?

A second problem with the use of SSNs as identifiers is that it makes it hard
to control access to personal information. Even assuming you want someone to
be able to find out some things about you, there's no reason to believe that
you want to make all records concerning yourself available.  When multiple
record systems are all keyed by the same identifier, and all are intended to
be easily accessible to some users, it becomes difficult to allow someone
access to some of the information about a person while restricting them to
specific topics.

The market for stolen numbers increased in 1986, with the passage of the
Immigration reform law. While making up a number is usually good enough to
fool the public library, employers submit the number to the IRS, which cross
checks with its own and SSA's records. Because of the checks, illegal workers
need to know what name goes with the number so they won't be caught as
quickly.

DN COMMENT: The following contribution was in answer to a series of
question I posed to Chris as I put together this summary.

From: hibbert@xanadu.com (Chris Hibbert)

One of the few points in your article that I disagreed with was the idea
that we might solve a lot
of problems by requiring people to use unique names. There are many
problems that we might use unique universal IDs to solve, but there
are also a lot of problems we'd create or exacerbate with such a
system. One of the protections of our privacy currently is that not
every database uses the same universal IDs, and so it's often a fair
bit of trouble for someone who knows you in one context to find other
information about you. 
 ...
When people ask me about designing databases and want to know what to
use for a universal ID, my usual answer is to suggest that they think
real hard about how secure the system has to be, and what the
penalties are for not realizing that someone already has an account.
I don't have a good answer for making sure that you always match
returning customers with their accounts, but assigning account numbers
and requiring them to remember them works pretty well.

MAKING ENTRIES IN DATABASES UNIQUE

COMMENT BY DN: Many people suggested that life would be solved if only we
ensured that whenever a new name was entered into a database, it would be
entered uniquely, so as not to combine records of different people. In my
opinion, these proposals are technically reasonable and fundamentally
flawed. They are flawed because they assume one or more of the following:

1. the person entering the data knows if this is a new entry or not. 

This can't possibly be true when the database might have hundreds of
millions of names (the world population is measured in the billions), when
there are thousands of people entering the information, and when the person
about whom the information is being entered either does not know, does not
care, or deliberately does not wish to cooperate. 

Every large database of names I know of suffers from problems of: the same
person multiply entered (Donald A Norman is not the same as Donald Norman who
is not the same as D.A. Norman. To say nothing of mistyping: D.  Narman), and,
simultaneously, the same records confusing two different people (the d. norman
who wrote paper 1 is not really the same as the d.  norman who wrote paper 2).
(See the discussion of the U.S. Social Security database.)

I see no simple solution to this problem, despite the clever solutions
proposed by respondents, of which I will here reprint a few:
END COMMENT BY DN:

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

From: Will_Taber@dgc.mceo.dg.com

The initial problem is that the police database was designed with the
assumption that name/DOB would be unique. A much simpler solution would seem
to be to provide an occurrence number in the database. Each time a STEVEN REID
or a JOHN A SMITH or a REGIS Q MISSLETHWAITE is entered into the database the
occurrence number for that name is incremented and stored in the record for
that individual. The database now has a unique ID for each individual and when
there is confusion, information other than name (DOB, Address, Phone Number,
what ever is available and relevant) can be used to determine which person is
the one in question.  

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

From: shapiro@mica.Colorado.EDU (Andrew Shapiro)

In order for the police to identify someone they would type that persons
name. If more than one person share that name then the computer would ask
for some other identification, like DOB. If a single individual still
cannot be identified the computer would guide the officer by asking for
more information. 

This system allows people to chose and use any name they would like while at 
the same time allows computer operators to identify individuals without 
confusion. I do not believe that people should be forced to conform to the 
inflexible programs software engineers write. 

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

From: s_titz@ira.uka.de (Olaf Titz)

There already is a system where all people have names chosen by
themselves. It's IRC (Internet Relay Chat), where every person is
known by a name ('nickname' is the term actually used; the real names
of the people are known too) that he can choose himself freely,
provided it does not exceed 9 characters and is globally unique. The
latter is currently becoming a problem as the user base of IRC grows
to several thousand people. Of course everyone wants a nick that has a
meaning and fits the person, so the choice becomes increasingly
difficult for new users. Some people have proposed to deal with the
problem in an in this context already well-known way: adding
information of locale. But many don't like that idea.

(More information on IRC can be found in a paper by Elizabeth Reid
(emr@munagin.ee.mu.oz.au) titled 'Electropolis', which is carried by
many anonymous FTP servers, including ftp.uni.kl.de.)

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

COMMENT BY DN: The schemes above rely too much on the good faith of the
person about whom the information is being entered. It is apt to lead to
less commingling of records at the price of multiple records for the same
person. I don't think the problem is in retrieval: the problem is in data
entry. See some of the horror stories above.

Many people commented on the fact that there already exist registries for
ensuring unique identification:

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

From: faustus@ygdrasil.CS.Berkeley.EDU (Wayne A. Christopher)

A friend of mine in Sweden got a letter one day from the government, telling
her that her name was too common, and would she mind changing her last name to
her mother's maiden name? This may seem excessively paternalistic to many
people in the US, but I guess it does make some sense.

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

From: craig@mnemosyne.MicroUnity.com (One of the people named Craig Hansen)

I believe the Screen Actors Guild has such a registry; many people have found
their given name already taken and have been forced to take a "Stage Name."
Ultimately, though, identifiers such as SSN are already unique, and these
unique identifiers are at the root of the privacy concerns, because they are
globally unique identifiers for information.  The SSN makes it easy to join
together pieces of the information from different databases, which permits the
assembling of a dangerously complete dossier from a series of apparently
benign releases of information.

COMMENT BY DN: See the discussion of SSN.

How about a completely non-coercive service in which people (or their parents)
could register their names and a few lines about themselves, subject to good
taste, privacy, and other concerns. Then prospective parents could scan it and
make their own judgments about what they are getting their kids into. I would
imagine that the spread of names would increase.

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

From: Simon Marshall &lt;S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk&gt;

I'd like to suggest the application of computer password techniques. We all
know that the best password is computer generated gibberish, right? Even if we
stick to lower case letters, two 5-letter identifiers, such as ``yloof
lirpa'', would give something like 141 thousand billion different
permutations, enough for a long time to come.

Though this technique is not often used for passwords, since they are difficult
to remember, writing down your name in case you forget it would not render it
useless. Indeed, just imagine the commercial possibilities, selling names that
actually make sense to those with more money than sense. How much money do you
think you could get if the computer came up with ``jdanq uayle'' for your name?
Maybe not much, but you'd want to sell it anyway.

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

From: mcclella@yertle.Colorado.EDU (Gary McClelland)
&gt;In other words, how to we get the benefits and avoid the risks?

I'll give it a try using Don's model of the California license
plate system and the name database of the American Kennel Club as
models to be modified for this larger purpose:

1. "Used" names only are recorded in the database.

2. Database is encrypted to prevent casual reading (although the
experts at, say, NSA might still be able to read it).

3. From terminals lots of places, parents, new immigrants, people wanting to
change their names, etc. could try out potential names. The test name is
encrypted and checked for a match in the database. System replies only "OK" or
"used."

4. Finding an unused name could be a pain. Here is where the AKC strategy
applies. They encourage outlandish and multiple names to avoid duplicates
(this can even be fun!). Just as one does not use the official AKC name for
the dog very often (not on the dog tag, not when you want the dog to fetch
your slippers, and not even with the vet, just for official registration forms
at dog shows), one would use one's official name only on official documents
(that is another problem of deciding just what documents require one's full
name but that is not a new problem) and it could be used whenever it was
necessary to avoid name collisions such as the Ottawa example that started
this thread.

5. Some folks don't like long, complicated names for either themselves or
their dogs. The AKC deals with this by simply adding a short number to the end
of names that are duplicates.  In this case, if the system indicated a desired
name was a duplicate, one could be given the option of adding a short number
(a true PIN!) or arbitrary character string to make the name unique. One would
use this short extra part of one's name only for official purposes.

Obvious risks:
 a. all those existing programs and official written forms that haven't left
enough room for the long names
 
b. one could purposely try to select a confusing name by trying test names
until finding a duplicate and then adding a short PIN such as "1"

I'm sure there are other obvious risks but they aren't "obvious" to me right
now. Have at it!

BTW, once the system is set up I want to request

NAMES; JR. AND SR. DO NOT MEAN RELATIONS

COMMENT BY DN: One interesting fact about names emerged:

From: Craig Partridge &lt;craig@aland.bbn.com&gt;

In your posting to RISKS, you left out one other trend. The advent of Jr.  and
Sr. (or Older and Younger) or other distinguishing features to label people.
If a town had two John Smiths, quite often one would be John Smith Jr., the
other John Smith Sr., even if they were not related. Furthermore, someone who
was the John Smith Jr. in early life could become the John Smith Sr.  in later
life. Sufficiently confusing that the practice was largely dropped and we only
use Jr. and Sr. for son and father these days.

COMMENT BY DN: I asked Craig: Did they ever use "the taller" or "the
fatter" (fat John Smith)? He replied:

Not that I've heard of, once last names came into effect. (Before then it
was quite common of course). What I've seen is using town names to distinguish
(John Smith of Wayland) and Jr. and Sr. if that wasn't enough. My uninformed
guess is that town name plus Jr. and Sr. worked pretty well in most cases.

But the Jr. and Sr. to mean younger and older stayed common practice until
quite recently. Certainly through the 18th century in the US. (A common
warning in genealogy books is to be aware of this practice and not assume
Sr. is father of Jr.).

The four-year study by the University of California at Davis reports that
women making computer chips have a 40% higher incidence of miscarriages than
other workers in the same factories.  It covered 15,000 workers at 14
factories in seven states.  A previous study by the University of
Massachusetts reported a 70% increased risk among women in a particular
factory of Digital Equipment Corp.  [Source: San Francisco Chronicle, 4
December 1992, p.1.]

Researchers in Finland have identified a statistically significant incidence
of miscarriages among women using computer video display terminals that emit
electromagnetic radiation of type ELF -- triple the expected normal.  A report
is being published in the American Journal of Epidemiology.  [Source: San
Francisco Chronicle, 10 December 1992, p.A7]

Incidentally, Paul Brodeur has another article on electromagnetic radiation
effects in the New Yorker dated 7 December 1992.  [RISKS readers will recall
the previous series of three articles being discussed here, e.g., <A HREF="/Risks/9.06.html">RISKS-9.06</A>
and .07.]

      [Forewarned is not necessarily forearmed, even if you have four arms.
      But this problem really demands greater attention, even if there are
      some who say these studies are not definitive.]

[unquoted paraphrasing and bracketed comments mine --Mark S.]

A story by Virginia Ellis in the Los Angeles Times (page A3, Tues 3 Dec 92)
reports that programming errors associated with adding a new "keno" game to
the Calif. state lottery "apparently caused some wagers made early Nov. 17 not
to be logged into the main database.  As a result terminals at retail outlets
were unable to identify those tickets as winners.  A separate programming
oversight caused a similar problem in northern Calif. on Nov. 23, when for
part of the day no tickets for any games could be cashed and validated,
officials said."

The state controller's office is said to be asking whether pre-deployment
testing of the new software was adequate.  "Lottery Director Sharon Sharp
acknowledged that the lottery pressed GTECH, the Rhode Island company that
operates and maintains its computers, to get the games on-line by mid-Nov. but
she insisted there was still time for keno to be adequately tested.  ``We felt
110% comfortable,'' she said.  ``In fact, we could have tested it for three
more months and this still could have happened.''"

The lottery director downplayed the trouble, calling programming problems par
for the course.  Players affected by the troubles took a different view.  At
least one "replay" winner who couldn't get his free ticket from the computer
was told by the lottery to use a complex by-mail procedure to collect his
winnings.  He decided that his time plus 29 cents postage was too much for a
$1 return.  The lottery director said that the system has an "elaborate backup
system" which "ensures that no winner will be lost.  She [Sharp] said she has
since appointed an internal task force of computer technicians and auditors to
investigate the problems and determining if damages should be assessed against
GTECH."  Another lottery official suggested that "operator error" may've been
involved.

[And now the most interesting part...]

"The problems come just three months after the Calif. Lottery Commission
approved a change in the GTECH contract that decreases by hundreds of
thousands of dollars per day the maximum damages that can be assessed against
the company for errors that affect computer performance.  The change was
approved without public discussion.  Sharp said she proposed the change
because the company was being asked to get the keno game ready on a short
deadline.  ``What was important was to be able to get the... cooperation of
our supplier.  The cooperation meant much more that whatever financial
windfall you would or you wouldn't receive from... damages,'' she said.  Since
its introduction Nov. 16, Sharp said keno has added about $7 million a week to
lottery revenues."

[I think that GTECH must have known that the lottery's proposed keno
deployment schedule was too ambitious.  Otherwise, why condition cooperation
on the damage waiver?  This story documents that the Lottery Commission traded
off the risk of poor performance against the benefit of early deployment.  The
question is, did its assessment of this tradeoff calculate the costs (in time,
irritation, and lost winnings due to unreasonable transaction costs to recover
after computer failure) to players of failure, or only the costs to the
lottery of delayed deployment?  Should costs to players of failure be
considered by the lottery?  Or should it look only to its own balance sheet?]

</i><PRE>

A couple of items in RISKS touched upon computer systems and technology
affecting people's behaviour and causing changes in our society.  There is a
risk that some changes may be undesirable and unintended.

Sometimes the change comes about because the system lacks sufficient
information and or isn't smart enough to handle it.  When working at Bell
Canada back in the '70s, I saw an example of that.  A system was supposed to
compare numbers of long distance operators working with the number required to
handle the load of calls.  Over the long term it was hoped the information
would help in predicting staffing requirements based on various factors.
However, it was also used to evaluate managers on their current success or
lack of success in matching the number working with the number needed.  One
serious flaw was that the program assumed the actual number of operators
working could be changed every half hour.  This assumption was at odds with
the union contract that put minimums on the number of hours in a shift and
limits on scheduling of shifts.  The result was that at the end of each day
managers would spent an hour or more doing nothing but telling operators to
unplug or plug into the system in an attempt to fool it.  The managers' and
operators behaviour was changed in a direction the company didn't intend.

On other occasions a change can come about simply because it is in some ways
easier for a system to deal with data where quantities or levels are
significant, compared to other data, and managers may place too much emphasis
on that data.

The Metro Toronto Police may have changed their system now, but at one time,
their system reported each week statistics on the activities of each police
officer - just in order to ensure sound management of staff resources of
course.  Such things like numbers of parking tickets issued were easy to input
and report.  A wide variety of other activities, such as taking a lost child
home, or spending some time checking into a broken window at a business, could
not be as easily input or reported in meaningful ways, yet the value of those
other activities may be far more.  Supervisory officers would, of course,
recognize the value of such activities in principle, but the common reaction
to the weekly report was to notice such things as few parking tickets being
issued, to require explanations when that happened, and to tell the officers
to spend more time on issuing parking tickets so that next week's report
wouldn't "look so bad".  The net result of such a system to change the police
officers' behaviour.  While they would be unlikely to ignore other matters
that came up, the officers would none the less concentrate on the activities
that easily produced large numbers on the reports - such as issuing parking
tickets.

In both of these examples changes happened that were not intended by anyone.
How to predict and avoid or manage such changes may not be simple when a
system is being designed or managed, but an effort is needed.

The following just appeared on AppleLink, Apple's semi-public bulletin board
and e-mail system.  I have censored out identities.  We all knew that the
common, every-day errors many of us have with e-mail can lead to potential
disasters affecting a huge number of people when world-wide WANs/LANs exist.
Here is an example, this one evidently triggered by the blind carbon copy
mechanism, which may reside invisibly on a message.  Invisible information is
never a good idea because it can lead to very visible results.

                       [Bad object-oriented software engineering, despite
                       parameterized information hiding (including X, 
                       below) and inheritance of ancestors!  ENCAPSULATION
                       is the key to GOOD information hiding.  PGN]

In the Internet mail system, a blind cc is visible to the sender (as a line
labelled bcc: list-of-names) but is not only invisible to the receivers, it
ISN'T THERE, so that any reply by any of the receivers cannot go to the bcc
list.  That seems like the better way to do things.  (Although a bcc list with
2,800 recipients is pretty amazing.)

Hardly an issue of RISKS goes by without a story of someone obtaining residual
data--data that the original owner thought was gone.  It's usually from a disk
(issues of medical records, bbs files, and Prodigy come to mind), although
most recently (RISKS 14.15) Tom Swiss points out that utilities exist to scour
RAM for bits.

There's a common moral to all these stories that I feel a need to interject
here: We'd all be better off (at least from a privacy perspective) if the
products we used minimally had security features equivalent to the C2 criteria
of the Orange Book ("U.S. Department of Defense Trusted Computer Security
Evaluation Criteria").

Specifically relating to residual data, it states: "No information, including
encrypted representations of information, produced by a prior subject's
actions is to be available to any subject that obtains access to an object
that has been released back to the system."

Of course, Tom wouldn't have been able to recover his own lost file, but one
might argue that a decent user interface would have prevented that in the
first place...
                    Kraig R. Meyer		 	 kmeyer@aero.org

    [I might add that it is not just the reuse of the object that is
    risky, but the residues left over from incomplete deletion, irrespective
    of whether there is ever any reuse of the object.  If an object is
    deallocated, its memory contents (primary, secondary, tertiary, backup,
    whatever) may still remain and be accessible to penetrators, system
    administrators, etc., EVEN IF THE ORIGINAL OBJECT IS NEVER REUSED.  PGN]

Here's a computer related risk I didn't expect to run into at my local public
library...

Over the last few years, the public library system has been converting the
card catalog and checkout system over to a (remote) centralized computer that
provides all sorts of nifty features like dial in access, ability to check if
a book is checked out, requesting books from other libraries and much more.
Well, in the last year or so, they found that the paper card catalog was not
being kept up to date, so, since they had the computer, they got rid of it.

Last week, a transformer blew and the computer went down (since it had no UPS,
it went down hard and recovery included fixing hardware as well as restoring
data).

While the computer was down, it was still possible to check out books
(apparently they had some sort of backup procedure in place for that), but
there was no card catalog -- one had to ask at the reference desk to get a
list of places to go look around in the stacks for books on their topic.

I talked with one of their computer services people and was told that they
plan to put in a UPS for next time so the machine can be taken down safely and
the data preserved, but there are no plans for anything beyond that (in
particular, no decentralization was planned).  Obviously, another blown
transformer or some down power/phone lines (we are expecting an unusually
nasty winter thus year) could take out the card catalog again.

This certainly isn't a life-threatening sort of risk, but does illustrate one
risk of computerizing an index at a site distant from the records.

The following excerpt from CERT Advisory CA-92:19 suggests that it
may be a federal crime in the U.S. for computer system administrators
to take certain actions to defend their systems against a hacker.

The risk described here is not entirely about computing: it is mostly
a legal risk created, I think, by legislators and administrators that
are insufficiently aware of computing technologies and practises.  A cynic
might suggest other reasons for these kinds of legal opinions.

Lines marked with &gt; are direct quotes; see two other comments by me later.

&gt;
&gt;CA-92:19                         CERT Advisory
&gt;                                December 7, 1992
&gt;                            Keystroke Logging Banner
&gt; 
&gt;The CERT Coordination Center has received information from the United States
&gt;Department of Justice, General Litigation and Legal Advice Section, Criminal
&gt;Division, regarding keystroke monitoring by computer systems administrators,
&gt;as a method of protecting computer systems from unauthorized access.
&gt; 
&gt;The information that follows is based on the Justice Department's advice
&gt;to all federal agencies.  CERT strongly suggests adding a notice banner
&gt;such as the one included below to all systems.  Sites not covered by U.S.
&gt;law should consult their legal counsel.
&gt; 
&gt;    The legality of such monitoring is governed by 18 U.S.C. section 2510
&gt;    et seq.  That statute was last amended in 1986, years before the words
&gt;    "virus" and "worm" became part of our everyday vocabulary.  Therefore,
&gt;    not surprisingly, the statute does not directly address the propriety
&gt;    of keystroke monitoring by system administrators.
&gt; 
&gt;    Attorneys for the Department have engaged in a review of the statute
&gt;    and its legislative history.  We believe that such keystroke monitoring
&gt;    of intruders may be defensible under the statute.  However, the statute
&gt;    does not expressly authorize such monitoring.  Moreover, no court has
&gt;    yet had an opportunity to rule on this issue.  If the courts were to
&gt;    decide that such monitoring is improper, it would potentially give rise
&gt;    to both criminal and civil liability for system administrators.
&gt;    Therefore, absent clear guidance from the courts, we believe it is
&gt;    advisable for system administrators who will be engaged in such
&gt;    monitoring to give notice to those who would be subject to monitoring
&gt;    that, by using the system, they are expressly consenting to such
&gt;    monitoring.  Since it is important that unauthorized intruders be given
&gt;    notice, some form of banner notice at the time of signing on to the
&gt;    system is required.  Simply providing written notice in advance to only
&gt;    authorized users will not be sufficient to place outside hackers on
&gt;    notice.

In other words, you must "give notice" lest you be convicted of snooping (and,
of course being a victim of unauthorized monitoring your attacker will go
free.)  How do you ensure that snoops, crackers and disgruntled employees are
guaranteed to view a message when you can't guarantee they are prevented from
logging in in the first place?  Catch-22, eh?

&gt;    An agency's banner should give clear and unequivocal notice to
&gt;    intruders that by signing onto the system they are expressly consenting
&gt;    to such monitoring.  The banner should also indicate to authorized
&gt;    users that they may be monitored during the effort to monitor the
&gt;    intruder (e.g., if a hacker is downloading a user's file, keystroke
&gt;    monitoring will intercept both the hacker's download command and the
&gt;    authorized user's file).  We also understand that system administrators
&gt;    may in some cases monitor authorized users in the course of routine
&gt;    system maintenance.  If this is the case, the banner should indicate
&gt;    this fact.  An example of an appropriate banner might be as follows:
&gt; 
&gt;       This system is for the use of authorized users only.
&gt;       Individuals using this computer system without authority, or in
&gt;       excess of their authority, are subject to having all of their
&gt;       activities on this system monitored and recorded by system
&gt;       personnel.
&gt; 
&gt;       In the course of monitoring individuals improperly using this
&gt;       system, or in the course of system maintenance, the activities
&gt;       of authorized users may also be monitored.
&gt; 
&gt;       Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring
&gt;       and is advised that if such monitoring reveals possible
&gt;       evidence of criminal activity, system personnel may provide the
&gt;       evidence of such monitoring to law enforcement officials.
&gt; 
&gt;Each site using this suggested banner should tailor it to their precise
&gt;needs.  Any questions should be directed to your organization's legal
&gt;counsel.

Given that notices that appear on the outside of shrink-wrap software boxes
have been held not to constitute a contract; nor that system demands for
"passwords" and "identification" are considered insufficient evidence that
authorized secure access is intended, I find it unlikely that any mere textual
bulletin supplied AFTER logging in would be considered sufficient notice to
unauthorized users.  Most systems let you interrupt such displays anyway.  And
are you sure that your cracker can read at 9600 baud?

&gt;The CERT Coordination Center wishes to thank Robert S. Mueller, III,
&gt;Scott Charney and Marty Stansell-Gamm from the United States Department
&gt;of Justice for their help in preparing this Advisory.

The German Bundestag, which had just moved into its brand-new, expensive
quarters in Bonn (they'll be moving to Berlin someday, but this building was
started when the Wall was still up), has been forced to move back into its old
plenary building because of computer errors.

The new building was installed with a special sound control system that was
specifically designed to eliminate all the problems with feedback, screeching,
volume adjustments and such that had plagued the old system.  During the big
budget debate (where the cost overruns in the new building were to be
discussed as well :-) the sound system turned itself down to a whisper - no
one could follow the speeches. After a 5 hour pause while technicians searched
for the cause, the Bundestag moved back into the old building to resume the
debates.

The cause: The architects had worked out an extremely symbolic form and used
symbolic materials to create the building. The plenary chamber is round and
completely enclosed in (bullet-proof) glass, to underline the transparancy of
the parliamentary process. This glass, however, does not absorb the sound, but
rather it bounces it back. The computers, detecting feedback, turn down the
volume to avoid this problem. A steady state is only achieved when the
microphones are turned off. It will take until March to either replace the
computerized system or put carpeting over the glass walls.

A new central system is being tested in Denmark for people to call a doctor
service at off hours, and possibly get a housecall (this is for non-emergency
cases, i.e., not the equivalent of 911).  The patients in the Danish city of
Odense complained loudly that the waiting for a phone call to be answered was
too long, while the provider said their computerized logs showed no caller had
to wait more than 10 minutes.  After many complaints they tested the
equipment, which showed it was not able to register waits longer than 10
minutes!  Steen Hansen

If you are interested in further details, please e-mail lea@dde.dk (Leif Erik
Andersen), who quotes the danish radio news on Dec 9, 1992.

  Den nye laegevagt paa Fyn har maattet erkende, at systemet ikke var
  saa velfungerende som laegerne haevdede. Paa trods af gentagne klager
  fra patienter over lange ventetider paa telefonen, haevdede
  laegevagtens ansatte at ingen havde ventet i mere en ti minutter. I
  gaar kom det saa frem, at edb-registreringen ikke kunne registrere
  ventetider laenger end de ti minutter! Laegerne stolede blindt paa
  udstyr, som slet ikke var beregnet til at registrere ventetid, ifoelge
  Fyns Telefon. Laegevagtens leder, Per Holm Pedersen, har givet
  fynboerne en 'uforbeholden undskyldning'. [DR, onsdag]

 |A couple of items in RISKS touched upon computer systems and technology
 |affecting people's behaviour and causing changes in our society.  There is 
 |a risk that some changes may be undesirable and unintended.

When I was a supervisor in a large phone-in technical support operation (a few
years back now), we introduced a metrics program that recorded a number of
statistics about the calls the techicians were processing. Two of those
statistics were "Available Time" (time spent being available to take calls,
even if there were no calls coming to your phone) and time per call.  One of
the other managers decided to set minimum standards for all of the metrics.
So, an enterprising tech wrote a program on a PC to dial home (where no one
was there to answer the phone), wait some random time and then hang up and
dial again.  Until we caught on, that person's statistics were the best in the
group; and the others in the group (who knew what was going on) were
grumbling. Fortunately, we caught it before permanent damage (i.e., a changed
performance rating or some sort of salary adjustment) was done.

According to the Associated Press today, officials in South Korea decided to
use the abacus to tabulate 24 million votes in Friday's presidential
elections.  The abacus was used to avoid a recurrence of charges in the 1987
presidential race that the computer count was electronically manipulated.  The
Central Election Management Committee employed about 300 abacus experts to
oversee the counting.

It's curious that these people find manual manipuation -- an unnecessary
backformation, since manipulation MEANS movement by hand -- of an election to
be preferable to electronic manipulation.

     A story in the Washington Post on 7 Dec 92 entitled "Va. Book Vendor
Rescued from a Storied Ending" ended with lessons in both safety in the
library and computer security. The following is a summary of that article:

     Mike Keck was nearly buried alive in his Alexandria Virginia bookstore,
From Out of the Past. Mike was working in the "aviation" section when a metal
shelf attached to a wall came "flying" loose, tipped over and started a domino
effect that quickly toppled almost one million magazines. "As I fell, I
twisted to protect myself; the twisting broke the socket of my hip." His wife,
Barbara said, "Once it started, there was no stopping it. All the racks gave
way". The rescue squad had to use a torch to cut away the twisted metal that
was trapping Mike.

     Barbara also said "I videotaped it ... for insurance purposes.  Right now
the computer doesn't look like it was damaged. ALL MY INVENTORY IS IN IT, AND
I HOPE IT WILL BE OK."

     I was struck by this thought: would that be a MILLION records?  Wouldn't
some offsite backup be appropriate?

   WASHINGTON (AP, 15 Dec 92)
   The Navy on Tuesday canceled $835 million worth of contracts for an
electronic radar-jamming system criticized for years inside the Pentagon and
on Capitol Hill.  The Airborne Self-Protection Jammer was being developed by
the Navy for a variety of carrier-based warplanes, such as the F-14, F/A-18
and the E/A-6.  The Pentagon had spent more than 15 years and $1.5 billion to
develop the system. It had ordered 136 of the devices, which were supposed to
confuse enemy surface-to-air missile radars.  But the system, which was being
developed by a number of firms, never passed its flight tests.  At one point,
the Navy acknowledged that testing standards on the system had been relaxed,
but the system was unable to meet even the lowered standards.  Over the years,
the jammer became a symbol of weapons kept in development before the bugs were
ironed out.
   In its statement, the Navy said, "The decision to terminate ...  was made
because it was determined in operational testing that the system was not
operationally effective and not operationally suitable."  The Navy said it was
canceling nine production contracts with: Consolidated Electronic
Countermeasures, which is composed of I.T.T.  of Nutley N.J., and Westinghouse
of Baltimore., Md.; I.T.T. and Westinghouse, operating separately;
Westinghouse Electronic Systems Co., (Welsco) of Baltimore, Md., and Smith
Industries of Florham Park, N.J.  ...
   Earlier this year, Sens. David Pryor, D.-Ark., and William V. Roth Jr.,
R-Del., charged that the Pentagon had manipulated its testing data to minimize
the system's problems, but the Navy promised it would apply toughened
standards.

A number of advocacy groups have recently been involved in efforts to make
public information, for example from the Congress, available electronically.
One of the reasons frequently cited for such efforts is the desire for open
government.  This notion of open government is normally opposed to a set of
images of behind-closed-doors government in which politicians cut deals with
cigar-smoking lobbyists.  Although open government is a good thing in the
abstract, I wonder if many of the motivations for it are misplaced, leading to
false solutions to deeper problems.  As evidence for this possibility, I would
cite the following article:

Robert L. Heath, Working through trade associations and public information
organizations, in Robert L. Heath, ed, Strategic Issues Management: How
Organizations Influence and Respond to Public Interests and Policies, San
Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1988.

This is a brief description of NAMNET, a computer network that has been
operated by the National Association of Manufacturers since 1987.  NAM, of
course, has long been famous for its aggressive and well-funded lobbying on
issues such as labor organizing and workplace health and safety regulations.
(It opposes these things.)  Among the many features of NAMNET is software
support for what has become known in business as "grassroots lobbying", in
which a special interest with substantial infrastructure (whether in-house or
contracted from commercial firms) mobilizes its allies in a highly selective
and focused way on very short notice to influence the proceedings of, for
example, a legislature.

Now, some people argue that electronic open government will level the
playing field by giving The People access to the same information as special
interests.  But maybe it doesn't work that way.  Techniques like NAM's 
(and others, such as direct mail techniques based on the application of
massive computing power to databases of personal information) have brought
a quiet revolution to the day-to-day conduct of politics.  Far from being 
run behind closed doors, information technology now allows politics to be
conducted through the rapid, top-down, real-time mobilization of massive
"constituencies".  And these methods quickly come down to money: it is now
entirely feasible to purchase a precise, measurable amount of pressure on any
given issue on any Senator of your choice.  The more money you have, the more
pressure you can buy.  (For more of this, see Wm. Greider's book "Who Will
Tell the People?")

So how about it?  If we wish to strengthen democracy, should we welcome
electronic "open government" or oppose it?  What alternative models of
information technology's relationship to government would be less amenable 
to high-powered manipulation and more amenable to the electronic cultures
within which we might reinvent democracy?

       PLEASE CIRCULATE THIS WHEREVER YOU FEEL IT IS APPROPRIATE
              BUT ONLY WHERE YOU FEEL IT IS APPROPRIATE

      AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE YOUR SAY ABOUT COMPUTING IN THE FUTURE

This is Gary Chapman, director of the Cambridge, Massachusetts, office 
of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility.  I edit The CPSR 
Newsletter, a quarterly publication that goes to all CPSR members and 
about 400 other people, including a lot of policymakers, members of 
Congress, administration officials, etc.  

We're going to try something unusual for the next CPSR Newsletter, and 
I'm putting out a call for help.  We're going to publish a special issue
 on "What the Clinton Administration Can Do For The Computing Profession
 and the Public."  I'm sending out this message to ask people to send me
 SHORT contributions to this issue, just brief comments about what the 
new administration can do to help support computing in the United 
States, or perhaps the world.  

Here are a few basic guidelines for these submissions:

1.  SHORT MEANS SHORT -- In order to publish as many of these as we can,
 we need to keep each contribution to about 100-150 words, max, one or 
two paragraphs.  In fact, anything longer will probably be eliminated 
out of fairness to others.

2.  YOU MUST IDENTIFY YOURSELF -- Again, briefly, with just your name 
and one line that says something about you, such as Joe Blow or Sally 
Smith, Programmer, BillyBob Corporation, or Centerville, Ohio, or 
something like that, whatever you prefer.

3.  ADDRESS ISSUES OF PUBLIC POLICY -- In order to make these 
contributions relevant to the Clinton administration, they should 
concern issues about which government can or should do something, or 
stop doing, whatever.  These include major issues such as privacy, 
access to information, computer networks like the Internet or NREN, R&amp;D 
priorities, equitable access to computers, intellectual property, 
defense policy, risks to the public, etc.  We're not really interested 
in contributions that are self-serving, parochial, excessively arcane or
 trivial, belligerently and unconstructively critical, and so on.  We 
will favor messages that discuss the intersection of computing and major
 issues of concern to the public at large.

4.  PLEASE INCLUDE A WORKABLE E-MAIL ADDRESS -- In case I have to get 
back to you about the text.  We won't publish e-mail addresses, I 
promise.

5.  GET ALL CONTRIBUTIONS TO ME BY JANUARY 15, 1993.  My e-mail address 
is chapman@silver.lcs.mit.edu.

This is not limited to people in the United States, although overseas 
contributors will have to make a case for what the Clinton 
administration should do to help international computing -- the focus 
will be on U.S. government  policy.

We're going to try and get this issue into the hands of the key players 
on computing and high tech policy in the new administration.  For the 
most part we already know who those people are, and we're talking to 
them about the issues that CPSR is working on.  This newsletter will 
give them a good impression, we hope, of the concerns of the computing 
profession and people who use computer networks.  Consider this an 
opportunity for a kind of "hard copy" town hall.

Thanks for your help!  Get those messages coming!

Around 7pm on 27 December 1992, the new San Joaquin (California) County Jail
computer system automagically unlocked all of the cell doors in a high-risk
area, with a highly audible series of loud clicks, releasing about 120
potentially dangerous inmates who were being held in an "administrative
segregation pod."  Fortunately, the pod was itself isolated by other doors
that remained locked.  The glitch was attributed to a spurious signal from the
"incoder card" whose responsibilities include opening those doors in
emergencies.  [Source: San Francisco Chronicle, 30 Dec 1992, p.A14, article by
Peter Fimrite] 

Fimrite's article also noted other California cell-door problems.  Less than a
year after the supposedly escape-proof Pelican Bay State Prison near Crescent
City CA opened, inmates learned how to pop open the pneumatic cell doors at
will.  A similar system in the Santa Rita Jail in Alameda County was also
found to be pickable.  [If it had required breaking DES, that situation might
have been DES-pickable!]

For those of you new to RISKS (or in case Fimrite or his Chron colleages see
this in RISKS), our archives include the following computer-related cases.
(Rather than grep-ing through the back issues, I give references to back
issues of the ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes, containing material
derived from the earlier issues of RISKS.  S 10 1 is dated Jan 84, S 12 4 is
Oct 87, S 13 4 is Oct 88, S 17 1 is Jan 92.)

The Washington Post has an article by John Burgess (at least some of which
appears in today's San Francisco Chronicle) discussing a federal judge's order
to McAfee Associates of Santa Clara CA, to stop distributing their Pro-Scan
Version 2.31 and ViruCide Version 2.33 and derivative products.  Imageline
Inc. of Richmond VA (maker of PicturePak and ValuePak) has sued McAfee
Associates for libel, fraud, and other misdeeds, because those antiviral
products mistakenly identify Imageline products as containing viruses.  Stay

In the first half of this year the chemical factory Cindu exploded causing
several deaths and a chaos. It was confirmed yesterday that a simple typing
error led to this tragic accident. Apparently the computerised chemical
processing installation was fed with data in which a comma was placed at a
wrong digit, causing the wrong amount of chemicals to be mixed in the
installation. This led to an enormous explosion and the closure of the
factory.

The Dutch news said that the responsible person has been found and he
will be charged with negligible conduct causing death.

BTW: This year has been disaster-year for the Netherlands. We have had 2
serious plane crashes: the well-known El al 747 that crashed into two
apartment buildings, the DC10 with 300 Dutchmen aboard that crashed in Faro
this week. We had the Cindu explosion, an earthquake (yes, in Holland) 2 major
train-accidents, and quite a few lesser accidents. I hope the next year will
have some mercy on us :-)

I assume you have already been inundated with the issue of the woman
who was murdered by (her ex-husband I believe) here in Boston. It
seems she dialed 911 when she heard him at the door but unfortunately
her exchange was a Brookline exchange (a neighboring township a few
blocks away, not politically part of Boston), so the 911 call went to
the Brookline Police. On hearing her address the Brookline police
informed her she needed to call the Boston Police.

I am not certain of the exact details of what ensued (I'm not sure
anyone outside of the Police departments is certain yet), the
Brookline police claim the delay would not have made any difference in
the outcome (her murder), but of course that's a fairly convenient
position for them to take.

This has been a front-page story in the Boston Globe these last few days.
Makes one want to pick up their phone and dial 911 and see exactly who you get
and ask whether they would actually come should you need them.

In the past we have tried to control information collected by "Big Brother" or
the Federal Government.  I believe that this has for the most part been
accomplished.  What has not been done, and what seriously needs to be
addressed is the collection and dissemination of information by numerous
"Little Brothers."  Specifically, additional guidance is needed to protect
information maintained by credit reporting agencies, State Government
agencies, retail stores, and other entities which routinely collect
information that can be linked to an individual by name or other unique
identifier.

Since I teach a computer security class at a local college, the issue of
privacy seems even more important once you know how many ways the information
can be compromised.  After a lecture on privacy one of my students mentioned
that he worked with some private investigators, and he mentioned that they
routinely had access to all kinds of information on people, and that agencies
such as the state department of motor vehicles routinely sold access to their
records to just about anyone.

To illustrate the problem I asked the student to initiate an inquiry and to
see what he could find out with only my name as information.  The next class
he brought me the results of his spending about 30 minutes at a computer
terminal.  Here is a partial list of what he provided me in printed form: my
current address, the addresses of all my previous residences, a list of all of
the automobiles I have ever owned, my social security number, my drivers
license number, a list of all of the credit cards I have ever owned including
cancelled cards, their credit limits, the credit card numbers, and the current
balance, the name and address of my employer, my father and brother's name and
address, the name of my wife, the name address and phone numbers of all of my
neighbors, their date of residence, and the type of home they had, my criminal
record (blank) along with any pending cases, my traffic record (not blank
unfortunately!  :-)), my race, my income, the amount of my mortgage, my credit
rating, etc.  I imagine that most people have no idea that such information
about them is so easily accessible.  Imagine the potential for coming up with
a detailed profile of a person once you begin associating individuals to the
groceries they buy if the current trend of using check cashing cards or
bank-cards to pay for groceries really catches on!  For example, could you
imagine who might want to have access to lists of customers which bought
specific products?  Giant supermarkets (a large chain in our area) already has
the computer printing out coupons based on the purchases you have made, what
would they do with this information if they could associate you with the
groceries you bought?  One could imagine the following phone call after
purchasing a bladder control product: "Yes, Mr. Seborg, this is the office of
Dr. Nosey, Urologist, we are offering five dollars off your initial
consultation, when can we schedule you for your first appointment?"  Or worse,
you could have someone inferring some personal profile based on your patterns
of consumption.  Far fetched, maybe, but I bet you may think before you use
that bank card, or check cashing card next time at the grocery store, eh?

&gt;Now, some people argue that electronic open government will level the
&gt;playing field by giving The People access to the same information as special
&gt;interests.  But maybe it doesn't work that way. ....

Agre then goes on to ask if we should welcome or oppose electronic "open
government" if our primary interest is in strengthening democracy.

I agree that there are many pitfalls related to the question of electronic
democracy as it is usually described.  The one that I find most disturbing is
the question of access.  Users of the net tend to be white males from a
certain age group and socio-economic class.  There are very few
representatives of the impoverished underclass on the net, and women are very
much underrepresented.  Also underrepresented are old people and very young
people.  If we were to increase access to government for users of the net, we
would be increasing access for a relatively prosperous, well educated, and
successful group, at the expense of much of the rest of the country.  This is
not a healthy situation for a democracy.

There is a serious risk of disenfranchisement contained within the standard
description of electronic democracy.  While this may not be the sort of risk
usually discussed in this forum, it is nonetheless significant, and it is
possible only because of computers.

GTECH, the company which got the mysteriously beneficial contract change
indemnifying them from operational goofs is in the news big time here in
Maryland.

It seems that allofasudden/outoftheblue they were awarded a contract for Keno
which was a total surprise to all, including the state legislature. The
no-bid award was justified due to a "fiscal emergency".

The earlier report is only the half story.  The president of the German
Bundestag has a new priority button that switches off all microphones except
his own.  After resuming the debates in the new building, Johnny Klein put a
heavy book on the button and didn't notice the effect.  Security personal
prevented technicians from entering the Bundestag.  Then the parliament
decided to move back to his old building, which incidentally is controlled by
the same (working!) computer.  (See the German newspaper, Die Zeit, "Johnny
griff daneben", for details.)

Hmm, seems I recall seeing this problem demonstrated at length in the mid
1960's.  Didn't Don Adams and Barbara Feldon (and Edward Platt) repeatedly run
into problems of this sort when using the "Cone of Silence" over at
"Control"?

Since the show was a continuing news documentary describing actions of spy
agencies, one would have thought that if anyone had studied it intensly, it
would have been the (then) East and West Germans...

(A quick note to our younger crowd: The television show in question was "Get
Smart," which was kind of a spoof on the entire spy genre.  It is currently in
syndication throughout the United States, and quite a few other countries as
well).

As I was paying for some magazines at a local bookstore today, I happened to
notice two interesting bulletins to store owners - passed on to the people
minding the cash registers - about the latest in credit card fraud.  There
are two closely related frauds involved:

    1.  Credit cards with their magnetic stripes re-recorded with a
	different, but valid, account number.  Since these days
	pretty much the entire system runs on what is read off
	the magnetic stripe, with a complete receipt printed for
	you without a need to emboss anything from the original
	card, this is a great way to charge things to someone else.

	Their recommendation:  Cross-check the information embossed on
	the card with the information printed on the receipt.  There's
	a reward offered to anyone who finds a "magnetically forged"
	card this way.  In practice, don't bet the ranch.  It's hard
	enough to find anyone who bothers to check the signature any
	more; how many people will bother to check long strings of
	digits?  It's worth keeping in mind that unless the card IS
	checked, there is no good way to prove, or even reliably
	detect, the fraud later:  The only information in the system
	is what came off the magnetic stripe.  (Well, you do have the
	signature - but do stores even bother to keep all those
	signed, printed receipts?  Finding any particular one would
	be a horrible job.)

    2.  Someone has apparently gone into business creating fake credit
	cards with valid (stolen) credit card numbers on them.  They
	are currently easily detectable because they all bear the
	name of some particular non-existent bank.  If the creator
	had thought about this a bit, he would have created fake
	Citibank or AT&amp;T cards - even if it were hard to get them to
	look *exactly* like the real ones, they'd still be much, much
	harder to detect than cards "issued" by a specific "First
	Federal of Oshkosh", which since it doesn't exists has issued
	NO real cards.  (I hope I haven't given anyone a new idea.)

The potential losses here are staggering.  I don't know who ends up stuck with
the immediate bill for these losses - certainly not the owner of the valid,
stolen credit card (though proving that a fraud has taken place could be time
consuming and painful), most likely not the retailer (after all, he DID get a
"valid card/good transaction" response from whatever agency he checks with).
There should be some interesting finger-pointing between the issuing banks and
the transaction approving agencies.

In the end, of course, we all end up paying.  Check your monthly bills
carefully!

Here in the Bay Area, there has been a rash of carjacking crimes.  In San
Francisco alone, there have been around 60 carjackings in the past six months
or so.  Several people have been injured when resisting a carjacker - the
latest being a young man who was shot in the head on Christmas Eve when he
wouldn't give up his car.  The police recommend that drivers should give up
their cars to would-be car-jackers, since a life is more valuable than a car.

Naturally, Silicon Valley has been working on the problem, the first
solution being a remote-controlled ignition kill switch, operated from a fob
such as those used with active car alarms.  One of our local stations had a
blurb about the latest innovation, which uses pager technology to allow a
car owner to dial a 1-800 number, triggering a pager-like satellite signal
which causes a particular car to kill its ignition.  This way, car owners
can calmly let a carjacker escape with the vehicle, then walk to the nearest
telephone and stop the car in its tracks.

I thought this was a rather clever use of technology, so I gleefully told one
of my house-mates about it.  His reaction was "gee Jim, now I can hassle you
without ever leaving the house".  This kind of stopped me in my tracks, and
after having thought about it a bit, a number of risks seem evident.
Basically, any kind of "wrong number" risk can potentially create a serious
traffic hazard, as well as resulting in personal annoyance (depending on the
mechanism used to re-allow ignition - especially when the user doesn't have a
car-phone).  You've then got yet another number that you must guard as closely
as an ATM code, but which contains significantly more digits to remember (the
1-800 number plus a password-like code), and keeping track of that while
keeping it away from others is hard.  Plus, a single fault at a pager company
can cause large-scale regional traffic disruptions (if the device becomes
popular, which it probably will).

        The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has
adopted international Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems.  The
Guidelines are intended to raise awareness of the risks in the use of
information systems and to establish a policy framework to address public
concerns.

       The OECD Security Guidelines should be of special interest to RISKS
readers.  They are similar in form to the 1980 OECD Privacy Guidelines and
will probably have a substantial impact on security policy.

      Of course, there are lots of issues left open by the Guidelines,
including the relationship between privacy and security.  But the principles
offer a good starting point for public discussion on security and
risks-related issues.

        A copy of the press release and an excerpt from the Guidelines
follows.  For additional information or for a copy of the Guidelines, contact
Ms. Deborah Hurley, OECD, 2, rue Andre-Pascal, 75775 Paris Cedex 16, France

Group on Information System Security           rotenberg@washoc.cpsr.org

=============================================================

         OECD ADOPTS GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURITY OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

        The 24 OECD Member countries on 26th November 1992 adopted Guidelines
for the Security of Information Systems, culminating almost two years' work by
an OECD expert group composed of governmental delegates, scholars in the
fields of law, mathematics and computer science, and representatives of the
private sector, including computer and communication goods and services
providers and users.

        The term information systems includes computers, communication
facilities, computer and communication networks and the information that they
process.  These systems play an increasingly significant and pervasive role in
a multitude of activities, including national economies, international trade,
government and business operation, health care, energy, transport,
communications and education.

        Security of information systems means the protection of the
availability, integrity, and confidentiality of information systems.  It is an
international issue because information systems frequently cross national
boundaries.

        While growing use of information systems has generated many benefits,
it has also shown up a widening gap between the need to protect systems and
the degree of protection currently in place.  Society has become very
dependent on technologies that are not yet sufficiently dependable.  All
individuals and organizations have a need for proper information system
operations (e.g. in hospitals, air traffic control and nuclear power plants).

        Users must have confidence that information systems will be available
and operate as expected without unanticipated failures or problems.
Otherwise, the systems and their underlying technologies may not be used to
their full potential and further growth and innovation may be prohibited.

        The Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems will provide
the required foundation on which to construct a framework for security of
information systems.  They are addressed to the public and private sectors and
apply to all information systems.  The framework will include policies, laws,
codes of conduct, technical measures, management and user practices, ad public
education and awareness activities at both national and international levels.

        Several OECD Member countries have been forerunners in the field of
security of information systems.  Certain laws and organizational and
technical rules are already in place.  Most other countries are much farther
behind in their efforts.  The Guidelines will play a normative role and assist
governments and the private sector in meeting the challenges of these
worldwide systems.  The Guidelines bring guidance and a real value-added to
work in this area, from a national and international perspective.


PRINCIPLES

1. Accountability Principle

        The responsibilities and accountability of owners, providers and users
of information systems and other parties concerned with the security of
information systems should be explicit.

2.  Awareness Principle

        In order to foster confidence in information systems, owners,
providers and users of information systems and other parties should readily be
able, consistent with maintaining security, to gain appropriate knowledge of
and be informed about the existence and general extent of measures, practices
and procedures for the security of information systems.

3. Ethics Principle

        Information systems and the security of information systems should be
provided and used in such a manner that the rights and legitimate interests of
others are respected.

4. Multidisciplinary Principle

        Measures practices and procedures for the security of information
systems should take into account of and address all relevant consideration and
viewpoints, including technical, administrative, organizational, operational,
commercial, educational and legal.

5.  Proportionality Principle

        Security levels, costs, measures, practices and procedures should be
appropriate and proportionate to the value of and degree of reliance on the
information systems and to the severity, probability and extent of potential
harm, as the requirements for security vary depending upon the particular
information systems.

6. Integration Principle

        Measures, practices and procedures for the security of information
systems should be co-ordinated and integrated with each other and with other
measures, practices and procedures of the organization so as to create a
coherent system of security.

7. Timeliness Principle

        Public and private parties, at both national and international
levels, should act in a timely co-ordinated manner to prevent and to respond
to breaches of information systems.

8.  Reassessment Principle

        The security information systems should be reassessed periodically,
as information systems and the requirements for their security vary over time.

9. Democracy Principle

        The security of information systems should be compatible with the
legitimate use and flow of data ad information in a democratic society.

SCOPE:

The advance of computer and telecommunications technologies holds great 
promise for individuals and society. From convenience for consumers and 
efficiency in commerce to improved public health and safety and 
increased participation in democratic institutions, these technologies 
can fundamentally transform our lives.

At the same time these technologies pose threats to the ideals of a free 
and open society. Personal privacy is increasingly at risk from invasion 
by high-tech surveillance and eavesdropping. The myriad databases 
containing personal information maintained in the public and private 
sectors expose private life to constant scrutiny.

Technological advances also enable new forms of illegal activity, posing 
new problems for legal and law enforcement officials and challenging the 
very definitions of crime and civil liberties. But technologies used to 
combat these crimes can pose new threats to freedom and privacy.

Even such fundamental notions as speech, assembly and property are being 
transformed by these technologies, throwing into question the basic 
Constitutional protections that have guarded them. Similarly, 
information knows no borders; as the scope of economies becomes global 
and as networked communities transcend international boundaries, ways 
must be found to reconcile competing political, social and economic 
interests in the digital domain.

The Third Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy will assemble 
experts, advocates and interested people from a broad spectrum of 
disciplines and backgrounds in a balanced public forum to address the 
impact of computer and telecommunications technologies on freedom and 
privacy in society. Participants will include people from the fields of 
computer science, law, business, research, information, library science, 
health, public policy, government, law enforcement, public advocacy and 
many others.

Pre-Conference Tutorials:
On Tuesday 9 March, the day before the formal conference begins, CFP'93
is offering a number of in-depth tutorials on a wide variety of subjects
on four parallel tracks. These presentations will range from interesting
and informative to thought-provoking and controversial. The tutorials
are available at a nominal additional registration cost.

Conference Reception:
Following the Tutorials on Tuesday evening, you are invited to meet new 
and old friends and colleagues at an opening reception. 

Single Track Main Program:
The technological revolution that is driving change in our society has
many facets and we are often unaware of the way they all fit together,
especially the parts that lie outside of our own expertise and interest.
The primary goal of CFP'93 is to bring together individuals from
disparate disciplines and backgrounds, and engage them in a balanced
discussion of all CFP issues. To this end our main program, starting on
Wednesday 10 March, is on a single track enabling our attendees to take
part in all sessions.

Registration is Limited:
CFP'93 registration will be limited to 550 attendees, so we advise you 
to register as early as possible and take advantage of the early 
registration discounts.

Luncheons and Banquets:
A key component of the CFP conferences has been the interaction between
the diverse communities that constitute our attendees. To promote this
interaction CFP'93 is providing three luncheons and evening two banquets
with the cost of conference registration.

EFF Pioneer Awards
All conference attendees are invited to the Awards Reception sponsored 
by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) on Wednesday evening, 10 
March. These, the second annual EFF Pioneer Awards, will be given to 
individuals and organizations that have made distinguished contributions 
to the human and technological realms touched by computer-based 
communications.

Birds of a Feather Sessions:
CFP'93 will provide a limited number of meeting rooms to interested 
individuals for special Birds of a Feather sessions after the formal 
program each evening. These sessions will provide an opportunity for 
special interest discussions that were not included in the formal 
program and will be listed in the conference materials. For further

CFP'93 Featured Speakers:

Nicholas Johnson 

Nicholas Johnson was appointed head of the Federal Communications 
Commission by President Johnson in 1966, serving a seven year term. In 
his role as commissioner, he quickly became an outspoken consumer 
advocate, attacking network abuses and insisting that those who use the 
frequencies under the FCC license are the public's trustees. He has been

CFP'93 Tutorials:

Tuesday 9 March - Morning Tutorials

Information Use in the Private Sector
Jack Reed, Information Resource Service Company
Diane Terry, TransUnion Corp.    Dan Jones, D.Y. Jones &amp; Assoc.

This tutorial will deal with the use of personal information from the
point of view of some private sector information vendors and users. It
will include a discussion of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the
"Permissible Purposes" for obtaining a consumer credit report.
Information used for purposes outside the FCRA will be discussed in
relationship to privacy and societal needs for businesses and
individuals.

Access to Government Information:
James Love, Director, Taxpayer Assets Project

The tutorial will examine a wide range of problems concerning citizen 
access to government information, including how to ask for and receive 
information under the federal Freedom of Information Act, what types of 
information government agencies store on computers, what the barriers 
are to citizen access to these information resources, and how citizens 
can change government information policy to expand access to taxpayer-
funded information resources.

Exploring the Internet -- a guided journey
Mark Graham, Pandora Systems	Tim Pozar, Late Night Software

This tutorial will give participants a practical introduction to the 
most popular and powerful applications available via the world's largest 
computer network, the Internet.  There will be hands-on demonstrations 
of communications tools such as e-mail, conferencing, Internet Relay 
Chat, and resource discovery and navigation aids such as Gopher, WAIS, 
Archie and World Wide Web. Extensive documentation will be provided.

Constitutional Law for Non-lawyers (1/2 session):
Mike Godwin, Staff Counsel, Electronic Frontier Foundation

This tutorial is designed to inform non-lawyers about the Constitutional 
issues that underlie computer-crime and computer civil-liberties cases.  
The tutorial focuses on the First and Fourth Amendments, but includes a 
discussion of the Fifth Amendment and its possible connection to the 
compelled disclosure of cryptographic keys. It also includes a 
discussion of the appropriateness of "original intent" as a method for 
applying the Constitution in the modern era.

Civil Liberties Implications of Computer Searches &amp; Seizures (1/2 ses.):
Mike Godwin, Staff Counsel, Electronic Frontier Foundation

This tutorial assumes only a very basic knowledge of Constitutional law 
(the prior tutorial provides an adequate background), and outlines how 
searches and seizures of computers may raise issues of First and Fourth 
Amendment rights, as well as of federal statutory protections. It 
includes a discussion of what proper search-and-seizure techniques in 
such cases may be. 

Tuesday 9 March - Afternoon Tutorials

Practical Data Inferencing: What we THINK we know about you.
Russell L. Brand, Senior Computer Scientist, Reasoning Systems

What do your transaction trails reveal about you?  Are you a good risk 
to insure?  Are you worth kidnapping, auditing or suing?  Which products 
should I target at you?  Are you a member of one of those groups that I 
would want to harass or discriminate against? This tutorial will be a 
hands-on approach to digging for data and to piecing it back together.  
Time will be divided between malicious personal invasions and sweeping 
searches that seek only profit, followed by a brief discussion about 
improper inferences and their practical impact on innocent files and 
lives. Legal and moral issues will not be addressed.

Telecommunications Fraud
Donald P. Delaney, Senior Investigator, New York State Police

Illegal call sell operations in New York City are estimated to be a 
billion dollar industry. This tutorial will provide an overview of the 
problem, from finger hacking to pay phone enterprises, and will include 
an up-to-date assessment of the computer cracker/hacker/phone phreak 
impact on telephone company customer losses. Also discussed will be 
unlawful access of telephone company switches; unlawful wiretapping and 
monitoring; cards, codes and 950 numbers; New York State law and police 
enforcement; methods of investigation and case studies.

Private Sector Marketplace and Workplace Privacy 
Ernest A. Kallman, Bentley College, H. Jeff Smith, Georgetown University

This tutorial will give participants a general overview of privacy 
issues affecting uses of personal information (e.g., medical 
information, financial information, purchase histories) in the 
marketplace as well as privacy concerns in the workplace (e.g., privacy 
of electronic and voice mail, work monitoring).  The tutorial will also 
set the boundaries for privacy arguments in the middle and latter 1990s.

SysLaw
Lance Rose, Attorney and Author "SysLaw"

The SysLaw tutorial session will explore in depth the freedom and
privacy issues encountered by computer bulletin boards (BBS), their
system operators and their users.  BBSs are estimated to number over
45,000 today (not counting corporate systems), and range from small,
spare-time hobby systems to systems with thousands of users, grossing
millions of dollars.  BBSs are a grassroots movement with an entry cost
of $1,000 or less, and the primary vehicles for new forms of electronic
communities and services. Subjects covered will include: First Amendment
protection for the BBS as publisher/distributor; data freedom and
property rights on the BBS; how far can sysops control BBS user
activities?; and user privacy on BBSs today.

Note: Tutorial presenters will offer expert opinions and information.
Some may advocate particular viewpoints and thus may put their own
"spin" on the issues. Caveat Listener. 

====

CFP'93 Main Program Sessions: 

Wednesday 10 March

Electronic Democracy
Chair - Jim Warren, MicroTimes and Autodesk, Inc.

The effects of computer and telecommunications technologies on 
democratic processes and institutions are increasing dramatically. This 
session will explore their impacts on political organizing, campaigning, 
access to representatives and agencies, and access to government 
information that is essential for a free press and an informed 
electorate.

Electronic Voting -- Threats to Democracy
Chair - Rebecca Mercuri, University of Pennsylvania

This panel session will invite representatives covering a broad spectrum 
of involvement with the controversial subject of electronic vote 
tallying to address such issues as: Is a secure and reliable electronic 
voting system feasible? What threats to these systems are identifiable? 
Should electronic voting systems be open for thorough examination? Can 
auditability be assured in an anonymous ballot setting? Can voting by 
phone be practical and confidential? Did Congress exempt voting machines 
from the Computer Security Act?

Censorship and Free Speech on the Networks
Chair - Barbara Simons, IBM

As online forums become increasingly pervasive, the notion of "community 
standards" becomes harder to pin down. Networks and BBSs will link--or 
create--diverse, non-geographic communities with differing standards, 
laws, customs and mores. What may be frank discussion in one forum may 
be obscenity or defamation or sexual harassment in another. This session 
will explore the questions of what kinds of freedom-of-speech problems 
face us on the Net and what kinds of legal and social solutions we need.

Portrait of the Artist on the Net
Chair - Anna Couey, Arts Wire

Computer forums and networks make possible both new artforms and new 
ways of remote collaboration and exhibition. The growth of the Net 
creates opportunities for the blossoming of dynamic and interactive 
artforms and of artistic cultures -- provided that networks become 
widely accessible and remain open to artistic expression without 
political interference. This session will examine the potentials and the 
problems of art and artists on the Net.

Thursday 11 March

Digital Telephony and Crypto Policy
Chair - John Podesta, Podesta and Associates

The increasingly digital nature of telecommunications potentially 
threatens the ability of law enforcement agencies to intercept them when 
legally authorized to do so. In addition, the potential widespread use 
of cryptography may render the ability to intercept a communication 
moot. This session will examine these issues and the proposals that 
have been put before Congress by law enforcement agencies to address 
these perceived problems.

Health Records and Confidentiality
Chair - Janlori Goldman, American Civil Liberties Union

As the new Administration and Congress consider proposals to reform the 
United States health care system, it is imperative that confidentiality 
and security safeguards be put in place to protect personal information. 
Currently, no comprehensive legislation exists on the confidentiality of 
health information. This session will explore the current and potential 
uses of health care information, and proposals to safeguard the 
information.

The Many Faces of Privacy
Chair  - Willis Ware, Rand Corp.

Privacy at any cost is foolish, unwise and an untenable position, and 
privacy at zero cost is a myth. This two-part session will explore the 
balancing act between the two extremes and the costs and benefits that 
accrue. The first part will present several examples of systems and 
applications in the public and private sectors that stake out a position 
in this continuum.   The second part will be a panel discussion 
exploring the issues raised by the examples previously presented.

The Digital Individual
Chair - Max Nelson-Kilger, San Jose State University

We are all represented by personal records in countless databases. As 
these records are accumulated, disseminated and coalesced, each of us is 
shadowed by an ever larger and more detailed data alter-ego, which 
increasingly stands in for us in many situations without our permission 
or even awareness. How does this happen? How does it affect us? How will 
it develop in the future? What can we do? This session will investigate 
these questions.

Friday 12 March

Gender Issues in Computing and Telecommunications
Chair - Judi Clark, Bay Area Women in Telecommunications

Online environments are largely determined by the viewpoints of their
users and programmers, still predominantly white men. This panel will
discuss issues of freedom and privacy that tend to affect women -- such
as access, identity, harassment, pornography and online behavior -- and
provide recommendations for gender equity policies to bulletin board
operators and system administrators.

The Hand That Wields the Gavel
Chair - Don Ingraham, Asst. District Attorney, Alameda County, CA

An inevitable result of the settlement of Cyberspace is the adaptation
of the law to its particular effects. In this session  a panel of
criminal lawyers addresses the fallout from a hypothetical computer
virus on the legal responsibilities of system managers and operators.
The format will be a simulated court hearing. Attendees will act as
advisory jurors in questioning and in rendering a verdict.

The Power, Politics, and Promise of Internetworking
Chair- Jerry Berman, Electronic Frontier Foundation

This session will explore the development of internetworking 
infrastructures, domestically and worldwide. How will this 
infrastructure and its applications be used by the general public?  What 
will the global network look like to the average user from Kansas to 
Kiev?  How will politics, technology and legislation influence the 
access to, and cost of, the Net?  How can the potential of this powerful 
medium be fully realized?

International Data Flow
Chair - George Trubow, John Marshall Law School

The trans-border flow of information on international computer networks 
has been a concern for governments and the private sector. In addition 
to concerns for privacy and data security, the economic and national 
security implications of this free flow of information among scientists, 
engineers and researchers around the world are also cause for concern. 
This session will assemble a number of speakers to compare the various 
perspectives on the problem.

The following extract from Douglas Adams' latest book* contain a lesson 
for designers of complex systems, particularly computerised ones (e.g., 
fly-by-wire): 

     ... all mechanical or electrical or quantum-mechanical or hydraulic or 
     even wind, steam or piston-driven devices, are now required to

"DISA yaks to FCC on PCS"

Article Summary
Government Computer News, January 4, 1993, Page 38

This is a summary of an article about a technology you've probably never seen,
complained about by an agency you've probably never heard of.

In an article titled "Defense agency wants PCS voice services in public
domain", author S. A. Marud tells how the Defense Information Systems Agency
(DISA) has jumped into the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) inquiry
into the standards to be set on the operation of the startup Personal
Communications Services (PCS) industry.

PCS is a wireless digital technology which operates at 2 gigahertz.  Cellular
is analog.  Also, one advantage of the service is that a number can be
assigned to a person, not to a telephone.

Two groups in DISA, the Federal Wireless Services User Forum (FWSUF) and the
Interagency Cellular Radio Working Group (ICRWG) were the impetus for filing
comments.  They want to be certain that PCS supports at least Group 3 / Group
4 Fax, paging, images, and voice and data encrypted with an STU-III device.
i.e. that a group 3 fax modem should work the same whether it's plugged into a
wall jack or a PCS phone.  PCS should also support dialing "0" for Operator
and 911 for Emergency.  ICRWG wants there to be two nationwide carriers for
PCS, or in the alternative, at least one frequency block reserved nationally
to one carrier and the rest awarded to local carriers.

DISA's concerns on National Security and Emergency Preparedness makes it want
certain basic services (Such as area code 710?) to be part of the new system,
and that at least voice services to be available through the public switched
(read local telco, AT&amp;T, FTS-2000, MCI etc.) network.  The systems should be
made to be interoperable (meaning the phone you use in Dallas should also work
in Kansas City, Chicago, New York and Los Angeles), either from the start or
soon after some industry standards can be developed.  DISA would also prefer
that PCS licenses be issued for large areas if no nationwide carrier(s) are
authorized.

DISA is worried that PCS may be declared to be "private carriers" which means
that the government cannot mandate that they be part of the Telecommunications
Priority System (TSP) which allows the government to seize telephone lines.
TSP was invoked by the federal government for more than 4000 circuits and
services during Hurricane Andrew.

Certain industry groups are watching the rulemaking process on PCS, including
the Wireless Information Network Forum (which represents computer and
communications companies including Apple, AT&amp;T &amp; IBM), Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) (guess who they represent).
CTIA is worried that the FCC might decide that PCS license won't be issued to
a cellular operator in the same area.

A decision on how the PCS industry is to be structured is expected from the
FCC sometime in Fall 1993.

It is this type of oversimplified explanation that encourages
misunderstandings about accidents and how to prevent them and maybe leads to
more and unnecessary accidents in the future.
	 
	 The Dutch news said that the responsible person has been found and he
	 will be charged with negligible conduct causing death.
	 
I certainly hope it is not the poor schnook that was typing and made a
perfectly predictable and inevitable error.  We should not be blaming
accidents on people who do human things and make errors that are inevitable.
Who are they going to put in jail?  The programmer who wrote code that allowed
such a predictable input error to cause a dangerous output?  The person who
wrote the requirements and neglected this?  The chemical engineers who built a
plant that could blow up with one error like that?  The managers who allowed
all this to happen?  What about the regulatory authorities who gave a license
for such a dangerous design?

Actually, everything I've said above could be COMPLETELY WRONG!  Without a
complete investigation, nobody should be talking about the "cause" of an
accident.  Were there interlocks?  If so, why didn't they work?  If not, why
weren't there any?  etc. etc.  There are hundreds of factors that we know
nothing about that could have been the real causes of the accident.

The Bhopal explosion was blamed by Union Carbide as a maintenance error.  But
a complete investigation turned up hundreds of factors that were involved,
most of which go back to poor management.  The maintenance error was probably
the least important (if it actually ever happened, nobody knows, it's just the
explanation that Union Carbide management put forth).  An accident was
inevitable at Bhopal because of all the other factors.  Something else just
would have been the proximate cause, and it sounds like an accident was
inevitable in this case too.  The chemical industry can ignore all the lessons
from Bhopal because it was a "maintenance error."  We are probably going to
hear for years now about the chemical plant that blew up because of a typing
error or computer error (when it may not have had anything very significant to
do with the accident).

The law likes to simplify causes down to one simple event.  But we, as 
scientists and engineers, should require more than this.

In <A HREF="/Risks/14.20.html">RISKS-14.20</A> a contribution on the accident at the chemical factory Cindu
appeared. The information provided was sparse and slightly erroneous. As we
were involved in the accident examination we have more detailed information
which I give here:

FACTS, Database for Industrial Safety Acc.#: 11057 Extended abstract 
Country: NL    Date : 1992 0708

At a chemical factory a heavy explosion occurred which caused the death of 3
firemen of the works fire brigade and injured 11 workers included 4 firemen of
the works fire brigade.  The damage was estimated at several 10th of millions
NL guilders. There was a severely material damage.  The fragments where found
at a distance of 1 km.

The accident started with a typing error in a prescription by a laboratory
worker.  Instead of tank 632 he typed tank 634.  In tank 632 there was stored
resin feed classic (UN-1268) and normally used in the batch process.  In tank
634 DCDP (dicyclopentadiene) was stored.  The operator, who had to check if
the tank contents was equal with the prescription, filled the reactor with the
wrong chemicals.  The batch process started with steam heating via the coil in
the reactor. After temperature was rising, first the operator tried to cool
the reactor with more water of the water mains and later on the works fire
brigade was alarmed to cool the reactor.

An administrator, who checked the prescription every morning, found the error
and tried to contact the operator, but it was too late.  Because the works
fire brigade expected that the contents of the reactor would released via the
safety valve and the bursting disc, they were connecting deluge guns to
prevent spreading of the expected fire. The firemen did not wear the
prescribed personal safety articles, such as hand gloves and breathing
apparatus, because they expected to do a relative, easy job.

After releasing chemicals via the safety valve and the bursting disc, several
seconds later the reactor ruptured, the contents of the reactor released and
an explosion followed.

The local fire brigade was alarmed and together with the works firebrigade,
they tried to prevent the fire to spread to the other installations, such as
cylinders filled with boron trifluoride.  To prevent enormous damage to the
environment due to polluted fire fighting water, it was decided to let the
fire burn out by itself.

RISKS Vol. 14, Issue 20 paraphrased a Washington Post article that appeared in
the San Francisco Chronicle about the temporary restraining order Imageline,
Inc. of Richmond, VA has been granted against McAfee Associates.

McAfee Associates believes the suit to be without merit and will vigorously
defend ourselves against it.  Allow me to share some pertinent facts with you:
 
1.      The temporary restraining order [TRO] applies to our retail
        product, PRO-SCAN, and then only to a particular version of
        it.  This particular version has not been shipped since October
        1991, and has less than 100 registered users.
 
2.      PRO-SCAN accounts for approximately 6% of our sales and less
        than 2% of our licensing activity.  It is essentially provided
        as a convenience for people who do not wish to use a modem to
        download our shareware products.
 
3.      The particular version of PRO-SCAN employs different
        technology then our shareware VIRUSCAN series, e.g., they
        are separate programs.  The TRO in no way effects the main
        product line, which is distributed electronically.
 
In summary, while we intend to vigorously defend ourselves, this litigation is
unlikely to have any impact on our overall business.

Microprocessor design faults
B A Wichmann
National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, Middlesex, TW11 0LW, UK 

Introduction

Modern microprocessors are very reliable. Generally, we take this for
granted and we are therefore not concerned about the possibility of
a chip having a design fault. However, in some applications, and error
could have serious consequences, so that all reasonable precautions must
be taken against such potential errors.

This note makes some proposals which would allow users of critical
applications to protect themselves against such problems in a reasonable
manner.

The problem

Modern microprocessor chips are getting very complex indeed. The current gate
count can exceed 2.5 million. One must therefore expect that new versions of
such chips will contain logical bugs. A common form of bug is in the
microcode, but since the distinction between a microcode fault and another
form of design bug is difficult to define, the distinction is not made here.
We are *not* concerned with fabrication faults.

The price/performance improvements have also been dramatic, which has been
encouraged in a highly competitive market. Of the three attributes,
performance, price and reliability, the issue of reliability comes third for
most users. Hence the commercial market is not in the business of producing
chips without design faults.

Several research projects have been undertaken or proposed to produce a design
which can be formally verified mathematically \cite{viper,veri-micro}.
Unfortunately, it is very difficult for industry to use chips other than those
to commercial designs, due to the investment in compilers and other tools.
Hence it is much more advantageous to provide commercially designed chips with
as high a reliability as is feasible.

Chip suppliers are naturally concerned about the use of their products in
applications which are critical for fear that any error could result in claims
for damages. Also, open reporting of bugs is not welcome, since it could be
potentially damaging to their market share unless it was required of all
suppliers. In consequence, suppliers do not feely provide information on bugs,
or even allow the user to decode the external marking on the chip to discover
the mask version used. Attempts to report bugs openly have not been successful
\cite{micro-rpt}.

A consequence of the above is that it is very difficult of users undertaking a
critical application to protect themselves against a potential design bug. One
approach that has been tried with one project is to use identical chips from
the same mask so that rig and development testing will extrapolate to the
final system. In some cases, the suppliers have provided information under a
non-disclosure agreement, be this seems to be restricted to major projects.

In contrast, quite a few software vendors have an open bug reporting scheme
--- and almost all provide a version number to the user. Hence it appears
in this area, software is in `advance' of hardware.

Some information

Over a period of three years, I have collected examples of design errors
in chips from several different sources. In August 1992, I posted a message
on Comp.risks (a bulletin board moderated by Peter Neumann), requesting
other examples. Unfortunately, there are problems publishing this information
in its entirety as follows:

 * Some of the information comes from sources which have probably signed
non-disclosure agreements and hence they have asked for the information not
to be published;

 * It would be difficult (and expensive) for me to trace all my sources
to ask permission to publish;

 * Much of the information does not contain some details which could
result in it being misleading --- perhaps the bug only applies to very
early releases of a chip;

 * It is clear that the information I have is not comprehensive.

Hence I have decided to extract from this information some useful points
rather than attempt to publish it as fully as possible.

The key issues extracted are as follows:

 * Early chips are unreliable:

There have been some dramatic errors in very early releases of chips.

 * Rarely used instructions are unreliable:

One report sent to me reported that some instructions not generated by
the `C' compiler were completely wrong. Another report noted that
special instructions for 64-bit integers did not work, and when this was
reported, the supplier merely removed them from the documentation!

 * Undocumented instructions are unreliable:

Obviously, such instructions must be regarded with suspicion.

 * Exceptional case handling is unreliable:

A classic instance of this problem is an error which has been reported
to me several times of the jump instructions on the 6502. When such an
instruction straddled a page boundary, it did not work correctly. This
issue potentially gives the user most cause for concern, since it may
be very difficult to avoid the issue. For instance, with machine
generated code form a compiler, the above problem with the 6502 would
be impossible to avoid.

Hence is would appear that the reliability growth models which have been
applied to large software systems apply equally to complex chips. This
appears to imply that the chips on the market represent to best that the
supplier thinks that the market requires, rather than one which has either
every known bug removed or one which has been shown correct by formal or
informal reasoning.

Conservative system design should therefore use `well-established' chips,
avoid rarely used or undocumented instructions. Much of this is conventional
wisdom.

The key issue is the extent to which chips which pass the above criteria
could be expected to be fault-free (in operation). Just one example
reported to me shows that we cannot expect too much. A compiler vendor
had a bug reported which the supplier of the software had some difficulty
in tracing. Eventually, it was found that the chip in question microcoded
the integer divide instruction by making it interruptible. Unfortunately,
the status of the registers was not preserved correctly after the interrupt.
Clearly, a bug of that type could go undetected for years and yet cause
the system to fail tomorrow.

The above has clear implications for those producing systems requiring
very high reliability. Even formal proof that the machine-code implements
the mathematical specification of the system is insufficient. Unfortunately,
no figure can be provided as an upper limit on the reliability of a single
processor system (without design diversity).

A proposal

It is currently very difficult for a designer of a high reliability system
to minimise the risks from design faults in chips for the reasons given
above. Of course, the risks are {\em small}, but for very critical systems,
all reasonable steps must be taken to reduce the risk to ALARP (As Low As
Reasonably Practical).

Further improvements would be possible if there was greater visibility
of the design process for the chips by the supplier to the users
developing critical systems. My proposal for this is as follows:

 1. The actual version of the device is determinable from the
external marking;

 2. The supplier is registered to ISO 9000;

 3. The supplier's quality assurance procedures requires that all user
reported bugs are recorded, and that the list for any specific version of
the device is available to any user who might reasonably require it.
(Obviously, suppliers should be able to charge for this, perhaps also
in the chip costs as well, and perhaps it might only be applied to
the `older' chips);

 4. Government procurement should request conformance to this scheme.
(Government and its agencies are responsible for many of the most
critical systems, and such a requirement would ensure the availability
of chips following this proposal.)

Extracts from two newspaper articles on an ATM glitch which corrupted
thousands of customer cards on Dec 31st in New Zealand.
These articles are both from general circulation newspapers. The
second gives a little more information.

"Year too long for money machines", By Roger Fea, New Zealand Herald,
Jan 2, 1993.

   The passing leap year caught several thousand ASB Bank customers
short on Thursday - when the bank's money machines refused to process
their transactions.
   The ASB's managing director, Mr Ralph Norris, said that a "faulty
date checking routine" had corrupted the magnetic strip on the
customers' money machine cards.
   The fault had to do with the fact that 1992 was a leap year and
that Thursday was the 366th and last day of the year.
   The money machines were programmed to acknowledge the extra day but
instead of the year 1992 being encoded, the figure 02 was used.
   The problem became apparent about 10 am on Thursday and covered a
period from midnight to noon that day, when it was fixed.
   Only those customers who made two separate transactions during the
period were initially affected. The first transaction went through but
the problem occurred when their cards were inserted a second time.
   Mr Norris said all customers who used their cards during the 12
hours - possibly about 10,000 - were now carrying corrupted cards.
   If they used them subsequently up until Monday or Tuesday their
transactions would be similarly rejected. By that time a new programme
would be in place which would bypass the problem.
   [ Information about cards still working with other bank's machines
and EFT-POS, as well as various apologies and contact information. ]
   

"Leap year spikes cashcards", NZPA, Waikato Times, Jan 2, 1993.

   About 1500 TSB Bank customers in Taranaki had their Cashflow cards
"corrupted" yesterday by a computer software fault that could ripple
around the world with disastrous consequences.
   TSB customers, who used their cards between midnight Wednesday and
about 12:30pm Thursday to make withdrawals, found they could not use
the cards again and needed replacement cards.
   "It's quite a serious problem we are talking about ... which has
the potential to ripple around the world," TSB information services
manager John Hollins said.
   The 18 TSB automated teller machines (ATMs) throughout the region
operated on a version of an NCR-based machine code which made no
allowance for leap years. So after a first withdrawal on Thursday the
machines no longer recognised the cards and came up with an "unable to
process" message, Mr Hollins said.
   [ Information about the ASB being affected, but not the Trust Banks,
which the ASB and TSB were once part of. ]
   Bank customers overseas who used ATMs which operated on the same
NCR code could also expect problems after their first withdrawals on
the last day of 1992, which had been a leap year, Mr Hollins said.
   However, customers who used Cashflow machines for other
transactions - such as account balance queries, transfers of money, or
deposits - were not affected.
   [ EFT-POS still worked OK, various apologies ].

-----
Background from Conrad:

Both ASB and TSB are regional banks (although the ASB are starting to
move into other regions). The nationwide trading banks (which also use
NCR ATMs, amongst others) do not seem to have been similarly affected.

This is another instance where New Zealand, as the first country in
the world to see the new day, also gets to experience date-related
bugs first - such as the recent 3pm Nov 1 1992 bug which broke many
banking systems running on Tandem CLX hardware - as the bug hit NZ
(then Australia, then Japan.....) a workaround was developed, and 
problems were averted in Europe and the US.....

News reports indicated that the Ross Perot campaign is being investigated by
the FBI, Secret Service, and Federal Trade Commission for allegedly using
stolen computer codes to obtain credit reports on some campaign workers.
Investigators refused to discuss the case, but former Perot campaign
employees, Equifax (the credit reporting company) and Orix Consumer Leasing of
Secaucus, NJ admitted having spoken to investigators.

Equifax said at least seventeen credit files of former Perot campaign workers
may have been accessed illegally.  Some Equifax reports were obtained using
the security code of Orix, which claims to never have requested the credit
reports on Perot volunteers.  Officials at Orix and Equifax have said they
believe Orix's security codes were stolen.  [Source: LA Times 2 or 3 Jan 93]

The B767 aircraft suffers repeated failures of the computer that controls the
individual passenger lights, sound, etc.  Unlike earlier aircraft, all the
switches on the armrests, including the individual light switches, sound
channel and volume, and attendant call button, are controlled by a computer.
On a recent flight that I was on, from Milan to Washington, the computer
wedged shortly into the flight.  Although one attendant figured that the
situation would have to wait until the plane landed, another managed to reset
the computer.  According to the attendants, these computer problems happen all
the time.

Now of course this is not a life-critical system, but it is certainly
ominous that such a simple task cannot be implemented correctly.  I'm
also curious about replacing 300 local light switches by a centralized
computer with 300 inputs and 300 outputs.  Ditto for the channel
controls.

Years ago (pre-wordprocessing) I used an IBM Selectric typewriter with a
correction key.  For a lousy typist like me, this was *wonderful*.  However,
the manual warned against using a correctable (carbon film) ribbon for typing
legal documents because undetectable alterations would be too easy.

Well, recently on a Delta flight from Hartford to Atlanta one of the options
on the inflight sound system was an interview with Frank Abagnale, a reformed
forger who now advises companies on fraud prevention.

Abagnale said that output from most laserprinters and photocopiers can be
removed in a similar manner with correction tape because the toner powder,
like carbon film ribbon, only sits on the surface of the paper but does not
impregnate the fibers.  I tried it and he's right.

He said some of his clients have had checks altered in this manner.  He
suggested two solutions:

  1: use an impact printer with inked fabric ribbons

  2: there is a fixative, similar to the stuff artists
     use to protect charcoal drawings, that can be sprayed
     over the printout, making removal of toner more difficult.

Matt Healy  matt@wardsgi.med.yale.edu

PS: In the Selectric, IBM had the best keyboard I have ever used.  Why didn't
they use it for the PC?  Closest approximation I have used recently is an old
Leading Edge Model D.   

       [If you wish to answer Matt's question, send mail to HIM, not to RISKS.
       By the way, the Selectric touch was fine, but the ball kept getting
       out of alignment.  I have some wonderful concrete (abstract) poetry 
       generated in 1969 using just such a ball.  I had a real ball!  PGN]

During the fall I recall that there was a RISKS contribution in which the
writer speculated about the number of digit positions required to specify a
real currency exchange rate, concluding that something like four or five digits
would surely be adequate. This is incorrect - my daughter was previously in
Zaire in the Peace Corps and is now in Congo in the Peace Corps. They (she and
her husband had to leave Zaire when the Peace Corps cancelled the program in
the country due to unrest which was partly due to the economy, which is in a
shambles. When they went in the Peace Corps (Thanksgiving 1990 for Zaire), the
exchange rate was something like 400 Zaires per dollar (officially) and about
800 Zaires per dollar in the real market. When they left the country the rate
was about 80,000 Zaires per dollar (Sept. 1991), and the official rate had
been dropped for some time. This weekend the rate is about 2,500,000 Zaires
per dollar!! (And the largest piece of money is a [recently printed] note for
5,000,000 Zaires, but the government has said that in order to control things
they were going to remove that one from circulation!)

So in the face of unreasonable people (dictators, etc.), perhaps we need to use
a floating point representation for the exchange rates - but I do think that
one decimal digit for the exponent should be adequate. (And no one should need
seven digit accuracy in the mantissa.)

A letter in the UK magazine DEC User Jan 1993 page 6 shows a new danger"

  I think all readers should consider the implications of what happened to
  our company on 26th September 1992.

  At about 7:00am, our alarm was triggered, police and managers alerted,
  but by 7:07am we were already too late. In a precise but crude act, a
  single window was shattered by two lumps of concrete and our main PDP
  11/84 processor was detached from all peripherals and lifted through
  the broken window.

  Naturally, we have restoration media of the recovery list, programmes and
  latest data. We were back in operation on Wednesday  night thanks to our
  maintenance contract, software support and up-to-date back-up media.

  We are still reviewing potential motives and ramifications, but there
  have been other thefts in the area and complete systems are apparently
  reaching the former Eastern Bloc. In the meantime, if anyone offers you
  a cheap PDP, please let me know.

The statement 

    The dutch news said that the responsible person has been found and
    he will be charged with neglig[ent] conduct causing death.

in <A HREF="/Risks/14.20.html">RISKS-14.20</A> on the Cindu accident aroused some excitement. In my first
contribution in <A HREF="/Risks/14.21.html">RISKS-14.21</A> I forgot to add details.

Although there were some rumours that employees of Cindu would be prosecuted,
the public prosecutor decided not do so. He thinks the employees were punished
enough already by what had happened and that the case is too complex to be
able to focus responsibility for the accident to one person. The rumours
focused on the man who forgot to check the recipe before executing it. He was
an apprentice operator, 3 months in service, and was alone when the accident
happened.

Dutch government charges the Cindu company as a whole for breaking several
environmental, health, safety, and economical laws. The public prosecutor
demands a fine of one million guilders (approx. US$600,000) and a suspended
sentence (trial period of two years) to close the plant if another accident
happens again. The latter is quite new in the Netherlands.

The judge pronounced judgement on 5 January: a fine of 200,000 guilders
(approx. US$100,000) mainly for breaking health and safety laws. (Of course
Cindu is liable for damage etc., but this is civil law).

Mr. Wichmann makes the point that while often market pressures result in
manufacturers concealing bugs in chips he states that:

  "In contrast, quite a few software vendors have an open bug reporting scheme
  --- and almost all provide a version number to the user."

Unfortunately recent events have indicated that Microsoft does not always
adhere to this maxim, choosing instead to "slipstream" certain corrections.
Further from reports I have received, Microsoft employees have been
distributing misinformation on incidents.

The situation is as follows: when MS-DOS 5.00 was released, the CHKDSK program
apparently contained a flaw that causes corruption of disks containing over
approximately 65,280 clusters if the /F switch is used. Depending on cluster
size, this indicates that disks or partitions containing approximately 128MB,
256MB, 512MB, 1024MB, or 2048MB are at risk.

The problem had been corrected in a version of MS-DOS 5.00 dated 11-91 however
other than the date, the only way to check is with a byte-for-byte check since
both versions are exactly the same length (16,200 bytes).  For reference, the
earlier version contains the string 8B 4F 0F 8B F9 at offset DS:263E while the
"fixed" one contains 8B 7F 0F 32 ED at the same offset.

The sad part is that people have reported MicroSoft personnel as first
recommending the undocumented VER /R switch and using only "Revision A".
Unfortunately *every* version of MS-DOS 5.00 reports "Revision A". Just today
I received a note from someone who contacted Microsoft and was told to
"execute COMMAND.COM and check the version number" again both the old (04-91)
and the new (11-91) versions report exactly the same thing.

Further, this mirrors the response received when I called to report that
certain corrupt values in the partition table could cause a floppy boot to
hang ("You must have a bad floppy...").

To make matters worse, Microsoft appears unwilling to post an approved "patch"
to the problem preferring to handle it on an individual basis (sounds kind of
like WordPerfect here - call with a problem and they send you a set of "magic"
disks).

Thus it would seem that Mr. Wichmann has been spared contact with Microsoft in
his assessment. I only wish it was true...

Padgett &lt;padgett@tccslr.dnet.mmc.com&gt;
        
ps.  Apparently  the  11-91  version of  MS-DOS  5.00  Revision  A 
     contains  a  number  of changes to  other  programs  however 
     IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, and COMMAND.COM appear to be the same.
        
pps. IBM  PC-DOS  5.00 is said to return something  meaningful  to 
     VER/R  -  the version dated 2-92 apparently has  the  CHKDSK 
     "fix".

PROCEDURES FOR RELEASE OF GIS DATA TO THE PUBLIC

There are many instances where non-governmental organizations request data and
maps, e.g. coverages, from geographic information systems (GIS) owned by
Federal and State agencies, but operated for these agencies by contractors.
Release of data from these systems usually requires the contractor to submit
the requested data / maps to the agency which in turn releases its to the
requesting organization.  GIS pose a special case because map coverages often
involve multiple layers of data from third parties and have widely varying
levels of quality.

This posting presents a hypothetical case regarding release of GIS data, poses
some questions, offers a straw man, and requests feedback.  The contractor and
the agency face substantial risks if the data are misused, misinterpreted, or
the results of these actions create problems for the users.

REQUESTS AND LIABILITY

Examples of non-governmental entities include other contractors doing work for
the same or other State agencies, businesses which want to use the data for
their own purposes, and "good government" groups and other interest groups,
who have reason to believe the data / maps will add value to their work.

The issue is raised about the use of released data for purposes for which they
are not intended and the ability of the original contractor and the agency to
protect themselves against problems with the quality of the released data.
For instance, should the original contractor prepare a "caveat emptor"
statement.

Further, the original GIS contractor gets much of its data from its primary
customer, the Agency, and from other State agencies.  The contractor does not
"own" the data, does not own the hardware and software of the GIS -- it was
paid for with tax dollars -- and, yet may be held liable by its customer for
inappropriate release or failure to properly qualify the release of these same
data.

CASE EXAMPLE

Let's take a hypothetical State Alcoholic Beverage Control Agency (ABC) which
has collected information on package sales by retail outlet, by product, and
other useful marketing information.  The State Agency sells all alcoholic
beverages in the State except beer and wine, which are sold in grocery stores.
It also regulates the sale of alcoholic beverages in restaurants and bars.

The State has built a GIS to make maps of sales data to support "targeting" of
different products by demographics, but also to help keep tabs on public
consumption habits in order to monitor "demand" for package sales v.
restaurant sales.  The ABC Agency argues it must have this data in map form so
that it does not overstock stores near high volume bars and in resort areas.
This has raised privacy issues and the legislature is asking whether the
Agency has gone overboard in meeting its regulatory mandates.

WHY THE DATA ARE REQUESTED

Some of the questions coming from the legislature are motivated by lobbying
pressures from the liquor industry.  The industry has a generally adversarial
relationship with the ABC Agency.  It will likely use the GIS data to make a
case in the current legislative session for changing the extent of the ABC
Agency's powers.  On the other side, a civil rights organization has requested
the GIS maps in order to show there are a disproportionate number of liquor
licenses in minority neighborhoods, and to show that the ABC Agency
discriminates against minority applicants for these licenses.

Numerous requests have been received by the Agency for copies of its maps.
Suppose you are the contractor who runs the GIS for the ABC Agency.  What
would you do in terms of qualifying the release of the GIS data, electronic
files, and hardcopy maps?  What kind of release procedures would you want to
use to cover your operation?

STRAW MAN

I'll start by offering a "straw man" caveat emptor statement.

        The primary objective of this data is to support specific
        legislative, regulatory, and administrative objectives of
        the ABC Agency and decision making which affects its
        operations.  This agency takes no responsibility for
        interpretation or use of this data for purposes other
        than for which it was originally intended.  ABC Agency
        databases and GIS coverages include many types of
        information with varying degrees of quality and
        reliability depending on the original sources.

        Further, it is the policy of the ABC Agency to accept and
        use the best data possible and to provide its users with
        information on the quality of that data.  ABC data are
        subject to periodic updates, and it is the responsibility
        of external users to obtain these updates.

Whether the data is ready for release or not the ABC Agency may be forced by
Freedom of Information Act requirements in the hypothetical state to release
the data and gis coverages.  The absence of a legislative mandate to make the
data public in other instances may not be a sufficient reason to withhold it.

This case revolves around marketing and regulatory data for alcoholic
beverages, but a parallel case could be developed for releasing GIS data on
hazardous waste sites which impinges on public safety, privacy, and real
estate values.

SUMMARY

The original question is -- what should the contractor and the government
agency do when faced with multiple requests for GIS data by non-governmental
entities?  What kind of "release policy and procedures" should be developed,
and does anyone have any examples?

Announcing the 4th AFCEA Computing Conference &amp; Exposition Conference,
Sponsored by the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics
Association (AFCEA) in cooperation with the Association for 
Federal Information Resources Management (AFFIRM).

Objective:
	A forum for military, civil government and industry computer
	hardware, software and systems professionals and users to exchange
        information and strengthen professional knowledge regarding 
        capabilities, technology and application of information systems.

Focus:
	This is not a DoD-only conference.  The scope and focus of
	the conferences has continued to broaden to include presentations

Security Tracks:

Panel:  Critical Programs Lead the Way

Recent policy and mission assignments in DoD strongly support the goal to
achieve adequate levels of security at an affordable price.  To meet this
goal, security requirements must be addressed early, from the top down, and
throughout a systems life cycle to be effective.  The panel will cover a cross
section of activities representing the latest DoD approach to systems
security.  Presentations will address the vital role of security architecture,
discuss current programs for meeting critical multilevel security
requirements, and describe a specific security product being developed for the
Navyis COPERNICUS program.

Panel: Standards - the Key to Interoperability

To achieve security in an open systems environment requires the development of
comprehensive standards touching nearly every dimension of information
technology.  While progress is being made in selected areas, the broadly based
security standards structure needed to support the performance and user
demands of emerging networks is yet to be developed.  The immensity of the
task requires Government and industry to work closely together on a national
and international basis.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) plays a fundamental role in this effort.  NIST, DoD, and industry
presenters on the panel will discuss status, issues, and the direction for a
number of important security standards activities.

                            ABSTRACT

Computer Science is hard pressed in the US to show broad utility to help
justify billion dollar research programs and the value of educating well over
40,000 Bachelor of Science and Master of Science specialists annually in the
U.S. The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of the U.S. National
Research Council has recently issued a report, "Computing the Future
(Hartmanis and Lin, 1992)" which sets a new agenda for Computer Science. The
report recommends that Computer Scientists broaden their conceptions of the
discipline to include computing applications and domains to help understand
them. This short paper argues that many Computer Science graduates need some
skills in analyzing human organizations to help develop appropriate systems
requirements since they are trying to develop high performance computing
applications that effectively support higher performance human organizations.
It is time for academic Computer Science to embrace organizational analysis
(the field of Organizational Informatics) as a key area of research and
instruction.

                          INTRODUCTION

Computer Science is being pressed on two sides to show broad utility for
substantial research and educational support. For example, the High
Performance Computing Act will provide almost two billion dollars for research
and advanced development. Its advocates justified it with arguments that
specific technologies, such as parallel computing and wideband nets, are
necessary for social and economic development. In the US, Computer Science
academic programs award well over 30,000 Bachelor of Science (BS) and almost
10,000 Master of Science (MS) degrees annually. Some of these students enter
PhD programs and many work on projects which emphasize mathematical Computer
Science. But many of these graduates also take computing jobs for which they
are inadequately educated, such as helping to develop high performance
computing applications to improve the performance of human organizations.

These dual pressures challenge leading Computer Scientists to broaden their
conceptions of the discipline to include an understanding of key application
domains, including computational science and commercial information systems.
An important report that develops this line of analysis, "Computing the
Future" (CTF) (Hartmanis and Lin, 1992), was recently issued by the National
Computing and Telecommunications Board of the U.S. National Research Council.

CTF is a welcome report that argues that academic Computer Scientists must
acknowledge the driving forces behind the substantial Federal research support
for the discipline. The explosive growth of computing and demand for CS in the
last decade has been driven by a diverse array of applications and new modes
of computing in diverse social settings.  CTF takes a strong and useful
position in encouraging all Computer Scientists to broaden our conceptions of
the discipline and to examine computing in the context of interesting
applications.

CTF's authors encourage Computer Scientists to envision new technologies in
the social contexts in which they will be used.  They identify numerous
examples of computer applications in earth science, computational biology,
medical care, electronic libraries and commercial computing that can provide
significant value to people and their organizations. These assessments rest on
concise and tacit analyses of the likely design, implementation within
organizations, and uses of these technologies. For example, CTF's stories of
improved computational support for modelling are based on rational models of
organizational behavior. They assume that professionals, scientists, and
policy-makers use models to help improve their decisions. But what if
organizations behave differently when they use models? For example suppose
policy makers use models to help rationalize and legitimize decisions which
are made without actual reference to the models?

One cannot discriminate between these divergent roles of modelling in human
organizations based upon the intentions of researchers and system designers.
The report tacitly requires that the CS community develop reliable knowledge,
based on systematic research, to support effective analysis of the likely
designs and uses of computerized systems. CTF tacitly requires an ability to
teach such skills to CS practitioners and students.  Without a disciplined
skill in analyzing human organizations, Computer Scientists' claims about the
usability and social value of specific technologies is mere opinion, and bears
a significant risk of being misleading. Further, Computer Scientists who do
not have refined social analytical skills sometimes conceive and promote
technologies that are far less useful or more costly than they claim.
Effective CS practitioners who "compute for the future" in organizations need
some refined skills in organizational analysis to understand appropriate
systems requirements and the conditions that transform high performance
computing into high performance human organizations. Since CTF does not spell
out these tacit implications, I'd like to explain them here.

                  BROADENING COMPUTER SCIENCE: 
                 FROM COMPUTABILITY TO USABILITY

The usability of systems and software is a key theme in the history of CS. We
must develop theoretical foundations for the discipline that give the deepest
insights in to what makes systems usable for various people, groups and
organizations.  Traditional computer scientists commonly refer to mathematics
as the theoretical foundations of CS. However, mathematical formulations give
us limited insights into understanding why and when some computer systems are
more usable than others.

Certain applications, such as supercomputing and computational science are
evolutionary extensions of traditional scientific computation, despite their
new direction with rich graphical front ends for visualizing enormous mounds
of data. But other, newer modes of computing, such as networking and
microcomputing, change the distribution of applications. While they support
traditional numerical computation, albeit in newer formats such as
spreadsheets, they have also expanded the diversity of non-numerical
computations. They make digitally represented text and graphics accessible to
tens of millions of people.

These technological advances are not inconsistent with mathematical
foundations in CS, such as Turing machine formulations. But the value of these
formats for computation is not well conceptualized by the foundational
mathematical models of computation. For example, text editing could be
conceptualized as a mathematical function that transforms an initial text and
a vector of incremental alterations into a revised text. Text formatting can
be conceptualized as a complex function mapping text strings into spatial
arrays. These kinds of formulations don't help us grasp why many people find
"what you see is what you get" editors as much more intuitively appealing than
a system that links line editors, command-driven formatting languages, and
text compilers in series.

Nor do our foundational mathematical models provide useful ways of
conceptualizing some key advances in even more traditional elements of
computer systems such as operating systems and database systems. For example,
certain mathematical models underlie the major families of database systems.
But one can't rely on mathematics alone to assess how well networks,
relations, or object-entities serve as representations for the data stored in
an airline reservation system. While mathematical analysis can help optimize
the efficiency of disk space in storing the data, they can't do much to help
airlines understand the kinds of services that will make such systems most
useful for reservationists, travel agents and even individual travellers. An
airline reservation system in use is not simply a closed technical system. It
is an open socio-technical system (Hewitt, 1986; Kling, 1992). Mathematical
analysis can play a central role in some areas of CS, and an important role in
many areas. But we cannot understand important aspects of usability if we
limit ourselves to mathematical theories.

The growing emphasis of usability is one of the most dominant of the diverse
trends in computing. The usability tradition has deep roots in CS, and has
influenced the design of programming languages and operating systems for over
25 years. Specific topics in each of these areas also rest on mathematical
analysis which Computer Scientists could point to as "the foundations" of the
respective subdisciplines. But Computer Scientists envision many key advances
as design conceptions rather than as mathematical theories. For example,
integrated programming environments ease software development. But their
conception and popularity is not been based on deeper formal foundations for
programming languages. However, the growth of non-numerical applications for
diverse professionals, including text processing, electronic mail, graphics,
and multimedia should place a premium on making computer systems relatively
simple to use. Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is now considered a core
subdiscipline of CS.

The integration of HCI into the core of CS requires us to expand our
conception of the theoretical foundations of the discipline.  While every
computational interface is reducible to a Turing computation, the foundational
mathematical models of CS do not (and could not) provide a sound theoretical
basis for understanding why some interfaces are more effective for some groups
of people than others. The theoretical foundations of effective computer
interfaces must rest on sound theories of human behavior and their empirical
manifestations (cf. Ehn, 1991, Grudin, 1989).

Interfaces also involve capabilities beyond the primary information processing
features of a technology. They entail ways in which people learn about systems
and ways to manage the diverse data sets that routinely arise in using many
computerized systems (Kling, 1992). Understanding the diversity and character
of these interfaces, that are required to make many systems usable, rests in
an understanding the way that people and groups organize their work and
expertise with computing. Appropriate theories of the diverse interfaces that
render many computer systems truly useful must rest, in part, on theories of
work and organization. There is a growing realization, as networks tie users
together at a rapidly rising rate, that usability cannot generally be
determined without our considering how computer systems are shaped by and also
alter interdependencies in groups and organizations. The newly-formed
subdiscipline of Computer Supported Cooperative Work and newly-coined term
"groupware" are responses to this realization (Greif, 1988; Galegher, Kraut
and Egido, 1990).

                  BROADENING COMPUTER SCIENCE: 
                FROM HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING 
                TO HIGH PERFORMANCE ORGANIZATIONS

The arguments of CTF go beyond a focus on usable interface designs to claims
that computerized systems will improve the performance of organizations.  The
report argues that the US should invest close to a billion dollars a year in
CS research because of the resulting economic and social gains. These are
important claims, to which critics can seek systematic evidence.  For example,
one can investigate the claim that 20 years of major computing R&amp;D and
corporate investment in the US has helped provide proportionate economic and
social value.

CTF is filled with numerous examples where computer-based systems provided
value to people and organizations. The tough question is whether the overall
productive value of these investments is worth the overall acquisition and
operation costs. While it is conventional wisdom that computerization must
improve productivity, a few researchers began to see systemic possibilities of
counter-productive computerization in the early 1980s (King and Kraemer,
1981). In the last few years economists have found it hard to give
unambiguously affirmative answers to this question. The issue has been termed
"The Productivity Paradox," based on a comment attributed to Nobel laureate
Robert Solow who remarked that "computers are showing up everywhere except in
the [productivity] statistics (Dunlop and Kling, 1991a)."

Economists are still studying the conditions under which computerization
contributes to organizational productivity, and how to measure iteasy.  But
there is no automatic link between computerization and improved productivity.
While many computer systems have been usable and useful, productivity gains
require that their value exceed all of their costs.

There are numerous potential slips in translating high performance computing
into cost-effective improvements in organizational performance. Some
technologies are superb for well-trained experts, but are difficult for less
experienced people or "casual users." Many technologies, such as networks and
mail systems, often require extensive technical support, thus adding hidden
costs (Kling, 1992).

Further, a significant body of empirical research shows that the social
processes by which computer systems are introduced and organized makes a
substantial difference in their value to people, groups and organizations
(Lucas, 1981; Kraemer, et. al.  1985; Orlikowski, 1992). Most seriously, not
all presumably appropriate computer applications fit a person or group's work
practices. While they may make sense in a simplified world, they can actually
complicate or misdirect real work.

Group calendars are but one example of systems that can sound useful, but are
often useless because they impose burdensome record keeping demands (Grudin,
1989). In contrast, electronic mail is one of the most popular applications in
office support systems, even when other capabilities, like group calendars,
are ignored (Bullen and Bennett, 1991). However, senders are most likely to
share information with others when the system helps provide social feedback
about the value of their efforts or they have special incentives (Sproull and
Kiesler, 1991; Orlikowski, 1992). Careful attention to the social arrangements
or work can help Computer Scientists improve some systems designs, or also
appreciate which applications may not be effective unless work arrangements
are changed when the system is introduced.

The uses and social value of most computerized systems can not be effectively
ascertained from precise statements of their basic design principles and
social purposes. They must be analyzed within the social contexts in which
they will be used. Effective social analyses go beyond accounting for formal
tasks and purposes to include informal social behavior, available resources,
and the interdependencies between key groups (Cotterman and Senn, 1992).

Many of the BS and MS graduates of CS departments find employment on projects
where improved computing should enhance the performance of specific
organizations or industries.  Unfortunately, few of these CS graduates have
developed an adequate conceptual basis for understanding when information
systems will actually improve organizational performance.  Consequently, many
of them are prone to recommend systems-based solutions whose structure or
implementation within organizations would be problematic.

                   ORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATICS

Organizational Informatics denotes a field which studies the development and
use of computerized information systems and communication systems in
organizations. It includes studies of their conception, design, effective
implementation within organizations, maintenance, use, organizational value,
conditions that foster risks of failures, and their effects for people and an
organization's clients. It is an intellectually rich and practical research
area.

Organizational Informatics is a relatively new label. In Europe, the term
Informatics is the name of many academic departments which combine both CS and
Information Systems. In North America, Business Schools are the primary
institutional home of Information Systems research and teaching. But this
location is a mixed blessing. It brings IS research closer to organizational
studies. But the institutional imperatives of business schools lead IS
researchers to emphasize the development and use of systems in a narrow range
of organizations -- businesses generally, and often service industry firms. It
excludes information systems in important social sectors such as health care,
military operations, air-traffic control, libraries, home uses, and so on. And
Information Systems research tries to avoid messy issues which many practicing
Computer Scientists encounter: developing requirements for effective systems
and mitigating the major risks to people and organizations who depend upon
them.

The emerging field of Organizational Informatics builds upon research
conducted under rubrics like Information Systems and Information Engineering.
But it is more wide ranging than either of these fields are in practice.

Organizational Informatics Research

In the last 20 years a loosely organized community of some dozens
of researchers have produced a notable body of systematic
scientific research in Organizational Informatics. These studies
examine a variety of topics, including:
     *    how system designers translate people's preferences
          into requirements;
     *    the functioning of software development teams in 
          practice;
     *    the conditions that foster and impede the
          implementation of computerized systems within
          organizations;
     *    how people and organizations use systems in practice; 
     *    the roles of computerized systems in altering work,
          group communication, power relationships, and
          organizational practices.

Researchers have extensively studied some of these topics, such as
computerization and changing work, appear in synoptic review articles (Kling
and Dunlop, in press). In contrast, researchers have recently begun to examine
other topics, such software design (Winograd and Flores, 1986; Kyng and
Greenbaum, 1991), and have recently begun to use careful empirical methods
(e.g. Suchman, 1983; Bentley, et. al, 1992; Fish, et. al., 1993). I cannot
summarize the key theories and rich findings of these diverse topics in a few
paragraphs. But I would like to comment upon a few key aspects of this body of
research.

Computer Systems Use in Social Worlds

Many studies contrast actual patterns of systems design, implementation, use
or impacts with predictions made by Computer Scientists and professional
commentators. A remarkable fraction of these accounts are infused with a
hyper-rational and under-socialized view of people, computer systems,
organizations and social life in general.  Computer Scientists found that rule
driven conceptions to be powerful ways to abstract domains like compilers. But
many Computer Scientists extend them to be a tacit organizing frame for
understanding whole computer systems, their developers, their users and others
who live and work with them. Organizations are portrayed as generally
cooperative systems with relatively simple and clear goals. Computer systems
are portrayed as generally coherent and adequate for the tasks for which
people use them. People are portrayed as generally obedient and cooperative
participants in a highly structured system with numerous tacit rules to be
obeyed, such as doing their jobs as they are formally described. Using data
that is contained in computer systems, and treating it as information or
knowledge, is a key element of these accounts. Further, computer systems are
portrayed as powerful, and often central, agents of organizational change.

This Systems Rationalist perspective infuses many accounts of computer systems
design, development, and use in diverse application domains, including CASE
tools, instructional computing, models in support of public policy
assessments, expert systems, groupware, supercomputing, and network
communications (Kling, 1980; Kling, Scherson and Allen, 1992).

All conceptual perspectives are limited and distort "reality."  When
Organizational Informatics researchers systematically examine the design
practices in particular organizations, how specific groups develop computer
systems, or how various people and groups use computerized systems, they find
an enormous range of fascinating and important human behavior which lies
outside the predictive frame of Systems Rationalism. Sometimes these behaviors
are relatively minor in overall importance. But in many cases they are so
significant as to lead Organizational Informatics researchers to radically
reconceptualize the processes which shape and are shaped by computerization.

There are several alternative frames for reconceptualizing computerization as
alternatives to Systems Rationalism. The alternatives reflect, in part, the
paradigmatic diversity of the social sciences. But all of these reconceptions
situate computer systems and organizations in richer social contexts and with
more complex and multivalent social relations than does systems rationalism.
Two different kinds of observations help anchor these abstractions.

Those who wish to understand the dynamics of model usage in public agencies
must appreciate the institutional relationships which influence the
organization's behavior. For example, to understand economic forecasting by
the US Congress and the Executive branch's Office of Management and Budget,
one must appreciate the institutional relations between Congress and the
Executive branch. They are not well described by Systems Rationalist
conceptions because they were designed to continually differ with each other
in their perspectives and preferred policies. That is one meaning of "checks
and balances" in the fundamental design of the US Federal Government. My
colleagues, Ken Kraemer and John King, titled their book about Federal
economic modelling, DataWars (Kraemer, et. al., 1985).  Even this title
doesn't make much sense within a Systems Rationalist framework.

Modelling can be a form of intellectual exploration. It can also be a medium
of communication, negotiation, and persuasion. The social relationships
between modelers, people who use them and diverse actors in Federal
policymaking made these socially mediated roles of models sometimes most
important. In these situations, an alternative view of organizations as
coalitions of interest groups was a more appropriate conceptualization. And
within this coalitional view of organizations, a conception of econometric
models as persuasion support systems rather than as decision support systems
sometimes is most appropriate.  Organizational Informatics researchers found
that political views of organizations and systems developments within them
apply to many private organizations as well as to explicitly political public
agencies.

Another major idea to emerge from the broad body of Organizational Informatics
research is that the social patterns which characterize the design,
development, uses and consequences of computerized systems are dependent on
the particular ecology of social relationships between participants. This idea
may be summarized by saying that the processes and consequences of
computerization are "context dependent." In practice, this means that the
analyst must be careful in generalizing from one organizational setting to
another. While data wars might characterize econometric modelling on Capitol
Hill, we do not conclude that all computer modelling should be interpreted as
persuasion support systems. In some settings, models are used to explore the
effects of policy alternatives without immediate regard for their support as
media for communication, negotiation or persuasion. At other times, the same
model might be used (or abused with cooked data) as a medium of persuasion.
The brief accounts of models for global warming in CTF fit a Systems
Rationalist account. Their uses might appear much less "scientific" if they
were studied within the actual policy processes within which they are
typically used.

Repercussions for Systems Design

Even when computerized systems are used as media of intellectual exploration,
Organizational Informatics researchers find that social relationships
influence the ways that people use computerized systems. Christine Bullen and
John Bennett (1991) studied 25 organizations that used groupware with diverse
modules such as databases, group calendars, text annotating facilities and
electronic mail. They found that the electronic mail modules were almost
universally valued, while other system facilities were often unused.

In a recent study, Sharyn Ladner and Hope Tillman examined the use of the
Internet by university and corporate librarians. While many of them found data
access through databases and file transfer to be important services, they also
reported that electronic mail was perhaps the most critical Internet feature
for them.
     The participants in our study tell us something that we
     may have forgotten in our infatuation with the new
     forms of information made available through the
     Internet.  And that is their need for community.  To be
     sure, our respondents use the Internet to obtain
     information not available in any other format, to
     access databases ... that provide new efficiencies in
     their work, new ways of working.  But their primary use
     is for communication.  Special librarians tend to be
     isolated in the workplace -- the only one in their
     subject specialty (in the case of academe), or the only
     librarian in their organization (in the case of a
     corporate library).  Time and time again our
     respondents expressed this need to talk to someone --
     to learn what is going on in their profession, to
     bounce ideas off others, to obtain information from
     people, not machines.  
     There are tremendous implications from the Internet
     technology in community formation -- the Internet may
     indeed provide a way to increase community among
     scholars, including librarians.  The danger we face at
     this juncture in time, as we attach library resources
     to the Internet, is to focus all of our energies on the
     machine-based resources at the expense of our human-
     based resources, i.e., ourselves (Ladner and Tillman,
     1992). 
In these studies, Organizational Informatics researchers have developed a
socially rich view of work with and around computing, of computing within a
social world.

These studies have strong repercussions for the design of software. A good
designer cannot assume that the majority of effort should go into the
"computational centerpiece" of a system, while devoting minor efforts to
supporting communication facilities. One of my colleagues designed a modelling
system for managers in a major telephone company, after completing an
extensive requirements analysis. However, as an afterthought, he added a
simple mail system in a few days work. He was surprised to find that the
people who used these systems regularly used his crude electronic mail system,
while they often ignored interesting modelling capabilities. Such balances of
attention also have significant repercussions. Many people need good mail
systems, not just crude ones: systems which include facile editors, ease in
exporting and importing files, and effective mail management (Kling and Covi,
1993).

Assessing people's preferences for systems' designs is an exercise in social
inquiry. While rapid prototyping may help improve designs for some systems, it
is less readily applicable to systems which are used by diverse groups at
numerous locations. Computer scientists are beginning to develop more reliable
methods of social inquiry to better understand which systems designs will be
most useful (Bentley, et. al. 1992; Kyng and Greenbaum, 1991). Root and his
colleagues (1993) recently reported the way that the explicit use of social
theory helped them design more effective group meeting systems. Unfortunately,
these newer methods are rarely taught to CS students. When computer
specialists build an imbalanced system, it should not be a surprise when the
resulting organizational value of their efforts is very suboptimal.

</i><PRE>

In a simplified engineering model of computing, the reliability of products is
assured through extensive testing in a development lab. The social world of
technology use is not perceived as shaping the reliability of systems, except
through irascible human factors, such as "operator errors." An interesting and
tragic illustration of the limitations of this view can be found in some
recent studies of the causes of death and maiming by an electron accelerator
which was designed to help cure cancer, the Therac-25 (Jacky, 1991, Leveson
and Turner, 1992).

The Therac-25 was designed and marketed in the mid 1980s by a Canadian firm
AECL as an advanced medical technology. It featured complete software control
over all major functions (supported by a DEC PDP-11), among other innovations.
Previous machines included electro-mechanical interlocks to raise and lower
radiation shields. Several thousand people were effectively treated with the
Therac-25 each year. However, between 1985 and 1987 there were six known
accidents in which several people died in the US. Other were seriously maimed
or injured.

Both studies concur that there were subtle but important flaws in the design
of the Therac-25's software and hardware. AECL's engineers tried to patch the
existing hardware and (finally) software when they learned of some of the
mishaps. But they treated each fix as the final repair.

Both studies show how the continuing series of mishaps was exacerbated by
diverse organizational arrangements. Jacky claims that pressures for speedy
work by low-skilled machine operators coupled with an interface design that
did not enhance important error messages was one of many causes of the
accidents. Leveson and Turner differ in downplaying the working conditions of
the Therac-25's operators and emphasize the flawed social system for
communicating the seriousness of problems to Federal regulators and other
hospitals. Both studies observe that it is unlikely for the best of companies
to develop perfect error-free systems without high quality feedback from
users. Their recommendations differ: Jacky emphasizes the licensing of system
developers to improve minimal standards of competence. Leveson and Turner
propose extensive education and training of software engineers and more
effective communication between manufacturers and their customers.

However, both studies indicate that an understanding of the safety of computer
systems must go beyond the laboratory and extend into the organizational
settings where it is used. In the case of the Therac-25, it required
understanding a complex web of interorganizational relationships, as well as
the technical design and operation of the equipment. The need for this kind of
organizational understanding is unfortunately slighted in the CS academic
world today. CTF discusses only those aspects of computer system reliability
which are amenable to understanding through laboratory-like studies (Hartmanis
and Lin, 1992:110-111). But cases of safety critical systems, like the
Therac-25, indicate why some Computer Scientists must be willing to undertake
(and teach) organizational analysis.

   [From the title of the above section, I presume Rob had not yet gotten
   around to commenting on system security in complementary context to the 
   discussion on human safety.  But it seems that similar conclusions can 
   be drawn.  Apologies for the interjection.  PGN]

Worldviews and Surprises about Computerization

These few paragraphs barely sketch the highlights of a fertile and significant
body of research about computer systems in use.  Perhaps the most important
simplification for traditional computer scientists is to appreciate how people
and their organizations are situated in a social world and consequently
compute within a social world. People act in relationship to others in various
ways and concerns of belonging, status, resources, and power are often
central. The web of people's relationships extend beyond various formally
defined group and organizational boundaries (Kling and Scacchi, 1982; Kling,
1992).  People construct their worlds, including the meanings and uses of
information technologies, through their social interactions.

This view is, of course, not new to social scientists. On the other hand,
there is no specific body of social theory which can easily be specialized for
"the case of computing," and swiftly produce good theories for Organizational
Informatics as trivial deductions. The best research in Organizational
Informatics draws upon diverse theoretical and methodological approaches
within the social sciences with a strong effort to select those which best
explain diverse aspects of computerization.

       ORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATICS WITHIN COMPUTER SCIENCE

CTF places dual responsibilities on Computer Scientists. One responsibility is
to produce a significant body of applicable research. The other responsibility
is to educate a significant fraction of CS students to be more effective in
conceiving and implementing systems that will enhance organizational
performance. It may be possible to organize research and instruction so as to
decouple these responsibilities. For example, molecular biologists play only a
small role in training doctors. However, CS departments act like an integrated
Medical school and Biology department. They are the primary academic locations
for training degreed computing specialists, and they conduct a diverse array
of less applicable and more applicable research. In practice, the research
interests of CS faculty shape the range of topics taught in CS departments,
especially the 150 PhD granting departments. CS curricula mirror major areas
of CS research and the topics which CS faculty understand through their own
educations and subsequent research. As a consequence, CS courses are likely to
avoid important CS topics which appear a bit foreign to the instructor.

An interesting example of this coupling can be illustrated by CTF, in a brief
description of public-key encryption systems and digital signatures (Hartmanis
and Lin, 1992:27). In the simple example, Bob and Alice can send messages
reliably if each maintains a secret key. Nothing is said about the social
complications of actually keeping keys secret. The practical problems are
similar to those of managing passwords. In real organizations, people lose or
forget their passwords. Also, some passwords can be shared by a group of with
shifting membership, and the "secret key" can readily become semi-public. In
practice, the management of keys is a critical element of system security.
But Computer Scientists are prone to teach courses on cryptography as
exercises in applied mathematics, such as number theory and Galois theory, and
to skirt the vexing practical problems of making encryption a practical
organizational activity.

Today, most of the 40,000 people who obtain BS and MS degrees in CS each year
in the U.S. have no opportunities for systematic exposure to reliable
knowledge about the best design strategies, common uses, effective
implementation, and assessments of value of computing in a social world
(Lewis, 1989). Yet a substantial fraction of these students go on to work for
organizations attempting to produce or maintain systems that improve
organizational performance without a good conceptual basis for their work.
Consequently, many of them develop systems that underperform in organizational
terms even when they are technically refined. They also recommend ineffective
implementation procedures and are sometimes even counterproductive.

One defensible alternative to my position is that CS departments should not
take on any form of organizational analysis. They should aggressively take a
role akin to Biology departments rather than taking on any instructional or
research roles like Medical schools. To be sincere, this position requires a
high level of restraint by academic Computer Scientists. First and foremost,
they should cease from talking about the uses, value or even problems of
computerized systems that would be used in any organizational setting.
Research proposals would be mute about any conceivable application of research
results. Further, they should make effective efforts to insure that anyone who
employs their graduates should be aware that they may have no special skills
in understanding organizational computing. It would take an aggressive "truth
in advertising" campaign to help make it clear that Computer Scientists have
no effective methods for understanding computerization in the social world.
Further, Computer Scientists would forsake their commitments to subfields like
software engineering which tacitly deals with ways to support teams of systems
developers to work effectively (Curtis, et. al. 1988). Computer Scientists, in
this view, would remove themselves from addressing organizational and human
behavior, in the same way that molecular biologists are removed from
professionally commenting on the practices of cardiologists and obstetricians.
CTF argues that this view would be self-defeating.  But it would be internally
consistent and have a distinctive integrity.

In contrast, CS faculty are often reluctant to wholly embrace Organizational
Informatics. But some CS subfields, such as software engineering, depend upon
organizational analysis (Curtis, et. al., 1988). Further, CS faculty do little
to advertise the distinctive limitations in the analytical skills of our
programs' graduates. Part of the dilemma develops because many CS faculty are
ambivalent about systematic studies of human behavior. Applied mathematics and
other modes of inquiry which seem to yield concise, crisp and concrete results
are often the most cherished. As a consequence, those who conduct behaviorally
oriented research in CS departments are often inappropriately marginalized.
Their students and the discipline suffers as a result.

Between 1986 and 1989, the total number of BS and MS CS degrees awarded
annually in the US declined from about 50,000 to approximately 40,000. The
number of students majoring in CS rapidly declined at a time when
computerization was becoming widespread in many fields. A significant fraction
of the decline can be attributed to many students finding CS programs insular
and indifferent to many exciting forms of computerization. The decline of
military R&amp;D in the U.S. can amplify these trends or stimulate a more
cosmopolitan view in CS departments. The decline in military R&amp;D is shifting
the job market for new CS graduates towards a markedly more civilian
orientation. This shift, along with the trend towards computing distributed
into diverse work groups, is leading to more job opportunities for people with
CS education who know Organizational Informatics.

The situation of CS departments has some parallels with Statistics
departments. Statistics are widely used and taught in many academic
disciplines. But Statistics departments have often maintained a monkish
isolation from "applications." Consequently, the application of statistics
thrives while Statistics departments have few students and modest resources.
Might the status of Statistics indicate a future possibility for an insular
approach to CS?

The best Organizational Informatics research in North America is conducted by
faculty in the Information Systems departments in business schools and by
scattered social scientists (cf. Boland and Hirschheim, 1987; Galegher, Kraut
and Egido, 1990; Cotterman and Senn, 1992; Sproull and Kiesler, 1991). But
Computer Scientists cannot effectively delegate the research and teaching of
Organizational Informatics to business Schools or social science departments.

Like Computer Scientists, faculty in these other disciplines prefer to focus
on their own self-defined issues.  Computer Scientists are much more likely to
ask questions with attention to fine grained technological nuances that
influence designs. For example, the professional discussions of computer risks
have been best developed through activities sponsored by the ACM's Special
Interest Group on Software (SIGSOFT). They are outside the purview of business
school faculty and, at best, only a few social scientists are interested in
them. Generally, technology plays a minor role in social science theorizing.
And when social scientists study technologies, they see a world of
possibilities: energy technologies, transportation technologies, communication
technologies (including television), medicinal drugs and devices, and so on.
They see little reason to give computer-related information technologies a
privileged role within this cornucopia. As a consequence, the few social
scientists who take a keen interest in studying computerization are
unfortunately placed in marginal positions within their own disciplines. Often
they must link their studies to mainstream concerns as defined by the
tastemakers of their own fields, and the resulting publications appear
irrelevant to Computer Scientists.

Further, faculty in these other disciplines are not organized to effectively
teach tens of thousands of CS students, students who are steeped in technology
and usually very naive about organizations, about systems development and use
in organizations. In North America there is no well developed institutional
arrangement for educating students who can effectively take leadership roles
in conceptualizing and developing complex organizational computing projects
(Lewis, 1989).

CTF is permeated with interesting claims about the social value of recent and
emerging computer-based technologies. While many of these observations should
rest on an empirically grounded scientific footing, Computer Scientists have
deprived themselves of access to such research. For example, the discussion of
systems risks in the ACM rests on a large and varied collection of examples
and anecdotes. But there is no significant research program to help better
understand the conditions under which organizations are more likely to develop
systems using the best risk-reducing practices. There is an interesting body
of professional lore, but little scholarship to ground it (See Appendix).

Computer Scientists have virtually no scholarship to utilize in understanding
when high performance networks, like the National Research and Education
Network, will catalyze social value proportional to their costs. Consequently,
many of the "obvious" claims about the value of various computing technologies
that we Computer Scientists make are more akin to the lore of home remedies
for curing illness. Some are valid, others are unfounded speculation. More
seriously, the theoretical bases for recommending home medical remedies and
new computer technologies can not advance without having sound research
programs.

                         WHAT IS NEEDED

CTF sets the stage for developing Organizational Informatics as a
strong subfield within Computer Science. CTF bases the expansion
of the discipline on a rich array of applications in which many
of the effective technologies must be conceived in relationship
to plausible uses in order provide attractive social value for
multi-billion dollar public investments.

The CS community needs an institutionalized research capability to produce a
reliable body of knowledge about the usability and value of computerized
systems and the conditions under which computer systems improve organizational
performance. In Western Europe there are research projects about
Organizational Informatics in a few Computer Science departments and research
funding through the EEC's Espirit program (Bubenko, 1992; Iivari, 1991; Kyng
and Greenbaum, 1991). These new research and instructional programs in Western
Europe give Organizational Informatics a significantly more effective place in
CS education and research than it now has in North America.

The CS community in the U.S. has 30 years of experience in institutionalizing
research programs, especially through the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency and the National Science Foundation (NSF). There are many approaches,
including national centers and individual investigator research grants. All
such programs aim to develop and sustain research fields with a combination of
direct research funds, the education of future researchers, and the
development of research infrastructure. They are all multimillion dollar
efforts. Today, NSF devotes about $125K annually to Organizational Informatics
as part of the Information Technology in Organizations program. This start is
far short of the level of funding required to develop this field within CS.

The North American CS curricula must also include opportunities for students
to learn the most reliable knowledge about the social dimensions of systems
development and use (Denning, 1992).  These opportunities, formed as courses,
can provide varied levels of sophistication. The most elementary courses
introduce students to some of the key topics in Organizational Informatics and
the limitations of Systems Rationalism as an organizing frame (for example,
Dunlop and Kling, 1991a). More advanced courses focus on specific topics, such
as those I have listed above. They teach about substantive problems and
theoretical approaches for analyzing them. While many of these approaches are
anchored in the sociological theory of organizations, CS students usually
won't grasp the importance of the theories without numerous computing examples
to work with. They also have trouble grasping the character of computing in
organizations without guided opportunities for observing and analyzing
computerization in practice. Consequently, some courses should offer
opportunities for studying issues of computerization in actual organizations.

Fortunately, a few CS departments offer some courses in Organizational
Informatics. In addition, some CS faculty who research and teach about human
behavior in areas like Human-Computer Interaction and Software Engineering
can help expand the range of research an instruction. Unfortunately, only a
fraction of the CS departments in the US. have faculty who study and teach
about computing and human behavior.

While the study of Organizational Informatics builds upon both the traditional
technological foundations of CS and the social sciences, the social sciences
at most universities will not develop it as an effective foundational topic
for CS. On specific campuses, CS faculty may be able to develop good
instructional programs along with colleagues in social sciences or Schools of
Management.

But delegating this inquiry to some other discipline does not provide a
national scale solution for CS. Other disciplines will not do our important
work for us. Mathematics departments may be willing to teach graph theory for
CS students, but the analysis of algorithms would be a much weaker field if it
could only be carried out within Mathematics Departments. For similar reasons,
it is time for academic Computer Science to embrace Organizational Informatics
as a key area of research and instruction.

                        ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This paper builds on ideas which I've developed over the last decade. But they
have been deepened by some recent events, such as the CTF report. They were
also sharpened through a lecture and followon discussion with colleagues at
the University of Toronto, including Ron Baeker, Andy Clement, Kelley
Gottlieb, and Marilyn Mantei.  Rick Weingarten suggested that I write a brief
position paper reflecting those ideas. At key points, Peter Denning and Peter
Neumann provided helpful encouragement and sage advice. I also appreciate the
efforts of numerous other friends and colleagues to help strengthen this paper
through their comments and critical assistance. The paper is immeasurably
stronger because of the prompt questions and suggestions that I received in
response to an evolving manuscript from the following people: Mark Ackerman,
Jonathan P. Allen, Bob Anderson, Lisa Covi, Brad Cox, Gordon Davis, Phillip
Fites, Simson Garfinkel, Les Gasser, Sy Goodman, Beki Grinter, Jonathan
Grudin, Pertti Jarvinen, John King, Heinz Klein, Trond Knudsen, Kenneth
Kraemer, Sharyn Ladner, Nancy Leveson, Lars Matthiesen, Colin Potts, Paul
Resnick, Larry Rosenberg, Tim Standish, John Tillquist, Carson Woo and Bill
Wulf.

                       APPENDIX

            Published Materials about Computer Risks

Unfortunately, there is no single good book or comprehensive review article
about the diverse risks of computerized systems to people and organizations,
and ways to mitigate them. The Internet board, comp.risks, is the richest
archive of diverse episodes and diverse discussions of their causes and cures.
While its moderator, Peter Neumann does a superb job of organizing discussions
of specific topics each year and also creates periodic indices, there is no
simple way to sift through the megabytes of accumulated comp.risks files.

Computerization and Controversy edited by Charles Dunlop and Rob Kling (1991)
includes two major sections on "security and reliability" and "privacy and
social control" which identify many key debates and reprint some key articles
and book excerpts which reflect different positions.  Another major source is
a series of articles, "Inside Risks, which Peter Neumann edits for
Communications of the ACM.

Ex-Car Rental Owners Indicted, FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP)
   Value Rent-A-Car Inc. rigged its COMPUTER system to set up a scam
overcharging customers who returned their cars with less than a full tank, a
federal indictment says.  The indictment returned Friday says Steven M. Cohen,
one of three former owners charged, fixed Value's computer system in 1988 to
add five gallons to the fuel tank capacity of every vehicle in Value's fleet.
This allowed the company to overcharge customers who turned in the car with
less than a full tank.
   Federal prosecutor Lothar Genge said that through 1991, about 47,000
customers were slapped with the phony charge, which ranged from a couple of
dollars to $10 or $15. Mitsubishi Motor Sales bought the company in 1990 and
is looking for ways to pay back the overcharges, Genge said.

  Nintendo Inquiry Launched

  The Government is probing claims of health hazards to children playing
  computer games like Nintendo.  The informal inquiry follows reports that two

  Baroness Denton, junior Consumer Affairs Minister, has called for an urgent
  report: `It is important to know if there are any health risks.

Here is an excerpt from an article in the Kansas City Star, January 7, 1993:

Ford's honesty saves county $2 million, by Anne Lamoy

  An alert bookkeeper at the Ford Claycomo assembly plant saved Clay County
  from cheating itself out of $2 million.  When paying the county's business
  personal property taxes recently, Ford's bookkeeper realized that the
  plant's two tax bills were much smaller than in previous years.  Much, much
  smaller.  "When the original bills were printed, they left off a digit,"
  Clay County Assessor Shirley Quick said Wednesday.  "And that digit meant $1
  million."  In fact, both tax bills were exactly $1 million short, thanks to
  a computerized data entry error.

The article goes on to state that Ford is the only company that owes more than
1 million in business personal property taxes in the county.  It doesn't say
whether this is the first time their bill contained 7 digits.

Today on a trouble shooting talk show in Denver, a caller called in to
complain that his license had been revoked, and he had to leave his car since
he couldn't drive.

Apparently, he had renewed his drivers license recently (required every three
years in Colorado). At that time, a database check was made of the other 49
states. There was a match, based on birthdate and name. The other person with
the same name and birthdate, had a suspended Penn. drivers license, based on a
drunk driving conviction.

Based on that match, his license was summarily revoked, and notice was mailed
to him to that effect. (Which he apparently had not yet received). The license
showed revoked at a routine traffic stop some time later. It is not clear how
automatic the revocation process is. In any case, no hearing is offered before
the revocation.

The driver was especially upset because:
  1) he had had a Colorado drivers license for 25 years.
  2) he had never been to Pennsylvania, and
  3) he didn't drink.

The burden is apparently upon him to prove the the Colorado DMV that they had
the wrong man. At present he is still fighting the organization trying to get
his license reinstated.

The following appeared in the Minneapolis Star Tribune, 1/12/92:

  STUDENT LOAD ERRORS BLAMED ON COMPUTER (AP)

  Because of a computer problem, thousands of college students have been sent
  notices ordering them to begin repaying loans that aren't due, a loan-
  processing company in St. Paul [Minnesota] says.

  Shirley Chase, an attorney for EduServ Technologies, formerly known as Hemar
  Corp., said problems with a new computer system caused a backlog in
  processing student requests to defer payments.  She said the company hopes
  to clear up the backlog by the end of February.  More than 10,000 deferment
  forms are backlogged, she said.

  Because of the backlog, some students who are entitled to postpone their
  loan payments have gotten notices urging them to pay and some have been
  contacted by a collection agency.  Chase said EduServ has "bent over
  backward" to make sure no adverse credit reports are filed with credit
  bureaus because of the delay.  EduServ processes loans issued by banks and
  other lenders and make sure payments are current.

Comment:  Given that they probably had a choice of whether to send dunning
notices to everyone or temporarily stop sending them, it shouldn't be
surprising which choice they made.

FLATZ, leading performance artist from Munich (Bavaria) recently advertised
"SOFTKILLER - the first buyable computer art virus". For MS-DOS systems,
you may buy a diskette (in limited version: 20 diskettes each 1,800 DM equiv.
about 1,100$; or unlimited version: 500 diskettes each 300 DM equiv. 185$)
which after start will display some FLATZ head on the screen while formatting
the disk. Advertised shortly before xmas as "the ultimate donation for PC
owners", FLATZ explicitly warns that SOFTKILLER overwrites disks on data and
will overwrite itself after execution.

After publication of this advertisement, Bavarian Criminal Agency became
involved to analyse whether this might imply a crime of "computer sabotage"
(German Penal Code, section 303b) according to which the destruction of
programs and data which are essential for some person or institution will be
prosecuted. In the analysis, FLATZ admitted that his software was not
self-reproducing and therefore no virus. Moreover, his "attack on the
computerworld" is mentioned in capital letters on the envelope. On the other
side, distribution via BBS (though not foreseen by him) this warning is lost.

At this time, no test or reverse engineering of SOFTKILLER has been done. 
Probably, it is technically not worth the effort. But with some probability, 
other artists may come up with similar "ideas". Happy,Healthy and Riskless 1993

An AP story in the Boulder Daily Camera (1/8/93) reports a familiar story with
a few new variations.

A private investigator and two police employees have been indicted by a Denver
grand jury for improperly obtaining the criminal histories of 8,559
individuals.  The Private Eye paid $3 to $5 per search and as much as $1,300
per week (he kept great records!).  The scheme unraveled when a co-worker of
the police employee who was doing the snooping became angry that her colleague
was spending so much time looking up names that she was falling behind in her
regular work.  So after seeing a "criminal history format" on her screen that
she was not supposed to be using, the co-worker turned her in.  A computer log
revealed that on the day she was caught, she had run checks on 95 people!  It
turns out that a transaction recording system allowed investigators to
reconstruct all 8559 criminal history searches.  With such a great logging
system it seems strange that no one noticed 8559 extra searches; if the
co-worker hadn't got the extra work dumped on her, these folks would still be
stealing criminal records.

Today's UK newspapers are full of the story on the British Airways (BA)
"dirty tricks" campaign against Virgin and their successful suing by
Richard Branson. Of particular relevance to "risks" is the following
extract from the Independent newspaper (p6, 12 January 1993):

  ... The [BA] team were told that in future, their key task would be
  to access highly confidential information from their rival's
  [Virgin's] computer system.
    "We were shown how to get the information by tapping into our computer
  terminals in the Helpline office. We tapped in with our regular BA code
  and called up the Virgin flight numbers".
    In common with many other airlines, Virgin rents out a segment of a
  vast computer known as Babs - British Airways Booking System. Mr Khalifa
  and his colleagues simply tapped into it. "We could see on the Babs
  computer system when flight is open [sic], when it closed, if it was
  delayed and how many passengers were due to board".
    For the next nine months the Helpline hackers provided BA with critical
  information on Virgin's flights.

I don't recall mention on Risks of the impending problems with modem networks.
The North American telephone numbering plan is being changed.  This is going
to gradually lead to problems for all the people with long distance numbers
that are pre-stored in documents, files, programs, and modems.

The change (as I understand it) is that the leading 1 digit should be used
ONLY when dialing outside the area code, rather than the current system that
imposes the need when dialing outside the local calling area.  Then the area
code restriction to the form x0x or x1x will be removed.  I expect the change
to be done carefully by the telco's so that mistakes will cause failure to
connect rather than incorrect connection.

Just to make things interesting, this change is being staged area code by area
code.  So for people who plan to fix their internal stored numbers you need to
know when your area is being changed.

FAA prohibits pilot knowing GPS altitude in IFR flight

I was recently informed that the KLN-90 GPS(Global Positioning System)
navigation unit used in airplanes was designed so that the pilot cannot
display the altitude the unit calculates from satellite data. It does display
the barometric altitude and will issue a warning if the barometric altitude
differs significantly from the GPS altitude.

On asking Bendix/King why they would deny a pilot information already computed
in the unit, the spokesperson explained that the calculated GPS altitude is
often several hundred feet different from the "officially correct" barometric
altitude, and that pilots might be so stupid as to try to fly by the GPS
altitude - thus putting themselves at risk of a collision. Accordingly, the
TSO(Technical Standards Order) by which the FAA defines approval of GPS
navigation systems for IFR(Instrument Flight Rules) prohibited them from
making GPS altitude information available to the pilot.

Last month I was flying in the clouds in mountains and experienced a failure
of the primary pressure altimeter in the aircraft. Cross checking a second
pressure altimeter with the GPS altitude on a non-TSO GPS navigator verified
that it was the primary altimeter that was wrong. Not having this information
could easily have resulted in my death.  I would much prefer to educate pilots
about GPS altitude errors than to deny them the possibility of having what
could be lifesaving information.

 Newsgroups: sci.electronics
 Subject: SCI.ELECTRONICS Phone fraud !!!
 Summary: A recent attempt to rip-off sci.electronics correspondents.
 Keywords: fraud, con artists, phone numbers
 Message-ID: &lt;C077BC.GBn@unix.portal.com&gt;
 Date: 1 Jan 93 23:16:23 GMT
 Sender: news@unix.portal.com
 Organization: Portal Communications  -- 408/973-9111 (voice) 408/973-8091  

 At about 6PM Thursday evening, I got a phone call. The operator said
that he had a collect call to me from Charles Pooley in New York. The
name was familiar, but I didn't remember exactly why. I said I would
accept the call, but then the "operator" said the call couldn't get
through because I had the call collect option blocked. He then said he
could pass the call through if I gave him my calling card number. I
said that I'd rather call Mr. Pooley myself, and could the "operator"
give me Mr. Pooley's number.  There was a pause, then a phone number
with a San Jose area code! It didn't occur to me until later that , if
the call was from New York, why was the call-from number (408) !??!

 I remembered that Charles and I had been corresponding on a topic from
sci.electronics. I was lucky enough to have an old message from him lying
around, and emailed him a message about my mysterious phone call.

 Charles Pooley replyed to me today -- turns out the guy tried the same scam
on him too! But this time, the bogus operator said the collect call was from
me to Charles! Charles was also wary, and didn't give the crook his calling
card number.

 So - WATCH OUT! How this con artist chose my name and Charles' to try is
beyond me. As far as public postings in sci.electronics, I don't think Charles
and I had exchanged more than four public postings. Most of our correspondence
has been via "private" email.

 This has definitely raised my paranoia level. If, out of the millions of
public postings during 1992, someone should choose two correspondents who have
exchange only a slight amount of messages ....  I mean, why us?  Or, is there
a "boilerroom" operation going on, with a bunch of phony operators, armed with
USENET listings -- calling people with this con?

 OH! - I may have put my phone number in one of my public
sci.electronics postings - that's probably how the scamsters make
their selection. Makes sense ...

CHILDREN BEWARE!!!

Alas, Microsoft isn't the only software company sliding corrections in without
notice -- there are (at least) two versions of Digital Research's (really
wonderful) DR-DOS 6.0 floating around out there as well.  In this case, the
problem isn't quite so critical: the early version will not run Windows 3.1,
apparently because of some hooks Microsoft inserted (rampant speculation).
Windows 3.0 will run, however.  The new version, which has been fairly freely
distributed, but which has the SAME version number, corrects the Windows
incompatibility (which some might call an advantage).  DR-DOS users should
check to make sure that their COMMAND.COM is dated 4-07-92 (or later?).

For me, this has created no serious problems, but I can forsee
situations in which failure to adhere to a reasonable numbering system
could lead to all kinds of headaches -- "What version of our software
are you using?" "Version 6.37a."  "Yes, but WHICH version 6.37a...?"

&gt; So in the face of unreasonable people (dictators, etc.), perhaps we
&gt; need to use a floating point representation for the exchange rates
&gt; - but I do think that one decimal digit for the exponent should be
&gt; adequate.

He walks right into it!

According to the Guinness Book of World Records, in June 1946 the
Hungarian pengo [two acute accents on the o] reached a valuation of
1 / 1.3e20 of the gold pengo of 1931.  Now I don't know what *that*
value was, but I think we can assume that the exchange rates with
at least some other currencies must have exceeded 1e19.

The German inflation of 1923 also went well past the 1e10 mark --
no pun intended -- if I recall correctly.

      ^^^
     I wouldn't be too certain. I don't have it hand, but I recall an
occasion when a South American currency (Paraguay?) depreciated to
billions (43 billion?) to one versus it's gold equivalent (it's in the
Guinness book of records).

     It is easy to underestimate the size of data a program may be asked to
deal with, especially several years down the line. (See the Bank of New York
problems, recorded here several years ago, when a program suddenly had more
than 2^16 transactions/day). The cautious programmer will be generous to a
fault. The best case I've seen was in a banking program where dollar amounts
were stored as 96 bit integer quantities of pennies - this rolls over at
nearly $8E26, or about 792 trillion trillion dollars.

The lack of need for seven digit accuracy is correct, the single digit
exponent is not.  I have a German banknote of 1,000,000,000 Mark, barely
enough to buy a bread by one month after issue.  I have also seen German
stamps of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 Mark (Eine Trillionen Mark, German
trillions of course).  That was in the early twenties of course.  And I add
that at that time Germany was a democratic country, no unreasonable people
were involved.

synthesis and assessment of complex, computer-based, mission-critical
systems.  Many DoD related systems tend to be large, complex,
fault tolerant, distributed, real-time, time-critical systems.
Of interest is the development and enhancement of the system level
ability to specify, capture, synthesize, analyze, model, prototype,
test and implement such systems.  The emphasis is on developing forward
engineering capabilities; however, reverse engineering capabilities will
also be addressed.  

                               TOPICS OF INTEREST

    INTEGRATION OF CAPTURE, OPTIMIZATION, AND ASSESSMENT TECHNOLOGIES 
    INTEGRATION OF DEPENDABLE SYSTEM DESIGN INTO SYSTEM ENGINEERING 
    INTEGRATION OF SECURE SYSTEMS DESIGN INTO SYSTEM ENGINEERING
    APPLICATION OF SIMULATION, MODELING, MEASUREMENT, METRICS, 
                             AND PROTOTYPING WITHIN SYSTEM ENGINEERING
    REQUIREMENTS ELICITATION, SPECIFICATION AND TRACEABILITY  

    Authors are requested to submit (5) copies of the paper of no more than
7,000 words (5 pages or less). Include a cover letter listing the author(s),
paper title, area of interest, and the name, address, FAX, telephone number,

     Hertz Rent-A-Car has recently implemented an advanced fuel purchase
option.  The option permits drivers to pay for gas at the average self service
price in the area of the car rental.  The option only benefits those drivers
who use more than a full tank of gas.  Otherwise, you must show your gas
receipts upon returning the car, if you claim that you are returning the car
with a full tank. 
     An interesting quirk of this system is the programming of the portable
check-in palm-top computers used by the attendants who wander along the lanes
where you return your car.  If you have driven less than 50 miles, the system
is programmed to automatically charge you $5.00 for gas, even if you have a
receipt showing that you have filled it up.  Hmmm... let's see... if the
average distance driven by those who have driven less than 50 miles is about
35 miles, that equates to about one gallon of gas for the $5.00 charge (vs.
about $1.15 at the tank).  Are Ross Perot's gas prices already here?  To
override the check-out slips provided by the attendants from their palm-tops,
you have to take your receipt into the main check-in area.  If you're in a
hurry, chances are you won't.  Then Hertz has the full tank of gas *and* your
$5.00.  Luckily, my attendant informed me of this quirk.  Chalk up another one
for American ingenuity!

When I read this passage, I knew I'd heard a story somewhere like this before.
It turns out the story is in the Nintendo Entertainment System manual!

The Super Nintendo Entertainment System "Consumer Information and Precautions
Booklet", which comes with SNES and NES systems sold in the US (and the UK, to
the best of my knowledge), issues the following warning:

     EPILEPSY WARNING: READ BEFORE USING YOUR NES OR SUPER NES
 
     A very small portion of the population may experience 
     epileptic seizures when viewing certain kinds of flashing 
     lights or patterns that are commonly present in outr daily 
     environment. These persons may experience seizures while 
     watching some kinds of television pictures or playing 
     certain video games. Players who have not had any previous 
     seizures may nonetheless have an undetected epileptic 
     condition. Consult your physician before playing video games 
     if you have an epileptic condition. Consult your physician 
     if you experience any of the following symptoms while 
     playing video games: altered vision, muscle twitching, other 
     involuntary movements, loss of awareness of your 
     surroundings, mental confusion, and/or convulsions. 

Looks like this British case is another classic version of RTFM!

Owners of Commodore 64's might remember a program in the C64 Programming
manual (I think) which changed the color palette for the text, screen and
border as fast as the 64 was capable.  There was a warning message to the
effect of "don't run this if you or someone in your family has a history of
epileptic problems".

Over the holidays, in the "Aberdeen Press and Journal" and its evening
equivalent, the "Evening Express", was a description of a trial scheme for
holding patients medical records on cards:

  ... The 750,000 pound patient data-card system is one of the first of its
  type in Europe, according to one of its pioneering developers, Dr James
  Beattie.  Around 8000 hi-tech cards, the size of a credit card, will be
  distributed to patients registered with the Inverurie Health Centre.  NHS
  Chief Executive in Scotland, Don Cruickshank, said if it proves successful,
  the system could become the basis for an all-Scotland one.  He said: 'This
  project has the potential to greatly improve the communication of individual
  medical histories and to which the individual patients will themselves have
  access'. Special machines which can read the coded cards will be installed
  at various points in the North-east.

[The article then states that the machines will be installed in the health
centre, another doctor's surgery, three outpatients clinics in Aberdeen (for
diabetes, asthma and hypertension) and "chemists shops in Inverurie and
Kintore"]

  ... When a patient has treatment from a clinic, their card will note what
  has happened and course of action taken which will be available to their own
  doctor much more quickly than at present ", he [Dr Beattie] said.  Dr
  Beattie hopes cards will be distributed in about a years time. The pilot
  project will run until 1996, when it will be evaluated by health chiefs.

[What intrigued me first was the level of security: the Evening Express of the
same day was more explicit on some technical details:]

  Plastic cards which can hold more than 1,000 pages of information on NHS
  patients...  To maintain confidentiality, the cards can be read only by
  special machines. A portable version will be used by GPs on home visits. Mr
  Cruickshank said patients will also have access to their own medical
  records, using number similar to those used for bank cash cards.

[It also mentions that half the population will remain as a control group for
the study.]

Brief note for those not in the UK: The NHS (National Health Service) is an arm
of the government which is responsible for the vast majority of medical
services in the UK. Thus, perhaps 90+% of the population would be involved if
the scheme were implemented nationwide. I'm not going to dwell on why I think
this is of interest to Risks, but I'll mention two points:

1) If an entire medical record is stored on card, it will contain a great deal
of very confidential information (about as much so as it gets) and a lot of
very important information: how secure is a chemist's shop for such a system?
Also, such a system on its own would be very vulnerable to card failure.

2) Because the cards are read electronically, there is a risk/benefit in terms
of doing computerised card searches remotely (although the article doesn't say
the machines will be networked, I can imagine that happening eventually.

                     [I didn't know there were any 750,000 pound patients!  
                     Wow.  That is really heavy.  Somewhat like the 
                     seven foot patrolmen I read about last week.  PGN]

To: privacy@cv.vortex.com
Subject: DoJ Has NOT "Authorized" Keystroke Monitoring

The Subject line on the recent [PRIVACY] reposting by David Banisar of the 7
Dec 92 advisory from CERT/CC is highly misleading and inappropriate.  As with
some newspapers, it is important that people read more than just the
headlines.

The Department of Justice hasn't "authorized" anything.  Rather, they are
advising system administrators that certain activities, namely the monitoring
or recording of user-to-computer session transmissions (hence "keystroke
monitoring") MAY be found illegal in certain circumstances and that notice
should be given to users.

The CERT advisory was extracted from a letter to the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) from DoJ.  Justice asked NIST in its role of
providing computer security guidance to Government to circulate the letter and
provide appropriate guidance.  We have made the letter available, without
comment, through several government and other channels (including CERT, I4,
etc.).

The letter is intended to advise system administrators of an ambiguity in
U.S. law that makes it unclear whether session monitoring, often conducted
by system administrators who suspect unauthorized activity, is basically the
same as an unauthorized telephone wiretap.  I repeat, the law is *unclear*
-- and the fact that one can argue either way on the issue does not clarify
the law as currently written.  DoJ advises, therefore, that if system
administrators are conducting session monitoring or anticipate the need for
such monitoring, they should ensure that all system users be notified that
such monitoring may be undertaken.

The DoJ advice, therefore, is not "authorizing" anything -- even implicitly.
They have simply observed the types of activities that diligent system
managers often undertake (a la Cliff Stoll in "The Cuckoo's Egg") in an
attempt to protect their systems from unauthorized users, and they have
rendered some prudent legal advice.

Clearly, there are lots of issues here -- technical and otherwise -- that
will need to be discussed and sorted out.  Indeed, changes in
agency/organizational policies and even the law are probably needed.
However, none of this changes the fact that system administrators need now
to be aware of the potential impact of their activities, and the DoJ advice
attempts to do this.

We (NIST) are developing additional guidance for system administrators to
assist them in implementing the DoJ recommendations.  I expect that others
will be doing likewise.  We also hope to encourage discussion of the related
technical and other issues.  In the meantime, system administrators are well
advised to read the basic DoJ advice and examine their systems and agency
policies to determine if, where, and how notices should be provided to users.

We welcome comments and suggestions, particularly regarding approaches that
various organizations take in dealing with this issue.

In response to an article I wrote, W. Murray (WHMurray@DOCKMASTER.NCSC.MIL)
cautions against applying the orange book in situations for which it was never
intended.  While the orange book is not an appropriate criteria for many
environments, it is currently the ONLY criteria regularly used in the United
States to assess the security features of operating systems--and as such,
there is a lot that can be learned from it, even in non-military environments.

It is an unfortunate fact that many vendors of commercial operating systems
either do not know or do not care about security--the result being that most
of us do not have much in the way of security in the computer systems we use
every day.  If we insist on keeping the bugs of DOS and UNIX for backward
compatibility into eternity, we will never have secure systems.

Re: Version numbers (Marchant-Shapiro, <A HREF="/Risks/14.26.html">RISKS-14.26</A>)

&gt; ... "Version 6.37a."  "Yes, but WHICH version 6.37a...?"

Actually this is nothing new. My other hobby is automobiles and we regularly
get into arguments as to whether certain options were available, both sides
citing references as "proof".

A recent case concerned the Pontiac GTO "Judge" in 1970 - for years there had
been a rumour of a 455 option that year but all available sales literature
showed only a 400 engine. Recently a brochure turned up dated November that
looked exactly (same cover artwork and everything as the September issue which
is very common). but which did mention a 455 engine option. Turns out that 17
cars were built.

Shortly after the Titanic incident, the White Star Line refitted the Olympic
with an extensive increase in the double hull coverage also fitted to the
third ship in the series (the ill-fated Britannic which incidentally sunk 
much faster than its sibling), along with a number of other "safety" features.

The ones I liked the best were the giant cranes used with rotary lifeboat
launchers. Originally billed as being able to launch all boats from either
side of the ship, there was one minor difficulty - some of the smokestacks 
would have had to be jettisoned first. Minor problem.  

This was also apparently "slipstreamed", at least I never saw a mention of 
"Triple Screw Steamship Revision A" - but then what can you expect from
a company that would add a fourth stack for pure sales appeal (well maybe 
the cigars in the lounge did need that much ventilation...).

The fact is that manufacturers have been quietly fixing products at least
since the introduction of mass production and it is always a stressful time 
for the engineers when the easy changes of development are replaced by the 
rigorous requirements of configuration control. Sometimes even management
is not told about such "fixes", occasionally with disastrous results (it is 
very easy to remove the motor mounts in one of my cars so that the engine can 
be raised allowing the spark plugs to be changed. Seems that the power steering
was in the way of an air conditioner duct so it was moved just a wee bit 8*).

"Public Service for Hackers"    by John Marcham          
_Cornell_Alumni_News_ magazine

Two former [Cornell] students will develop a computer program to make it easier
for a quadriplegic man in Tennessee to use a computer he owns, as part of their
punishment for launching a computer virus that damaged programs and caused hard
drive crashes last February.

David Blumenthal '96 and Mark A. Pilgrim '94 were sentenced by a Tompkins
County Court judge to pay restitution to users whose computers were jammed by
the men's virus, at and near Stanford University and in Japan, and to perform
ten hours of community service per week for a year.

A computer buff who knew the quadriplegic and heard of the Cornell virus case
wrote the judge in Ithaca, and asked if the students' public service could be
worked off developing a less expensive and cumbersome program for the disabled
man, who uses a mouthstick and outdated software to operate his McIntosh
computer.

The judge and the former students agreed to the proposal: the students start
work in November. A third former student, found guilty of a lesser infraction,
was asked by not required to do public service, and declined.

After nearly two _months_ at the integrator to repair a bad motherboard, I
finally got my computer back last night (tip 'o the hat to UPS for leaving it
outside of my apartment in near-zero (Fahrenheit) weather)... and it still has
frequent parity errors.  In fact, the problem is worse now than two months
ago!

A curious fact has come up: I ordered a 20 MHz system, and have an invoice
stating they shipped a 20 MHz system, but apparently they actually shipped 25
MHz systems.  The manager I talked to claimed he was doing me a "favor" by
shipping a better system -- and doesn't seem to understand my statement that I
would have refused a 25 MHz system out of concern for unreliability.

(When I purchased my system a year ago 16 MHz 386-SXs were standard and 20 MHz
systems were just starting to get carried.  A 25 MHz would have been
first-generation and hence rather unreliable, as my extensive down-time
demonstrates).

The RISK of having your licence revoked is greater than merely that of having
the same name and birthdate as another person, as discussed in RISKS 14.26 by
Bruce Hayden - you need only a *similar* name and birthdate in common.

Yesterday I received in the mail from the state of Maryland, in which I live,
a notice that my driver's licence is revoked based on a DWI arrest by a person
with a similar name in 1985.  On all official documents, including driver's
licenses, I use my full name William James Roberts.  The miscreant with the
same birthdate and named James Roberts resided in Florida, a state I have
never visited, and was arrested in Tennessee.  To have my license reinstated,
I must *prove* to the hearing *board* that I am not the DWI James Roberts,
something I suspect it will not be easy to do.

If one has a real DWI he gets a day in *court*, but if one has merely
a computer generated DWI he has no such right.

The notice indicated that James Roberts had no sex (sigh), weighed 0 pounds,
was 0 ft 0 in in height, and had blank eyes.  So the folks who programmed the
database join use the fact that the information you are required to have on
your driver's license is not useful when they want to roll up the numbers on
license revocations.  I suspect that if I were Barbara James Roberts (sex:F),
I would have gotten the same notice.  In that case it might be easier to
fight.  But what if I were a woman with an ambiguous middle name, say Barbara
Kelly Roberts and the revokee were just Kelly Roberts, really a male but to
Maryland an M or F?  Then I would again be in difficulties.

The next step in the widening scope of the database joins may be just to use
your birthdate and the Soundex code of your last name.  That should
considerably improve the numbers achieved by the "responsible" bureaucrats in
their hunt for more revocations.

A common mistake (and sometimes, I suspect, a deliberate decision) in system
design is to assume that things that are purportedly the same in theory are
actually the same in practice.  Thus, for example, politicians who want to
prohibit people from using illegal drugs think it is equivalent to punish
people who fail drug tests, forgetting that there are sometimes false
positives, fraudulently altered results, and so on.

So it is with the driving story.  Someone else turns up who appears enough
like you, at least superficially, and suddenly it's up to you to prove
innocence.

Here's another example.  This was told to me second hand, so I won't
swear it's true, but it's plausible enough and the lesson is there anyway.

New Jersey, like many (all?) other states, has a mechanism for revoking
driver's licenses for various reasons.  Moreover, they have laws mandating
stiff penalties for people caught driving with a revoked license.  But
how does one tell if a license has been revoked?  New Jersey's answer
is to have a list of revoked licenses; their law specifically prohibits
driving while one's name is on the revoked list.

I know a guy who says his name was placed on the revoked list due to a
clerical error.  He had not done anything wrong, and had never been informed
that his name was on the list.  He found out about it when he was stopped for
speeding; of course he was immediately charged with driving while on the
revoked list.

At the hearing, the state readily admitted that his name had been placed
there in error.  However, they argued that that was irrelevant: the law
prohibits driving while one's name is on the list and that's just what he
had done.  The judge had no option but to find him guilty.

	"The change (as I understand it) is that the leading 1 digit
	should be used ONLY when dialing outside the area code, ...

No, the change is that a leading 1 will always be followed by an area code.
The old practice of dialing 1-nnn-nnnn to make a long distance call within
one's area code is being abolished.  This will separate the area code and
exchange number spaces, which at present are distinguished by the second digit
(0 or 1 for area code, other for exchange).  This is vital because North
America has run out of area codes.

In Oregon, we will convert to this scheme in July, and we will still use a
leading 1 when making toll calls within the area code, but we will have to
punch the area code as well.  This preserves the characteristic that "a
leading 1 means you're paying money," considered desirable.

You will probably both get dozens of messages about this...anyway:

In Risks 14.26, Rob Horn stated that the North American dialing scheme
is changing; but in fact, it started changing (at least) 5 or 6 years ago
and the dialing scheme is no longer consistent around the country.

In the old days, area codes were 3 digits of the pattern x0x or x1x;
prefixes (the first 3 digits of a "local" number) could not be either
of these patterns.  Toll calls within your area code were dialed as 
1 + number; toll calls outside of your area code were dialed as 1 + area
code + number.

When area codes started running out of prefixes, the dialing
instructions started changing.  I know of three different dialing
schemes currently being used in the U.S.: 

(1) The original scheme, described in the paragraph above, 
(2) The scheme used in Southern California, in which you do not dial
    "1" to call a number in your area code (even if it is a toll call)
(3) The scheme used in the Detroit area, in which you dial 1 + 313
    to place a toll call within your area code.

When they start using area codes that don't conform to the x0x or x1x format,
any regions still using dialing scheme (1) will have to switch to either
scheme (2) or scheme (3).

What's worse is that some areas (like California) have chosen to go strictly
with "+1 means area code", while other areas (such as Oregon and Washington)
have retained the "+1 means long distance" meaning as well.  This gets
confusing for computer autodialers, as well as humans.

This means that in-area-code-but-long-distance numbers are dialed differently
in the two plans:

Local, in-area-code: both=xxx-xxxx
Local, out-area-code: Oregon=n/a, California=1 yyy xxx-xxxx
Long distance, in-area-code: Oregon=1 yyy xxx-xxxx, California: xxx-xxxx
Long distance, out-area-code: both=1 yyy xxx-xxxx

(Oregon doesn't have any local calls that are in a differing area code.)

Blech.  Your PUC at work. :-)

What's happened in 313 is exactly the opposite -- we now have to dial
1-313-xxx-yyyy for calls WITHIN the area code, instead of just dialing
1-xxx-yyyy.  This allows them to use the x[01]x prefixes as new exchanges
(postpones the need to split the area code by a few years).  I hadn't thought
of it before, but of course, when this is done everywhere, then it will be
possible to use (almost) any 3 digit area code, too.

&gt; Subject: heard on BBC this morning

&gt; At the tail end of the sports news at the end of NewsHour, the morning BBC
&gt; show heard on WBUR, was the mention of an error in a betting computer at a
&gt; greyhound race track.  The computer continued to accept bets well after the
&gt; conclusion of the race.  Needless to say, many gleeful track-betters bought
&gt; tickets for the dog that had already won, and claimed their winnings.

&gt; The article also mentioned that some people are just born losers.  
&gt; After the race had finished, 139 people bet on dogs that had *lost*!

&gt; The government management reported that they intended to reclaim all of the
&gt; unfairly-won monies.  However, they stated that they intend to *keep* the
&gt; money from the losers.

There is a long article in the NYTimes Science section on Jan 19, 1993, about
the crash last week of the Earthwinds balloon just after it took off to try to
fly around the world.  The three men of the crew have been trading accusations
since the crash, and many people blame the problems on the lack of "adequate
engineering and planning, particularly in the integration of its labyrinthine
electronic and plumbing systems".

Paris Charges Ex-Official in Air Crash

COLMAR, France (AP) - A former official of the French domestic airline
Air-Inter was charged Monday with negligent homicide in the crash of a
passenger jet a year ago that killed 87 people.  Jacques Rantet, Air-Inter's
former director of flight security, was charged ... with negligence leading to
death and injury in the crash of the Airbus A320.  Nine people survived after
the airliner crashed into a mountainside as it approached Strasbourg airport
on Jan. 20, 1992.

Phantom Access Foils Cracking Attempt 01/18/93 NEW YORK, NEW YORK,
U.S.A.,1993 JAN 18 (NB) -- An attempt to illegally break into, or "crack"
the "Mindvox" conferencing stem contained in Phantom Access, a flat-rate
New York-based online service recently featured in various news
publications, was detected and rebuffed. 

Bruce Fancher, co-owner of Phantom Access, told Newsbytes, "There was no
real damage and we have notified all of our users about the attempt in the
hope that they will be even more conscious of security. The nature of this
attempt points out one of the things that users of any on-line system must
be aware of in order to protect her/his privacy."

The attempt came to the attention of the owners of the system, Fancher and
Patrick Kroupa, when subscribers reported receiving the following message: 

  It has been brought to my attention that your account has been 'hacked'
  by an outside source. The charges added were quite significant which is
  how the error was caught. Please temporarily change your password to
  'DPH7' so that we can judge the severity of the intrusion. I will notify
  you when the problems has been taken care of. Thank you for your help in
  this matter. -System Administrator"

The system owners immediately sent a message to all subscribers declaring the
message to be fraudulent. In addition to pointing out the textual errors in
the message -- for example, Mindvox is a "flat rate" system and charges are
not accumulated -- the owners admonished users to both safeguard their
passwords and insure that they are not easy to decipher.

Fancher told Newsbytes that the review of Mindvox in a recent issue of Mondo
2000, its mention in an issue of Forbes, and his speaking engagements on
behalf of the system have led to more rapid growth than had been anticipated.
He said, "We are moving to larger space on February 1st and will be upgrading
our equipment from a single Next system to multiple Suns. We will also
increase the number of dial-in ports and greatly increase the speed of our
Internet connection. We are very grateful for the user response to date."

A student on a short course on software reliability that I gave late last year 
informed me that Lautro, the UK insurance companies' watch-dog organisation, 
has recently been putting the wind up a lot of companies by doing spot checks 
on computer systems. 

Lautro has real "teeth", and can stop a company from trading if they are not 
satisfied with the service it provides to the public. Nowadays, this includes 
deficiencies in service due to computer cock-ups. 

Apparently, a number of insurance companies are beginning to take software 
reliability rather seriously all of a sudden! 

Unfortunately, we only had time for a short conversation, and I do not have 
any further information. I would be extremely interested to know, for example, 
what Lautro measure when they perform their audit.

"GSA Memos Reveal that FBI Wiretap Plan was 
Opposed by Government's Top Telecomm Purchaser"

The New York Times reported today on a document obtained by CPSR
through the Freedom of Information Act.  ("FBI's Proposal on Wiretaps Draws
Criticism from G.S.A.," New York Times, January 15, 1993, p. A12)

The document, an internal memo prepared by the General Services
Administration, describes many problems with the FBI's wiretap plan and also
shows that the GSA strongly opposed the sweeping proposal.  The GSA is the
largest purchaser of telecommunications equipment in the federal government.

The FBI wiretap proposal, first announced in March of 1992, would have
required telephone manufacturers to design all communications equipment to
facilitate wire surveillance.  The proposal was defeated last year. The FBI
has said that it plans to reintroduce a similar proposal this year.

The documents were released to Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility, a public interest organization, after CPSR submitted Freedom
of Information Act requests about the FBI's wiretap plan to several federal
agencies last year.

The documents obtained by CPSR reveal that the GSA, which is responsible for
equipment procurement for the Federal government, strongly opposed two
different versions of the wiretap plan developed by the FBI.  According to the
GSA, the FBI proposal would complicate interoperability, increase cost, and
diminish privacy and network security.  The GSA also stated that the proposal
could "adversely _affect national security._"

In the second memo, the GSA concluded that it would be a mistake to give the
Attorney General sole authority to waive provisions of the bill.

The GSA's objections to the proposal were overruled by the Office of
Management and Budget, a branch of the White House which oversees
administrative agencies for the President.  However, none of GSA's objections
were disclosed to the public or made available to policy makers in Washington.

Secrecy surrounds this proposal.  Critical sections of a report on the FBI
wiretap plan prepared by the General Accounting Office were earlier withhold
after the FBI designated these sections "National Security Information."
These sections included analysis by GAO on alternatives to the FBI's wiretap
plan.  CPSR is also pursuing a FOIA lawsuit to obtain the FBI's internal
documents concerning the wiretap proposal.

The GSA memos, the GAO report and others that CPSR is now seeking indicate
that there are many important documents within the government which have still
not been disclosed to the public.

               Due Date:     5/5/92

Brenda Robinson (S)

After KMR consultations, we still _"cannot support"_ Draft Bill. No. 118 as
substantially revised by Justice after its purported full consideration of
other agencies' "substantive concerns."

Aside from the third paragraph of our 3/13/92 attachment response for the
original draft bill, which was adopted as GSA's position (copy attached),
Justice has failed to fully address other major GSA concerns (i.e.,
technological changes and associated costs).

Further, by merely eliminating the FCC and any discussion of cost issues in
the revision, we can not agree as contended by Justice that it now " ... takes
care of kinds of problems raised by FCC and others ...."

Finally, the revision gives Justice sole unilateral exclusive authority to
enforce and except or waive the provisions of any resultant Iaw in Federal
District Courts. Our other concerns are also shown in the current attachment
for the revised draft bill.

Once again OMB has not allowed sufficient time for a more through review, a
comprehensive internal staffing, or a formal response.

                          ATTACHMENT
                 REVISED JUSTICE DRAFT BILL
                       DIGITAL TELEPHONY

The proposed legislation could have a widespread impact on the government's
ability to acquire _new_ telecommunications equipment and provide electronic
communications services.

_Existing_ Federal government telecommunications resources will be affected by
the proposed new technology techniques and equipment. An incompatibility and
interoperability of existing Federal government telecommunications system, and
resources would result due to the new technological changes proposed.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been removed from the
legislation, but the Justice implementation may require modifications to the
"Communications Act of 1934," and other FCC policies and regulations to remove
inconsistencies. This could also cause an unknown effect on the wire and
electronic communications systems operations, services, equipment, and
regulations within the Federal government. Further, to change a major portion
of the United States telecommunications infrastructure (the public switched
network within eighteen months and others within three years) seems very
optimistic, no matter how trivial or minimal the proposed modifications are to
implement.

In the proposed legislation the Attorney General has sole _unilateral
exclusive_ authority to enforce, grant exceptions or waive the provisions of
any resultant law and enforce it in Federal District Courts. The Attorney
General would, as appropriate, only "consult" with the FCC, Department of
Commerce, or Small Business Administration. The Attorney General has exclusive
authority in Section 2 of the legislation; it appears the Attorney General has
taken over several FCC functions and placed the FCC in a mere consulting
capacity.

The proposed legislation would apply to all forms of wire and electronic
communications to include computer data bases, facsimile, imagery etc., as
well as voice transmissions.

The proposed legislation would assist eavesdropping by law enforcement, but it
would also apply to users who acquire the technology capability and make it
easier for criminals, terrorists, foreign intelligence (spies) and computer
hackers to electronically penetrate the public network and pry into areas
previously not open to snooping. This situation of easier access due to new
technology changes could therefore affect _national security_.

                            (1)

   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The proposed legislation does not address standards and specifications for
telecommunications equipment nor security considerations. These issues must be
addressed as they effect both the government and private industry. There are
also civil liberty implications and the public's constitutional rights to
privacy which are not mentioned.

It must be noted that equipment already exists that can be used to wiretap the
digital communications lines and support court-authorized wiretaps, criminal
investigations and probes of voice communications. The total number of
interception applications authorized within the United States (Federal and
State) has been averaging under nine hundred per year. There is concern that
the proposed changes are not cost effective and worth the effort to revamp all
the existing and new telecommunications systems.

The proposed bill would have to have the FCC or another agency approve or
reject new telephone equipment mainly on the basis of whether the FBI has the
capability to wiretap it. The federal-approval process is normally lengthy
and the United States may not be able to keep pace with foreign industries to
develop new technology and install secure communications. As a matter of
interest, the proposed restrictive new technology could impede the United
States' ability to compete in digital telephony and participate in the
international trade arena.

Finally, there will be unknown associated costs to implement the proposed new
technological procedures and equipment.  These costs would be borne by the
Federal government, consumers, and all other communications ratepayers to
finance the effort. Both the Federal government and private industry
communications regular phone service, data transmissions, satellite and
microwave transmissions, and encrypted communications could be effected at
increased costs.

&gt;From The Japan Times Wednesday January 13,1993

  SAPPORO (Kyodo)

  Four men went on trial here Tuesday for allegedly taking out residency
  register microfilm from a Sapporo ward office, then selling duplicates of it
  that they had made.  The defendants are accused [of] duplicating all of the
  Sapporo citizens' residency registrations, using the microfilm and selling
  it to direct marketing companies.

  Katsumi Shibuki, 32, an office worker of Chuo Ward Sapporo, Jun Hongo, 24,
  a company executive of the same ward, and two others were charged with
  theft.

  During their first trial hearing at the Sapporo District Court, all four
  admitted taking microfilm that is kept at the ward office for resident
  perusal.  However, an attorney for Hongo entered a plea of innocent of
  behalf of his client, contending that the defendants took out the microfilm
  only for temporary use and therefore the act does not constitute theft.

  The three other defendants refused to enter a plea Tuesday as their
  attorneys argued that legal problems are involved in charging their
  clients with theft for their act.  In their opening statement, prosecutors
  said the four made several preliminary inspections of the ward office
  where the microfilm was kept and then purchased a microfilm duplicator,
  thus premeditating the crime.  They noted that Shibuki borrowed the
  microfilm on the pretext of reading it, but his accomplices took it out
  and duplicated it in their Sapporo office.

  The prosecutors charged that the defendants collaborated and each assumed
  a different role.  According to the indictments, the four were accused of
  taking out 482 residency register microfilm entries kept at all of
  Sapporo's eight ward offices between April and May 1992.

A few comments.  Japan has a universal citizen registration law that requires
all residents to report their place of residence to their local government.
This is in addition to a family registration system that tracks all births
deaths, marriages and divorces.  That data may be similarly ill secured
however it is of less interest to direct marketeers than the residence data
which is kept up to date within about 15 days.  Although this system is very
ancient the law regarding data security has obviously not caught up with the
technology.  As more and more local governments are keeping this data on
personal computers all of the attendant risks to privacy will appear.
Obviously what is needed is a law that relates specifically to the data and
not to the media. It is clear from the article that the prosecutors believe
that the accused did something illegal but they don't seem to have a statute
appropriate for the circumstances.  A final observation is that while the case
for theft seems very weak to someone familiar with American or English law
things in Japan are not so obvious.  People have been convicted in Japan for
intent to commit a felony when no felony was actually committed.  The courts
may also take a similarly broad interpretation of theft even though the
physical objects taken were promptly returned.

Of course, the search for most of these conditions are among the _goals_ of

The General Accounting Office (GAO) has issued a report summarizing the
findings from its recent studies of software problems in major weapons.  The
report is entitled "MISSION CRITICAL SYSTEMS: Defense Attempting to Address
Major Software Challenges."  Copies may be obtained by calling GAO's
distribution center at 301-275-6241 and requesting IMTEC-93-13, dated December
24, 1992 (a nice Christmas present for Congressman Dellums, who is now
ascending to chair the Committee on Armed Services of the House of
Representatives.)

Some may be interested to know that GAO has virtually decided to abolish its
Information Management and Technology Division.  Future investigations of
information system failures will be carried out by the program divisions.
I've indicated to our congressional affairs representative at GAO that I don't
think much of this, particularly with the Government's well-known difficulties
in designing, procuring, managing and maintaining large-scale systems.  Sorry
to say my views didn't appear to derail the express train.

A snippet in today's Melbourne daily - "The Age" (21 Jan '93):

"Television sets were once accused of killing flies and video games are
still suspected of prompting epileptic fits.  But blowing up a petrol
station?  That, it seems, is the province of the mobile phone.

As a warning Shell has issued in the UK makes clear, mobile phones can
do more than propel private conversations on to front pages
[sorry Chuck].  According to British Shell, service station customers who
use mobile phones while filling their cars could ignite petrol vapo[u]r
through sparks emitted by the phones' electromagnetic radiation.

And that is not all.  A man in Florida is suing a mobile phone maker claiming
the antenna on one of its phones caused excessive exposure to the microwave
radiation it emits.  This, he claims, contributed to a brain cancer that
killed his wife.  ..."

Is it safer to smoke at a petrol station?

We've had walkie talkies (ok - two way radios) for years with no
perceivable or admitted risk to the health of users.  I presume mobile
phones have less power output than their predecessors, as area
transponders/repeaters/xceivers  are likely to be more sensitive than
2-ways, and are located to obviate high output end-user devices.

Nevertheless, I was reminded of EMR's existence just recently.  I've purchased
a Heart Rate Monitor (HRM) to monitor the quality &amp; consistency of my runs.
It's a two piece type: one is a band around the chest, which transmits to a
digital receiver on the wrist.  Now, apart from my curiosity about how this
works (ie, what is transmitted &amp; how) not getting me anywhere (this is a
consumer device), I was intrigued with its performance in the field.

My running route takes me under some high tension lines.  Guess what?  The HRM
goes bonkers!  At first I thought it was just the transmitter not fitted
properly, but I eliminated this as the result here is totally different.  It
took a few more runs under these lines to recognise the cause.  I don't think
I could survive a heart rate of 228-230 beats/minute!  On checking the manual,
it warns of strange behaviour (the device, not the user) under HT lines.

With the plethora of EMR everywhere, I wonder if strange behaviour in
_humans_ is the only outlook for the future...

A Reuters report found in the NY Times (21 Jan 1993) states that computer
disks holding secret information on Brazil's banking reserves have disappeared
from the central bank.  The federal police are investigating the loss.
According to the report, President Itamar Franco "took the unusual step" of
releasing information on the reserves to offset any damage or financial
speculation from loss of the disks.  The disks held information on day-to-day
reserve operations and details like where the reserves are invested, what they
consisted of and how the reserves were generated.

COMMENTS: This disappearance may be related to ex-President Collar's
involvement in the looting of Brazil.  At a minimum, the data disappearance
seems to be another indication of the Post-Hacker Era, where governments and
companies have learned that computers can be used as an essential aspect of
crime and/or to cover up a crime.  The lines between "hacker" activities and
"legitimate" activities may become increasingly less clear.  In order to
commit a white collar or economic crime, individuals or organizations will
almost have to use computer techniques.  While there continues to be an (often
unconscious) image that many have that computer crime is "bad individuals"
against "good" organizations, the Organization as Computer Criminal is rapidly
becoming a serious problem.  One but certainly not the only instance of this
is the recent British Airways's penetration of Virgin Air's reservations
system.

The Evening Post, Wellington, New Zealand, 27th January, 1993 (Excerpted)

ACC Promises Nothing

  A computer glitch two weeks ago means some accident compensation clients
have been sent multiple identical letters promising them cheques for $0.00.
Teacher Angela Watt received three envelopes yesterday from the Accident
Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Corporation relating to her son
Andrew, who sprained his ankle while picking apricots.  The first letter gave
Andrew's medical fee number and requested that he keep it in a safe place. The
second did the same thing but added mysteriously that "although you have
claimed $0.00, legislative regulations provide maximum limits of payment of
$0.00. Payment of this amount will be forwarded."  Confused and craving
enlightenment, Mrs Watt opened the third letter. She found a cheque for $29 -
a refund for Andrew's doctor's fee.
  Palmerston North branch manager Jo Burney said the corporation reprogrammed
its Wellington computer on January 12 to stop it sending out individual
letters for every part of a client's claim.  "Under the old system, you would
get separate letters and cheques for each part of a claim - the doctor's fee,
the prescription charge and the physiotherapy," she said.
  The new computer programme was supposed to save all the claims, add them up
and send out one letter and one cheque.  "Something happened ... there was one
letter all right but it was sent out three times in some cases."

An interesting tidbit came to light while I was attending a demonstration of
Lotus' cc:Mail and Notes products at the Boston NetWorld this month.  During
the Notes portion of the presentation someone asked how secure the information
in the various databases was, and how the encryption was done.

The presenter said that the data was considered very secure, so much so that
the FBI had approached Lotus to ask that a "back door" be left in the software
in order to give the Bureau a method for infiltrating suspects' filesystems.
She said they were specifically targeting "drug dealers and other bad people."

Given this backdoor, what was to stop the Bureau from inspecting confidential
materials on any system?  The risks seem obvious.  Additionally, it makes one
wonder how many other vendors of supposedly "secure" software have been 
similarly approached by various Federal organizations, and how many have 
agreed to create the back doors as requested.

Happily, the presenter said that Lotus refused to honor the FBI's request.
Bravo!

Subject: A stopped clock never foils?

One way to discourage intruders from using covert channels to foil security is
to turn off the system clock, or at least to hide it from users.  But this
breaks a lot of software, so it's too drastic for all but the most
security-conscious sites.  So I was surprised to see J.-B. Condat's letter in
RISKS 14.28, which began:

  Date: 31 Dec 69 23:59:59 GMT
  From: jbcondat@attmail.com
  Subject: New E-journal on computer security
  ...

Unix cognoscenti will recognize that date: it corresponds to the internal Unix
time value of -1, which is returned by system functions when the clock is not
available.  I guess Condat and the Chaos Computer Club France must really be
practicing what they preach!

&gt; &gt; At the tail end of the sports news at the end of NewsHour, the morning BBC
&gt; &gt; show heard on WBUR, was the mention of an error in a betting computer at a
&gt; &gt; greyhound race track.  The computer continued to accept bets well after the
&gt; &gt; conclusion of the race.  Needless to say, many gleeful track-betters bought
&gt; &gt; tickets for the dog that had already won, and claimed their winnings.

This happened in New Zealand, with the computer system run by the NZ TAB
(Totalisator Agency Board), on the 7th of January, at the Waikato aGreyhound
Club meeting.

The problem started when the track to computer site communication links proved
unreliable - basically a noisy data line, with lots of dropouts.  Switching to
a backup dialup line did not help. When they switched to a backup modem, it
blew a fuse. They then tried to switch to a cellular modem backup, they failed
to establish a connection (I am unsure on the engineering details here).
(Apparently all these backup services had worked OK on the previous day). The
upshot was that operation continued on the noisy line, with reduced
throughput.

Because of these communication difficulties, after consultation with the
Auckland computer site, the track tote manager decided to delay all races by
30 minutes. Unfortunately, the human-human communications link failed here, as
both the track operators, and the Auckland site operators delayed the races by
the required 30 minutes, thus resulting in the computer believing races had
been delayed by 60 minutes.

When the race was started, the track operators performed a standard `Race
close' function, to shut off betting. (NZ TAB operates `betting to the jump').
However, because in the computers' eyes, the race was being closed 30 minutes
early, the control function being used asked for the `Override for Early
close' field to be set to `Y'.

The operator, apparently used to closing races at approximately the right
time, or after the scheduled time, had never seen this diagnostic before,
and/or had `sent' the control function, and walked away before seeing the
diagnostic.

This problem was not noticed/solved for about 3 minutes, and since a greyhound
race is over in about 20 seconds, this allowed time for a number of bets to be
placed after the result was known. The bets were placed all around the country
- not just at the track.

[Exactly what happened in this 3 minute period has not been sorted out - there
was a flurry of human-human communication between the track, the Auckland
computer site, and the master computer site, once it was realised that betting
was still being taken.  Procedures were not correctly followed. Part of the
problem is that this has never happened before in the 12 years of operation
this system has had. Too reliable?]

Once the `double deferment' problem was noticed, the track tried to move the
race start times forward by half an hour. However, the software would not
allow them to move subsequent race start times to a time which was prior to
the scheduled start time of a race which has already been run. This was not a
major problem, since the early race close could be used OK.  [Perhaps a case
of error-checking being a little too stringent?]

I would hesitate to blame the problems on `computer failure'. Perhaps
`communications failure' - between the computer and the operators (For having
a slightly different interaction in this instance), and human-human (the
double deferment, and the site/track communications when the problem was
noticed). The only hardware failure was a dodgy comms link. Software failure?
Not really. Computer system failure? I guess so, you've got to count the
operations side of things.

&gt; &gt; The article also mentioned that some people are just born losers.  
&gt; &gt; After the race had finished, 139 people bet on dogs that had *lost*!

This is explained by the popularity of a product called `Easybet'.  This is a
bet in which the computer selects three runners for a race (runners are
selected randomly, weighted by favouritism), and the ticket wins if the three
selected runners come in 1st, 2nd and 3rd (a boxed trifecta). The default race
for an `Easybet' is the next race to close. Since the race hadn't been
`closed', many `Easybets' were sold on the race which had already been run.
Many of the losing tickets sold after the race had been run were actually
`Easybets' which didn't win.

&gt; &gt; The government management reported that they intended to reclaim all of the
&gt; &gt; unfairly-won monies.  However, they stated that they intend to *keep* the
&gt; &gt; money from the losers.

The `loss' was approximately NZ$7000, mostly from trifecta bets (selecting
1st, 2nd and 3rd in the right order), with a payout of over $200 per $1
invested. NZ$5000 of this was placed at a single agency.  The agent has been
arrested and charged, after allegedly encouraging customers to bet after the
result was known, and allegedly placing bets him/herself (illegal).

Since the TAB in New Zealand operates on a pari-mutuel system, where the prize
pool is a percentage of the money placed on a particular bet type for that
race, the late bets increased the number of winning units, thus `diluting' the
dividend paid on winning bets. The TAB is making up the dividend to the
correct amount, for bets placed before the race was run.

   In May 1992, the US Postal Service testified before the US House of
Representatives' Government Operations Subcommittee that National Change of
Address (NCOA) information filled out by each postal patron who moves and
files that move with the Post Office to have their mail forwarded is sold to
direct marketing firms without the person's consent and without informing them
of the disclosure. These records are then used to target people who have
recently moved and by private detective agencies to trace people, among other
uses. There is no way, except by not filling out the NCOA form, to prevent
this disclosure.

   This letter is to request information on why your personal information was
disclosed and what uses are being made of it. Patrons who send in this letter
are encouraged to also forward it and any replies to their Congressional
Representative and Senators.

Eligible requestors: Anyone who has filed a change of address notice with

address change and mail forwarding information that I provided to the Postal
Service. This information is maintained in USPS System of Records 010.010.

	On or about (date), I filed a change of address notice requesting that
my mail be forwarded from (old address) to (new address). The name that I used
on the change of address form was (name).

	This request includes the accounting of all disclosures made by the
Postal Service, its contractors, and its licensees.

	I am making this request because I object to the Postal Service's
policy of disclosing this information without giving individuals an option to
prevent release of this information. I want to learn how my information has
been disclosed and what uses have been made of it. Please let the Postmaster
General know that postal patrons want to have a choice in how change of
address information is used.
	
	If there is a fee in excess of $5 for this information, please notify
me in advance. Thank you for consideration of this request.

Sincerely,

CC: Your Congressional Representative

COMPUTER CHEATS TAKE CADSOFT'S BAIT

Employees of IBM, Philips, the German federal interior ministry and the
federal office for the protection of the constitution are among those who
unwittingly 'turned themselves in' when a German computer software company
resorted to an undercover strategy to find out who was using illegal copies of
one of its programs.

Hundreds of customers accepted Cadsoft's offer of a free demonstration program
that, unknown to them, searched their computer hard disks for illegal copies.
Where the search was successful, a message appeared on the monitor screen
inviting the customer to print out and return a voucher for a free handbook of
the latest version of the program. However, instead of a handbook the users
received a letter from the Bavarian-based software company's lawyers.

Since the demonstration program was distributed last June about 400 people
have returned the voucher, which contained coded information about the type of
computer and the version of the illegally copied Cadsoft program being used.
Cadsoft is now seeking damages of at least DM6,000 (ECU3,06E2) each from the
illegal users.

Cadsoft's tactics are justified by manager Rudolf Hofer as a necessary defence
against pirate copying. The company had experienced a 30% drop since 1991 in
sales of its successful Eagle design program, which retails at DM2,998. In
contrast, demand for a DM25 demo version, which Cadsoft offered with the
handbook of the full version, had jumped, indicating that people were
acquiring the program from other sources.

Although Cadsoft devised its plan with the help of lawyers, doubts have been
raised about the legal acceptability of this type of computer detective work.
In the case of government offices there is concern about data protection and
official secrets. The search program may also have had side-effects that
caused other files to be damaged or lost.  Cadsoft is therefore preparing
itself for what could be a long legal battle with some customers.  So far it
has reached out-of-court agreement with only about a quarter of those who
incriminated themselves.

RISK in paragraph three.

Superior Court ruling upholds `Wizards' ban, by Christina Kirby

  A SUPERIOR court judge has upheld the Milpitas Unified School
District's 2-year-old ban on the Wizards spelling game.  The ruling was
handed down last Friday.
  The computer game was banned in 1990 by the school board following
complaints from parents that it promoted satanic worship.
  Teachers, seeking to reverse the ban, argued that it infringed on
their rights to choose teaching materials, and broke laws prohibiting
state agencies, such as school districts, from supporting any religion.
  The court ruled that the school district had acted within its authority and
had not violated the California constitution by banning the game.
  "With all due respect, we don't agree with the court's decision," said
Catherine Porter, an attorney representing the teachers.  "Based on the
California constitution, we do believe that we provided significant evidence
to show that the purpose and effect of the ban was religious and not secular."
  Pleased by the ruling, Milpitas Superintendent Jack Mackay said, "We
always thought the board was acting within its authority to maintain a
secular environment."
  Porter said Monday that the teachers would be discussing whether or
not to appeal the decision.

A personnel supervisor "who knew the ins and outs of a computer system that
managed charger accounts for thousands of jewelry store customers along the
Eastern Seaboard" and a former co-worker worked a scam using the supervisors
ability to alter the computers database, illustrating the risks of:

  - inadequate controls within the computer system
  - retail store policy shortcomings
  - the procedure by which they let users who have had their card stolen
    continue to charge purchases
  - flaws in the system accountability

"Using computer passwords of other employees, detectives said, Benjamin
Francois was able to alter customer records and list a credit card as lost or
stolen.  Then his friend, John Wise, would appear at a jewelry store and claim
to be the customer whose credit card was missing.  By store policy, Wise only
was required to give sales clerks a name, Social Security number and a secret
code that would allow customers whose cards were lost or stolen to continue
charging merchandise.  "If the clerk asked to see some identification, Wise
would explain ...  he had no photo to prove he was the customer, but he would
give the clerk the secret code Francois had obtained from the computer."

Affected between June 2nd and last September were:
  - jewelry stores in Tampa, Orlando, Palm Beach and Altamonte Springs FL
  - Jewelers Financial Services, which ran accounts for:
    . Zales Jewelers, Bailey Banks &amp; Biddle Jewelers, Gordons Jewelers

Francois was able to delete the references to stolen or lost cards on the
charge accounts after the purchases were made.  The two men were arrested
after a tip in November led police investigators to "verify the mainframe
database" records.

Of particular interest: system controls allow Francois to manipulate the
database, then hide the activity so that, apparently, the real customers were
not billed.  If the report is correct, it was the November tip and not any
system controls that revealed the thefts.  Apparently the charges were allowed
to fall into some sort of accounting black hole.

Heard this on the radio this morning: a major Christian radio network is
alerting its member stations to check their latest shipments of religious
compact discs before airing them.  It seems that some other CDs were
mislabelled at the factory and shipped along with the religious ones.
Unfortunately the itinerant CDs were by the Dead Kennedys.  A spokesman for
the radio network said, "This is what happens whenever people get around
machines."  The CBS newsreader, with masterful understatement, said, "The Dead
Kennedys CDs included songs such as, `I Kill Children,' which some Christian
listeners may not find inspirational."

The major telecomm carriers are reporting that 1992 was a bad year for the
phone baddies intent on ripping off phone service from corporations. Sprint
reported fraud claims by its business customers dived 96 percent, to $670,000,
or $1,350 per incident compared to an average loss of $35,000 in 1991. AT&amp;T
says fraud claims made to it dropped about 88 percent and MCI says it has also
seen a drop in claims. In other words, 1992 losses were a far cry from the $1
billion to $3 billion a year claimed as losses in past years. The major reason
for the drop: customer awareness

This is because Jock Gill who handles Email for Clinton was at the

The issues surrounding the topic of possible negative health effects from
cellular phone use are going to be among the hottest (no pun intended) in
coming years.

There are no definitive studies that fully address the complexities of the
situation, especially in view of increasing circumstantial evidence that
non-ionizing radiation may have more biological effects than previously
thought.

It's true that walkie-talkies, ham radios, etc. have been around for
many years--but there are some potentially significant differences
with cellular phones:

1) Most walkie-talkie, police radios, ham radios, etc. are operated
   in a push-to-talk mode.  You're only transmitting when you're
   actually talking.  Cell phones transmit continuously, so exposure
   is continuous during calls.

2) Cell phones operate at higher frequencies than most common
   service or ham radios (common hand-held ham radios, for
   example, usually go no higher than the 440 Mhz band.  Cell
   phones operate in the 800-900 Mhz region, which puts them
   just about in the microwave range.

Recently there have been a number of concerns raised about microwave exposure
to the operators of police radar units.  We're talking longer exposure and
higher frequencies in the radar case--but nobody knows where the "thresholds"
might be for exposure to possibly show effects in some persons.  The bottom
line is that the higher the frequency, the more "energetic" the effects.

In at least a couple of the cases of persons accusing cell phones of causing
tumors, part of their evidence is the shape and direction of tumor
growth--they apparently are aligned with the antenna and growing inward from
the outside.  Of course, this says nothing about cause and effect--but it has
to at least be considered.

It's true that cell phones use quite low power.  But a little power packs a
bigger "punch" at these frequencies, and with the antenna right next to the
head the *field strength* (which matters more than the absolute power) can be
quite high (inverse square law applies).

Concerns about health effects from hand-held radios have been around for a
long time.  But with the millions of people using continuously transmitting,
ultra high frequency units who never did before, some new dimensions are added
to the picture--and they are definitely worthy of serious consideration.

By the way, not all cellular systems are created equal when it comes to
radiation exposure.  The new CDMA digital system, for example, throttles back
the power from the portable unit depending on how close you are to the cell
site--the site transmitter sends a signal back to the handheld controlling the
power level.  The main reason for doing this is to drastically increase
battery life, but it has the additional benefit of reducing overall exposure
as well.

Subject: Re: EM Radiation - is smoking safer?  (Menon, <A HREF="/Risks/14.29.html">RISKS-14.29</A>)

	"We've had walkie talkies (ok - two way radios) for years with
	no perceivable or admitted risk to the health of users."

Not so.  Long term (over 20 years) use of two-way radios by police officers
has been linked to higher incidences of glaucoma.  This is one reason why the
transmitter unit is now worn on the belt, with the microphone pinned to the
lapel.

(This means that the transmitter irradiates the gonads instead of the
eyeballs ... a possible new risk?)

I am seeking assistance in obtaining copies of any current US/European
legislation (proposed or enacted) for the certification of computing
professionals. Also, I have seen some reference to 6(?) US States considering
such legislation. I would like to know which States so that I can visit them
on an upcoming sabbatical.

Any assistance would be appreciated.

Sorry, folks -- human error strikes again.  GAO's distribution center
is at (202) 275-6241.  The warehouse is in Maryland, but they don't
take the orders there.  Mea culpa, mea culp, mea maxima culpa.

   [stu@national.mitre.org (Stuart Bell) notes FAX (301) 258-4066,
   no charge for single copies -- just provide all info.]

   [and later from James Paul:]

Well, it's worse than I thought.  GAO has been migrating to the new Government
telephone system and apparently this has caught up with their ordering
operation.  When you dial (202) 275-6241, you are now directed to call (202)
512-6000.  At the same time the message says you will automatically be
switched over to the new number.  I really apologize for all the confusion.
Me, I just get 'em directly.

The **PRELIMINARY DRAFT** of the U.S. Federal Criteria for Information
Technology Security (FC) (which will eventually replace the "Orange Book") is
available on-line.  The files are located on both the NIST Computer Security
Bulletin Board and on the NCSC's DOCKMASTER computer system.  DOCKMASTER has
the FC available in UNIX compressed postscript format, while the NIST BBS has
the FC available in PKZIP postscript format.  When printed out, both volumes
of the document total approximately 280 pages double-sided.  By the first week
of February, the FC (without the figures) should be available in ASCII format
at both sites.  The figures will also be available individually in postscript
form.

What follows are instructions on how to download the files from both sites,
how to register your name for announcements, and how to send in comments.

      - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

TO DOWNLOAD THE FILES FROM DOCKMASTER:

The files can be found on DOCKMASTER in the directory:

          &gt;site&gt;pubs&gt;criteria&gt;FC

      - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

TO DOWNLOAD THE FILES FROM NIST'S BBS:

Volumes 1 and 2 of the FC can be accessed through the Internet via
anonymous ftp. To download, ftp to csrc.nist.gov or to 129.6.54.11.

Log in as "anonymous" and use your Internet address as the password.  The FC
postscript files are in directory /bbs/nistpubs.  The files are fcvol1.ps.Z
and fcvol2.ps.Z, for volumes one and two respectively.  Both of these volumes
have been ZIPped using PKZIP.  The PKZIP program is available in /bbs/software
should you need to download it.


REGISTERING YOUR NAME:

When you receive an electronic copy of the draft FC, please send us
you name, mailing address, telephone, and e-mail address to the e-
mail address listed below and state that you have an electronic
copy of the FC. If you distribute the document to additional people
in your organization, please send us the same information on those
people as well.  We will put the names into our database for any
further announcements, meeting notices, draft announcements, etc.,
related to the effort.  NIST will be sending out a LIMITED NUMBER
of hard copies, but due to the substantial expense of sending out
such a large document - even at book rate, we would prefer people
to receive the document via electronic means.  Therefore, by
sending us your name and the names of those in your organization
who have the downloaded copies of the document, it saves us from
having to send additional hard copies.

COMMENTS:

We are soliciting TECHNICAL, SUBSTANTIVE comments on the document.  The
deadline for comments is March 31, 1993.  All those who contribute substantive
comments will be invited to a two-day workshop at the end of April 1993 to
resolve the comments.  The workshop will be held in the Washington-Baltimore
area in a to-be- announced location.

Please send your comments to:

                    lynch@csmes.ncsl.nist.gov

or, if you prefer, you can send us a 3.5" or 5.25" diskette in
MSDOS or UNIX format (please indicate which) to:

                     Gaithersburg, MD  20899

We would prefer to receive electronic copies of comments and/or name
registrations, but we will also receive hardcopy comments/name registrations
at this same address.  You can also contact us via the following fax:

Sat, 30 Jan 93 16:14:27
</i><PRE>

The University of York in the UK is running a two day conference on Computers,
Security and the Law that may be of interest to the readers of COMP.RISKS.
The programme for the conference follows.  If you do not think this is a
suitable place for this but know of somewhere that is perhaps you could
forward it or let me know and I will do so.

                          FINAL PROGRAMME.
                   COMPUTERS: SECURITY AND THE LAW
                       31 March - 1 April 1993

The conference will be run by the Department of Computer Science in
association with the Society for Computers &amp; Law and the Licensing Executives
Society .

The aim of the conference is to highlight some of the important legal issues
that surround the use, and abuse, of computer technology in a way that should
be accessible to the non-specialist, such as lawyers or computer scientists.

The target audience for the conference is senior management and those in both
public and private sector organisations who wish to improve their knowledge
about the legal aspects of buying, using or creating computer related products
and services. The conference will be of interest to the police, the civil
service, banks, insurance and building societies.

The programme will take place over two consecutive days. The first day will
deal with the legal aspects of intellectual property rights, copyright and
contract law as it relates to computer products and services. The second day
will deal with the topics of computer crime and its prevention, security, data
protection and privacy.

The conference dinner will be a Medieval Banquet at St William's College
(founded in 1461).  The keynote speaker will be Emma Nicholson, MP.

Proceedings of the conference will be published and be available to 
participants after the conference.


REGISTRATION AND FEES:

Delegates will be able to register for either of the two days 
separately if they wish.   Fees: #275 for full conference, #165 for 
single day; a discount is available for early booking by 19th

  from the 1/28/93 Columbus (Ohio) "Dispatch"
  by Ron Lietzke and Bruce Cadwallader

  A three-minute computer failure at an Ohio Bell central office disrupted
  phone service for 42,000 telephone lines in the Downtown business district
  for about 45 minutes yesterday morning.  The computer problem cleared after
  a few minutes, but the disruption snowballed when a surge of callers seeking
  dial tones caused a telephone traffic jam of sorts, Ohio Bell spokesman
  David Kandel said.

  Outgoing and incoming calls on 15 Downtown prefixes were disrupted by the
  problem, which started at 9:42 AM.  The Columbus police, the Franklin County
  Sherrif's Department, Columbus Public Schools, and state offices were among
  those disrupted by the outage, Kandel said.

  Callers in the affected prefix areas who dialed 911 could not reach Columbus
  police or the Franklin County Sherrif's office for at least 3 minutes.
  However, those agencies reported that they did not receive any complaints
  after the dial tones returned.  "It was starting to clear itself within
  minutes, but because you're looking at such a huge volume of calls Downtown,
  it took the system time to recover," Kandel said.  "The system was
  delivering a very, very slow dial tone."

  Problems started when one of two computer processors failed.  The other took
  over, but it took about three minutes for it to retrieve the information
  from the failed processor, Kandel said.  Ohio Bell technicians were working
  with the equipment manufacturer yesterday to determine what caused the
  processor to fail.  It still was not working late yesterday.  [...]

  Columbus police dispatchers reported having problems for about 30 minutes.
  Chief Deputy Robert Taylor of the sheriff's department said this radio room
  used cellular phones until the problem cleared.  Neither department knew of
  any emergencies missed because of the computer problem.  Columbus
  firefighters said they were receiving 911 calls throughout the period of
  disruption.

Two items of interest I note.  One is that even a brief delay in grabbing data
from the failed computer resulted in a large backlog.  Perhaps the system was
not designed to account for the large number of lines in downtown Columbus,
which boomed during the 1980's.  Phone systems tend to use less than state-of-
the-art technology (to avoid many of the "bleeding edge" problems often noted
here), but in this case, perhaps a faster processor or live mirroring of the
data in question would have helped.

As to my second point, twice the article points out that nobody knew of any
emergency calls that were missed, with the implication that no harm was done.
Dead men tell no tales?

This one goes in the `When will they ever learn?' category:

	I just got a call from a person who recently purchased a Unix based PC
as junk from a bank, and low and behold, the computer was not cleaned before
sale.  How hard is it to break in?  Not too!  All you have to do is boot from
a DOS floppy, run Norton Utilities or any similar tool, search for the `root:'
part of the password file, and change that line to look like `root::0:1::/:'.
Then you reboot from Unix and login as root with no password!

	So that's too simple to be believed, but of course it works, and now
comes the real problem.  I am not sure it's illegal to use that data however
you want! That's right, the computer crime laws don't cover computers that are
not attached to any networks, aren't part of the banking system, etc.  This
system is no longer a banking computer, the data was sold along with the
system to the new owner by the bank with no stipulations or warnings (as-is),
and the new owner, as far as I can tell, has the right to use anything on the
computer as their own.

	It's a little upsetting that the bank didn't bother to do a secure
deletion before giving all this data away (only about 120Mbytes worth of
information on customers, etc.).  How about the privacy of the customers of
the bank? How about the EFT codes stored on-line! How about all the passwords
that can now be guessed and exploited to enter the bank as if you were an
employee? Oh well, anyone want to buy a used computer - no longer so cheap?

            [Expletives deleted if there were expletives UNDELETED.  
               By the way, remember that the C2 Orange Book requirement is
               for deletion prior to initial assignment and reallocation.  
               Somewhere there should be a requirement for deletion prior 
               to permanent deallocation as well.  PGN]

With all due respect to Christina Kirby, the "Wizards" game is NOT a computer
game.  It is a pencil-and-paper game, like other adventure simulations.  The
students gain points by achieving goals in spelling (and perhaps other
language-related tasks), and translate these points into progress around a
game board.  It bears a superficial resemblance to "Dungeons and Dragons,"
with magicians, wizards, a winged dragon, a pit -- symbols that some
(fundamentalist) Christians equate with Satanism and/or disregard for Biblical
symbolism.  The symbols were the basis of the argument made against the game.

The teachers had two objections -- the issue of choice of instructional
materials, and that of the way the District imposed the ban.  One result of
the uproar was a rewrite of the "Challenged Instructional Materials" policy.
making the evaluation process much more accessible to the concerned public.
Another was the motivation of a parent in the district who fought the ban to
mount a (successful) run for a School Board seat last election, unseating an
incumbent.

It might be interesting for readers who want to know more about the "Clever
Tactics Against Piracy" (RISKS 14.30) that the story, including some technical
details, was first published in the German news magazine DER SPIEGEL (#36,
1992, August 31st), titled "Trojanisches Pferd" (Trojan Horse). The company
used a 12-digit key that looked like the serial number of the
"free-demonstration coupon", which had to be printed out and sent back, to
identify the pirated copies found on the "customers" machine and some details
about the computer it was found on.

Do not relax.  So what if an official back door doesn't exist?  Other federal
agencies are more discreet than the FBI, and would consider "their" back door
useless if any notice were taken of its existence.  Furthermore, somebody is
bound to see the profit in covertly adding a back door to a product and
quietly selling it to individuals with a commercial interest in violation of
privacy.

I checked with Lt. Colonel North, Admiral Yamamoto, and especially Captain
Murphy, and they all agree: never assume a publically-accessible medium is
secure just because it's encrypted!

In RISKS 14.29, joltes@husc.harvard.edu reports that Lotus says that the FBI
had asked them to place backdoors into Notes and cc:Mail, and they refused.
Assuming that they told the truth, I'll second Dick's "Bravo!".

But one RISK here is that, without *sources*, it's hard to tell -
does Lotus provide sufficient documentation on file formats and encryption
algorithms that users can verify that the program does what it claims?

In <A HREF="/Risks/14.29.html">RISKS-14.29</A>, Dick Joltes said the following about a presentation he
attended on Lotus Notes and the response of the Lotus representative to a
question about how the encryption was done:

	The presenter said that the data was considered very secure, so
	much so that the FBI had approached Lotus to ask that a "back
	door" be left in the software in order to give the Bureau a
	method for infiltrating suspects' filesystems.  She said they
	were specifically targeting "drug dealers and other bad
	people."

	Given this backdoor, what was to stop the Bureau from
	inspecting confidential materials on any system?  The risks
	seem obvious. ...

There are, in fact, very good controls to stop the FBI or any other law
enforcement agency from doing this.  They're called warrants.  In order to
execute a search and seizure on any system, the government needs to have a
court order.  To get a court order, they have to demonstrate that there is
probable cause that a crime has been commited.  Neither the FBI nor any other
law enforcement agency is allowed to "infiltrate" someone's system and poke
around to see what's there.

The "obvious" risk here is not from the government.  If the government is
unable to break through the crypto or get the key, they may be unable to
obtain evidence needed to prosecute someone who has commited a crime.  This is
potentially a very serious problem, especially as records become more heavily
computerized.

	Happily, the presenter said that Lotus refused to honor the
	FBI's request.  Bravo!

Encryption of files and communications is going to make it much more
difficult, and in some cases impossible, for law enforcers to get evidence
needed for conviction.  Unless we want a society with greater crime, we need
to find some way of meeting both our needs for information security and our
needs for law enforcement.  Then we can cheer.

Dorothy Denning, responding to my posting regarding cc:Mail, says:

...
&gt; the FBI nor any other law enforcement agency is allowed to "infiltrate"
&gt; someone's system and poke around to see what's there.

The key word here is "allowed."  As we've seen with such scandals as Watergate
and Iran-Contra, what is allowed by law and what is actually done sometimes
are two different things.  What is to stop an agency from conducting an 
initial covert search of a person or corporation's records, then requesting
the warrant after they find questionable or illegal material?

Dorothy's comments presuppose that all operatives within all governmental
bodies are completely honest.  While I would say that a majority of these
workers are honest, the risk that some are not makes the presence of known
back doors in supposedly "secure" software a highly questionable situation.

&gt; The "obvious" risk here is not from the government.  If the government
&gt; is unable to break through the crypto or get the key, they may be
&gt; unable to obtain evidence needed to prosecute someone who has commited
&gt; a crime.  This is potentially a very serious problem, especially as
&gt; records become more heavily computerized.

Certainly it is.  However, we must evaluate whether the risks to the public
at large outweigh the advantage of having such back doors available to 
legitimate authorities.  What if the codekey sequence used to activate the
alternative access method became known due to a security leak (disgruntled
Lotus employee or government agent, espionage, etc)?  Lotus would then need
to issue a binary patch to change the codekey (at their expense, no doubt).
Customer confidence in the product would sag and businesses would begin to
question the security of their own supposedly encrypted software.

If I were running a business and knew that a product I was evaluating had a
built-in back door, it would end my interest in the product.

&gt; Encryption of files and communications is going to make it much more
&gt; difficult, and in some cases impossible, for law enforcers to get
&gt; evidence needed for conviction.  Unless we want a society with greater
&gt; crime, we need to find some way of meeting both our needs for
&gt; information security and our needs for law enforcement.  Then we can
&gt; cheer.

My cheer was in regard to Lotus' refusal (well, they *said* they refused) to
blindly install a security hole in their most successful product simply 
because a government agency said "please do it."  Knowing that acquiescence
to such a demand was a violation of the trust placed in Lotus products by
their customers, they did the "right thing" and said "no."

I agree that some balance needs to be stuck, but the scales must not be tilted
to the needs of law enforcement at the expense of the public.  Given some 
recent incidents (such as "Operation Sun Devil," which nearly put a legitimate
business into bankruptcy due to the actions of paranoid and uninformed agents)
it seems obvious to me that few Federal agencies currently possess the basic
skills needed to differentiate between criminals and "fringe groups" such as
gamers and hackers whose participation in society is outside the "norm" of
American experience.

The subject of "Computing and the Law" is one that is just beginning to make
an impact on society, and both the public and the government need to feel 
through the tangle of issues that surround it.  We must not make the mistake
of infringing on privacy simply to deter crime, since this will establish
legal precedents that could easily become Draconian in their use if unchecked.

I do not assume that everyone in government is totally honest.  Rather,

breaking into someone's system or conducting a search without a

of the media to expose abuses.

There should be additional information on its way to RISKS about this
subject (from another source).  Employees of Lotus were involved in meetings
with the FBI held under the auspices of the EFF over the past 18 months.
Several proposed bills were discussed and tabled.  We have it from one of
the employees who was actually involved.

It is not surprising that Dorothy's source knew nothing (if true) of the
contacts.  Stratification and compartmentalization within federal organizations
is not uncommon, with the result that groups within the same agency do not
know of the activities of others.

 although it is correct "in spirit".
 
 As one of the developers of Notes, I have represented Lotus twice regarding 
 FBI proposals.  In the first (about 18 months ago), the FBI was trying to 
 persuade Congress to pass a law requiring communication service providers to 
 deliver the original plain text of messages entering their systems, in 
 essence requiring us to install a back door.  Lotus was not approached by the 
 FBI - rather, the EFF learned of the bill and asked me to participate in a 
 round-table discussion with lawmakers and others from the telecommunications 
 and computer industries.  The bill was tabled shortly thereafter.
 
 Last year, we again participated in several discussions with the FBI related 
 to a new proposal that would have required manufacturers of communication 
 equipment and services to modify their products (in this case, Lotus Notes) 
 to be able to, on demand and in a timely fashion and from a single access 
 point, grant the FBI access to communications.  This new law would not 
 require us to install a backdoor, that is, they took the issue of encryption 
 off the table, but would instead require us to install logic into our message 
 routers to disable dynamic adaptive least-cost path routing and also to 
 disable code that breaks messages into packets for transmission on different 
 virtual circuits.  It would also require us to put logic into the message 
 routers to deliver copies of messages to a central monitoring point from 
 anywhere in the network.  This FBI plan has also been tabled.
 
 If it weren't for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, we never would have had 
 a chance to participate.  EFF and the CPSR are providing a great service for 
 our industry, which has a pitifully small lobbying presence in Washington.  
 Neither Lotus nor Lotus Notes was singled out by the FBI, rather, I 
 represented Lotus voluntarily in order to defend Lotus' commercial 
 interests.  Additionally, I was compelled to attend because I believe very, 
 very strongly in my right to privacy as a US citizen.
 
 On the other hand, the FBI has a very difficult job to do, and with the 
 onslaught of technology, it fears that it may soon lose its longstanding 
 authority to carry out court-ordered wiretaps.  Valid wiretaps - ones that 
 you would probably agree with.  From their perspective, why can't a technical 
 solution be found to what appears to be a technical problem?
 
 From my perspective, though, the cat's out of the bag.  It's already very 
 easy for the average joe to do effectively unbreakable end-to-end encryption 
 of messages on standard PC hardware.  Passing laws won't stop bad guys from 
 using encryption, so these laws will just have the effect of increasing the 
 cost of every mail system, every PBX, every LAN router, every cellular phone, 
 and so on.  Not to say what the laws will do to your privacy.
 
 Think about it.  And then call the EFF.

If you are a student at U. of Illinois, you should know that anyone who knows
your social security number and birthday can now see your official transcript.
To add insult to injury, if someone does looks at your transcript, *you* will
be charged a $5 transcript fee.

The administration building, room 100, now has three computer
terminals. Anyone can walk up to one and type
  1) a social security number
  2) a birthday
  3) an address

If the social security number and birthday match a current student, that
student's transcript will be send to the address and that student's account
will be charged $5.

At the very least, check your university bill. It seems that your only
protection is your ability to track down the destination address of an
improperly send transcript (assuming the university keeps a record of these
addresses).

Subject: [TDR] Programmer Licensing

Al Underwood asked about the possibility of Government Computer Professional
Certification, otherwise known as Programmer Licensing.  A famous philosopher
referred to it as "Guild Socialism," i.e. that in exchange for their group
providing some needed service, their group must be the only one allowed to
perform it.  Doctors, Lawyers, Electricians, Plumbers and others got their
practices set up so that any involvement in them by persons who are not
licensed by their guild becomes a criminal offense.  That some of these
activities may be hazardous by persons not trained in the particular practice
in question may be the reasoning behind the requirements, but in every case,
the actual practice of licensing is used to protect those in that particular
guild from competition.  Doctors keep out people from foreign countries.
Lawyers use it to keep people from dispensing information about minor matters
such as bankruptcy, or use it as a club to threaten people, and so on.

I remember that New Jersey was planning to do this a couple of years ago. I
made a big stink on any forum I could find in the computer world (I did not
know of many Internet lists at that time, so I could only complain on one or
two) and sent out messages on the BBS networks I could get access to, in order
to warn people about this.

When certification is done at the mandatory level, i.e. you must have a
license to practice the certified occupation or you can be charged with a
criminal act, it gives to private parties the power of the State to decide
what is or is not satisfactory performance.  It can be prostituted in all
sorts of ways depending on the political agenda of the people who are
involved.

1.  License fees could be anything from $10 to $2000 a year depending on
    what the board wants to set the fees at.  If you can't afford the
    fee, that's too bad, you're out of the business.

2.  License boards generally grandfather the law: anyone who claims to be
    working in that particular field at the time the law is in effect is
    granted an automatic license.  Therefore the license rule serves to
    do just one thing: raise money for the licensing board and begin to
    weed out those who either weren't around when the licensing started
    or could not afford the fees.  This can also be used as a hidden
    tax, by, for example, budgeting $100,000 for the license bureau,
    while setting the tax to take in $1.1 or $2.1 million, thus using
    the law to raise an extra 2 mil for revenue hungry state legislatures.

3.  The license boards conceivably can decide what is or isn't valid
    practice in a particular occupation.  A Programmer Licensing Board,
    or "Software Engineers Quality Control Board" or whatever it is
    called, can decide, for example, that the use of the "GOTO" is 
    no longer permitted, or the COBOL ALTER, or some other language
    construct, and make use of the proscribed method grounds for 
    someone to lose their license. 

4.  One state can set standards such that its requirements become 
    effective beyond its borders.  It's noted there is a man who is
    a lawyer in California who has to come back into DC to defend 
    his license to practice over an issue that allegedly was settled,
    because if the DC Bar revokes his license all the other states will.

5.  If someone writes opinions which are unflattering of a License Board
    or take an unpopular stance on an issue, the License Control
    Board can, using item 3 above, take someone's license away 
    by changing the standard in a way that the person cannot meet it and
    thus loses his license.  For a fictional example of how this could be 
    prostituted into requiring almost everyone in a particular
    guild to become an indentured servant of a particular company,
    read the short story "Magic, Inc." by Robert A. Heinlein.
    It's usually in a combined story of "Waldo, and Magic, Inc,"
    where two related short stories are combined.

6.  A computer program is the creation of the mind of an individual,
    and as such is "a figment of the imagination" since a computer 
    program has no physical apportation other than as bits on disk,
    which are no different from any other bits.  As such, a computer
    program is a form of writing.  I question whether a law requiring
    someone to have a license in order to write something would stand
    challenge in the United States on 1st Amendment grounds of prior
    restraint.  I do not know if someone has ever tried to license
    reporters in order to show that they know how to write and spell
    and use English correctly; whether such would withstand court
    scrutiny is an interesting question.  But a law that allowed a
    reporter to lose his license if a government agency decided he
    is not qualified would be so offensive to the first amendment
    that a court wouldn't even consider arguments over the intended
    "improvement" of the reporters guild such a law would attain. 
    Requiring reporters to know their subject matter in order to
    write about it would certainly make them better writers.  It
    also would certainly be unconstitutional.  

7.  There is generally a shortage of talented computer people.  A
    law requiring licensing of programmers (or 'software engineers'
    or whatever it is) would not fix the problem and would only 
    exacerbate it and might make things worse since everyone currently
    working can be grandfathered, some places might have to hire 
    incompetents because the supply of quality people is dried up.

8.  Some companies have gone to training their own people in order
    to make up for a famine of supply.  If the laws require that 
    you can only enter the field after a four year degree from an
    accredited university, there goes the space for opening level
    people and the chance for a company to 'grow their own.'

9.  Cutting people's appendixes for free is still 'practicing 
    medicine'.  Fighting a traffic ticket (where traffic offenses are
    still crimes) is still 'practicing law'.  Doing these things for
    someone else, even if for free, is still performing a licensed
    occupation which is a crime.  What does this do to the shareware
    world of people who write programs on spec for others to try and
    use and pay for if they like them?

10. A few years ago the Food and Drug Administration busted into a
    warehouse and seized thousands of gallons of contraband orange
    juice.  Because it was unfit for human consumption?  Because it
    was contaminated?  Because there was a danger to the public?
    Because the agency didn't like the label on it and wanted that
    particular processor - Proctor and Gamble - to comply with a
    standard that it was not requiring of 300 other orange juice
    processors.  When P&amp;G said that if the EPA would evenly enforce
    the law on everyone they would go along, the EPA decided to 
    seize the packages.  What this has to do with the licensing 
    of software people is slightly related to #9.  If someone is
    writing software for a company and doesn't have a license, can
    the software be seized?  If the person has a license where the
    program is made but not in other states?  (You can't practice
    medicine or law or engineering in states not licensed.)  If 
    the program is transported from a state not requiring a license
    to create software to one where on is, can the product be 
    seized for noncompliance?  The product was produced by an 
    unlicensed person in a state where licensing is required.  In
    some states if you order a stock not registered in that state
    and then decide to change your mind and not buy it, the broker
    cannot force you to pay for it because of mandatory registration
    of stock issues.  Could not the same thing be done for 
    computer programs or the creators of same?  

These and perhaps other points come up in the licensing of software
professionals; the dangers to the people who make this stuff, and perhaps
dangers to the public.

I have heard that the reason it was killed was because (1) the software
industry didn't want it; (2) Bell Labs, in New Jersey, was upset when the
estimated license fees for all of the people who worked there would cost the
company more than $1,000,000.

Apparently some legislator in New Jersey proposed this law without
asking anyone either in the industry or in its customers, if anyone 
even wanted it.

This is a pointer to a basenote and discussion pertaining to computer pointing
device injuries (mouse, trackballs, puck, stylus, etc.) in
sci.med.occupational.  For convenience I have included a copy of the basenote
below.  To follow net etiquette, please direct all responses to the basenote

                      (Copy of Basenote)

This note (which is being posted monthly) is for anyone that has been
injured using a computer pointing device (mouse, trackball, puck, tablet,
etc.).  I have been assisting computer operators who have been injured using
pointing devices for the past 4 years.  I am now presently doing research
at the University of California's (San Francisco and Berkeley's) Ergonomics
Lab on the design of computer pointing devices with the goal of reducing
injuries associated with their use.  In order to do this, I need to collect
information on pointing device design characteristics (button design, button
force, device size, device shape, etc.) that are important in minimizing
and/or reducing the physical stresses operators are subjected to.  Some of
this information will be collected through my laboratory research, but a
major and important source of information has to come from operators like
yourself.  I need to collect all the information I can from computer
operators that have been injured as a result of pointing device use.

In order to do this, I need your help.  If you have been injured using a
pointing device, I would appreciate it if you would send me a note with
information pertaining to your injury.  I would like the information e-
mailed directly to me (petej@garnet.berkeley.edu).  The format I would
like the information sent to me is as follows, fill in as much as you
can:

 1) NAME: (optional)
 2) COMPANY: (optional)
 3) PHONE #: (optional)
 4) NUMBER OF HOURS SPENT IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER PER DAY:
 5) PERCENTAGE OF TIME SPENT USING A POINTING DEVICE:
 6) MANUFACTURER OF COMPUTER AND MODEL NUMBER:
 7) POINTING DEVICE USED AT TIME OF INJURY: (Please be specific)
      a) MANUFACTURER
      b) MODEL OR PART NUMBER
      c) DESCRIPTION OF DEVICE
 8) PRIMARY SOFTWARE APPLICATION USED AT THE TIME OF YOUR INJURY
 9) TYPE OF INJURY
10) WHAT YOU THINK CAUSED YOUR INJURY
11) IF INJURY IS RESOLVED OR YOUR CONDITIONS HAVE IMPROVED, WHAT CHANGES
    WERE MADE (This is probably the most beneficial information)

    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

My intent is to enter this information into a database in order to
gather information and look for trends.  Each month I will share
relevant information by posting a monthly summary in
sci.med.occupational similar to what has been done with keyboard
information.  If you are presently experiencing problems, feel free to
call me (510/231-9405) and I will share with you what I know.  I am also
open for suggestions, please post responses to this basenote or e-mail
me if you have any further suggestions or input.

If your company has internal bulletin boards, please post this note or
provide a pointer telling your co-workers about this basenote in the
sci.med.occupational newsgroup.  I will be also be posting a pointer to
this basenote in comp.risks, comp.human-factors, and sci.med as well.

Finally, if you have any opinions or inputs on a particular pointing
device or pointing device design in general, send me a note or call me. 
Our lab is assisting some of the major pointing device manufacturers
with the design of their pointing devices. If you have some inputs for a
particular company, I will be happy to direct them to the appropriate
person. 

Thanks for your help.

  I have been invited to give (or organize) a 4-hour seminar presenting civil
liberties perspectives and concerns to a group of 40-60 high-tech criminal
investigators on the first day of the HTCIA Northern California 3-day workshop
in April (High Tech Criminal Investigators Association).  They are expecting
attendees from Nor Cal and from beyond.  My understanding is that most of
the members are sworn peace officers who are specializing in investigating
high-tech crime; a minority are corporate and agency computer security
officers.  Most will attend the seminar (only one seminar per time-period).

  I see it as an *outstanding* opportunity to
(a) open [more] communication channels between in-the-trenches law enforcement
officials and civlibbies,
(b) learn more of their concerns and problems,
(c) enhance the chances of additional similar and expanded exchanges at future
law-enforcement meetings through *nonconfrontational*, well-informed, candid
discourse, and
(d) better inform law enforcement folks of the complexities, styles and trade-
offs in "cyberspace," and their ramifications for law enforcement's legitimate
and significant concerns.
  [And -- heh! -- it will give "them" a chance to harangue "us" civlib types;
equitable role-reversal for those cops who have entered the lion's den by
attending any of the Computers, Freedom &amp; Privacy conferences of the last
several years.]

  I have invited an attorney who is specializing in these issues to join me in
organizing and presenting this seminar, and am in hopes that her organization
will support her participation.  She has been closely monitoring related
legislation in Washington, DC, and has also been directly involved in a major
computer-search case currently being litigated in Texas.

Query/request:
  I have a number of ideas for topics and perspectives to present/cover, and
have several documents I plan to provide as handouts. But, I am very-much
interested in receiving suggestions and/or papers/handouts that might be
appropriate for presentation/distribution at a regional meeting of high tech
criminal investigators [long on meat; short on emotion and opinion, please].
  Please forward comments, suggestions and copies (ideally e-copies for
reformatting and printing in a combined handout, including a note permitting
reproduction for this purpose).  [Confidentiality of sources and suggestors
will be protected, upon request.]

&gt;From Jack King (gjk@well.sf.ca.us)

The U.S. Dept. of Justice has asked the U.S. Sentencing Commission to
promulgate a new federal sentencing guideline, Sec. 2F2.1, specifically
addressing the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1988 (18 USC 1030), with a base
offense level of 6 and enhancements of 4 to 6 levels for violations of
specific provisions of the statute.  The new guideline practically guarantees
some period of confinement, even for first offenders who plead guilty.

For example, the guideline would provide that if the defendant obtained
``protected'' information (defined as ``private information, non-public
government information, or proprietary commercial information), the offense
level would be increased by two; if the defendant disclosed protected
information to any person, the offense level would be increased by four
levels, and if the defendant distributed the information by means of ``a
general distribution system,'' the offense level would go up six levels.

The proposed commentary explains that a ``general distribution system''
includes ``electronic bulletin board and voice mail systems, newsletters and
other publications, and any other form of group dissemination, by any means.''

So, in effect, a person who obtains information from the computer of another,
and gives that information to another gets a base offense level of 10; if he
used a 'zine or BBS to disseminate it, he would get a base offense level of
12. The federal guidelines prescribe 6-12 months in jail for a first offender
with an offense level of 10, and 10-16 months for same with an offense level
of 12.  Pleading guilty can get the base offense level down by two levels;
probation would then be an option for the first offender with an offense level
of 10 (reduced to 8).  But remember: there is no more federal parole.  The
time a defendant gets is the time s/he serves (minus a couple days a month
"good time").

If, however, the offense caused an economic loss, the offense level would be
increased according to the general fraud table (Sec. 2F1.1). The proposed
commentary explains that computer offenses often cause intangible harms, such
as individual privacy rights or by impairing computer operations, property
values not readily translatable to the general fraud table. The proposed
commentary also suggests that if the defendant has a prior conviction for
``similar misconduct that is not adequately reflected in the criminal history
score, an upward departure may be warranted.'' An upward departure may also be
warranted, DOJ suggests, if ``the defendant's conduct has affected or was
likely to affect public service or confidence'' in ``public interests'' such
as common carriers, utilities, and institutions.  Based on the way U.S.
Attorneys and their computer experts have guesstimated economic "losses" in a
few prior cases, a convicted tamperer can get whacked with a couple of years
in the slammer, a whopping fine, full "restitution" and one to two years of
supervised release (which is like going to a parole officer). (Actually, it
*is* going to a parole officer, because although there is no more federal
parole, they didn't get rid of all those parole officers. They have them
supervise convicts' return to society.)

This, and other proposed sentencing guidelines, can be found at 57 Fed Reg
62832-62857 (Dec. 31, 1992).

   59. Synopsis of Amendment: This amendment creates a new guideline
applicable to violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1988 (18
U.S.C. 1030). Violations of this statute are currently subject to the fraud
guidelines at S. 2F1.1, which rely heavily on the dollar amount of loss caused
to the victim. Computer offenses, however, commonly protect against harms that
cannot be adequately quantified by examining dollar losses. Illegal access to
consumer credit reports, for example, which may have little monetary value,
nevertheless can represent a serious intrusion into privacy interests. Illegal
intrusions in the computers which control telephone systems may disrupt normal
telephone service and present hazards to emergency systems, neither of which
are readily quantifiable. This amendment proposes a new Section 2F2.1, which
provides sentencing guidelines particularly designed for this unique and
rapidly developing area of the law.

   Proposed Amendment: Part F is amended by inserting the following section,
numbered S. 2F2.1, and captioned "Computer Fraud and Abuse," immediately
following Section 2F1.2:

"S. 2F2.1. Computer Fraud and Abuse

   (a) Base Offense Level: 6

   (b) Specific Offense Characteristics

   (1) Reliability of data. If the defendant altered information, increase by
2 levels; if the defendant altered protected information, or public records
filed or maintained under law or regulation, increase by 6 levels.

   (2) Confidentiality of data. If the defendant obtained protected
information, increase by 2 levels; if the defendant disclosed protected
information to any person, increase by 4 levels; if the defendant disclosed
protected information to the public by means of a general distribution system,
increase by 6 levels.

   Provided that the cumulative adjustments from (1) and (2), shall
not exceed 8.

   (3) If the offense caused or was likely to cause

   (A) interference with the administration of justice (civil or criminal) or
harm to any person's health or safety, or

   (B) interference with any facility (public or private) or communications
network that serves the public health or safety, increase by 6 levels.

   (4) If the offense caused economic loss, increase the offense level
according to the tables in S. 2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit). In using those
tables, include the following:

   (A) Costs of system recovery, and

   (B) Consequential losses from trafficking in passwords.

   (5) If an offense was committed for the purpose of malicious destruction or
damage, increase by 4 levels.

   (c) Cross References

   (1) If the offense is also covered by another offense guideline section,
apply that offense guideline section if the resulting level is greater. Other
guidelines that may cover the same conduct include, for example: for 18 U.S.C.
1030(a)(1), S. 2M3.2 (Gathering National Defense Information); for 18 U.S.C.
1030(a)(3), S. 2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft), S.
2B1.2 (Receiving, Transporting, Transferring, Transmitting, or Possessing
Stolen Property), and S. 2H3.1 (Interception of Communications or
Eavesdropping); for 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(4), S. 2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit), and S.
2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft); for 18 U.S.C. S.
1030(a)(5), S. 2H2.1 (Obstructing an Election or Registration), S. 2J1.2
(Obstruction of Justice), and S. 2B3.2 (Extortion); and for 18 U.S.C. S.
1030(a)(6), S. 2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit) and S. 2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement,
and Other Forms of Theft).

 
Commentary

   Statutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(1)-(a)(6)

   Application Notes:

   1. This guideline is necessary because computer offenses often harm
intangible values, such as privacy rights or the unimpaired operation of
networks, more than the kinds of property values which the general fraud table
measures. See S. 2F1.1, Note 10. If the defendant was previously convicted of
similar misconduct that is not adequately reflected in the criminal history
score, an upward departure may be warranted.

   2. The harms expressed in paragraph (b)(1) pertain to the reliability and
integrity of data; those in (b)(2) concern the confidentiality and privacy of
data. Although some crimes will cause both harms, it is possible to cause
either one alone. Clearly a defendant can obtain or distribute protected
information without altering it. And by launching a virus, a defendant may
alter or destroy data without ever obtaining it. For this reason, the harms
are listed separately and are meant to be cumulative.

   3. The terms "information," "records," and "data" are interchangeable.

   4. The term "protected information" means private information, non-public
government information, or proprietary commercial information.

   5. The term "private information" means confidential information (including
medical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and tax information)
maintained under law, regulation, or other duty (whether held by public
agencies or privately) regarding the history or status of any person,
business, corporation, or other organization.

   6. The term "non-public government information" means unclassified
information which was maintained by any government agency, contractor or
agent; which had not been released to the public; and which was related to
military operations or readiness, foreign relations or intelligence, or law
enforcement investigations or operations.

   7. The term "proprietary commercial information" means non-public business
information, including information which is sensitive, confidential,
restricted, trade secret, or otherwise not meant for public distribution. If
the proprietary information has an ascertainable value, apply paragraph (b)
(4) to the economic loss rather than (b) (1) and (2), if the resulting offense
level is greater.

   8. Public records protected under paragraph (b) (1) must be filed or
maintained under a law or regulation of the federal government, a state or
territory, or any of their political subdivisions.

   9. The term "altered" covers all changes to data, whether the defendant
added, deleted, amended, or destroyed any or all of it.

   10. A "general distribution system" includes electronic bulletin board and
voice mail systems, newsletters and other publications, and any other form of
group dissemination, by any means.

   11. The term "malicious destruction or damage" includes injury to business
and personal reputations.

   12. Costs of system recovery: Include the costs accrued by the victim in
identifying and tracking the defendant, ascertaining the damage, and restoring
the system or data to its original condition.  In computing these costs,
include material and personnel costs, as well as losses incurred from
interruptions of service. If several people obtained unauthorized access to
any system during the same period, each defendant is responsible for the full
amount of recovery or repair loss, minus any costs which are clearly
attributable only to acts of other individuals.

   13. Consequential losses from trafficking in passwords: A defendant who
trafficked in passwords by using or maintaining a general distribution system
is responsible for all economic losses that resulted from the use of the
password after the date of his or her first general distribution, minus any
specific amounts which are clearly attributable only to acts of other
individuals. The term "passwords" includes any form of personalized access
identification, such as user codes or names.

   14. If the defendant's acts harmed public interests not adequately
reflected in these guidelines, an upward departure may be warranted. Examples
include interference with common carriers, utilities, and institutions (such
as educational, governmental, or financial institutions), whenever the
defendant's conduct has affected or was likely to affect public service or
confidence".

Continental Cablevision of Hartford broadcast a special offer of a free
T-shirt during last fall's Holyfield/Bowe fight (14Nov92).  Unlike most pay-
per-view broadcasting, this one did not show up through legitimate decoders.
The ad and its 800 number only showed up when watched through illegal
decoders.  140 freeloaders called the 800 number within minutes of the ad's
broadcast.  Continental sent the T-shirts by certified, return receipt mail,
and then sent them a followup letter reminding them of the federal law (fines
up to $10,000) and demanding a $2000 fine.  [Chicago Tribune, 3 Feb 1993]

The following appeared in the November issue of _Esperanto_, the publication
of the Universal Esperanto Association.  (This is my translation from the
original Esperanto.)

&gt; Portugal:  Esperanto from a computer error

&gt; Hans Jankowski (German) was pleasantly surprised when a money-changing
&gt; machine from the bank "Totta and Acores" in the Lisbon airport gave
&gt; him his receipt in Esperanto.  Because the Portuguese Esperanto
&gt; Association was also surprised, Antonio Martins decided to explore.
&gt; It seems that this was probably an error in setting up the computer:
&gt; on installation of the ten-language system, someone mistakenly
&gt; programmed Esp-eranto instead of the Spanish (esp-anol).  So, no one
&gt; congratulate the bank: they would be able to repair the "mistake"!

Their guess as to the origin of the situation certainly sounds plausible to
me, although they apparently did not contact the bank to find out for sure.

German newspapers report broadly on risks of hand-held telephones used in
flight. Following a report of a new German weekly magazine FOCUS (some sort of
Anti-Spiegel published since mid-January 1993, with some remarkably
well-investigated articles on IT InSecurities), Germany's federal airtransport
authority (Luftfahrt-Bundesamt, LBA in Braunschweig) admitted that major
problems with passengers telephoning with "handy" mobile hend-held telephones
have recently been experienced in some German airplanes.

Newspapers report that hand-held telephones have influenced flight instruments
(e.g. indicating velocity) even in landing approach. An LBA manager
responsible for analysis of flight systems' security mentioned a B737
approaching Hamburg airport under IFR conditions when slope indicator suddenly
began to jump; the pilot interrupted descent and made another (successful)
approach. In som. The LBA manager was quoted to say that if velocity
indicators be adversely affected by some influence of such a "handy"
telephone, the pilot may be tempted to diminish the velocity below the
critical value, with catastrophic influence on the plane.

When contacted by me, this LBA manager refused some overdrawn citations but
admitted that LBA sees serious problems and had warned carriers several times.
Meanwhile, passenger instruction concerning emergency exits etc now also
mentions risk of hand-held telephones which (according to some old German law)
are not allowed to use in-flight. According to him, wires in planes are
traditionally "hardened" against some electromagnetic induction; but the order
of magnitude of such protection (about 3 Volt/meter) is, according to recent
measurements of MBB (part of German Airbus, DASA) significantly lower than the
30 Volt/m which some hand-helds induce. Signal induction may even be worse as
effects of reflections and resonances (which may develop in edges and channels
below the cabin) may well enlarge the effect in a way hardly to measure.

In public debates, such new facts add to the criticism that some overly
computerized systems (e.g. Electronic Flight Management Systems, Fly-by-Wire)
may enlarge in-flight risks. But at least one more advanced technology may
reduce the risk of electromagnetic radiation: German Airbus is preparing to
replace one (of 3) wires for some part of A340 communication (at least
experimentally) by Fly-by-Light connection; in such a system, risk will remain
with opticouplers between electromagnetic and optic parts as well as with
traditional non-optical computers but the lines near the passengers parts will
become immune against electromagnetic effects.

Klaus Brunnstein (Univ Hamburg, February 6,1993)

PS: this year, some of you may have missed my traditional report from Chaos
Conference. Luckily, I was unable to participate, because several participants
independently informed me that NOTHING worthwhile to report happened.
Participation was said to be significantly lower than ever before, and even
some journalists which are CCC's good friends did not report this year.
Moreover, due to very chaotic organisation, CCCs usual electronic articles
were not available for FTP. "Downsizing" CCC seems to be in interesting
contrast to US hackers (2600) which become more active, as visible from the
Pentagon raids.

We knew there was some intelligence in Washington (contrary to popular
belief), I have encountered many dedicated civil servants who actually
understand the issues despite the pseudo-random efforts of transitory 
appointees. The excerpts I have seen of the GSA thoughts demonstrate this.

Actually, on reflection such a law might be a *good thing*. At the moment
the country is in an economic slump and numerous encryption technology
companies are struggling. Think of the benefits to them !

For the 1974 automotive model year the government passed the seatbelt
interlock law that mandated fastening of the seatbelts in occupied front seats
before the automobile could be started. This provided a windfall for a number
of people: those who made the millions of new interlock devices and wiring as
well as those who were paid to disconnect them.

Fortunately some cars were constructed in such a way that a simple connector
disconnect under the seat would allow starting in any condition. Such
forethought !

The simple fact is that such a law is unenforceable and will not have the 
desired effect (not that that has ever stopped Washington before), it is simply
too easy to bypass by anyone who cares. We have had plenty of examples of
how-to in both RISKS and PRIVACY (exercise is left to the student).

Not that a few miscreants won't be caught, stupidity is not confined to the
law-abiding, but all such a law does is serve notice that conversations may
be monitored (as they may be now) and a new industry will be born. Those in 
on the ground floor will make a few more millions from both sides and business
will continue as usual.

One universal truth in the USA is that *every* new law, good or bad, needed or
unnecessary means another piece of the pork barrel for someone. The line has
undoubtedly already formed.

	I must strongly disagree that the government needs special
capabilities for tapping phones, decoding transmissions, etc. built into these
systems by the manufacturers.  But perhaps my reasons are very different than
the ones recently stated regarding CC:mail.

	Everyone seems to be arguing the issue from a standpoint of the
government's need to crack down on crime vs.  the civil liberties of the
citizens.  I personally fall heavily on the civil liberties side, but I also
think that historically, we give up civil liberties to fight crime and provide
security.  I find it very hard to understand why cryptography should be an
illegal weapon while hand guns are legal, but then I can't understand how
cigarettes and alcohol can be legal when marijuana and cocaine and penicillin
and RU248 (238?) are illegal.  The point, I guess, is that it is political
power that determines legality and not rationality.  Which brings me to my
point.

	I am concerned that the government acts unfairly toward some companies
and against others based on their size, market share, political affiliations,
etc.  If the government approaches Lotus and not me to make a back door for
them, I think they are unfairly supporting Lotus in favor of me.  It is an
implicit endorsement of Lotus! I want the FBI to offer me hard cash and
government contracts in exchange for putting back doors in my software for
them.  In fact, I think we should require fairness to the extent that if the
FBI wants back doors in any product, they have to make the same deal for all
other products.

	This is not a privacy issue, it is a business issue.  We have the CSPR
and the SPA and other such groups that essentially provide better business
connections for people and support the positions of their constituents.  If
their constituents want to allow a 40 bit RSA to be claimed as `secure', they
support it, even though technically speaking, this is trivial to break - in a
matter of minutes - on a PC!  None of these companies are working for our
privacy, they are working for their profits.  They don't provide secure
encryption because there is no profit in it.  If the FBI can't read these
codes, it's probably not for lack of a back door - it's probably because of a
lack of technical expertise and funding.

	I am eager to hear some of you tell me that there is profit in
security.  What a bunch of malarkey! There may be a little profit in good
security for a few select organizations, but the vast majority of the profit
from security is from the perception and not the reality.  I often hear
companies tell me their cryptosystem is really good because it was approved by
the NSA - they don't mention the words `for export'.  People commonly buy
wordperfect because of it's encryption capability, but this has never been
secure in any way.  In fact, they are buying the wordperfect cracking program
from QUT to read files encrypted by employees who have since left.  PKware
sells authenticated PKzip capability, and people buy it because they want the
perception of integrity, but it is easy to crack, an forged virus-infected zip
files under their newest algorithm have already been shown after only a few
weeks in widespread distribution.

	Now about Lotus.  In my limited personal experience with Lotus, I have
found them to be sincere about providing the best protection they can in their
products, subject to the time constraints placed on them by the market which
values performance over almost everything else.  I think they did the right
thing by claiming to have refused to put in a back door, at least from a
business standpoint.  I also think that if the government offered enough money
in exchange for the back door, Lotus would put it in.  This is not a moral
issue, it is a business issue.

SEMI-HUMOROUS-SEMI-SINCERE-REMARKS-ON

	So if you are a private citizen who wishes to maintain privacy, or a
criminal who wishes not to be caught, there are at least three lessons to be
learned:

	1 - Buy from a small sincere company (like mine) that will (for the
right amount of money) provide source code, and then get that source code
vetted by a different small sincere company (like mine) that will certify the
algorithm, its implementation, and report on its adequacy.  Small companies do
this better because you probably need a real expert for the whole process, and
only the right small company will likely provide this to you.  The second
similar company provides you with the redundancy required for high integrity.

	2 - Security costs time and money.  If you aren't willing to suffer
the consequences, you don't want security! Most people say they want the best
security for the price and performance, but as most real experts know, you
don't get much security unless you get a lot of security.  The average high
school level cracker can break almost every commercial security product in a
matter of a few hours - most in minutes.

	3 - The best encryption in the world won't make you very safe if you
dial into CompuServe (NOTE I AM NOT CITING COMPUSERVE AS AN ACTUAL PERPETRATOR
BUT RATHER AS A CONVENIENT NAME-RECOGNITION IDENTIFIER FOR THE LARGER CLASS OF
SUCH SERVICES) from your PC to send the information.  The FBI could easily
provide the back door in the communications service to enter your PC from your
remote connection and extract your keys, the plaintext of your message, or
maybe even place the back door in your encryption package.  Before you laugh
at the suggestion, note that when a recently introduced communications service
first came on the market, it `accidentally' transmitted private information
from subscribers over the wire.  If it happens accidentally, you know we can
do it on purpose.

For all the fur that's in the air, the participants in this discussion give
naive trust to the assumption that "there's all this crime the FBI has to stop"
without ever considering whether you could reduce the amount of crime by
changing the law.  It's a classic risk, and it has been exploited by Hitler,
Mussolini, Bismark, Saddam Hussein, and Torquemada, to name a few.  You state
it thus, filling in the blanks to suit your particular needs:

"Our cause is just, therefore we must ......"

Nonsense.  Damn little deserves this kind of credulity, certainly not the
performance of the FBI, the DEA, and the Federal Government.  The
Joltes-Denning twain argue nits about how to stem a legal trickle while we are
inundated by breaches of reason.

SPYMASTERS ORDER REDESIGN OF `TOO SECURE' MOBILE PHONES  by Christopher Lloyd

[Cartoon of a ridiculous mobile handset with various antennaea and dishes
protruding.  It is being held by a dismayed, purple-suited, man whilst a
sign reads: "New! GCHQ-approved mobile phone".]

  The next generation of mobile telephones has proved so secure against
tapping that it is to be made less safe on the advice of the intelligence
services.  The phones, based on coded digital technology, will have their
technology modified so that spies can continue to eavesdrop on private
conversations.

  The changes, ordered by a European Community (EC) telecommunications
committee in Brussels, are being made at the insistence of European
governments, including Britain's.  They fear that surveillance operations
against drug barons, the criminal underworld and foreign powers could be
undermined.

  Digital mobiles phones, based on a system called GSM, are already
replacing standard analogue networks across the world. They are equipped
with a sophisticated scrambling code called A5, offering protection from
interception equivalent to many military systems.

  It is this code that is to be replaced by one called A5X, to allow
undercover eavesdropping to continue.

  Last week a Department of Trade and Industry spokesman confirmed changes
were being introduced to make it easier for security agencies - ranging
from GCHQ, the British government's listening post near Cheltenham, to the
FBI in America - to eavesdrop.

  "Alternative coding is being developed for the reasons you have outlined,"
he said.  "There is a general desire for this among the governments of
Europe."

  The department, which issues export licenses for the phones, is
particularly concerned that the original A5 technology should not be sold
to countries that may adapt it for military applications. 

  In America, the FBI has voiced similar concern.  Nestor Michnyak,
spokesman for the FBI headquarters in Washington, said that digital
technology was advancing so fast that counter-surveillance was in danger
of being undermined.

  "We are trying to get companies and manufacturers to work with us to allow
us to maintain the surveillance operations we have undertaken since the late
1960s," he said.  "All we are asking is to be able to continue to do what we
are currently doing and we want the same access we are having now."

  Manufacturers of GSM mobile phones will be forced to adapt products to
work with the new codes.  Motorola, one of the leading makers of the
digital mobile handsets, complained that costs may rise as a result.

  "We are flying blind here," said Larry Conlee, the assistant general
manager of Motorola's European cellular division.  "The GSM system has
ended up more secure than it should have been for the commercial market
and now we're trying to recover from it."

  Vodafone, Britain's largest analogue mobile phone company, which has
already installed 250 GSM base stations covering 50% of the UK population,
said its network will need to be adapted to accept the new codes.

  "Government authorities have made it known that they don't want this
high level of encoding," said Mike Caldwell, the spokesman for Vodafone.

  Caldwell said the problem with the original system was that it would
take security services weeks rather than minutes to decode the
conversations they wanted to bug.  Despite the changes, it will be still
virtually impossible for any amateur eavesdropper to intercept calls made
on the digital mobile phones.

        Transcript of an article in New Scientist, 30 Jan 1993

Spymasters fear bug-proof cellphones
(Barry Fox, Bahrain)

One of the jewels of Europe's electronics industry, the new all-digital
cellular phone system GSM, may be blocked from export to other countries
around the world by Britain's Department of Trade and Industry. The DTI
objects to the exports because it believes the encryption system that GSM uses
to code its messages is too good.  Sources say this is because the security
services and military establishment in Britain and the US fear they will no
longer be able [to] eavesdrop on telephone conversations. Few people believe
GSM needs such powerful encryption, but the makers of GSM complain that the
DTI has woken to the problem five years too late.

At MECOM 93, a conference on developing Arab communications held in Bahrain
last week, many Gulf and Middle Eastern countries sought tenders for GSM
systems, but the companies selling them could not agree terms without the
go-ahead of the DTI. Qatar and the United Arab Emirates want to be first with
GSM in the Gulf, with Bahrain next. GSM manufacturers are worried that the
business will be lost to rival digital systems already on offer from the US
and Japan.

The Finnish electronics company Nokia, which is tendering for Bahrain's GSM
contract, says "There is no logic. We don't know what is happening or why." A
DTI spokeswoman would only say that exports outside Europe would need a
licence and each case would be treated on its own merits.

The GSM system was developed in the mid-1980s by the Groupe Special Mobile, a
consortium of European manufacturers and telecommunications authorities. The
technology was supported by European Commission and the GSM standard has now
been agreed officially by 27 operators in 18 European countries.

GSM was designed to allow business travellers to use the same portable phone
anywhere in Europe and be billed back home. This is impossible with the
existing cellphone services because different countries use different analogue
technology.

The plan was for GSM to be in use across Europe by 1991, but the existing
analogue services have been too successful. No cellphone operator wants to
invest in a second network when the first is still making profits. So GSM
manufacturers have been offering the technology for export.

Whereas all existing cellular phone systems transmit speech as analogue waves,
GSM converts speech into digital code. Foreseeing that users would want secure
communications, the GSM designers built an encryption system called A5 into
the standard; it is similar to the US government's Data Encryption Standard.
British Telecom was involved in developing A5, so the British government has
special rights to control its use.

To crack the DES and A5 codes needs huge amounts of computer power.  This is
what alarmed the FBI in the US, which wants to be able to listen in to
criminals who are using mobile phones. It also alarmed GCHQ, the British
government's listening post at Cheltenham which monitors radio traffic round
the world using satellites and sensitive ground-based receivers.

The DTI has now asked for the GSM standard to be changed, either by watering
down the encryption system, or by removing encryption altogether. This means
that GSM manufacturers must redesign their microchips. But they cannot start
until a new standard is set and the earliest hope of that is May.

Any change will inevitably lead to two different GSM standards, so robbing GSM
of its major selling point -- freedom to roam between countries with the same
phone. Manufacturing costs will also rise as new chips are put into
production.

As part of a research project, I would like to find out about Programmable 
Logic Controllers (PLCs), of the sort frequently used for real-time control 
of industrial plant. 

I require information about the hardware and software, any fault-tolerant 
architectural features, methods of program development, reports on their 
use, etc. 

Information would be particularly welcome from anyone who has worked with 
PLCs, but any odd stories or references would be useful. 

The result will probably be a project report (or two) on the application of 
PLCs in the control of safety-critical systems. This report will be in the 
public domain, but if requested I will treat sources as confidential and 
not attribute the information in the report. 

Many thanks. Please address any responses to me personally, not to RISKS.

About two months ago I was permitted to accompany my wife on an expedition to
the fabric store.  Our final transaction, involving a credit card, was a
source of no small confusion to the clerk at the till.  He punched all the
requisite buttons, but was unhappy with the result.  Finally, though, he
punched the transmit button.  Apparently he was no happier with this new
result, since he (mentally) ran over the process again before again punching
the transmit button.

Still unhappy, he asked help from a co-worker, who quizzed him on the process.
Satisfied that he had no, in fact, made an error, *she* punched the transmit
button, and was no happier than he with the result.  The manager, was brought 
in, and was still not any happier after she (the manager) had punched transmit.
The situation was resolved when someone remembered to turn on the printer
attached to the "swipe" unit.

I was reminded of this yesterday. Why?  The credit card statement came with,
you guessed it, four copies of the same billing.

Risks?  The unit apparently was indicating an error, but did not give any
indication as to what that error was.  The procedure had a "fault", but was
allowed to proceed without a vital component.  (The printed receipt, signed
by the customer, is, in fact, the only legal proof of the transaction.  yes,
I do know that the existence of the credit card record is a "presumption of
evidence" of the transaction.)  Finally, even though the transaction was only
entered once, the unit still submitted four confirmed "billings", with only
the transmit key being hit again.  I find it odd that the transaction, having
been transmitted, would not be cleared from the "till-side" unit in order
to prevent such accidental duplicates.

On the evening of Feb. 2nd my wife and I were woken up by sounds out on the
street. My wife struggled out of bed, looked through the venetian blinds, and
screamed at me to put on my glasses and come to the window.

The house across the street was on fire. This was no, small, contained fire :
the entire, complete structure was up in flames. I was quoted in the press
days later as saying that the flames were over fifty feet high; I still don't
think this is an exaggeration.

It was a stunning and disturbing site : so much so, that we have slept only
fitfully since then. The house was completely destroyed. Fortunately, the
owner escaped.

What makes it all the worse is that it quickly became apparent that the fire
department was not responding! For what seemed like an eternity, the fire
burned out of control, with only a lone police officer on the scene.
Eventually, the fire department arrived and began to do their work. As the
neighbours congregated in shock outside, the story began to circulate that 'it
took the fire department 22 minutes to get here', and that 'they went to the
wrong address'.

It turns out that when the operator at 911 received the call, Birchwood was
punched into the computer. The system listed Birchwood Heights Drive first, a
street a good 5 miles away! from our location. Tragically, the operator
selected that location, and a full response team of 6 pumpers and trucks was
sent. Meanwhile, the fire on Birchwood Drive continued to rage out of control.

My neighbour across the street called three times, since it became evident
that something was wrong when the fire department was not there within five
minutes (being only about 1 mile away.) They realized their mistake within
10-12 minutes, after the third call (and after obviously seeing that there was
no fire on Birchwood Heights Drive!)

The Mississauga Fire Department has apologized to the owner of the destroyed
property (estimates of loss are $1/2million or higher), and has promised to
review it's dispatch procedures.

Surely the system can be programmed to provide a second confirmation for
streets that are phonetically similar? Surely something can be done with the
system configuration to avoid this easy but tragic mistake?

In the February 7, 1993 NY Times (sunday) on page 32 they had an article
(about 10 column inches) detailing privacy issues with email.

They talked about Oliver North's message in 1986 to his aide Ronald Sable:

"Oh Lord, I lost the slip and broke one of the high heels.   Forgive please.  
Will return the wig Monday".

The article quotes Paul Saffo (Institute for the Future) talking about "we

Fans of encryption and those who merely fan the fires of debate about
encryption's inherent threat/value will want to dig up Peter Schweitzer's new
book _Friendly Spies_ just published by Atlantic Monthly Press. He includes
many different details about covert intelligence operations directed against
US corporations by cold war allies. Time and time again he says, foreign
governments conspire with foreign companies to steal US technology and
economic secrets.

He mentions that France and Germany and many other countries require US
Companies to "register" the encryption key for reasons of national security.
All of the American transmissions are monitored and the data is passed on to
the local competitors.  Companies like 	IBM finally began to routinely
transmit false information to their French subsidiary just to thwart the
French Secret Service and by transitive property of economic nationalism,
French computer companies.

The lessons? Key registration in the world hurts American corporations.
Cryptography protects the creators and thwarts those who seek to copy
innovation.

A colleague has just shown me an article about an online service called
"Information America". The article is (possibly justifiably) alarmist in tone
- and I cannot vouch for its factual accuracy. The article appeared in issue 8
of a (strange, to me at least) magazine called Mondo 2000, published some time
in 1992 - the publisher's address is given as PO Box 1071, Berkeley, CA.

Let me say no more about the article or the magazine, but just provide
soc.roots/ROOTS-L readers some illustrative quotes from it:

"BIG BROTHER ISN'T DEAD, HE'S JUST SUBCONTRACTING

If you have a modem, a home computer and can afford $95 an hour fees you too
can access Information America's online computer database, cross indexing the
Postal Service's National Change of Address file (NCOA), major publisher and
direct marketing companies' client information, birth records, drivers'
license records, phone books, voter registrations, records from up to 49
governmental agencies, and more. Information America boasts up to date
information on over 111 million Americans, 80 million households, and 61
million telephones.

If you are not scared yet you should be. Because complete strangers can
find out where you live, tracing you through extensive relocations even if
they have only a last name, or a state, an old address or telephone number.
....
Not until recently has information like this been commercially available in
a single database, specifically with law enforcement, private
investigators, bounty hunters and lawyers in mind. Information America is
the first accessible service to make use of previously collected data for
the express purpose of providing up-to-date whereabouts and personal
profiles of as many Americans as possible.
....
People finder is made up of four services: SKIP TRACER, TELEPHONE TRACKER,
PERSON LOCATOR and PEOPLE FINDER MULTITRACK
.....
SKIP TRACER traces a person's moves or verifies the current address when
all you have is an old address. You will enter the person's name, street
number, street name, and either the zip code or the city/state. If your
subject is in IA's files a profile will be provided that includes the
address he moved to (or current address), phone number, length of
residence, and more. You may also request a list of ten of the person's
neighbours. A profile on the current resident at your subject's old address
and up to ten neighbours there may also be available.
....
TELEPHONE TRACKER tracks down the owner of a telephone number... If a match
is found, you may look at a profile of that individual/residence and a
listing of up to ten neighbours.
....
PERSON LOCATOR helps you locate a person when specific address information

addressed to the splendid Usenet newsgroup comp.risks - to which my colleague
is addressing a separate message about Information America.  However it seems
to me that the service might be of legitimate interest to a number of
soc.roots/ROOTS-L readers (for example, those carrying out aextensive "one-name

The Valley Times (Feb.18) reported that telephone service was cut off for more
than 4 hours to about 37,000 phone lines in Livermore, CA including "911" and
operator "O" lines. The article said that "the significance (of the
malfunction) was in having three prefixes that can't reach emergency phone
lines.... The phone company [Pacific Bell] was stymied in correcting the
problem because diagnostic tests of the equipment told technicians that there
was no problem....Technicians eventually located the problem in a call
processor computer tape and replaced the malfunctioning tape." Luckily for
those of us that live here, this is a relatively low crime area and no serious
crimes occurred during the outage. Some banks compensated by letting in only a
few customers at a time because they were concerned that their alarm systems
wouldn't be able to call police.

&gt;From the Oregonian, Saturday, Feb. 20, 1993, p.B1:

"Computer delays response to fatal Bonny Slope fire", by James Mayer

It takes seven minutes for the alarm to reach Tualatin Valley Fire &amp; Rescue
because of a glitch that sends it to the office that dispatches Portland Fire
Bureau units instead of to the proper agency in Washington County

[BACKGROUND: Multnomah County is the county that contains the City of Portland.
Suburban Washington County adjoins it to the west.  Multnomah County is oddly
shaped, and small slices of it here and there are served by suburban agencies
instead of the corresponding Portland agency.  I live in one of those places,
and when I moved into my present house in 1980 it took the telephone company
two days to find me and sort out who was responsible for hooking up my
telephone service.  Which fortunately was not an emergency.]

A computer error added seven minutes to the time it took firefighters to reach
a 68-year-old woman trapped in her burning Bonny Slope home last week.

Mildred Smith died of smoke inhalation suffered in a pre-dawn Feb. 12 blaze at
her home at 12401 NW Thompson Rd.

A neighbor telephoned 9-1-1 to report the fire at 2:40 AM, but firefighters
from Tualatin Valley Fire &amp; Rescue were not dispatched until 2:47 AM because a
computer error sent the original call to the wrong place.

Eugene Jacobus, Washington County deputy medical examiner, said it would be
hard to determine whether the dispatching delay made a fatal difference.
Firefighters were also delayed by steel-bar security doors when they reached
the remote house north of Cedar Mill, 5 and 1/2 minutes after finally getting
the call for help.

"It's really hard to say, but certainly a delay of that magnitude is going to
make a difference, Jacobus said.  "You can be relatively sure that any delay,
whether two or seven minutes, is going to rob an individual of some ability to
be resuscitated."

By Friday, officials had traced the problem to the computerized telephone
switching system at Portland's 9-1-1 center on Kelly Butte.


Fire and US West Communications officials say a "reloading" of some computer
software by US West inadvertently changed the way the 9-1-1 system routed calls
for a very small number of callers.

"We're still looking to find out how that happened," said Jim Haynes, US West
spokesman.

&lt;stuff about previous problems with the system deleted&gt;

Here's what happened in the latest incident, as pieced together from
interviews and official reports:

At 2:40 AM, Jack Gilbert, of 12229 NW Hillar Lane, called 9-1-1 to report what
he first thought was a brush fire in the area of the NW Thompson Road home,
about 100 yards away.

The call was answered at Kelly Butte, because the Gilbert's home is just
inside the Multnomah County line.

On the enhanced 9-1-1 computer screen, the dispatcher could see that
Washington County Consolidated Communication Agency was the appropriate
dispatching agency and Tualatin Valley Fire &amp; Rescue was the appropriate fire
department.

About four seconds later, the dispatcher hit a key that is supposed to route
the call automatically to the right place.

But, in this case, it didn't work.  Although the 9-1-1 operator didn't know
it, the call instead went to Portland's Fire Alarm Dispatch office, which
dispatches Portland Fire Bureau units.

Dispatchers there looked at the address and realized it was a Washington
County call.  At 2:44 AM Portland fire dispatchers called the Washington
County 9-1-1 center.

But for reasons that are unclear, Washington County dispatchers looked for
"1229" Hillar Road, instead of "12229" for some time without finding it in
their computers, finally kicking it back to Portland under the belief that it
must be a Portland address.

About two minutes later, Portland Fire called Washington County again.  This
time, the right, five-digit address was exchanged.

Finally, at 2:47 AM, Tualatin Valley Fire &amp; Rescue got the call.

At almost the exact moment, seven minutes after the first call, Smith herself
called 9-1-1 from inside her home.  The same thing happened.  The Kelly Butte
dispatcher hit the key to route the call, and it went to Portland Fire Alarm
Dispatch instead of Washington County.

About a minute after that, Gilbert called again, this time to report that the
fire was in the house. By this time, firefighters were on the way.

It took the first company, coming from kaiser Road in the Oak Hills area, 5
and 1/2 minutes to get there.

The second unti arrived two minutes after that.

Firefighters could hear 73-year-old Robert Smith pounding on the security
door, trying to get out.

His wife, by that time, however, was silent.  Firefighters broke a window to
get inside.

Robert Smith suffered smoke inhalation, but he survived. Mildred Smith died 12
hours later.

Larry Hatch, assistant director of the washington County 9-1-1 center,
acknowledged that confusion about the address added minutes to the call, but
none of that would have happened without the initial switching error.

Gary Schrader, director of Portland's Bureau of Emergency Communications,
which runs the Kelly Butte center, said officials originally thought the
dispatcher had made a mistake.

The telephone problem was discovered and corrected on Monday.

The telephone company had done a system "reload" Jan. 30 and that was what
resulted in the switch sending calls in the wrong direction, Haynes said.

Schrader said the error was not discovered because of the low volume of calls
from people who live in Multnomah County but, like the Smiths, are served by
an outside fire agency.

END Oregonian article

COMMENT:  The story doesn't say why "reloading" produces erroneous behavior.
Maybe US West doesn't know, at this point?

information technology in the Netherlands. My comments are in [... -JS] I

GSM cannot be tapped.   (Automatiseringsgids, 19 Feb 93)

The Ministry of Justice is negotiating with PTT Telecom to figure out which
way Justice, Police and Security Services can listen in on subscribers of the
new digital car phone system (GSM). The government is now discussing the
option of tapping conversations at the central PTT switchboards. [PTT Telecom
is the sole provider of telecom infrastructure in the Netherlands -JS]

GSM is protected by personal subscriber smart-cards and complex algorithms,
well enough to stop professional eaves-droppers. Security officials fear
that this will be welcomed by criminal organisations, who can communicate
through this system without fear of being tapped.

[The article does not mention exactly which 'algorithms'. Public key
perhaps? If anyone really knows, please tell us -JS]

Since GSM will be used throughout Europe, it is especially useful for
criminals operating internationally.

Secret and Police Services in Europe are trying to convince their Ministries
of Internal Affairs of the need to force GSM providers to adapt their services
to make tapping possible. The German government is talking to two GSM
providers, DBP Telekom and Mannesmann/PacTel, to persuade them to cooperate
and implement a tapping option. British Telecom and Vodafone in Great Britain
are also discussing this problem with the government.  [GSM] providers are
thinking about this problem and are trying to find a solution for all of
Europe.

I am writing a book about artificial life, and have some examples of programs
that automate distribution of software in LANs, implement distributed
databases, etc.  They are all written in the Unix shell, and involve a few
lines of code that automatically copy the programs between machines to
automate the distribution process.  It has come to my attention that there may
be substantial objection to this idea and I am asking people in this forum for
their opinion.

Each program includes explicit safeties to prevent copying to machines where
operation is not authorized by the root, and they are designed not to spread
outside of particular directories.  The code is very obvious (only a few lines
of shell script after all), and the book includes explicit warnings not to
remove safeties or use on any machine where you don't have permission.

Questions:

1 - why not provide this in the book?
2 - what risks do you see in it?
3 - are you an admin or a user?
4 - do you think there is value in including these examples?
5 - do you think the advantages of examples outweigh any risks?
6 - do you think that the versions that optimize their own behavior by
      `evolving' improved forms should not be included - if not why not?

Please Email me your responses ASAP, as the book goes to press in a few weeks.
Also, if you DO NOT want your comments included in the book (no names will be
used) tell me.  Otherwise, I will feel free to include any comments I find
particularly enlightening.  FC

The London Ambulance Service Crisis reported to RISKS earlier has been absent
from the UK press for a while, but now it seems likely to burst forth again.
The attached article is reprinted in its entirety from (UK) Computer Weekly,
18 Feb, 1993.  Cheers.  Brian Randell

Report to confirm (pounds)1m 999 systems blunder   (by David Evans)

LONDON Ambulance Service made a fatal blunder when it bought a (pounds)1m
untested computer system to handle 999 calls, an official inquiry will reveal
next week.  Union leaders have already blamed the system for contributing to
the deaths of at least four patients.

Around 800,000 emergency calls are handled by the capital's ambulance
service each year. But after a spate of incidents, in which calls were lost
and emergency victims suffered long delays before ambulances arrived, the
system was abandoned.

Now an official report into the fiasco, demanded by health secretary
Virginia Bottomley, is expected to be scathing in its criticism.

Since last November an independent panel has been looking at the circumstances
surrounding the purchase of the system, bought when a previous computer-aided
dispatch module crashed.  Yet after just a few months of use the replacement
was similarly suffering from calldata overload.

Questions raised by the report will include why Aldershot-based Systems
Options was chosen as the main soft-ware supplier when it had no previous
experience in providing dispatch systems to the ambulance sector. 

Jim Pedroza, Systems Options' founder, has consistently refused to talk to the
press. His networked solution based on Apricot workstations and servers
contrasts markedly with mini-based systems favoured by other emergency
services.

According to sources working close to the inquiry team, one conclusion is
that a replacement computer-aided dispatch system will now take years,
rather than months, to implement. It will also confirm that the Systems
Options solution is wholly unfit for the task.

Said one London ambulance source: "What we're talking about here is an
official stamp of condemnation. Not enough attention was paid to the project,
and the lack of expertise in choosing the system was completely unacceptable."

The outcome of the report has been delayed to allow for the publication
this week of the Tomlinson report on London hospitals.

Since the system was ditched, the service's chief John Wilby has resigned and
control room staff have reverted to manual methods of dispatching crews.

Below is the Call for Papers for the 4th IFIP Working Conference on Dependable
Computing for Critical Applications.  The conference aims to promote research
that considers different aspects of dependability, including security, safety,
reliability, and availability, in a common framework, with emphasis on high
assurance.

Call for Papers: 

4th IFIP Working Conference on Dependable Computing for Critical Applications
January 4-6, 1994, Catamaran Resort Hotel, San Diego, California, USA 

Increasingly, individuals and organizations are becoming critically dependent
on sophisticated computing systems. In differing circumstances, this
dependency might for example center on the continuity of service received from
the computing system, the overall performance level achieved, the real-time
response rate provided, the extent to which catastrophic failures are avoided,
or confidentiality violations prevented. The notion of dependability, defined
as the trustworthiness of computer service such that reliance can justifiably
be placed on this service, enables these various concerns to be subsumed
within a single conceptual framework with reliability, availability, safety
and security, for example, being treated as particular attributes of
dependability.

The fourth IFIP Working Conference on Dependable Computing for Critical
Applications aims at bringing together researchers and developers from
academia, industry and government for advancing the state of the art in
dependable computing. Papers are sought in all areas of dependable computing,
including but not limited to models, methods, algorithms, tools and practical
experience with specifying, designing, implementing, assessing, validating,
operating and maintaining dependable computing systems. Of particular, but not
exclusive, interest will be presentations which address combinations of
dependability attributes, e.g. safety and security or fault-tolerance and
safety, through studies of either a theoretical or an applied nature.

Submitting a Paper: Six copies (in English) of original work should be
submitted by 30 June 1993, to the Program co-Chair:

        Dr. Gerard Le Lann
        INRIA - Project REFLECS

        France                          E-mail: Gerard.Le_Lann@inria.fr

Papers should be limited to 6000 words, full page figures being counted as 300
words. Each paper should include a short abstract and a list of keywords
indicating subject classification. Papers will be refereed and the final
choice will be made by the Program Committee. Notification of acceptance will
be sent by September 24 1993, and camera-ready copy will be due on November
12, 1993. A digest of papers will be available at the Conference, and
hardbound proceedings will be published after the Conference as a volume of

Technology is constantly changing the our world.  New ways of doing things
bring benefits undreamed-of just a few years ago.  These technologies also
have their price.  The costs can be financial, but also less freedom, more
risks, more stress.  How do we balance benefits and costs?  Do those who enjoy
the benefits bear their fair share of the costs?  How can we determine a fair
share?  If we can, and don't like the results, what do we change?  Is the
Government always the best way to change things?

ISTAS '93 invites significant contributions on these issues from a wide
spectrum of scholarly and concerned individuals. The contributions can be
papers, proposals for a session or panel of invited experts, or proposals for

Periodically I will remind you of TWO useful digests related to privacy,
both of which are siphoning off some of the material that would otherwise
appear in RISKS, but which should be read by those of you vitally interested in
privacy problems.  RISKS will continue to carry higher-level discussions in
which risks to privacy are a concern.

* The PRIVACY Forum Digest (PFD) is run by Lauren Weinstein.  He manages it as
  a rather selectively moderated digest, somewhat akin to RISKS; it spans the
  full range of both technological and non-technological privacy-related issues
  (with an emphasis on the former).  For information regarding the PRIVACY
  Forum, please send the exact line:

information privacy

  as the BODY of a message to "privacy-request@cv.vortex.com"; you will receive
  a response from an automated listserv system.  To submit contributions,
  send to "privacy@cv.vortex.com".

* The Computer PRIVACY Digest (CPD) (formerly the Telecom Privacy digest) is
  run by Dennis G. Rears.  It is gatewayed to the USENET newsgroup
  comp.society.privacy.  It is a relatively open (i.e., less tightly moderated)
  forum, and was established to provide a forum for discussion on the
  effect of technology on privacy.  All too often technology is way ahead of
  the law and society as it presents us with new devices and applications.
  Technology can enhance and detract from privacy.  Submissions should go to
  comp-privacy@pica.army.mil and administrative requests to
  comp-privacy-request@pica.army.mil.

There is clearly much potential for overlap between the two digests, although
contributions tend not to appear in both places.  If you are very short of time
and can scan only one, you might want to try the former.  If you are interested
in ongoing detailed discussions, try the latter.  Otherwise, it may well be
appropriate for you to read both, depending on the strength of your interests
and time available.

The following appeared in the Feb. 13, 1993 issue of the "Toronto Star":

Edmonton(CP)-- It's that time of year again when love is in the air and Canada
Post is seeing red. Red envelopes, that is.  That's because the computerized
mail sorting machines, which can process 33,000 letters an hour, have trouble
reading addresses off the red envelopes popular for Valentine Day greetings, a
Canada Post spokeswoman says.  "We in Canada have some of the most technically
advanced machinery in the world," Teresa Williams says. "And while it's not
impossible for them to read red envelopes, some of them can present a bit of a
challenge."  If your valentine card hasn't arrived, it may have been delayed
in the mail-sorting process, William says.  A reminder for next year: white
envelopes should be used instead. "Or put a white sticker on a red envelope,"
Williams suggests.

Meanwhile Hallmark Cards Inc., based in the United States, is complying with a
U.S. Postal Service request to stop producing dark-colored envelopes over the
next couple of years. U.S. machines can't read them either.

During the night of 5 February 1993, 18 diskettes were stolen from the
Ministry of Economy and Taxes in Madrid, Spain.  All the diskettes contained
information of international funds transferred by Kuwait Investment Office
(KIO) since 1988.
 
The situation of this large group of chemical, building and real estate
companies in Spain is very complex, because many of them are in bankruptcy,
the Spanish Government paid a lot of money for this industry support, there
are thousands of people losing their jobs, and present managers of KIO in
Spain demanded old jobs at the Court, because of money fraud and political
corruption.
 
Javier De la Rosa, Fouad K. Jaffar and Mohamed al Sabah are the names related
with it that appear every day in several press items that compare their
management with Michael Milken (convicted), John H. Gutfreund, Donald M.
Feurstein (Salomon Inc) and other Securities &amp; Exchange Commission affairs in
USA.  But they control many journalists here, thanks to the singer Julio
Iglesias' ex-manager, and now Javier De la Rosa's speaker [spokesman?],
Alfredo Fraile.
 
The Government Ministry, Carlos Solchaga, told the press that he thinks the
goal of the thief is to sell this information to the press, and to discredit
HIM.  He advised journalists not to buy this interesting digital information,
because legal prosecution will be ordered if anything is published.
 
On the other side, Javier De la Rosa told the journalists that there is a
mafia in Spanish bureaucracy that stole the diskettes.  But this is not a
clever idea because it is not necessary to steal something that can be easily
diskcopied.
 
What is much more interesting is that KIO has nothing to say, and that a
Spanish Justice refused to accept its demand because there was not enough
information enclosed.  It seems that they did not find a computer expert able
enough to look for financial scandal data in computers and back-ups, now
owned by them.
 
IMHO, everybody has too many things to hide in this sad story.

The Boston Business Journal, February 1993

     A Boston branch of the Daiwa Bank Ltd., the 25th largest bank in the
world, was victimized by prison inmates with a gift for social engineering,
according to the Boston Business Journal.  The inmates placed collect calls to
the Daiwa switchboard, identified themselves as telephone repairmen, and said
they could fix the company's telephone problems by being connected to an
outside line. Once connected to an outside line, the cons made long-distance
calls, sticking Daiwa with the tab.  Some of the calls were to sex hotlines.
     Hospitals in the Boston area were some of the first victims of this form
of phone fraud, the newspaper reported.  Inmates treated at the hospitals
would memorize employees' names or use the names of physician's who appeared
on TV to con operators into giving inmates access to outside lines.  Once the
operators got wind of what was happening, though, the hospitals were able to
clamp down on the problem. One inmate, impersonating a doctor who appeared on
TV the previous day, gave himself away by referring to himself by title
"doctor." The operator knew the physician always identified himself by his
first name. the last thing the jailbird heard before the operator hung up on
him was, "I suggest you speak to the warden about that."

&gt;From the {Washington City Paper} of Feb 19-25, page 18:

News of the Weird by Chuck Shepard:

  In January, Israel's national telephone company initiated a fax service that
  transmits messages to God via the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem.  In May, the
  Roman Catholic Church will unveil a high-tech confessional at a trade show
  in Vincenza, Italy, that will accept confessions by fax.  And in December, a
  sect of Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn, NY began selling its members special
  beepers so they will know instantly when the Messiah arrives on earth."

And there is precedent for a response, I guess:
  "Your Majesty, I have a message from God for you."     - Judges 3:20

Paul Robinson -- TDARCOS@MCIMAIL.COM

    [Hopefully, the Messiah will not arrive on the Sabbath, although there
    might be a question as to whether the beeper is actually being USED as 
    long as it does NOT trigger.  Confessions by EMail should be easy to set
    up.  L.A. has long had drive-through churches; I suppose services via
    on-line interactive multimedia X-window conferencing cannot be far behind.
    But watch out for a hi-tech Allah McGordo bombshell in virtual reality.

Consider this a balancing comment on economic risk of incorporating
american technology (it is also tangentially relevant to the original
discussion about export restrictions on US cryptographic technology).

I don't doubt that the French, German or British intelligence services carry
out occasional industrial espionage for their local industries (certainly, I
have seen reports of British intelligence doing this in the British press).

However, to balance this (least anyone think from the above that the US is
somehow more virtuous in these things, and does not behave in such an
underhanded, ungentlemanly, or even, dare I say it, nefarious, manner) I
should point out that there are, or at least were, when I still lived there,
regular complaints in the British press from firms trying to sell technology
that contained US made components to, say, China, only to find, first, that
the US department of trade prohibited the sale on strategic grounds, and
second, that identical technology was suddenly no longer strategic when it was
offered by some US company that had mysteriously heard about the British deal,
and was able to close it instead.

Information America does a lot more than is described in the post (I have
not seen the Mondo article yet).  I know one of their sales people (well ex
she quit just before christmas).  Their prime selling strategy to lawyers 
seems to be in competition with Lexis, Nexis (sp?) and Dialog (all large
online database services).  

The idea is that the lawyer (or more correctly a paralegal) can research
case law on line in a fraction of the time it would take in the law
library.  They have all US court cases on line (local &amp; federal).

I don't think there is any "dark' intent in the lack of publicity for IA,
more that they just don't see value in advertising to people who are not
going to buy their service.

As to the other services they provide, what is the problem ?  We live in an
information society.  If you don't want people using and tracking information,
don't give it to them (i.e., go live some place where there are no phones or
credit cards).

(Re: "Anyone can get your U. of Illinois transcript" in <A HREF="/Risks/14.31.html">RISKS-14.31</A>)

MIT recently put on-line a new service, SIS, through which students can access
data in the registrar's database, including both personal and confidential
data about their own status and general data such as course schedules.

SIS is worth mentioning here, in response to Carl Kadie's message about
problems with a similar system at the University of Illinois, because (in my
opinion) SIS is a good example of system designers taking security issues
seriously enough and doing a good job of meeting security needs.

In order to use SIS to access personal data, a user must first register an
"extra" password with the Kerberos database.  The program that registers this
password does so by transmitting it to the Kerberos server in encrypted form
(using a key derived from the user's main Kerberos principal, for which he
already has a password) so that it isn't exposed to the network.

The assumption that led to the extra-password requirement is that people
already have the mindset that it's OK to share their accounts (i.e., their
main Kerberos principal password) with other people, so that name/password
pair is not sufficient authentication.  The documentation about SIS, and the
prompting that takes place when the user chooses an extra password, makes it
very clear that this password should be treated more securely by the user, and
that if the user sees fit to give it to others, that user is giving those
others access to his personal data in the registrar's database.

Once the user has registered for an extra password, he still can't access
personal data in the registrar's database immediately.  A notification is
mailed, by U.S. Mail, to the address for the user in the registrar's database.
About a week after that notification is received by the user, the password
actually becomes active and the user can access personal data on-line.

Obviously, this second safeguard is to protect against the possibility of a
user registering another user's extra password.  The notification mailed to
the user explains in detail what it's about, and tells the user whom to
contact if he *did not* register an extra password.

I suspect that an extra password does not become valid if the paper mail
notification is returned by the post office (i.e., is not successfully
delivered to the user).  Granted, the time given for the notification to be
returned by the post office probably isn't sufficient for all failed delivers,
but I think that the probability of a notification not being delivered
properly to someone whose extra password was illicitly registered by someone
else is sufficiently low that this is not a concern.

Once a user's extra password becomes valid he must type this password each
time he wants to use the SIS service to access personal data (and he must
already have valid Kerberos tickets for his main principal).  The Kerberos
tickets thus acquired are used to establish a Kerberos-authenticated network
connection to the machine on which the registrar's database resides.
Furthermore, the session key created while establishing that connection is
used to encrypt all personal data sent over the network.

There is one more safeguard to prevent security breaches of the database.  The
SIS protocol does not allow for direct modification of the database on the SIS
server.  Most data in the system can't be modified through it at all; instead,
users must talk to the registrar directly to effect changes.  The data that
*can* be modified is mostly MIT directory information, e.g., term address and
phone numbers, and when a user requests modifications to that data, the
modifications are stored and manually eyeballed for sanity by the registrar
before actually being fed into the system.

Finally, just in case there is some possibility that someone might manage to
break into the database machine (although it's pretty fortress-like in its
configuration :-), that machine is not actually the "home location" of the
registrar's database.  It's a copy that is updated by SneakerNet (a tape
carried from the registrar's office) regularly.  The registrar's computer is
on a subnet that is isolated from most of the campus network (and that is
certainly more paranoid about who gets to connect to it than the rest of the
campus network).

As you can see, I think that the people who designed and implemented
SIS did a good job of meeting security concerns.  Their only mistake
was using Motif for the UI :-).

Fred Cohen &lt;fc@turing.duq.edu&gt; writes in RISKS v14n33:

!        3 - The best encryption in the world won't make you very safe if you
!dial into CompuServe (NOTE I AM NOT CITING COMPUSERVE AS AN ACTUAL PERPETRATOR
!BUT RATHER AS A CONVENIENT NAME-RECOGNITION IDENTIFIER FOR THE LARGER CLASS OF
!SUCH SERVICES) from your PC to send the information. ...

You're perpetuating a security scare that has no basis in fact.

Prodigy, the latter service you mention, requires the use of its own front-end
program on your PC.  You cannot use Prodigy without it.  Since this front-end
program executes on your PC, it does have the potential for the abuse you
mention.  I personally do not use Prodigy in part because of this security
loophole.

On the other hand, other communication services, such as Compuserve, do not
have this questionable "feature" at all.

You dial Compuserve from your PC with a communications program of your choice.
At all times the contents of your memory and hard drive are under the complete
control of your CPU and communications program.

You are probably thinking of the "Quick B" transfer protocol which appears to
allow Compuserve to "take over" your PC to run both ends of a file
upload/download.  (A similar sequence occurs with the popular ZMODEM
protocol.)  This is not really so; Compuserve actually sends only an ENQ (05)
character to the PC, which is interpreted by your comm program as a request to
begin a file transfer.  Again, the PC's memory and hard drive are still under
the control of your own comm program, not Compuserve.  Most comm programs,
such as Telix and Crosstalk, can be configured to ignore ENQ and require the
PC user to execute the transfer command manually.

Bottom line: No online service can cause your PC to execute code that is not
in the PC's memory space, Prodigy notwithstanding.

		CALL FOR PAPERS AND PARTICIPATION

		Ninth Annual Computer Security
		   Applications Conference


	            December 6 - 10, 1993 
	       Orlando Marriott Internation Drive
	              Orlando, Florida

The Conference
   The Information Age is upon us, along with its attendant needs for
protecting private, proprietary, sensitive, classified, and critical
information.  The computer has created a universal addiction to
information in the military, government, and private sectors.  The
result is a proliferation of computers, computer networks, databases,
and applications empowered to make decisions ranging from the mundane
to life threatening or life preserving.
    Some of the computer security challenges that the community is faced
with include:
	* To design architectures capable of protecting the 
	  sensitivity and integrity of information, and of assuring 
	  that expected services are available when needed.

	* To design safety-critical systems such that their software and
	  hardware are not hazardous.

	* To develop methods of assuring that computer systems 
	  accorded trust are worthy of that trust.

	* To build systems of systems out of components that have 
	  been deemed trustworthy.

	* To build applications on evaluated trusted systems without
	  compromising the inherent trust.

	* To apply to the civil and private sectors trusted systems
	  technologies designed for military applications.

	* To extend computer security technology to specifically 
	  address the needs of the civil and private sectors.

	* To develop international standards for computer security 
  	  technology.

     This conference will attempt to address these challenges. It will
explore a broad range of technology applications with security and safety
concerns through the use of technical papers, discussion panels, and
tutorials.

     Technical papers, panels and tutorials that address the application of
computer security and safety technologies in the civil, defense, and
commercial environments are solicited.  Selected papers will be those
that present examples of in-place or attempted solutions to these
problems in real applications; lessons learned; original research,
analyses and approaches for defining the computer security issues and
problems.  Papers that present descriptions of secure systems in use
or under development, or papers presenting general strategy, or 
methodologies for analyzing the scope and nature of integrated
computer security issues; and potential solutions are of particular
interest.  Papers written by students that are selected for presentation 
will also be judged for a Best Student Paper Award.  A prize of $500, 
plus expenses to attend the conference, will be awarded for the selected 
best student paper (contact the Student Paper Award Chairperson for details, 
but submit your paper to the Technical Program Chairperson).

     Panels of interest include those that present alternative/controversial 
viewpoints and/or those that encourage "lively" discussion of relevant 
issues. Panels that are simply a collection of unrefereed papers will not 
be selected. 

INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS:

     Send five copies of your paper or panel proposal to Ann Marmor-Squires,
Technical Program Chairman, at the address given below. Since we provide blind
refereeing, we ask that you put names and affiliations of authors on a
separate cover page only.  Substantially identical papers that have been
previously published or are under consideration for publication elsewhere
should not be submitted.  Panel proposals should be a minimum of one page that
describes the panel theme and appropriateness of the panel for this
conference, as well as identifies panel participant and their respective
viewpoints.  Send one copy of your tutorial proposal to Daniel Faigin at the
address given below.  It should consist of one- to two-paragraph abstract of
the tutorial, an initial outline of the material to be presented, and an
indication of the desired tutorial length (full day or half day).  Electronic
submission of tutorial proposals is preferred.

Completed papers as well as proposals for panels and tutorials must
be received by May 18, 1993.  Authors will be required to certify prior 
to June 19, 1993, that any and all necessary clearances for public release 
have been obtained; that the author or qualified representative will be 
represented at the conference to deliver the paper, and that the paper has 
not been accepted elsewhere.  Authors will be notified of acceptance by 
July 31, 1993.  Camera ready copies are due not later than September 18, 1993.

My mother recently received several telephone calls from an organization
called Education Loan Services Inc (ELSI), of Braintree, Massachusetts.
Neither she nor any other family member had ever heard of ELSI -- an
organization that reputedly acts as a student loan clearing house, and as I
have inferred from my conversations with them, as a collections agency.

The callers asked for her (Marie) or for my wife (Kelly) concerning a student
loan.  (Both my wife and I have had student loans.  Mom predates the modern
concept of a student loan :-) Mom, being computer-literate and quite familiar
with the more typical computer snarls, naturally assumed it was a computer
error and that it concerned either Kelly or me -- she naturally assumed the
ELSI database had not been updated to indicate that both of our student loans
had been paid.

After an extended conversation with a representative of ELSI, I found they
were "cold calling" anyone with a name that matched those on their loan
paperwork, and further, that the match with Kelly's name was (apparently) a
fluke.  Further, the only way they claimed they could confirm that they had a
mistake was for me to provide them with Mom's social security number.

ELSI refused to accept any other information from me -- length of time at
address, differences in surnames, attendance at other schools, etc --
concerning the parties (not) involved, nor could they provide any information
on the cosigners of the student loan they claimed they were calling on.

When my mother called ELSI back, a (different) ELSI representative indicated
that it appeared to be a simple mix-up on the area code, and that her portion
of ELSI did not have direct access to the ELSI folks placing the outbound
calls.  (Which we found rather surprising.)  Interestingly, a different ELSI
representative had told me that ELSI was calling people based on directory
services information -- and not based on a mixed-up telephone number on the
loan paperwork.

This situation strikes me as having multiple risks.  I could have provided
ELSI with a bogus social security number for Mom.  (I declined to provide any
number.)  If ELSI could validate the social security number -- and I am quite
certain they could, via any one of several credit bureaus -- they would have
already known that mom wasn't a match.  (And then why did they call?)  Such an
organization could also easily be illicit -- "scavenging" either for social
security numbers or worse, scavenging payments from the parents of former
students -- parents who might unknowingly send an ELSI-like organization a
payment or two to keep their child from `defaulting'.

One of the major causes of the long time to get the data from the failed
computer is that phone switches have a lot more 'state' that they did in the
past.  For example, the State of Ohio Centrex (where I work in the telecom
office) is served by the switch which failed.  We have somewhere over 20,000
lines (I don't keep up with the details.)  In the past we had to configure
options like Call Forward No Answer and Call Forward Busy with written service
orders.  But now each line has an option called Call Forward No Answer
Universal (At least the name is close!) which allows someone at the phone to
specify the number to Call Forward Busy to.  This can be changed at any time.
Therefore in the case of a switch failure you can not just return to the
"standard" configuration, but must load a lot of 'state' information from the
failed computer.

This type of state is becoming more common in "fancier" features.  It makes it
much easier to manage a large number of phones!  Features like call
forwarding, which also require the switch to remember a number, are becoming
more and more common.

The State of Ohio phones were dead from about 14 minutes or so.   This likely
affected the Franklin County Ohio Highway Patrol Post's (and General
Head Quarters) public numbers also.

                 
Also, in yesterday's Columbus Dispatch it looks like Ohio Bell lost another
one:

"Blown Fuse disrupts phone service"

A blown fuse in the Ohio Bell switch serving 54,768 telephone lines in
Worthington disrupted service throughout the day yesterday.  Repairs were
expected to be completed last night.  Ohio Bell Spokesman Keith Jameson said
911 and other emergency numbers remained in operation, although getting a dial
tome within the affected area was slow.  Calling into the area was difficult
most of the day, since Ohio Bell purposely blocked 75 percent of incoming
calls while repairs were under way.  Jameson said that strategy enabled people
within the area to make calls.  By 5 PM, the company had reduced blocked
incoming calls to 50 percent.  The switch shut down at about 10:30 AM, when at
least one fuse blew, but Jameson said there may be other problems with the
switch.  The problem was not weather related, he said.

&gt;In order to use SIS to access personal data, a user must first register an
&gt;"extra" password with the Kerberos database.  The program that registers this
&gt;password does so by transmitting it to the Kerberos server in encrypted form
&gt;(using a key derived from the user's main Kerberos principal, for which he
&gt;already has a password) so that it isn't exposed to the network.

But has the Kerberos protocol been beefed up yet to guard against
password-guessing attacks?

As Michael Merritt and I noted in our critique of Kerberos (Winter Usenix,
1991, Dallas), Kerberos is vulnerable to password-guessing.  An intruder, from
anywhere on the Internet and without any authentication, can request
ticket-granting tickets for any user.  These are encrypted with a key derived
from the user's password.  But guessing at passwords is an old game -- and one
that succeeds, with ~25% probability, against typical UNIX system passwords.
Kerberos is somewhat more secure, since it permits passwords to be longer than
8 characters, but I'm unaware of any study that's been done to find out if
people actually take advantage of this.

Granted, such attacks may not succeed against any particular student.
But against a collection of students, the odds are pretty good that
some will be vulnerable.

I've seen proposals to strengthen Kerberos against such attacks, but I don't
know if these have been deployed yet.  And there are protocols that prevent
any password-guessing attacks, even by eavesdroppers (i.e., Lomas et. al, 1989
SOSP; Bellovin and Merritt, 1992 Oakland Symposium).

My point here is not to criticize the designers of SIS.  All things
considered, they seem to have done a very good job; the only other safeguard I
can think of would be to notify the student of any new uses of the SIS
account.  Rather, I'm trying to point out that secure systems can't be built
on weak foundations.  Intruders don't go through security; they go around it.

   But has the Kerberos protocol been beefed up yet to guard against
   password-guessing attacks?

Yes.

The most recent release of MIT Kerberos Version 4 includes kadmin
protocol enhancements to allow for the rejection of weak passwords,
and code on the server to check and reject weak passwords.

I don't know if any V4 vendors have incorporated changes like this
into their products; I suspect it will happen eventually if there is
enough demand for it.

Furthermore, MIT Kerberos Version 5 supports optional preauthentication.  MD5
on the user's password, Smart Card technology, or some other technique (the
code is pretty abstract, so new preauthentication types can be added
relatively easily) is used to create a "magic cookie" which is passed to the
server along with the TGT request.  If the cookie is wrong, the server won't
give the user a TGT to decrypt.  Preauthentication can be required or optional
on a principal-by-principal basis.

MIT V5 doesn't yet have weak-password rejection in it, but the hooks for it
are there, and it will be added before the first official (i.e., not beta
test) V5 release.

I don't think DCE Kerberos has preauthentication in it right now, and I don't
think they plan to add it before the first official DCE release (If you want
them to, and you're a member of the OSF, then let them know!).  I don't know
whether or not DCE Kerberos has weak-password rejection in it.

It is true that both V4 and V5 are still vulnerable to network eavesdropping
weak-password attacks, since an eavesdropper can watch for a TGT on the
network and try to decrypt it once it arrives, even if he doesn't know the
preauthentication magic cookie which convinced the server to send the TGT.
However, weak-password rejection makes the risk of an attack of this sort
minimal, and it is not vulnerable on an entire-Internet scale like the attack
which Steve mentioned.

(Thanks to Ted T'so, tytso@mit.edu, for confirmation of much of the
information above about V5.)

I must disagree [with the statement] that I am creating an unrealistic
security scare.  In fact, even if you are running Kermit from a PC, there are
ways for remote sites to inject commands/code into your machine.  The same is
true for many PC-based telnet, FTP, and Xmodem protocols.  Here is a real
example:

An FTP program was commonly used at one university to transfer information
between user PCs and a file server.  One day, someone noticed files appearing
on their computer that shouldn't have been there.  On subsequent investigation
it was found that the FTP protocol allowed remote users to send files into
the PC whenever the PC was setup to do outgoing transfers.  It turns out that
this is one of the most popular - public domain - FTP packages around.  At
this one site, a password was added to the process to prevent exchange when
the other party did not know the password - but - they did a poor job of it,
and someone discovered a trivial way to get past it within a few days.

Another?:

The well known attack where you transmit characters to a remote terminal that
tell the terminal to store a sequence of characters and play it back can be
exploited to attack remote computers running terminal emulators that are
accurate.  If you run Kermit, you may find that the VT emulations are good
enough to do the job.  That's right - even if you are simply logged in typing
commands, you can be had if the attacker is good enough at it and your package
is a true emulation.  In fact, when you login, you usually even tell the
remote site what kind of terminal you are emulating, thus easing it's attack
burden.

Another?

X-windows without the magic cookie allows remote users to watch what is being
displayed on your screen over the network.  Most X setups are insecure in this
way - at least most of the ones I have seen.

Another? 

Well - I'll hold off for now awaiting your response.  My point still seems
to hold - encrypting links is not adequate to prevent access to your data -
encryption without good computer security is generally not adequate - the
government or anyone else willing and able to go to the trouble can get you
by exploiting the places you login to - it is not patently safe to login to
on-line information services, even if you don't run their software. - FC

"Mark W. Schumann" &lt;mark@whizbang.wariat.org&gt; writes in RISKS 14.35

&gt;Prodigy, the latter service you mention, requires the use of its own front-end
&gt;program on your PC.  You cannot use Prodigy without it.  Since this front-end
&gt;program executes on your PC, it does have the potential for the abuse you
&gt;mention.  I personally do not use Prodigy in part because of this security
&gt;loophole.

Oh boy, let's kick Prodigy around some more.  Long ago when I was a
Prodigy subscriber and the rumors of Prodigy's uploading of stuff it
shouldn't started I did some experiments the results of which were
posted here.  I proved (as best I could) that the rumors were probably
unfounded and based on Prodigy's method of allocating disk space without
clearing it of previous data first.  Some other people who contacted me
had done similar experiments with similar results.

&gt;On the other hand, other communication services, such as Compuserve, do not
&gt;have this questionable "feature" at all.

America On-Line, TSN, and probably others also have special
communication programs that you must use.  Other services which do not
REQUIRE a specific comm program nonetheless OFFER one that usually
improves use of the service.  Genie (for sure, Aladdin) and Compuserve
(vague memory from years ago) both do.

&gt;You dial Compuserve from your PC with a communications program of your choice.
&gt;At all times the contents of your memory and hard drive are under the complete
&gt;control of your CPU and communications program.

Yeah, but how do you know that the authors of PC-TALK, Qmodem, or
whatever don't have a special hook in them that when you call up
Compuserve it doesn't (semi-seriousness on) upload all your pitiful
Tetris scores so the FBI can blackmail you?  Or heck, maybe Microsoft
has modified Windows or DOS to append juicy data to the end of files
opened for uploading somehow.  Maybe the FBI knows that the authors of
Qmodem use Turbo C++ (or whatever) and have had Borland modify the
compiler to insert this surreptitious uploading code into the comm
program automatically when it is compiled.  Maybe AMI has modified this
BIOS to do something like this.  Who can you trust?

(paragraph about QUICKB deleted)

&gt;Bottom line: No online service can cause your PC to execute code that is not
&gt;in the PC's memory space, Prodigy notwithstanding.

Not true as I have already shown.

In any case, any service that tried something like this would be
committing corporate suicide.  People would notice that their modems
were uploading all this data if by no other means than the Send Data
light on their modem and the hard disk access light and doubtlessly one
of them would figure out what was happening.

Even at high speeds with top notch data compression it still takes a
long time to transfer any significant amount of data.  Maybe "they"
could somehow work it into the background so whenever your modem sent
data you wanted it to a little bit extra would get mixed in but that
seems pretty pointless.

I understand that most AL research is done by writing AL programs which run on
a virtual computer. The practice is analogous to hacking E Coli which can only
live on a particular medium which is not availiable outside the lab's petri
dish.

I have no problem with people publishing code, even code which could be put
to 'sinister' ends (such as PGP). The author is not responsible for the actions
of the reader or end-user.

If you want to provide some sort of security, perhaps you can make a 
proprietary virtual machine which you distribute with the code in your book.

The code would then only run on the virtual machine. This could provide some
way of at least tracking the spread of malevolent AL programs.

Obviously this is not a perfect solution, but hey, what that guy from NASA
says, this isn't a risk free world.

NEW SOFTWARE FAILS TO FIX JAIL'S COMPUTER SYSTEM, 
by Judy Kuhlman, Daily Oklahoman, 26 Feb 1993

  An attempt by Oklahoma County officials to fix their troubled jail's
malfunctioning computer system failed Thursday.  Prisoners remained locked
inside their cells for the fourth consecutive day in the $54 million, 12-story
jail that opened in November 1991, Oklahoma County Sherrif J.D. Sharp said.
"Everything is just like it was. The computers are still down. We have an open
facility.  Some doors are locked open and others are locked closed, both
inside and outside the facility," Sharp said.  Twenty-two jailers were trapped
from 10 am to 6:30 pm Monday inside a jail control room when the controlling
computer shut down following a five-minute power outage. Guards since then
have been manually opening and closing the prisoners' cell doors, Sharp said.
  Computer software purchased by jail officials at a cost of $4,836 and
installed Thursday did not fix the jail's problems, Capt. James Rouse said.
  Oklahoma County commissioners had an emergency meeting Wednesday to approve
the purchase of that computer diagnostic equipment and to consider additional
equipment needed to deal with the county's latest jail crisis.  Officials were
not certain what caused the computers to shut down, Oklahoma County engineer
Ted McCourry said.  "We're taking it one step at a time. But every time we
round one corner, we run into another problem. Slowly but surely we're getting
it back. But we will still need outside help," Rouse said.  The technician who
built the computer system is supposed to fly into OKlahoma City from Denver
today to assess the problem and recommend a solution, Sharp said.  "I'm
extremely frustrated. I have never seen anything like it. It is a real touchy
situation here," Sharp said.  Sharp said there was no danger of prisoners
escaping.  "We have called in extra people and are taking extra precautions
which I cannot talk about at this time," Sharp said.
  Commissioners have also authorized the purchasing agent to immediately go
out for bids for a power-surge protector, expected to cost about $80,000, to
prevent electrical surges and a battery back-up system for the computers that
could cost an estimated $500,000.  McCourry said the power-surge protector and
back-up system was never included in the original jail plans and
specifications.  Commissioner Shirley Darrel asked the purchasing agent to
find out who took the surge protector out of the specifications and why it was
taken out in the first place.
  Sharp has said the problems might have been averted if the county jail
had been provided with a back-up system or a power-surge protector.
  McCourry said the jail has a back-up generator to supply power in the
advent of a power outage. The computer back-up system would act as a third
source of power for computers.
  County Clerk John Garvey has also suggested the sheriff hire a full-time
computer expert.

  [This is, I believe, the same "escape-proof" jail that had 2 escapees within
  a month of its becoming operational.  Having computer-controlled doors with
  not even a surge protector, not to mention no one in the state running the
  system, is unfortunately quite typical.  Jennifer Smith jds@math.okstate.edu]

     jail-doors in El Dorado, California, in 1988.  PGN]

Following is an abridgement [by JB and PGN] of an article that appeared in the
Home News section (page 4) of the Guardian newspaper in the UK on 25 Feb 1993:

  A schoolboy computer hacker caused chaos when he dialed into a vital
  database at a Brussels-based centre for cancer research and treatment.
  Paul Bedworth allegedly ran a rogue program that generated 50,000 phone 
  calls, and caused the computer system at the European Organisation for 
  the Research and Treatment of Cancer to "crash".  In the process, Mr.
  Dedworth, now 19 and a student of artificial intelligence at Edinburgh
  university, left the centre with a 10,000 pound [c. US$14,000] phone bill.
  His trial is in progress.

Jonathan Bowen, Oxford University Computing Laboratory

     [A Reuters story noted by "Mich Kabay / JINBU Corp."
     &lt;75300.3232@compuserve.com&gt; says Bedworth also broke into the
     British Telecom telephone network, a Lloyds Bank computer, and the 
     Financial Times of London.   PGN]

The New York Times, in its morning-after coverage of yesterday's huge
explosion in the World Trade Center garage in downtown Manhattan, reported
that the blast destroyed the complex's operations center and severed cooling
lines for the emergency generators.  The result was that there was no
organized leadership in evacuating 50,000 people down the stairwells of the
110-story twin towers, and the ventilation system was unable to suck out
smoke.  As of tonight, the toll stands at 5 killed, 2 missing, and over 1,000
injured.

The former director of the agency that runs the center said that studies in
the mid-80's showed it could withstand a car bomb.  "'They said you could
sustain a car bomb', he said.  'What they didn't tell us was you couldn't
sustain it if it was perfectly placed.'"

According to a Washington Post article last week, the Resolution Trust
Corporation [the federal agency charged with cleaning up failed savings &amp;
loans] generated incorrect data on Form 1099s [that's the form that tells the
Internal Revenue Service how much interest you earned for the year, so you pay
tax on it].

According to the article, there have been some serious glitches, including a
woman whose 1099 reported $152,000 in interest, rather than the $3,000 she
actually earned.  Other statements were off by a factor of 100 or more.
According to the article, the IRS was not sent the erroneous figure, although
about 2000 customers of the failed Trustbank received incorrect notices.

The error occurred because "of a computer tape mishap" according to
an RTC spokesman.  No further details on the mishap were provided.

As more and more data is submitted to the IRS electronically, and the IRS does
more and more electronic cross-checking, it's easy to see how people could
have received automatic dunning notices for underreporting their income, had
the erroneous data been sent to the IRS.  I wonder whether the IRS's analysis
software (or auditors) would have noticed that for many people, the amount of
interest reported was highly unlikely given their historical tax data and
income.

Forwarded to protect another's privacy.

&gt;Some weeks ago, conversation on AFU turned to the existence of
&gt;'permanent records' for grade school and high school students.
&gt;It turns out that the state of OHIO has been keeping computerized
&gt;records of Ohio primary and secondary students.  The local paper
&gt;has exposed this mess in the past week.  I quote from the
&gt;_Columbus Dispatch_:

&gt;	Virtually all school districts are sending 93 categories of
&gt;	information about each of Ohio's 1.8 million primary and
&gt;	secondary school students to 25 regional data centers.

&gt;	The information is linked to a student identification
&gt;	number, which the state says should be the student's social
&gt;	security number.  The computer data include test scores,
&gt;	disciplinary action, medical details including pregnancy,
&gt;	race, handicaps and family income.   [...]
&gt;	Princeton [a Cincinnati HS] supplies the state with
&gt;	statistics that do not identify students, but has never
&gt;	given information linked to names or identification numbers.
&gt;       As a result, the state has threatened to cut off the
&gt;	district's funding, beginning with it's April payment of
&gt;	about $288,000.

&gt;	Princeton and other school are suing the state based on the
&gt;	Federal Privacy Act.   [...]
&gt;	Many districts don't even tell parents or students they are
&gt;	sending information about students to the state.

&gt;[many sordid details deleted for brevity]

&gt;Ohio has also kept a database of accusations of child abuse
&gt;with 200,000 names on it.  Ohio's population is about
&gt;11,000,000.   It was, until recently, impossible to find out
&gt;if you were on the list, and who accused you, and impossible
&gt;to get your name removed.  If you worry at all about due
&gt;process, facing your accuser, etc., don't bother to move here.

&gt;I considered posting this information to COMP.RISKS or
&gt;COMP.SECURITY.PRIVACY, but I didn't care to be "Jolted" by the FBI or CIA.

In the Feb '93 "Hello" notice distributed with our monthly phone bill is an
informative little piece about CIRCUIT 9(sm)  This service "allows business
subscribers to identify a caller's ``billing'' telephone number, even if the
number is not published in the telephone directory."

CIRCUIT 9 services are assigned to 910 exchanges in the 212 and 718 area codes,
920 elsewhere in NY State, and 880 in area code 900.
Note that the CIRCUIT 9 exchange 880 is actually a fee-per-call 900, which have
long had the ability to receive calling number information.

Here's the juicy section:
  
  There are important limitations on the ways in which businesses that
  obtain your phone number through CIRCUIT 9 Service may use this information.
  For example, they may use your number to route or screen calls, or to obtain
  billing information about your account with them.

  However, subject to certain exceptions [?!], businesses that obtain your
  phone number through CIRCUIT 9 Service may not use your number to establish
  telemarketing lists or to conduct outgoing telemarketing calls without your
  consent. [!?]

  If you believe a business has misused the information they obtained through
  CIRCUIT 9 Service, you may call a special toll-free number.  Call
  1-800-729-8924 Monday through Friday 9am to 5pm.

The notice goes on to tell you that you can have these calls blocked by
calling you service representative, but doing so will also block exchanges
394, 540, 550, 970, and 976 and the area codes 700 and 900.  I guess privacy
is an all or nothing...

Further, the notice ends stating "Because CIRCUIT 9 service uses a different
technology [?] from Call ID, the restrict options [mandated by the PSC] 
(per-call and all-call restrict) used to prevent number delivery through
Call ID cannot be used to prevent number delivery through CIRCUIT 9 service."

I am beyond confused at this point.  What do they mean "certain exceptions?"
What constitutes my "consent?"  It almost seems NY Tel is admitting they have
had an utter disregard for our privacy in the past and are just writing us to
say they will continue in the same vein in the future.

I wonder what horrible punishments will rain down upon and business that I
report to their 800 number...

On Friday 26 February the UK national newspaper The Independent covered the
just-released report on the London Ambulance Service debacle very fully - it
was the main story on the front page (entitled "Report Prompts Departure of
Ambulance Boss"), with three more stories taking up a significant fraction of
page 3. These are entitled "Manager's `created an atmosphere of mistrust'",
"[Secretary of State for Health] Bottomley condemns `catalogue of errors'",
and "Father grieved for asthmatic son who died in his arms".  The first of
these three has the most detail, and is quoted below in its entirety.

The London Ambulance Service Crisis

MANAGERS "CREATED AN ATMOSPHERE" OF MISTRUST, 
By Susan Watts, Technology Correspondent, The Independent, 26 February 1993

It would be hard to paint a more damning picture of failed management than
that which emerged from the inquiry into the London Ambulance Service
yesterday.  The report said that the LAS management "created an atmosphere of
mistrust" with its over-aggressive style, born in part out of the desperation
to put right decades of poor performance.

The LAS made "virtually every mistake in the book" when implementing its
"ambitious" (pounds)1.5m computer system, one of the three-strong inquiry
team said. The computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system was seen as the only
hope the service had to put right its poor response times in dealing with
emergency calls. But the software was "not complete, not properly tuned,
and not fully tested", the report said.

The inquiry team was set up after the CAD system broke down on 26 and 27
October last year, then collapsed a second time on 4 November, forcing
controllers to revert to pen and paper to dispatch ambulances.

Managers took a high risk, "misguided" decision to have the CAD system up and
running in one phase. The system was developed and installed in "an impossible
timetable", the report said. The final system had known technical problems,
and the people who would have to use it were not properly trained to do so.
The team concluded that LAS management ignored advice to this effect "from
many outside sources".  

One of the team members, Paul Williams, said management had concentrated on
getting the best price for its computer system rather than one which would be
best for the job.  He said he would have expected a system of this kind to
have cost at least twice as much as the LAS computer. The report said there
was "no evidence of key questions being asked about why the [final] bid was
substantially lower than other bidders". The report questioned the apparent
lack of accountability within the service itself, and upwards to managers at
regional level. This was exacerbated by the LAS operating at arm's length from
its health authority, which meant it was not subject to checks from regional
managers.

The team said that although the computer system did what it was supposed to
do, the design had "fatal flaws" that together would lead to all the
symptoms of a systems failure. It found that System Options, the software
company which supplied the system, had never before dealt with a system
this large and complex. "We believe that they [the software supplier]
rapidly found themselves in a situation where they were out of their depth.

The team believes that some parts of the failed software system can be
salvaged, although chunks of the applications software may need to be
substantially rewritten.

The report refutes earlier statements from the LAS that the two disastrous
days in October had been exceptionally busy. The number of calls was in
fact only a little above average. It was only when ambulances failed to
arrive, and duplicate calls came in, when things got out of hand.

LAS board members appeared to have been given a "misleading impression"
about progress with the computer system and regional members seemed to have
been given even less of an idea what was going on within LAS.

Last year's crisis prompted the resignation of John Wilby, the chief
executive of the service. Yesterday, South West Regional Health Authority
revealed that it had already decided to remove Mr Wilby from his post,
having first raised fears over his performance at a meeting with him six
months before the computer breakdown.

Jim Harris, LAS chairman, denied that this might have put pressure on Mr
Wilby to produce results. But the report concluded that "an important
factor was almost certainly the culture within LAS of `fear of failure'."

Professor Marion Hicks, the health authority's chairman, said Mr Wilby was
given a limited time to improve, but by mid-October "the decision had been
taken to terminate his contract". This would have gone ahead in November if
the LAS board had not been taken over [sic] by events, and Mr Wilby's
voluntary resignation.

Non-executive LAS board members who remain are Roddy Braithwaite, Victor
Paige, Mary Spinks, Janet Preston and Stephen Miles. The executive
committee comprises Martin Gorham (chief executive), Alan Kennedy (acting
director of operations), Simon Young (director of finance) and Bernadette
el-Hadidy (director of human resources).
[Ends]

  The front page story leads with a report that the chairman of the LAS, Jim
Harris has resigned, and repeats the union claim that up to 20 deaths resulted
from ambulance delays, but states that this allegation is hotly denied by
management, adding that: "Yesterday's document shies away from linking deaths
directly with ambulance delays caused by the computer crash.  It said an
examination of 26 cases at coroners courts since November 1991 showed that the
LAS had not been blamed for a single death. Two cases are outstanding."

&gt;From The Oregonian, Sunday, 28 Feb 93:

Bank machine glitch leaves users poorer, but empty-handed

For thousands of people last week, automatic tellers charge their
accounts without dispensing money

&gt;From staff and wire reports

Customers who used an automatic teller machine in U.S. Bank's Exchange
system Thursday morning may want to take a close look at their next
monthly statement to make sure everything adds up.

Thousands of Oregon ATM users who tried to withdraw money between 4
a.m. and 10:30 a.m. Thursday came up empty-handed, even though the
machine's faulty computer software subtracted the money from their
accounts anyway. A U.S. Bank spokeswoman assured that all accounts
would be corrected by Tuesday.

Mary Ruble, corporate spokeswoman for the Portland-based company, said
the bank has what is called a redundant computer system that keeps
track of all transactions and has passed the information to all banks
who have customers who have been affected.

Ruble said Saturday that 18,000 transactions in Oregon, Washington,
Idaho, Nevada and California were affected Thursday.

"We are aware of the problem but we haven't been able to clear them all
up yet," Ruble said."We've shifted people from other responsibilities
to speed up the correction process."

John Kresge, vice president and manager of the U_S_ Bank's ATM network,
said the problem started when the bank was modifying the software in
its main computer in Portland. The computer links U.S. Bank with The
Exchange, a huge electronic clearinghouse that coordinates ATM deposits
and withdrawals for customers of banks throughout the Northwest.

The glitch affected only non-U.S. Bank customers who tried to make
transactions from U.S. Bank's ATM machines, Kresge said. It is not
known which banks were affected the most.

To safeguard from any account discrepencies [sic], Ruble recommends
that ATM users keep their receipts and compare them with their monthly
statements.  Problems should be reported to the customers' individual banks.

Kresge said all accounts will be properly credited, whether or not
customers noticed the problem.

"I hope there isn't too much anxiety out there," Kresge said. "I am certain
each one of those transactions will be reversed. We have an army of people
looking at it. They are manually going through all the transactions and making
corrections and reversing any charges that may have occurred."

I read the article on "Information America" with great interest, as it 
would explain a great deal of things that have bothered me, wondering 
how certain individuals got particular information.

In the first instance, we received a phone call from a law enforcement agency
looking for a "Mark Frates."  This individual has become known to us, as 
arrest warrants, letters from lawyers, etc. have arrived on a regular basis,
to be returned "Not here."  Since his last name matches the previous owners'
name, we assume he (and his several aliases) is their son.  But HOW, I 
wondered, did they get OUR phone number?  We moved into a house formerly 
owned by his parents, but our phone number was not connected to the Frates.
Apparently, someone has used this, or a similar, service, trying to track 
this guy down.

But the most worrying piece of mail came from the lowly Publisher's 
Clearing House.  It was the standard hype, with "you may be the winner..."
and all, but it had a worrying piece of personalization.  "Although you 
have not ordered anything from us since 1982..."  In the time in between, 
my husband had moved five times, and had not even renewed the original 
subscription.  Somehow, Publisher's Clearinghouse had tracked him across 
the country, and from Washington State to California, through the course 
of several moves, and had paired him with a magazine subscription from ten 
years before.  Impressive tracking capability for a junk mailer!  Especially 
one who, by implication, must have files on most of the residents of the
U.S.  Imagine what someone with more interest in you could do...

 SIXTH INTERNATIONAL COMPUTER SECURITY &amp; VIRUS CONFERENCE and Exposition
          sponsored by DPMA Fin.Ind.Chapter in cooperation with
ACM-SIGSAC, BCS, CMA, COS, EDPAAph, ISSAny, NUInyla, IEEE Computer Society
       Box 894 Wall Street Station, NY NY 10268 (800) 835-2246 x190
                                                
    
     FINANCIAL FIRMS OPEN MEETING THURSDAY ON TRADE CENTER RECOVERY

To address the technical side of network and computer terrorism recovery while
information systems personnel are interested, a special public forum of
industry leaders has been scheduled for next Thursday March 11, entitled,
"Trade Center Crisis Recovery."  The in-depth panel will include eight
industry representatives - from four affected financial firms that
successfully resumed business after Friday's disaster, and four suppliers that
helped them.

The panel will be housed in next week's Sixth International Computer Security
&amp; Virus Conference at the Madison Square Garden Ramada, co-sponsored by the 
eight computing and networking societies.

With damage estimates already in the multi-billions, Sally Meglathery, Elec-
tronic Security Head for the New York Stock Exchange and a scheduled panelist,
warns financial data keepers:  "Review [your] restart recovery procedures to
be sure that you have adequate backup to recover from an attack."

Other than state and federal offices, the main corporations inhabiting the
famed skyscraper are indeed banks (First Boston, Sumitomo, Dai-ichi), brokers
(Dean Witter, Shearson, Salomon, Mocatta and the Commodities Exchange) and
insurance companies (Hartford and Guy Carpenter).  Each type will send a
representative, as will some service firms.

William Houston, Eastern Region Head for Comdisco Data Recovery, notes that
"This is the second time in three years an electrical disaster has completely
shut down" the famed twin skyscraper.  His firm helped rescue the computer, 
networking and "back office" operations of two dozen downtown firms in response
to the August 13, 1990, electrical substation fire.

"We have some major customers in the Towers," notes Houston, "and while pre-
serving their anonymity I intend to plainly tell the Thursday audience just
what worked this time and what didn't."

Michael Gomoll, an executive with competitor CHI/COR Information Management,
says the terrorist act will have three key results:  "Direct loss of
revenues, effects on global markets and businesses, and concerns of the
business insurance profession."  Ironically, CHI/COR, a firm specializing 
in disaster recovery, was itself assaulted by the crippling Chicago flood 
of April 13, 1992.  As part of his presentation, Gomoll intends to explain
how cable conduits played an important role in both disasters.

Last fall, the conference now hosting this "Trade Center Crisis Recovery"
roundtable, received what now seem prophetic words in its greeting from Mayor
David Dinkins:  "As the telecommunications capital of the world . . . we are
also extraordinarily susceptible to the various abuses of this technology."

Another irony has to do with the "Meet the Experts" reception at the
Empire State Building Observatory following the forum.  In previous years,
the hosting conference has had its skyline reception at Top of The World,
located within the Trade Center.  That spot will not open this month. 
also extraordinarily susceptible to the various abuses of this technology."

A few months ago, a well-respected British TV documentary show (might have

electronically scanned by British Telecom (the main phone company) personnel,
supervised by the security services.  Direct scanning by the security services
would have been illegal.  They were looking for words like 'terrorist' &amp;

this could affect the privacy of American telexes to the U.K.

Headline: Sacked expert fears nuclear safety risk
Byline: Paul Brown, Environment Correspondent (The Guardian, 4 March 1993)

A computer system created to make Britain's nuclear reactors safer could fail
at a vital moment because it has not been tested properly, according to the
man who designed it.

Bob Hodson-Smith, who has been sacked by a company commissioned by Nuclear
Electric to design a back-up safety system for nuclear power station
controllers, says the system might not perform adequately at precisely the
moment it was needed because "bugs" had not been removed from the programming.
He has expressed his fears to Nuclear Electric, the state owned company that
runs [all commercial] nuclear power stations in England and Wales.  It is
understood that the company is seriously concerned at the implications.

The firm which sacked him, Active Business Services (ABS), of Sheffield, has
described his fears as irrational.  But Mr Hodson-Smith says: "I could no
longer live with the fact that safety might be compromised and I had done
nothing to warn anyone."

The Safety Related Plant Status Monitoring System, as Nuclear Electric
describes the system, has been in operation at a Magnox power station at
Oldbury-on-Severn in Gloucestershire for aa year.  Similar computer systems
are being brought into operation at Dungeness A in Kent and Hinkley Point A in
Somerset.

Status, as the system was called, was designed to prevent the kind of
accidents that occurred at Three Mile Island nuclear power station in the
United States and the Piper Alpha oil platform disaster.  In both cases shift
workers faced with a breakdown in equipment switched to substitute systems,
unaware that they had been taken out of service by a previous shift.

Status was designed to prevent this happening.  Staff log into the computer
every item of safety-related equipment in the nuclear station, so operators
can see at a glance whether it is in proper working order.  Safety at nuclear
stations relies on all vital equipment being duplicated at least twice so any
defective equipment can be bypassed.

Mr Hodson-Smith's alarm is based on the belief that the computer system might
be relied on in times of emergency when "bugs" in the programming had not been
removed.  In memos he warned ABS that he was not satisfied the system was
safe, and urged the company to inform Nuclear Electric of his fears.

In a memo to ABS managing director, Paul Sellars, he said he was aware he
would be "fired" if he published the information but "I am not prepared to
present a false picture to Nuclear Electric.  I believe that what is being
done with the Status project is not morally tenable."

Mr Hodson-Smith said he was not prepared to supply the newer Advanced Gas
Cooled Reactor [AGR] (at) Hinkley Point B with a similar system unless Nuclear
Electric were fully informed of the potential difficulties with Status at the
other stations.  He insisted that the system be thoroughly debugged, which
could only be done by writing a technical manual explaining the system and
cross-checking it.  This had not been done.

In a memo he said that if it was a computer system for a bank "it would be
acceptable to stick together a functionally complete version, install it and
hope it was right.  If it failed then it can be fixed as required.  However,
it is simply not acceptable to do this for a nuclear power station control
room system related to safety."

Mr Sellars, managing director of ABS, responded by suggesting that Mr
Hodson-Smith consult a psychiatrist, Dr James Conway in Sheffield.  Dr
Conway's view of his patient was that "he exhibited symptoms of anxiety and
overwhelming worry which would be understandable ... if his fears were
well-founded.  He believes there is little communication with the management
at present."

In a letter Mr Sellars told Mr Hodson-Smith that the Status system would not
become fully operative until fully tested.  "The company does recognise the
nature and extent of its responsibilities."

The company and Mr Hodson-Smith remained at loggerheads.  He was
subsequently dismissed, and has begun an action for unfair dismissal.

Mr Sellars said: "Mr Hodson-Smith had a very good brain but his behaviour has
become irrational.  He was not involved in the commercial area.  He had become
impossible to manage."  Mr Sellars said there were no bugs in the system,
which was being fully tested.  Technical manuals on how the system was
constructed were being written and would be provided to Nuclear Electric.

Mr Hodson-Smith has sent papers detailing his fears to the three nuclear
stations involved and Nuclear Electric is studying them.

Nuclear Electric emphasised that the computer system had not yet been fully
integrated into the control system for the reactors.  Safety had therefore not
been compromised.

Nuclear Electric said that the system was a management tool for checking
equipment.  In the case of an emergency the reactor would be shutdown
automatically, independently of the Status system.

  [A few of the risks covered: reliability of risk management systems; risk of
  bringing a system into disrepute by the actions of disruptive staff; risk of
  using a system for a year before full testing and manuals are complete; ...

|        [An old story, eh?  Security is almost always considered 
|        too expensive until AFTER the disaster...   PGN]

Now let's be fair.  How many other buildings got the same advice and
have not been bombed?  What is the expected benefit, over all major
buildings, of ensuring against an event with probability x?

In any case, what difference would it have made?  It would made the
evacuation a little smoother and less traumatic, but I doubt it would
have saved any lives or gotten the buildings re-opened any sooner.

Managers are always paid to decide how much risk is acceptable when weighed
against how much expense.  There is always some level of disaster against
which you are not protected (suppose it had been a nuclear device).  Maybe
their decision was rotten and they just lucked out in not having a much larger
loss of life; on the other hand, maybe their decision was pretty good and they
had really bad luck in the placement of the bomb coupled with really good luck
in not having any coincident problems to raise the death count.  I don't know
enough to know whether they acted correctly; I doubt that either the author of
the note or the moderator know, either.

&gt;Help keep my building from suffering from 'World Trade Center Syndrome' 
&gt;(lack of emergency lighting)... Point me in the right direction please!

From the news I've seen, I got the impression that the emergency lighting was
controlled by a central computer somewhere, although each separate
light/battery pack had a little bit of intelligence of its own.  However,
whoever programmed the emergency light microbrains had a panic routine that
just sat around trying to re-establish contact with the main controller if the
main controller had blown up.  But apparently it skipped the programmer's mind
that, if the main controller had blown up, it just might be a good idea to
turn on the emergency lights.

Does anybody know if this is true?  If so, it's some really poor
programming!  Perhaps comp.risks would be a good place to take this.

&gt;  A patient in Manchester Royal Infirmary in England was found unconscious
&gt;  after she mixed up the nurse's call button with the one to give herself more
&gt;  painkiller and pressed the latter button impatiently for several minutes.

It is usual practice with Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) to have a lockout
on the syringe driver, so that the patient cannot give themselves repeated
doses without sufficient time between them. This not only prevents overdoses,
but also means one bolus (dose) of painkiller has time to act before the
patient is able to give themselves another dose, so that if the first dose is
effective, the second, later, dose will not be administered by the patient.

However, if the syringe driver wasn't set up with the time lockout .....

Regarding Bill Clinton's electronic mail, Shellie Emmons 
&lt;sme46782@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu&gt; asks, as reported here by
David Daniels &lt;0004381897@mcimail.com&gt;:

&gt;  (1)  When you get thousands of messages a day, how do you
&gt;       respond effectively?

Same way you respond to thousands of letters or phone calls a day: delegate it
to staff members who are trusted to (at least) winnow out whatever wheat there
may be and respond to the chaff with a polite virtual form letter.  There are
480 minutes in a working day; even assuming that our energetic Mr. C. puts in
more than an 8-hour day, he clearly isn't going to give even a cursory
acknowledgement, much less a thorough reading and thoughtful reply, to
thousands of messages.

If any good ideas are received, he could take a "That'll teach 'em to suck
eggs!" approach: have the White House staff find some aide or advisory-panel
opening and invite his tormentor to work toward analyzing and implementing the
idea.  Citizens who envision government policymakers as putting in a six-hour
day in a brandy-and-cigars atmosphere will learn their lesson right quick.  :)

&gt;  (2)  How do you make a public e-mail system inclusive
&gt;       and accessible?

Figure out how to ape Minitel in the context of our technological and cultural
base?  Ignore the problem entirely, given that the older means of
communicating with the government will remain available?

&gt;  (3)  What would happen if e-mail became the primary
&gt;       mode of(mediated) access to government?

The Golden Age of Unix Nerds, that's for sure. :) Seriously, one needs some
analysis of the modes currently used before this question can be answered.
Again, perhaps the key would be to deliberately keep the older modes
available: mail, irate phone calls to one's Congressperson, riding through the
Rose Garden on horseback and shouting at the upstairs windows, whatnot.  With
all due respect to the people who are afraid of disenfranchising the
computer-illiterate, I can't see the new medium drastically changing the way
the government receives input, unless the individual representatives and
staffers *choose* to ignore other forms of input, from letters to phone calls
to lobbyists.

The real RISK, of course, is that the President would discover Usenet News!

  &gt;From: Shellie Emmons &lt;sme46782@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu&gt;
  &gt;I am currently involved in a research project that is trying to aid the
  &gt;Clinton Administration in making effective use of computer-mediated
  &gt;communication to stay "in touch" with the public.  ...

There are a number of confusions tangled up in this message; I'll summarize.
Ms. Emmons is an undergraduate the UIUC who was asked by a professor to set up
an email list for a research project.  She posted a message about the project
to three newsgroups (comp.human-factors, comp.society, comp.mail-misc),
suggesting more by the description than is entirely correct, and called it
"The White House Communication Project", even tho it has no official
connection to the White House.  The name of the project will be changed.  Jack
Gill is not the name of the White House person who is involved in efforts to
get email running there.

Any email that does go to an address used by Media Affairs Office of the White
House is printed out and handed to the folks who handle ordinary White House
mail; those folks add that letter to the other fifteen thousand (15,000)
letters that the White House gets every day.  Eventually someone may reply
(via US Mail) to the message in exactly the manner that they reply to all of
their hardcopy mail.

There are a number of organizations trying to help the government use email,
one of them is a consortium of researchers led by the MIT AI Lab.

The original message above is of course an example of a computer risk: the
ability to attract a considerable amount of attention and excitement in a very
short period of time; the medium amplifies the message.

This is a comment on the technology policy statement announced by Clinton and
Gore on 2/22/93.  The policy initiatives include the substance of the
National High Performance Computer Technology Act that Gore had previously
sponsored in the Senate (e.g., S. 1067 in the 101st Congress).  Central to
that act and the new initiative is the National Research and Education Network
(NREN), a plan to increase the bandwidth of the internet and develop software
for its utilization.  I am concerned that the technology policy does not
adequately address privacy or other concerns about the social implications of
computing, including concerns raised by its proposed initiatives.

In the hearings on the High Performance Computing Act, medical informatics was
one of the applications envisioned for the NREN.  It's also part of the
Clinton technology policy.  The (brief) discussion of medicine in the 2/22
statement is interesting:

         "This information infrastructure -- computers, computer data 
  banks, fax machines, telephones, and video displays -- has as its 
  lifeline a high-speed fiber-optic network capable of transmitting 
  billions of bits of information in a second.... 
        "The computing and networking technology that makes this 
  possible is improving at an unprecedented rate, expanding both our 
  imaginations for its use and its effectiveness.  Through these 
  technologies, a doctor who needs a second opinion could transmit a 
  patient's entire medical record -- x-rays and ultrasound scans 
  included -- to a colleague thousands of miles away, in less time 
  than it takes to send a fax today."

Well, imagine that ("Hey Sue, lookit chromosome 17 on this guy from the
Farber! 20 bucks at 7 / 5 sez he's malignant in 5 years.  Bet he hopes his
insurer never sees this, har har.").  Without having any expertise here, I
find it plausible that network consults using computerized medical records
would have many benefits for patients.  But it's also clear that implementing
a network-mediated record system that provided secure confidentiality would be
a challenging engineering task.  I mean social as well as computer
engineering, it's the communication among people that is problematic here.

I find much to like in the technology policy, so I would love to be proven
wrong.  Unfortunately, I see little evidence that privacy has sufficient
priority in the current policy or the former High Performance Computing Act.
I would appreciate hearing from others whether the policy adequately covers
other aspects of socially responsible computing.  The technology policy ought
to include a statement of ethics concerning computerized information.  I also
believe that the NREN should follow the example of the NIH's Human Genome
Project, which devotes 5% of its research budget to a program for studies of
the Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications of human genetic research.

I picked up the premiere issue of a new magazine called "Wired" which
is trying to spread the word about the Digital Revolution.  And
editorial blurb from the inside page is repeated here:

============
WHY WIRED?

Because the Digital Revolution is whipping though our lives like a Bengali
typhoon - while the mainstream media is still groping for the snooze button.
And because the computer "press" is too busy churning out the latest
PCInfoComputingCorporateWorld iteration of its ad sales formula cum parts
catalog to discuss the meaning or context of SOCIAL CHANGES SO PROFOUND their
only parallel is probably the discovery of fire.

There are a lot of magazines about technology.  "Wired" is not one of them.
"Wired" is about the most powerful people on the planet today - THE DIGITAL
GENERATION.  These are the people who not only foresaw how the merger of
computers, telecommunications and the media is transforming life at the cusp
of the millennium, they are making it happen.

OUR FIRST INSTRUCTION TO OUR WRITERS: AMAZE US.  

Our second: We know a lot about digital technology, and we are bored with it.
Tell us something we've never heard before, in a way we've never seen before.
If it challenges our assumptions, so much the better.

So why not now?  Why "Wired"?  Because in the age of information overload, THE
ULTIMATE LUXURY IS MEANING AND CONTEXT.

Or put another way, if you're looking for the soul of our new society in wild
metamorphosis, our advice is simple.  Get "Wired".

-LR [jfs: Louis Rossetto]

You can reach me at 415-904-0664 or lr@wired.com
================

Along with this they had an interesting article on "Cellular Phreaks and Code
Dudes" by John Markoff (markoff@nyt.com), which discusses how the latest rage
of Silicon Valley hackers is Cellular phones.  He gives an example of how two
phreaks hacked into an OKI 900 cellular phone and some of the features they
discovered:

  o how to use it as a cellular scanner.

  o the manufacturer's interface so you can attach the phone to a
    portable computer.

  o one of the phreaks wrote some software to track other portable
    phones as they move from cell to cell, this allows him to display the
    approximate locations of each phone since he knows the geographical
    locations of each cell.

  o having the phone watch a specific number, and when that number is
    used, pick up and by using a simple sound activated recorder, you've
    made an instant bugging device!  Maybe all the spies in Common Market
    who were worried about having point to point encryption on cellular
    phones didn't think of this trick?

I found this article to be worth the cost of the magazine, as it ties in
directly with RISKS readers here have been talking about.  Now if it is this
easy to hack this phone, how hard would it be to hack into the general
cellular phone service machines, those that handle the passing of phones from
cell to cell?

The down side was the really annoying format, which seems to be
"Techno-babble-obnoxious" with arbitrary changes in typeface, orientation, etc
as you flip through pages.  I felt that this detracted from the overall look
of the information they were trying to present, making it harder to
assimilate.  I'd be interested in talking to anyone else who has read this
magazine too.

  Ontario Hydro Cites Safety Reasons For Reducing Power Production At Bruce
  Nuclear Plant

  Power production has been reduced at Ontario Hydro's largest electrical
  generator so that engineers can solve a potential safety problem, a utility
  spokesman said Sunday. Hydro began 'derating' the units at the Bruce nuclear
  plant to 60 per cent Friday after learning the safety margin in the event of
  a reactor accident was slimmer than expected, said Tony Tidbury manager of
  reactor safety. 'This is not a problem in the reactor right now,' said
  Tidbury.  'It would only change in the event of an extremely, unlikely
  accident,' would be a huge leak of heavy water - which cools the reactor's
  radioactive fuel, Tidbury said. The Lake Huron nuclear plant produces about
  20 per cent of Ontario's electricity but Hydro spokesman Geoff McCaffery
  said the cut shouldn't be a problem."

Steve Jackson Games/Secret Service wrapup
By JOE ABERNATHY Copyright 1993, Houston Chronicle [no date given]

 AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret Service closed
 Thursday with a clear statement by federal District Judge Sam Sparks that the
 Service failed to conduct a proper investigation in a notorious computer
 crime crackdown, and went too far in retaining custody of seized equipment.
 The judge's formal findings in the complex case, which will likely set new
 legal precedents, won't be returned until later.  [...]

 The judge's rebuke apparently convinced the Department of Justice to close
 its defense after calling only ... one of the several government witnesses
 on hand.  "The Secret Service didn't do a good job in this case.  We know no
 investigation took place.  Nobody ever gave any concern as to whether (legal)
 statutes were involved.  We know there was damage," Sparks said in weighing
 damages.

 The lawsuit, brought by Steve Jackson Games of Austin, said that the seizure
 of three computers violated the Privacy Protection Act, which provides First
 Amendment protections against seizing a publisher's works in progress.  The
 lawsuit further said that since one of the computers was being used to run a
 bulletin board system containing private electronic mail, the seizure
 violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act in regards to the 388
 callers of the Illuminati BBS.

The testimony described by Joe was rather strange.  Agents testified that
there was no criminal connection, they were not even trained in the Privacy
Protection Act, and it took them only an hour to discover the true nature of
the situation.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation spent over $200,000
bringing this case to trial.  The legal ramifications are considerable.
Perhaps someone from EFF will contribute an analysis to RISKS, although many
EFFers (and I) are at Computers, Freedom, and Privacy 93 this week.  Don't
hold your breath, but perhaps we need to wait for the judge?  PGN

I am trying to assess the potential interest in my teaching a short course
(a week or less) on software safety at the University of California, Irvine
this summer.  Topics could include basic system safety principles, management
of safety-critical software projects, human error and the design of the 
human-machine interface, system and software hazard analysis, software
engineering practices for safety-critical systems (software requirements
analysis, design for safety, and verification of safety), and risk assessment.

Would such a course interest you?  Which of the above topics would be of 
the most importance to you?

Nancy Leveson  nancy@ics.uci.edu

    [Please reply directly to Nancy, not to RISKS.  We do not normally
    run prospecti for courses.  However, this potential offering is so
    closely related to the charter of the Risks Forum that it seems
    essential to include it.  Besides, Nancy has been a subscriber from
    volume 1 number 1 on and carries our entire akashic record in her head.

An article, entitled "School files: Dangerous data?" appeared as the headline
article in the 8 March 1993 _Cincinnati_Enquirer_.  It discusses Ohio's
Education Management Information System (EMIS), used to store demographic,
attendance, program, summer school, achievement and proficiency testing, and
post-graduation records of all public school attendees in Ohio.  The complete
set of data to be recorded was listed.  This includes family income
information, reason for leaving school (transferred schools, drug abuse,
pregnancy, etc.), and extracurricular activities (including those not(!)
related with school, such as 4-H or Scouting).  Information is indexed either
off of a Social Security number (a RISK in itself), or off of a school
district-supplied ID number.  Students switching school districts and not
using their SSN will have a new number assigned to them.  Students with
multiple ID numbers, I assume, are cross-indexed--but the article was unclear
on this point.

The EMIS system was proposed in 1989 and set to begin operation in July, 1991.
The legality of the system was challenged that month by a Cincinnati-area
school district (Princeton), and EMIS was declared illegal on Jan. 9, 1992.
The Ohio legislature then passed a law (House Bill 437) on April 30, 1992,
nullifying the previous ruling.  A new suit, filed by Princeton and others,
was filed Oct. 2, 1992, accusing the state of violating federal privacy laws.
This suit is up for decision in Hamilton County Common Pleas court this month.

Several of the well-known RISKS of large databases were brought up in the
article, which are quoted below.

   "Reliability is just one of the concerns about EMIS that led Princeton 
City School District to sue the state.  'Our concern is that kids do make
mistakes, and here's a record that never disappears.' said Richard Denoyer,
Princeton superintendent.  'If a kid drinks a beer, that could be in there
forever.
   'You used to give your Social Security number on your check at the
grocery store,' Denoyer said.  'People don't do that anymore.  They know
that (with the number) you can get into where you shop, what you buy, even
how much money you have in the bank.'"
(...)
   "Some say any number that can identify a student is too much.
   'There's this whole industry of data brokers and private eyes who make a
living obtaining (personal) information,' said Evan Hendricks, editor and
publisher of _Privacy_Times_, a newsletter on privacy issues.  If they want it
badly enough, they're not above bribing an employee or impersonating a school
official to get it, he said.  'That information isn't available if there's no
name attached.'
   'When you've got that much information linked together, that increases the
risk,' the ACLU's Goldman said.  'This would just be a huge challenge (to
hackers): ''Let's look at Johnny's grades.'' '

A couple of other interesting RISKS-related comments in the article were:

"...over 50% of the requests (into the FBI's criminal database--TJM) are 
non-law enforcement, typically from employers and licensing boards."

"This information (driver's license records) is now a public record and
state governments are bringing in a hefty revenue selling mailing lists."

The article also mentions a similar system in Texas, and says the Texas
system has not been challenged on privacy grounds.

A report in the Monday, 8 March 93 Globe and Mail newspaper Report on Business
by John Partridge raises questions about privacy and security: "Numbers the
Royal doesn't keep secret."

According to the report, the Royal Bank of Canada sometimes allows its
market-research firms to have not only the names, addresses, telephone
numbers, sex, and age of selected customers but also their client-card
numbers.

Critics argue that releasing these card numbers could lead to fraud; e.g.,
criminals with knowledge of the numbers etc. could fraudulently obtain new
"replacement" cards and enter new personal identification numbers (PINs) at
the customer's home bank.

Defenders argue that the likelihood of success of such ploys is negligible.

Royal Bank spokesperson Denise Curran is quoted as saying that the Bank
supplies card numbers because they include coded information such as
"geographic indicators" that help the market researchers cross-tabulate
results.

However, four other major Canadian banks refuse to provide client-card
numbers to market research firms.

The Consumers' Association of Canada objects to all banks' providing
outsiders with customer information of any kind without the client's
permission.  The Royal Bank argues that because its market research is for
its own internal use, it does not need to ask for such permission.

John Partridge reports in the Globe and Mail newspaper's Report on
Business for Tue 9 Mar 93, that the Royal Bank of Canada has cancelled its
practice of releasing client card numbers to its market research firms.

Tony Webb, senior vice-president of personal financial services, said, "No
doubt must be allowed to remain in the minds of our customers."

Jacqueline Singh, VP of marketing, said, "...there are other ways ... to get
the geographic data ... for them [the researchers] but also keep client
numbers confidential."  She added, "Our feeling is that if there is one more
piece of information we can keep confidential, then we absolutely should and
must."

Readers from outside the NY area should be aware that the World Trade Center
was built and is operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
This bi-state agency has some surprising powers to ignore local and even many
state laws and regulations.  The building grossly violates local NYC building
and fire codes.

This is not without some advantages.  The city building codes mandate specific
practices which have high labor costs during construction and prevent the use
of many modern construction techniques even good ones.  It is unclear if the
WTC could have been built under traditional codes at all.  Of course the
safety systems used, while not to code might have have adequate "diversity" in
location and conduit routing to survive.  The basic structural design seems to
have stood up quite well.  But there are a number of cases where the ability
to ignore local code resulted in bad choices.

For example self-contained battery operated trickle-charged lighting systems
in halls and emergency stairs are present in also evey other large building.

The NYC Fire Department has repeatedly stated that they would not be able to
properly respond to a fire above the tenth floor given the building's design.
(Inadequate high pressure feed system, lack of separately routed conduits for
external power supplies to the fire fighting substations throughout the
building etc.

In regards to the bombing at the World Trade Center, the news reports and
comments made at the various news briefings seem to indicate that the
emergency lighting was run off the backup generators only, there were no
batteries in the emergency lights in the stairwells. Among the reasons given
was the high cost of maintainance of the batteries.

Something which has been troubling me since the bombing and that I haven't
seen discussed anywhere was the vulnerability of the broadcasting system.  The
World Trade Center has most of the antennae for the New York area. On the day
of the bombing I was home with my kids who were watching TV at the time. All
the stations except a local PBS station, ch.21, which broadcasts from here on
Long Island and ch 2, CBS, which kept a backup antenna on the Empire State
Building were knock off the air and most weren't back on until much later that
night.  I couldn't help but think about all the years of watching those
emergency broadcast messages and wondering how they figured to keep
broadcasting through an emergency with no backup broadcast facilities.

As a side note it was interesting to see what ch 2, the CBS station did with
their one time New York monopoly.  They kept to there regular schedule, The
Wizard of Oz aired unopposed.  Actually given the events of the day it wasn't
such a poor choice.  I wonder if they got to increase there advertisement
rates for the night?

In <A HREF="/Risks/14.38.html">RISKS-14.38</A>, Scott Preece suggests that the impact of the World Trade
Center bombing would not have been significantly reduced if the Port Authority
had acted on a study that showed the garage to be vulnerable to a car bomb.
He also suggests that neither I nor the moderator know enough to question the
Port Authority's decisions.

Well, I read the newspaper.  The blast and its aftereffects have been covered
very extensively in the local press.  I've drawn the following conclusion: If
the basement levels had contained only parking, plus the structural components
needed to keep the buildings sitting on top, then the situation would be very
different.  Evacuation would have taken place in lighted, clear stairwells
rather than pitch-dark, smoke-filled stairwells, and hundreds of smoke
inhalation injuries would have been avoided.  Most of the people who were
killed, Port Authority employees who were in offices or a lunchroom on the
garage level, would have been elsewhere and would still be alive.  The job
of getting the buildings ready for reoccupancy would be simplified, because
the air-conditioning plant wouldn't be buried under rubble.

I DON'T know how much it would have cost to retrofit the buildings to move
everything out of the basement.

&gt;...emergency lighting... controlled by a central computer ... each separate

light microbrains had a panic routine...trying to re-establish contact with the
main controller if the main controller had blown up...if the main controller
had blown up, it just might be a good idea to turn on the emergency lights&lt;

Non-maintained emergency lighting normally consists per unit of a lamp, a
battery stack, a changeover relay and, in most cases, a trickle-charger for the
batteries. Supply current keeps the relay in the 'charge batteries; lamp off'
position. If it (or the relay's coil or connections) fails, the relay's spring
carries the contacts to the 'lamp on' position. Restoration of supply current
returns the unit to the 'charge batteries; lamp off' state. The device's
control system is therefore, within the usual limits, fail-safe.

I cannot imagine any good reason to replace this old, tested, cheap and
reliable system, in which each unit is independent of the others, with
something interconnected and allegedly 'intelligent', particularly since the
latter seems in the WTC's case (if the above allegation is true) to have neatly
evaded the fail-safe principle.

&gt;...it's some really poor programming!&lt;

Safety equipment should not, IMHO, ever require 'programming'. Its operation
should be based on simple principles of physics (preferably basic mechanics),
and upon as few of them at once as is possible, and its condition and readiness
should be easily subjected to inspection at any time. Otherwise it eventually
ceases to be safety equipment at all, and becomes another hazard.

Most of the basic safety devices (e.g. Otis' elevator safety mechanism, Fermi's
gravity control-rods or Westinghouse's vacuum brake) were invented long ago and
cannot now be 'improved' by the addition of 'features' since any added
complication can only reduce reliability, their most desirable characteristic.
Adding the wild variable of 'programming' seems most unlikely ever to benefit
anyone except the programmer and salesfolk involved. I wonder how many
airpeople would buy a computer-controlled parachute...

The newspapers in Milwaukee reported an interesting case this morning.  

An installer of automatic garage door openers has been arrested, pending
being formally charged of burglary.  He is accused of recording the electronic
code settings on the automatic garage doors he installed, and then returning
some time later and opening the garage doors electronically.  He has been
accused of an entire string of burglaries, and stolen goods were apparently
found in his home.  In some cases, the garage door was opened and the inside
door to the rest of the house was unlocked, or else it was pried open.

Sounds like it might be a good idea to change the code settings on your garage
door opener if it was installed by someone else, or even serviced recently.

Some time ago, my parents (who live in another state) decided that, if they
were going to hear their grandchildrens' voices, they needed to get a personal
800 number from MCI.  The personal 800 scheme works like this: each household
is assigned a unique 800 number (I'm told), and an access code (4 digits).  As
a precaution against abuse, when you dial the 800 number you get a message
telling you to enter your code.  Only callers who enter the correct code get
connected, so no massive dialing scheme advertising holiday resorts (etc) can
exploit the users' willingness to pay for incoming calls.

I promptly programmed my parents' number and the code on adjacent buttons of
my phone and left it at that.  I would just hit the first button, wait for the
announcement (voice-mail style) and hit the second button.  This worked, until
a little over a month ago.  At that point, after I hit the second button I was
asked to wait, and an operator came on the line and asked for my code.  The
first time this happened, I refused to give the code (since I had forgotten it
(!)).  A moment later, it apparently showed on the operator's console, and I
was put through.

I thought this was an aberration, but at no time after the first event was I
able to get directly through, without talking to an operator.  I thought their
equipment might not be able to handle the high speed dialer, so I relearned
the code and punched it in myself.  Still no go.  I tried from my office.
Same thing.

Finally, last week, I managed to get the operator to switch me to a technical
representative.  This individual and I discussed what was happening, and the
rep told me that he knew of another case where much the same thing had
happened.  I then asked if they had changed or upgraded their system software
lately.  Long pause.  "Why yes, we did, just about a month ago."

I suggested they check things out, and was promised a report.  Well, a couple
of days later the system WORKED!  And it has not failed again since.  I have
not received a report (nor a consulting fee from MCI), but I suspect that
MCI's upgrade of their personal 800 system included some, uh, 'features' of
which they weren't aware.  They may have gone back to the old software, or
they may have just fixed MY problem.  I don't know which.  But I am certain
that the origin of the problem had to do with a programming error in MCI's
hardware/software, and this raises the issue of other errors that might be out
there.

Should MCI employ beta testers?  That would be my suggestion.  They could pay
people like me to make trial calls at, say, 3:00 AM CST, just to make sure the
system worked as advertised.  Hey, in a world where most people can't program
an MS-DOS .BAT file, you need to check!

System Dynamics of Risks: Risk Perceptions, Mental Models, Circuit Breakers

There have been a number of postings about risk and public acceptance of risks
from various technologies, e.g. nuclear, chemical, etc.  I think it's worth
reviewing some of the basics about risk perceptions.  This posting is based on
the following references for those who wish to develop their own conclusions.

"Perceptions of Risk," Slovic, Paul, _Science_, 4/17/87. Vol 236,
pp. 280-285.

"The Fifth Discipline," Senge, Peter, Doubleday, 1990.

"Technological Risk," Lewis, H.W, Norton, 1990.

This posting is done in "bullet" form so that I can show attribution to source
by concept.  Almost all of the material in this post comes from one or more of
the sources noted above.  I have merely condensed some of the key ideas.

Senge's work on system dynamics does not mention risk
perceptions, per se, rather, in any great detail.  I have applied
his tools for thinking about system dynamics to risk perceptions.

Finally, if I have made any errors in representing the work of
these authors, they are unintentional.  I would appreciate
clarifications where necessary.


OBJECTIVES - Slovic

*    Provide a basis for understanding and anticipating public
     perceptions of hazards.  [Note: Senge - risk perceptions are
     mental models.]

*    Improve communication of risk information among technical
     experts, lay people, and decision makers.

BACKGROUND - Slovic

*    The development of chemical and nuclear technologies has
     been accompanied by the potential to cause catastrophic and
     long-lasting damage to the earth and to the life forms that
     inhabit it.

*    The mechanisms underlying these complex technologies are
     unfamiliar and incomprehensible to most citizens.  The most
     harmful consequences of these technologies are such that
     learning to mitigate or control them is not well suited to
     management by trial-and-error.  The public has developed
     increasing levels of dread of the unknown consequences of
     complex technologies.

*    The public is well aware that economic and political
     pressures during the design process in complex systems may
     lead to systems being built and operated near the edge of
     the safety envelope. [Senge - Eroding goals]  

*    Some systems, once built, represent such significant
     investments that it is nearly impossible to walk away from
     them regardless of risks. [Senge - Yesterday's solutions are
     today's problems.]  Example, nuclear waste resulting from
     the balance of terror associated with nuclear weapons.

*    Those who are responsible for human health and safety need
     to understand the ways people think about and respond to
     risk.  Perception and acceptance of risks have their roots
     in social and cultural factors and not in science.  

*    The result is that some risk communication efforts may be
     irrelevant for the publics for which they are intended
     because the "publics" have hidden agendas.  Also, the public
     may be raising the issue of risk to human health and the
     environment as a surrogate for other social, economic, or
     political concerns.

*    Risk perceptions are mental maps composed of attitudes,
     beliefs, assumptions, and judgements.  Following is an
     example of the "Not in my back yard," or NIMBY mental map. 

     [Senge - reinforcing, vicious loops.]

     -    Attitude:      government science is not trustworthy

     -    Belief:        government serves special interests, not
                         the public

     -    Assumption:    you can't fight city hall

     -    Judgement:     whatever it is the government is
                         proposing to do, get it out of my back
                         yard.

*    Disagreements about risk perceptions do not change as a
     result of better data becoming available and being
     disseminated to the public.   People have a hard time
     changing their opinions because of the strong influence
     initial impressions, or pre-existing biases, have on the
     interpretation of new information.  Also, the method of
     presenting the new data, e.g. as mortality or as survival
     rates, can alter perceptions of risk.

*    Generally, the gap between perceived and desired risk levels
     suggests that people are not satisfied with the ways the
     market or regulatory agencies have balanced risks and
     benefits.  Generally, people are more tolerant of risks from
     activities seen as highly beneficial, but this is not a
     systematic relationship.

*    The key factor regarding acceptance of exposure to risk
     appears to be the degree to which a person chooses that
     exposure in return for a perceived level of benefits.  The
     relationships between perceived levels of benefits and
     acceptance of risks are mediated by factors such as
     familiarity, control, potential for catastrophic
     consequences, and equity.

*    In the case of nuclear power people's deep anxieties are
     linked to the history of negative media coverage.  Also,
     there is a strong association between public attitudes about
     nuclear power and anxieties about the proliferation of
     nuclear weapons.


Accidents as Signals - Slovic

*    The impact of accidents can extend far beyond direct harm. 
     An entire industry can be affected regardless of which firm
     was responsible for the mishap.

*    Some mishaps cannot be judged solely by damage to property,
     injuries, or death.  Some events, like Three-Mile Island
     (TMI), can have ripple effects on public perceptions of
     risks leading to a more hostile view of complex technologies
     in general.

*    The signal potential of an event like TMI, and thus its
     social impact, appears to be related to how well risks
     associated with the event are understood.  The difference in
     perceptions between a train wreck and a nuclear reactor
     accident is that the wreck is seen as a discrete event in
     time while the reactor problem is regarded as a harbinger of
     further catastrophic mishaps.  The relationship is between
     degree of unknown dread of the consequences of the accident
     and the degree of subsequent irrational fears of future
     catastrophes.


Risks &amp; Benefits - Slovic

*    Firms conducting risk assessments within the framework of
     cost - benefits analyses often fail to see the "ripple"
     effects of worst case scenarios.

*    For example, Ford Motor Co. failed to correct a design
     problem with the gas tank of its Pinto compact care.  A cost
     - benefit analysis indicated that corrections costs greatly
     exceeded expected benefits from increased safety.

*    Had Ford looked at public risk perceptions of auto fires in
     crashes, the analysis might have highlighted this defect
     differently.

     -    Public perceptions of auto crashes regarded the risk of
          fire as a very high order problem involving
          considerable dread.

     -    Ford ignored potential higher order costs such as
          damage claims from lawsuits, damaged public reputation,
          lost future sales, and diminished "good will" from
          regulatory agencies.



Risk Perception &amp; Mental Models - Senge

The logic of mental models with regard to risk perceptions is
illustrated by the following notes:

1.   Senge - Structure influences system performance

     IF:       structure influences system performance, and;

     IF:       mental models - attitudes, beliefs, assumptions,
               judgements - are part of the structure;

     THEN:          Mental models influence system performance. 
                    Risk perceptions are mental models because
                    they are based on social and cultural factors
                    such as attitudes, beliefs, assumptions, and
                    judgements


2.   Senge - The easy way out usually leads back in.

     IF:       culture is the dominant collection of shared
               mental models operating in society, and;

     IF:       risk perceptions, which are mental models, have
               their roots in social and cultural factors, and
               not in science;

     THEN:          some risk communication efforts based solely
                    on scientific data will fail since they do
                    not address mental models which are the basis
                    for risk perception.


3.   Senge - The harder you push the harder the system pushes back.

     IF:       both our private and shared mental models are
               always flawed and can get us into trouble when
               they are taken for granted, and;

     IF:       levels of dread, in terms of perceived risk of
               complex technology, are reinforced by irrational
               fears caused by the unknown but potentially
               catastrophic effects of new technologies;

     THEN:          inappropriate mental models about complex
                    technologies may be reinforced, rather than
                    mitigated, by additional "marketing" efforts
                    to promote new technologies.


Charting Mental Models About Risk - Senge

Variables are defined as elements in a system which may act or be
acted upon.  A variable can move up or down in terms of
intensity, duration, absolute or relative values, etc., but it's
movement is measurable.

Slovic - There are four areas in which variables are defined for
mental models at work in shaping risk perceptions.  Following
each variable definition is a list of factors which further
define them.

*    The degree of voluntary acceptance of the risk, e.g.
     drinking coffee (caffeine) v. second hand smoke. (who makes
     the decision for exposure to the risk)

     -    Controllable?

     -    Consequences not fatal for individuals or groups?

     -    Equity in choice, degree of exposure?

     -    Low risk to future generations?

     -    Risks easily reduced or mitigated by individual
          choices?

     -    Risk decreases over time as more knowledge becomes
          available?

*    The level of dread of the unknown the person has about the
     risk, e.g. thermonuclear war v. car accident. (obliteration
     of the collective v. individual survival)

     -    Totally uncontrollable; e.g. Pandora's box?

     -    Catastrophic results?

     -    Consequences fatal?

     -    No equity or choice, random exposures to risks?

     -    High risks to future generations?

     -    Risk increases over time regardless of what is known
          about it?

*    The amount of knowledge the person has about the risk and
     especially its consequences, e.g. inhaling pesticide residue
     v. drinking alcoholic beverages. (imprecise science v.
     known, quantifiable data)

     -    Risks / consequences observable by trial and error,
          experimentation, or measurement?

     -    Those exposed realize the dangers?

     -    Effects / consequences separated in time and space,
          e.g., harm to future generations?

     -    Risks known to science, or exist in realm of
          "folklore?"

*    The degree of control the person has to prevent the
     consequences of system failure, e.g., riding on a snowmobile
     v. working in a coal mine. (individual control v. collective
     control)

     -    Consequences known, capable of quantification?

     -    Effects immediate?

     -    Risk well known and understood by the public and
          science?

     -    Solutions to mitigate risks work?


General Notes on Risks and Human Factors -- the Latent Failure Syndrome -
Lewis

*    Numerous functions and services in large, complex systems
     may be dependent on unrelated events.  Large,
     technologically complex systems have "latent" failures
     within them.  These are failures which are only apparent
     under a specific set of often obscure triggering conditions. 
     Examples include;

     Nuclear        Three Mile Island, Chernobyl
     Space          Challenger shuttle explosion
     Industry       Bhopal
     Environment    Exxon Valdez oil spill

*    While these disasters all have apparent triggers, in fact,
     these failures are virtually never the result of a single
     fault.

*    The risks of large system failures, with accompanying
     catastrophic consequences, accrue to the system as a whole
     rather than to individual components.

*    Pressures during the design phase [ eroding goals ] may lead
     to systems being built to operate near the edge of the
     safety envelope.

*    Logical redundancy is compromised by a lack of physical
     redundancy.  For example, separate communication channels
     are carried in the same conduit. 


Application of the "Latent Failure" Syndrone -- nuclear/chemical
waste cleanup

1.   Senge - Today's problems come from yesterday's solutions

     IF:       public anxieties [mental models] about nuclear
               technology are linked to dread of thermonuclear
               war, and;

     IF:       existing nuclear wastes are the by-products of
               weapons' production processes;

     THEN:          the public will extend it's original
                    perceptions [ mental models] to cover
                    processes involving the management of the
                    wastes even though the cleanup is designed to
                    neutralize them.

2.   Senge - The cure can be worse than the disease

     IF:       the public has an intuitive grasp of the "latent
               failure syndrone" with regard to complex
               technologies, e.g., nuclear weapons production,
               and;

     IF:       the public's mental map include a paradigm that
               "things blow up,"

     THEN:          the public will assume that the perceived
                    risks of cleaning up waste from nuclear
                    weapons production are no different than for the
                    activities that created the bombs in the first place.

Comments welcome, especially on ways to make distinctions between risk
perceptions about nuclear weapons v. risk perceptions about management of
nuclear wastes.  Are there any?

       INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR INFORMATION PROCESSING
      Working Group 9.2 - Social Accountability of Computing

              Announcement of Working Conference:
           "Facing the Challenge of Risk and Vulnerability
                   in an Information Society"
            to be held at Namur, Belgium, 20-22 May 1993

The event is jointly organised by IFIP-WG9.2 and the "Cellule Interfacultaire 
de Technology Assessment" (CITA), F.U.N.D.P., Namur and sponsored by the 
Belgian National Scientific Research Fund (FNRS) and the Ministry of the 
French Community.


1) Background

There has been much work done on the technical aspects of risk and
vulnerability within computer systems, and on what can be done to reduce risk
and alleviate the consequences. Less attention has been paid to the risks to
which society is exposed and its vulnerability in the age of information
technology.

The problems of risk and vulnerability are not new (and aspects of risk may 
even sometimes be considered to be necessary for society) but the size, 
complexity and global reach of computer systems means that the issues raised 
have acquired a much greater urgency.

The conference is an important opportunity to bring together many specialists
to address specific problems.  The scope of the conference is quite specific: 
careful analysis of the concepts of risk and vulnerability, particular 
experiences of both individuals and organisations, as well as professions
and other institutions of society, and responses to find new ways of meeting 
these challenges.


2) Main themes of the Conference

   - Analysis of Vulnerability and Risk: Theoretical papers which seek 
     to analyse the nature and types of risk in society and the ways in
     which society is vulnerable.

   - Vulnerability of the Employee and Citizen

   - Vulnerability of the Manager and Organisation: Papers that are based 
     on case studies which increase our understanding of the risks faced by
     people and organisations.

   - Professional Responses

   - Societal Responses: Papers which address the question: What can be
     done? through such means as legislation and the legal system, insurance, 
     codes of ethics, codes of practice, education, etc.

According to CBS news, the national network of Automated Teller Machines went
on the blink earlier today (3/17/93). Apparently EDS's main computer center in
New Jersey was damaged in last week's blizzard, and the backup computer center
was temporarily being occupied by companies forced out of the World Trade
Center as a result of the bombing.

What a nightmare, to be the administrator of a system like this, and
to have to plan for the possibility of both a bombing and a blizzard.
No wonder designing fail-safe computers is hard!

``East Coast Storm Freezes Some [San Francisco] East Bay ATMs''

An article in the March 16, 1993 Livermore/San Ramon, CA "Valley Times" stated
that a roof collapse in a Clinton NJ computer data center operated by EDS
prevented many San Francisco East Bay residents from accessing their ATM
accounts over the weekend.  The article said that "the data center...provides
the technological power that runs about 5,000 of the nation's 87,000 automatic
teller machines, including dozens in the East Bay."  By Monday afternoon, EDS
hadn't restored full power to its ATM network leaving local bankers scrambling
for ATM alternatives.  EDS has a back up system but it is being used by other
financial companies that suffered outages as a result of the Feb. 26 bombing
of the World Trade Center.

Quote from Larry Kurmel, executive director for the California Bankers
Association: "You tend to take these things [operating ATMs] for granted until
something like this happens. Then you realize these [ATM] systems are subject
to random events."

Newsgroups: sci.crypt,alt.security

The press in Britain this morning has been full of stories about Taurus. This
was a share dealing system in which the London stock exchange and local
institutions had invested some 400 million pounds (600 million dollars). It
didn't work and a review showed that there was no reasonable prospect of it
working; it seems that it just got too complex to cope with.

It has now been written off and the chief executive of the stock exchange 
`resigned' today.

A fair bit of the previous press criticism centred on the security, which was
designed by IBM and was apparently rather difficult to manage. As far as one
can tell from the press reports, it used their `common cryptographic
architecture' of 4753s for central control, DES cards in PS/2's for terminal
security, and smartcards for personal key management. Coopers and Lybrand, the
systems integrators, have also got a fair bit of stick (they sponsored
Eurocrypt 91, or so I seem to recall).

It will be interesting to see if this marks a turning point for bankers'
attitude to crypto technology. Up to now, it has been hard to sell things like 
formal methods or elliptic curves to men in suits, as DES in steel boxes was 
what they were comfortable with.

Future systems however may well use public key algorithms, and maybe even 
electronic wallets which distribute the security processing entirely into 
smartcards.

In that case, expect further entertainment, as some of the complexity will be 
pushed into the settlement process, or the arbitration system, or the key 
management mechanism; and the lack of relevant systems experience will exact 
its pound of flesh in one way or another.

Our head of department remarked that such fiascos can be compared to the
civil engineering disasters of the nineteenth century such as the collapse of
the Tay bridge. Civil engineers eventually got their act together, but there 
was a long learning process in which they worked out how to structure their
approach to large problems and combine the maths with the project management
in a way that worked.

Watch this space!

&gt;From the Fall 1992 issue of Intervue, 
the Intergraph customer newsletter:

Next time Mohammed A. Salameh is trying to find a parking
place for his van, he should use BombCAD...

--------begin article-----------

MANCHESTER, England.  Royal Ordnance Security Services is using a new software
package, BombCAD, as the basis for assessing the security level of a site and
predicting the effects of an explosion within or outside a structure.

BombCAD was developed using MicroStation PC CAD software to produce
sophisticated #D models of the structure under analysis.  If a building was
designed using CAD, BombCAD is able to use the original database containing
information on the overall site and building construction to produce a
computer model.  [...]

Using Intergraph's modeling capabilities, Royal Ordnance can create credible
scenarios for any property or installation and determine the likely effects of
an explosion, in terms of structural damage and human injury.  The range of
effects of each simulated explosion is displayed graphically on the 3D model
and reproduced as supporting evidence in a written report.

According to Andrew Quinn of Royal Ordnance, "We've already carried out
studies for four clients: two for risk assessment, one for the design of a new
building, and the fourth for modification of an existing structure.  Most
clients, for obvious reasons, do not wish to be identified.  However, one
example that is public knowledge is Manchester Airport.  We carried out a
number of 'what-if' scenarios and were able to provide the airport information
on evacuation routes, risk areas, and general safety programs."

The most recent issue of Popular Science had a small sidebar concerning new
copier technologies that are being used to combat counterfeiting.  According
to Canon, their new color copiers include two mechanisms to prevent people
from copying currency.

The first is rather innocuous - the copier can recognize many different
currencies and will print a blank image rather than a fake bill.  No obvious
risks here.

The second mechanism is a bit more threatening.  According to the story, 
which I quote without permission -

    "Each copier embeds a code into the copied image, which is
     impossible to see.  A special scanner extracts the code and
     a computer program then furnishes the copier's serial number,
     allowing identification of the registered purchaser of the
     machine."

As a means to combat counterfeiters this may be very useful.  Unfortunately,
it is also useful for tracking down people who report government waste,
publishers of underground newsletters, and others who may have a legitimate
need to remain anonymous.  Plus, it seems a bit too much like the Eastern bloc
countries who used to require registration of typewriters.

I found that the posting by Dan Yurman on the perception of risks really
helped clarify some issues.  I had not previously encountered the phrase
"level of dread" in risk analysis, and it seems particularly useful.  In
statistical analysis, death in a car accident seems to be an atomic concept,
so we focus on what will save the most lives.  In every day experience, death
in car accidents happens both often enough and seldom enough that we become
somewhat hardened to the possibility.  Death by fire in a car accident happens
less often, but summons such a level of dread that we see it differently; we
feel that "nobody should have to die that way".  We are likely to respond
"irrationally" and demand that cars be made safe from fire even if spending
the same amount of money in some other way would save more lives.

However, the point that "Some systems, once built, represent such
significant investments that it is nearly impossible to walk away from them
regardless of risks. [Senge - Yesterday's solutions are today's problems.]"
does not seem to be borne out by: "Example, nuclear waste resulting from
the balance of terror associated with nuclear weapons."

I would say that "nuclear waste ..." has become such a risk that we cannot
walk away from it, whatever the cost.  Perhaps the point would be better
made as "Coal, oil and nuclear powered electricity generating plants
represent such an important investment that it would be nearly impossible
to walk away from them regardless of the risks they present".

As he argues so well later on, nuclear waste disposal has become a very
unpopular topic because of its association with nuclear weapons.  We have
no investment in existing stockpiles of waste, and it would be easy to just
say that no one has room for it in their back yard, we'll just ignore the
problem.  In this case, informed recognition of the risk has led to an
understanding that we must continue to invest in solutions to the existing
problems, even though it might seem cheaper to just walk away from them.

Following up on my previous posting, The Guardian today (10 March 1993)
published a letter from George Jenkins, (Generation Director at Nuclear
Electric), commenting on the article thus:

The headline "sacked expert fears nuclear safety risk" (4 March) will have
concerned some readers, and the prominent article underneath suggested
that the Status computer system ". . . might be relied on in times of
emergency when 'bugs' in the programming had not been removed."  May I
make three facts absolutely clear?

First, the computer system in question is a stand-alone management
information system.  It is not connected to our reactor safety and control
systems at all.  Indeed, if you were to visit any of the nuclear plants
where it is being tested (as your reporter was invited to do), you would
see at a glance that it is not even located on the reactor operator's desk,
and forms no part of his control process.

Second, if it were to be removed, switched off, or even fail during
operation, it would not have the slightest effect on reactor safety.  The
main reactor safety systems at all UK nuclear power stations are hardwired,
and do not depend at all on computer software.

Third, any such computer system is subject in any event to rigorous checking
and validation, independent of its manufacturers.  That's what we're doing.
If it fails to meet our standards of reliability - among the highest in the
world - then it will simply be rejected.

  [A few of the risks covered: reliability of risk management systems; risk of

[Naggs'] note at the end appears to be very biased against the whistle blower:
"risk of bringing a system into disrepute by the actions of disruptive staff"
is not quite the way I would have put it.  The company is behaving much like
NASA did when problems with the shuttle's O-rings were discovered: instead of
fixing the problem, the company is attempting to discredit the safety-minded
individual and is attempting to sweep the problem under the rug.  Yes, the
whistle blower may have been "disruptive", but only to the extent that he was
forced to publicly announce the system's problems because of the management's
refusal to acknowledge even the possibility of a problem existing.

The FAA is opening an investigation into the risks of interference from
portable electronic devices on airplanes.  The previous investigation was 6
years ago, with the final report issued Sept 16, 1988.  It concluded that the
risk was small and that portable electronics could safely be used.  The new
investigation should issue an interim report in October and final report in
July 1994.

The reasons given for a new investigation are:

  1) The number of devices in use has grown substantially.  Some problem
  reports identified dozens of devices in use at the time of the problem.

  2) The shrinking size and low-voltage electronics of modern avionics
  are potentially more vulnerable to EMI
  
  3) Aircraft contain more composites.  The previous examination was
  only for metal skinned aircraft.  The metal provides substantial EMI
  protection. 

  4) There have been reports of interference from portable electronics.

From the limited number of reports there is a clear and substantial danger
from cellular phones.  These have been determined to be the cause of one third
of all suspected EMI.  They are also the most dangerous.  Despite the
prohibition on use in flight, people are observed to use the phones during
takeoff and landing.  This is the worst time for interference because the
aircraft is most sensitive to navigation and control interference at this
time.

The airlines may move more quickly.  They are already authorized to impose any
restrictions that they feel appropriate.  Given the incident reports there is
a potential that cellular phones may be prohibited from carry-on baggage (as
are other hazardous materials).

EMI problems should make software people feel right at home.  It is
like spaghetti code.  Every single wire and conductor is an antenna
and resonator.  Every chip a potential transmitter.  All of these
interact with each other to add or cancel.  To minimize EMI you want
the sum effect to be the least efficient antenna/transmitter possible.

Fortunately, this does not conflict with the real design goals and most of the
wires are already very inefficient.  The problem is tracking down the
occasional exception that is transmitting too much noise.

               [Ralph notes that this is not directly a COMPUTER RISK, 
               but it is interesting anyway.  PGN]

This week German shops and gas-stations have banned Dutch customers who wish
to pay with their credit card. In particular Euro-card users were duped by
this.  The reason was that a recent study by fraud-prevention units in the
Netherlands noted a sharp increase in credit-card-fraud.

Unsuspecting customers at German gas-stations got into trouble when the only
means they had to pay was their credit-cards.  They could still withdraw cash
from ATMs with their cards however.  It's interesting that because of the
easy ways to commit fraud with a credit card, now the Germans have decided the
Dutch customers are the perpetrators.

This case makes me think of the red-lining of phone-booths in inner-city areas
with a high ethnic population.  The phone company reasoned that as these areas
showed a high calling-card abuse rate, they shouldn't be allowed to call
certain countries.

&gt;&gt; An installer of automatic garage door openers has been arrested, pending
&gt;&gt; being formally charged of burglary.  

This is not a particularly new risk.

People have always been exposed when they hired locksmiths.  Locksmiths must
be licenced and bonded for this reason, in most states.  Indeed, despite
these precautions one hears about a case of locksmith burglary now and again.

There are, however, two new features to the risk:

  * You can change the code easily.  Most people can't hire a locksmith to
    change their lock and then change the key themselves.

    This change is in the customer's favor, but he needs to do it.

  * I would not be surprised to read about a burglary ring that builds a device
    to detect and record garage door opener codes.  Jog around town wearing
    what appears to be a personal stereo while people are coming home from work
    in the evening, and when you get home read the tape, jot down your codes,
    and burgle away the next day.

    There are ways of dealing with this, such as time-dependent codes, but i
    don't expect to see them coming to a garage door near me anytime soon.

&gt; I wonder how many air people would buy a computer-controlled parachute...

In fact computer controlled parachute deployment is possible.

Traditionally a parachutist manually deploys his main parachute.  If that
fails then he follows a set procedure to release the main and deploy the
reserve parachute.  Mains usually open but sometimes they don't, so every
parachutist must be trained in reserve procedures.  Yet over the years the
most common reason for death has been to simply fail to deploy the reserve
when needed.  In a high stress situation some people just seem to forget all
their training.

So the Automatic Activation Device (AAD) was invented.  These work on the rate
of change of air-pressure.  If you are descending too fast at a set height,
then your parachute is deployed regardless.  Note that an AAD is a backup
only.  You are not supposed to ever be low enough to need one and they should
only fire if for some reason you don't or can't deploy.  The mechanical models
have always been regarded as too unreliable, too bulky and too expensive for
experienced jumpers use so AADs have mostly been installed on student
equipment.

A new microcomputer controlled model called a Cypres answer most of the
normal complaints.  They are reliable, accurate, and small.  And they
have extra features like automatically adjusting for zero altitude.

Until recently most experienced jumpers still refused to attach even this AAD
to their own equipment.  "No way will I risk it firing at the wrong time".
Then last December a highly experienced (10000+ jumps) US jumper died when he
was knocked unconscious in freefall.  His rig had been given to him as
demonstration gear and it had a Cypres installed.  His last comment in the
plane was supposed to be "I might have to wear it but they can't make me turn
it on".  After this death, the waiting list for a Cypres went from 2 weeks to
18 weeks and jumpers who wouldn't be seen dead with an AAD started talking
seriously about installing one.

The RISK: I'm not sure there is one.  The Cypres sounds too good to be true.
Anyone who has one won't die.  Yet I keep feeling that that is the risk.  They
are supposed to be a backup but I am afraid that people will slowly put less
emphasis on reserve procedures and rely on this device working.  One day it
won't and the jumper will not know what to do.  There is a lot of discussion
in the Skydiving community about this topic at the moment.

Subject: Yet another White House address
To: Telecom Digest &lt;Telecom@delta.eecs.nwu.edu&gt;,
        Comp Privacy &lt;COMP-PRIVACY@PICA.ARMY.MIL&gt;,
        Risks in computing &lt;RISKS@csl.sri.com&gt;, libernet@dartmouth.edu,

MCI Mail announced yet another E-Mail address for messages to be sent to the
White House.  It stated in the note that messages sent to the address would be
sent as paper mail to the White House via the USPS, rather than as E-Mail.

The implication, since the usual charge for individual messages is 50c for the
first 500 characters, that this could conceivably be something that the White
House is paying for, since MCI Mail permits "autoforwarding" of a message sent
to a mailbox to be sent to a fax number, another E-Mail address or a Paper
Mail address.

If MCI is doing this to encourage MCI Mail subscribers to send messages,
then messages from users on Internet will almost certainly either bounce
or not be sent.

I encourage people on Internet to try sending a message to the address
supplied by MCI Mail for messages to the White House to see what happens.

I guess that's all I need to say.

OH YES!  You need the E-Mail address, don't you?  :)
