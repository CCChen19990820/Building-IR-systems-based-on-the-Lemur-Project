<h1>Partagas Cigars</h1><p>
   
Long before Fidel Castro came into power in Cuba, Partagas
cigars were 
crafted by hand in Havana under the direction of Ramon
Cifuentes and 
his father before him.
<p>
The last of the great cigar-makers to leave Cuba in the early
1960s, Ramon Cifuentes eventually discovered the ideal place
to go on making his Partagas cigars was only some 800 miles
east of Havana in 
Santiago, the tobacco capital of the Dominican Republic.
<p>
Ever since then, Ramon Cifuentes and his colleagues have
continued to 
make Partagas cigars in the Cifuentes tradition, always with
the 
longest filler leaves from the Caribbean, the supplest binder
leaves 
from Mexico and the costliest wrapper leaves from the African
Cameroons.
<p>
The cigars, which are made in 16 distinctive shapes, range
from a 
Number 10 measuring 7 1/2" x 49 Ring to a Puritos measuring  4
3/16" 
x 32 Ring.

<B>We're celebrating exam result tomorrow night and someone who doesn't know about cigars
picked up a box.  Guess what, they're Carbonells.  I've had one before, and thought it was a bit
dry but otherwise ok.  I'll make a more detailed comment later.  Of course he's storing them in his
car.  I tried not to cringe when I heard this, but I think he noticed.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I had one last night.  Not bad.  It had a sweet taste to it, smoked very
evenly with a solid ash.  Many of the first time smokers really enjoyed them too.
This one was about a 6 x 50.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The Carbonell Presidente is an exquisite and satisfying smoking pleasure for the true aficionado.  They smoke mildly with creamy notes and, are quite frankly (in my opinion) the closest smoke to a Cuban Cohiba Esplendido that I have ever smoked!!!  These words, I know, are very powerful as the Cohiba of Cuba is legendary--but it's true!!  These cigars are entirely made by the Carbonell family which I greatly believe has a lot to do with the great care with which they are rolled, aged and packaged.  I cannot say enough good about these Carbonell Presidente's--the only regret that I have is that they are not readily available thru my personal tobacconist or via the numerous mail order catalogues that I have found.  I guess that that only makes them more alluring and appreciated when I am able to find them!  </B><P>

Check out JW's Humidor. The guy has a few postings here in other threads. I've been
buying Hemingway Classics, Short Stories, and Signatures regularly now and with great
service. He sells them in singles which is pretty convenient for my budget. Look at his
strings mentioning Singles without buying a box" or something like that. Recently I've
gotten other hard to find treats like Partagas #10's. Check out his sight at

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Ditto on the JW's suggestion! I highly recommend this guy. If you can't get to his site (he tells me his server sometimes craps out), e-mail (crp123@ix.netcom.com) your request to him. I have had nothing but good experiences with this fellow cigar fan. He almost always has some of the what seem to be "extinct" cigars and he gives great service. JW, if you happen to see this, it's me Thomas. Thanks for the great smokes this past weekend.  </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Dan call John at 605-232-4616.  He sends me fantastic cigars
at great prices.  Usually never a wait.  I tried the JW
site and it didn't work for me. I  Usually try to buy from
my local guy as much as possible though.  Support your local
economy and such.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Dan:  I've tried the JW site and gotten there most of the time but there have been a few times I could'nt. Like the posting above said, JW tells me his server is updating and it sometimes tuckers out. I usually just e-mail him (ALWAYS WORKS FOR ME) and he gives me great service. He is at crp123@ix.netcom.com  Give this guy a call. My husband and I do alot of business with him. He is very nice and often generous after a few orders. Hope this helps.  Kitty</B><P>

fellow CA. I forgot to put my zip on an order for some Short stories and he
called me to get it to make sure my smokes could get there in the shortest time
possible. We also had a nice talk concerning smokes! It is so pleasent to trust
and not get burned in this day and age. Thanks JW!</B><P>

<B>The last two boxes of cigars that I have purchased really taste green.
(Santa Rosa Toros)& (Onyx 650). My question is...will aging in my humudor tame these rascals down or am I stuck with 50 bug torches?
This is really dissapointing and I am wondering if because of the demand for premium cigars, this will be the norm.</B><P>

<B>Tom- ageing will work for some cigars and not others. My
understanding is that the fermentation process involved
with maduros precludes ageing, so, you are probably out of
luck with the Onyx 650. With the Toros, give it a try, you
have nothing to loose except a little room in you humidor.
My recollection is that Santa Rosa cigars come naked (without 
cellophane) but if they are wrapped in cello, take it off
each cigar.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Since neither are maduro wrapped, they should age nicely. There are a great many young cigars on the market these days because of supply and demand problems.  Even some of the premium cigars are not aged as long as they usually are under normal market conditions.  Put them away and be patient.  You'll be rewarded in about six to eight months.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Sorry, my mistake.  I thought they were  colorado wrapped.  If they're maduros, then putting them in a humidor will keep them smokeable, but will not age them. As I stated earlier, maduros typcially do not age well because of the fermentation process used to achieve the maduro characteristic.</B><P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Greg, on the jar these cigar's come in there is
a label that tells the story of these cigars. I don't remember what it
said but I do remember the shop owner telling me to look at them and they
felt like a loaf of bread...they were very moist and rough looking. I should
of bought one then so I think I will tomorrow. I also remember that they
were very expensive, from 8.00 to 20.00. for that price castro himself
should have rolled them......:)</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Thanks, roper. These cigars I got came in a very
thick &amp; heavy box. They are the size of robustos and cost $11.50. I
would appreciate any other feedback or knowledge anyone else has.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>A friend of mine gave me one the other day and
we smoked them together. They were about the size of a corona gorda and
I believe he bought them for around $15 a piece. I have never had a cuban
cigar before, but if I were to guess what one was like it would be exactly
like this bad boy! I would certainly believe it was cuban. It seemed very
strong to me but not overwhelming. I personally cannot justify spending
that kind of money on a cigar, but would recommend to anyone who does to
try it.</B></P>

The flavor was o.k. - a little mild; not really like a cuban at all. I

on size.</B></P>

is they were rolled from a old and unwanted crop. bcuz they are not refined
like a vintage cigar should.</B></P>

<H2>Green Spots</H2>

<P><B>A thread below mentioned 'green spots'. I've been meaning to write
here and ask about them. I recently bought some cigars with green spots.
I didn't like the cigar so I'm bringing them back, but, I wondered what
the green spots were about? Does anyone know what causes them? Someone
told me that it was due to rushing the process, but, this was second hand
information. Please let me know. </B></P>

<P>
<HR><FORM method=POST action="GreenSpots.pl"><B>The Green Spots, if they
are very dark, represent the oils in the tobacco coming to the surface.
This gives a cigar a slightly more &quot;spicy&quot; taste. Light green
spots represent harmless mold and will flake off.</B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>As I mentioned on the other thread, tobacco mold
is not a desirable trait in one's cigars. It's not an issue of taste...leaf
mold does not affect the flavor of the cigar. However, mold spots do affect
the integrity of the wrapper. Every point at whcih a mold spot appears
on a wrapper leaf represents a potential hole in the wrapper itself. The
mold causes the wrapper tobacco to under go a chemical change and weakens
it. That's why I advised smoking these cigars first and not humidifying
them any further.</B></P>

<center><h1>ONCE IN A LIFETIME CIGAR </h1><p>



<img src="../gif/150box.gif">

<h2>PARTAGAS  150 SIGNATURE SERIES</h2>

</center>

Partagas 150 Signature Series is among the most unique cigar offerings ever made.



The cigar has been developed to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Partagas

brand, developed in 1845 by Don Jaime Partagas.<p>

<ul>

<li>The exquisite Cameroon wrapper on this truly limited edition of cigars comes

from the last remaining bales of Cameroon wrappers from a crop grown 18 years ago.

Cameroon wrapper of this of this era sets the standard by which all Cameroon is

measured today.<p>



<li>A truly, limited, finite, number of cigars are being rolled. Once this

exceptional offering of cigars is gone they are gone...forever. These cigars are

destined to become collector's items and their value will appreciate through

time.<p>



<li>The unique style of packaging for these cigars has never been seen before.<p>



<ul>

<li>Each cigar is perfectly round, bundled in small lots, tied with a canvas band 

just as they are when removed from the rollers table at the factory.<p>



<li>Attached to each canvas band, a manila tag is affixed and inscribed with the

name of the cigar roller who crafted that cigar.<p>



<li>The cigars are aged an additional 4 months in cedar lined ageing vaults.<p>



<li>Each bundle of aged cigars is then placed in a unique varnished, cedar, cube

shaped box emblazoned with the famous Partagas trim. <p>



<li>Most of the Cigars will be available in assorted packs of  25, 50, or 100

count boxes.<p>



<li>Partagas 150 Signature Series cigars can be readily identified, as each cigar

has been fitted with a special celebratory Anniversary band.<p>

</ul></ul>



<center><h2>DON RAMON</h2></center><p>



The Don Ramon cigar is the flagship of the Partagas 150 Signature Series line. The

Don Ramon frontmark consists of a commemorative humidor presentation of 10, 7x52

Partagas 150 Signature Series cigars.  They have been created to celebrate Don

Ramon Cifuentes, the father of the Partagas line. The Don Ramon epitomizes the

attention to detail and care given to the crafting of each Partagas 150 Signature

Series offering. Each Don Ramon cigar is placed in an individual cedar

presentation box.  As the hinged lid is lifted an ingenious mechanism lifts each

cigar for effortless removal.  The varnished cedar outer box is shaped like a

book, fitted with a humidification device and serves as a humidor.  Like a fine

art print, a limited issue of only 1000 boxes will ever be produced.  Each box

bears a brass plaque inscribed with its individual production number, as only <area shape="rect" coords="234,1 251,160" href="c14.html">

<B>Just FYI, I went to my favorite shop the other day to buy some Opus cigars and I was alarmed at the number of them that had green spots on them. I had to search the entire box to find 6 good ones. I have seen this with Cubans but never with Opus. I was told that this because the tobacco isn't ready yet. If this true beware.
Happy Hunting,
Thomas</B><P>

<B>Speaking of Opus X, to all Atlanta residents, Edward's on Piedmont has them in.  They appeared to
be in great condition, but I wasn't ready to shell out over $15 for the torpedo, although it looked almost
mouthwatering.  Furthermore, Edward's had a vast selection of Arturo Fuentes, Partagas, tons of Macanudos.</B><P>

you're there, the guy with the reading glasses that always has a cigar in his mouth that looks
lit but you never see any smoke coming off it or from his mouth, and the guy who lights his cigar
by holding a single match right up to the end of it, sucking so hard that the match goes out, but the cigar
appears perfectly lit.  I could write a story about those characters.  Sorry to ramble.  Oh matty, the Opus X are
sitting outside the walk-in humidor, as that whole shop is kept at 70/70%.  Let me know what you try.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Give me a break, Tom!!:)  The OpusX is aged sooooooooooo loooooooooong.  Those spots sound like too much humidity in the cigar.  Check it out.

Opus X will not be distributed on the west coast, which I know

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I went down to the smoke shop and asked the guy about OPUS X. He said that Robert Mondavi, the wine maker, has a wine by the same name that is distributed in the west. Due to trademark and other BS, Mondavi is challenging Fuente to make sure they do not sell a smoke with the OPUS X name anywhere in the vicinity of his wine. Can't we all just get along???</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Michael,  I did some research on your theory about the humidity causing the green spots and I don't think that's it. I was told that due to the HUGE demand put one these manufactures to put out these cigars that are not aging them as long as they would normally. And this is what causing the green spots. These are not my words these are from a rep out of Miami. Also, Opus is not shipped across the Mississippi due to the lack of supply (400-500K per/year made). I read this in one of the trade magazines, If the demand for cigars dropped to zero the industry would take about 2-3 years to catch up with the back-orders.
Thanks,
Thomas</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I read an artical in C.A. which stated that the fuente company didnt allow cases of
opusx to be sold to the public in order to keep supply avaible with out having to rush
the ageing process. i think fuente knows that it has a great cigar(better than most 
cubans i've smoked)and it won't risk it's reputation of their premier cigar with under
ageing. i live in southern delaware where i can get them pretty cheap.i love em</B><P>

You may (or may not) have a "real" Cuban Cohiba.  There are many knockoffs being sold (even in Cuba).  There are several articles on the net about this problem.  Try searching the web for "Cohiba" and see if you find the article.  I will be glad to help you determine the authenticity of your box.  If these are indeed real Cohibas, I would be glad to trade you for a few with some of my Opus X or other  Arturo Fuente cigars.

You may (or may not) have a "real" Cuban Cohiba.  There are many knockoffs being sold (even in Cuba).  There are several articles on the net about this problem.  Try searching the web for "Cohiba" and see if you find the article.  I will be glad to help you determine the authenticity of your box.  If these are indeed real Cohibas, I would be glad to trade you for a few with some of my Opus X or other  Arturo Fuente cigars.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Examine the wrapper very carefully. It should say "Cohiba"
in black on a white rectangle set on a background with a golden-yellow
bottom half and a top half of black set with small white squares
which are in a symmetrical grid pattern. Below the Cohiba text
on the gold it should say " La Habana, Cuba" in thin black stylized cursive
lettering. On the side of the black not cut by the white rectangle where it says Cohiba, the white squares should be in four horizontal rows. On the side that is cut by the Cohiba lettering, there are two rows, visible above
the Cohiba sign. I am still researching the packaging, but even the band
can be a definite sign of counterfeiting- IF it is the incorrect band. If it's the correct one,
there are still other points to check. Ask around.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The cigar will tell you when it is properly hydrated.  Meaning roll it through your fingers and listen for crinkling of the wrapper.  If the crinkle noise is that of a piece of paper the cigar is too dry.  If it is seilent then it is too wet.  You can't just buy a humidor put your cigars in and expect them to be perfect.  Humidification is an art just as smoking a cigar is an art.  It takes patients and a lot of work to get your humidor to that perfect 70/70.  As drew stated, wait until your humidor is stable before placing your cigars in.  Hope this helps.</B><P>

My supply of cigars had been stored in an air tight can for about
3 months.  A small Credo unit along with a wet sponge was used

I loaded the new humidor and followed the instructions for
setting the hygrometer, (wrapping it in a wet cloth for a half
hour and setting it to 95-98%.  After four days, the reading

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Here are some good gudelines when it comes to cello and storage.  If the cigars you are going to store are all the same brand, you can take the cello off without worry.  If you have mixed brands in the same humidor, the cello will allow the different cigars to retain their distinct flavors.  The "proper" way to store mixed cigars is to remove the cello and separate the smokes with spanish cedar.</B><P>

<HR><FORM method=POST action="UnevenBurn.pl"><B>Put the bad part thats
not burning on the bottum as you smoke. There is less air at the top, and
the cigar won't even up by being up there where theres less air. Give it
some time on the bottum but if it doesn't even up, light a match or whatever
and just touch the uneven part with the flame while you use a very slight
draw. This will usually cause the slow part to catch a little better. I've
always wondered why this happens. Is it the lightup? Something in the binder?
Anyway, thats how I get the problem fix'd and it works for me. I hope you
get a response with something better because I always hate to do this.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Thanks AL- I've tried the same thing, sometimes
it works. I have noticed that when I light the slow area,often smoke curls
out of numerous tiny pin-prick holes. Maybe these tiny holes in the wrapper
are causing the run due to reduced draw or less air.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Buzz, sometimes wetting the side which is burning
too fast will work. I also find some cigars seem to be self-correcting.
If you don't puff on them too hard and let them burn a little bit, they
get back on track. It's one of those marvelous mysteries. (g)</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>My solution might sound a little gross, but it
works. Runs are usually caused by imperfections in the tobacco (stems,
weak spots, etc),rolling process (too loose, air gaps, etc.), or poor lighting
technique. In any case, the best way I've found to correct the uneven burn
is to continually wet the fast burning portion of the cigar. I moisten
my finger with a little spit and continually dab in between draws until
it evens out. This works fine, except in social functions. I've dabbed
my finger in ice water, beer, and scotch so as not to look like a stoner
rolling a doobie in public. Saliva seems to work the best though. The consistency
allows it to stick to the wrapper as opposed to running off the side. I
told you it might get gross! I don't burn the excess tobacco. It seems
to give the rest of the cigar a &quot;torched&quot; flavor. And because
you still have to draw, you can make the run even worse. I say use spit...a
little gross, but effective.</B></P>

<B>I tend to find this happens only when I smoke large-ring stogies.  However, I 
learned a different method.  It's called toasting your cigar.  Before you light it the first
time, without puffing on it, put your lighter up to the very end and rotate the cigar until there is a
black ring all around the very end.  Then, light it as you normally would.  You're guaranteed an even
burn.  If it starts to burn unevenly, lightly toast the non-burning side.  Chances are, you'll get the wrapper
hot enough to burn.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Thats good advice Mongo. You have to start them the right
way. It's true that this tends to happen with the larger
ring gauges. Unfortunately I mostly smoke larger ring gauges.
I find that the new Blazer microtorch, if used properly, offers
pinpoint burning to even out the burn. Also, I have been told
that if you toast the end, remember to lightly blow out
through the cigar before the main light so as to remove any
charred flavor.Who knows if it is necessary, but with the
price of cigars, it can't hurt.</B><P>

<center><font size=5><b>LIGHTING AND RELIGHTING THE CIGAR</b></font><p>by Dale Scott</center><p>
<br clear=all>
<BR>
     Non-cigar smokers often refer to the "ritual" of lighting a cigar.  They may view the process of bringing the leaf to life as merely a stylized ceremony, repeated so often the reasons for it are forgotten.<P>
     They're wrong.  The time, care and techniques you use to light the cigar are <I><B>crucial</B></I> to the entire smoke.  You can really blow it here, or you can set the stage for real smoking pleasure.  <BR>
     There are three important cautions when lighting a cigar:<P>
<BR>
     1.     DON'T POISON THE TOBACCO WITH THE FLAME<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>     If you introduce a bad taste at the cigar's foot, you'll draw it down the entire length of the filler as you puff on it.  This taints the delicate taste of the tobacco, so it's important to not contaminate the tobacco during the lighting process.  To illustrate, in the current movie thriller <I>Crimson Tide</I>, premium cigars not only are a visual prop, but star Gene Hackman verbalizes his homage to one.  Then, he thumbs the wheel on a Zippo lighter and buries the foot of his <I>puro</I> in a ball of petroleum flame.  How many movie-going cigar fledglings will follow his example, only to wonder why their cigars taste like kerosene?  <I><B>Never </B></I>use fluid-type lighters.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL><DL><DD></DL></DL><BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>Butane </I></B>is a tasteless, odorless fuel, perfectly suited as a lighter medium. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>     <I><B>Wooden matches </B></I>are acceptable, but the woods they make them from don't burn as cleanly as butane.  Wait until the head is consumed totally, because its phosphorus taste can poison a cigar.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>     <I><B>Paper matches </I></B>are virtually useless because they don't burn long enough to get the foot going.  Every time one goes out, the cigar foot cools down again.  So, you hurry the process by sticking the match on the end of the cigar and puffing on it impatiently &#139; just what you shouldn't do!</BLOCKQUOTE>
 <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>     <B><I>Candles</I></B> don't work, either.  It may look cosmopolitan to have some elegant lady hold out a four
passenger candelabra to fire up your after-dinner treat, but the paraffin ruins the taste.  Besides, while both of you are focussing on lighting the cigar, the other three candles are dripping hot juice in your espresso, your cherries jubilee, and your lap.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>     <B><I>Cedar slivers</B></I> &#139; Purists light their cigars with a sliver of cedar from the cigar box, called a "spill."  Only use a spill if it is solid cedar, not cedar plywood.  In the latter, the glue that bonds the inner layer of wood between the outer layers of cedar can impart a bad taste.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<DL><DD>2.DON'T SOOT THE CIGAR.<P>
<DL><DD>Do <I><B>not </B></I>put the end of an open-footed cigar in the flame and puff it to life.  You'll char the filler tobacco, drawing the sooty taste through the length of the cigar.  Instead, hold the cigar in one hand &#139; not in your mouth &#139; so you can see what's happening at the cigar's foot.  Angle the cigar foot about 30&#176; below horizontal, but no more.  IF you point the cigar down too steeply, the flame will run up the sides of the barrel and char the wrapper.<P>
<DD>Keep the flame <I><B>small</I></B> &#139; about 3/8" to 1/2" high.  Hold the flame tip about 1/4" below the lower <I><B>rim</I></B> of the foot.  Rotate the cigar slo-o-owly to just <I><B>toast</I></B> the rim.  As each segment of the rim catches, you'll see a tiny wisp of smoke curling up and the rim starting to turn gray.  More important than the wrapper, you're igniting the binder &#139; the cigar's fuse &#139; which will carry the flame front down the cigar's length.  Be careful the tip of the flame doesn't char the wrapper!<P>
<DD>This will take longer than one match's length.  This is why butane lighters are preferable, especially if they are the kind you don't have to hold a button down on to keep going.  <P>
<DD>This careful lighting is another reason to smoke indoors: the wind, however light, causes the flame to dance around erratically, making the lighting unpredictable.</DL></DL><P>
     3.     MAKE CERTAIN THE ENTIRE RIM OF THE FOOT IS LIT.<P>
<DL><DL><DD>If it isn't, the cigar will burn unevenly.  So, when you see the ash encircling the rim, watch it to make sure the entire rim is burning and the coal is progressing inward toward the center of the foot.  It's OK to <B><I>gently</I> </B>blow on the foot to accelerate things.  Wait the full minute or longer, until the <B><I>entire</B></I> face of the foot is gray ash.  Be patient.<P>
<DD>When the end is completely lit, <I><B>don't puff in on it yet!</I></B>  Instead, blow lightly into it once, to expel even the slightest of contaminating fumes out the foot.  If you must puff on it afterwards to get it going, use several little puffs in quick succession, not big ones.<BR>
     </DL></DL><P>
RELIGHTING THE CIGAR<P>
     Winston Churchill was one of the better-known cigar lovers of the twentieth century, smoking 15-18 large Havanas a day.  He even holds one in his world-famous bronze statue.  Churchill once intoned, in that flat bulldog growl of his, "A good cigar should be lit but once &#139; a bad cigar, nevah!"<P>
     But a cigar that goes out completely, or one that burns unevenly down one side can indeed be relit with satisfactory results, if done right.  The trick is to bring it to life again without poisoning it with that dead cigar-butt taste.  To do so, you must heat the cold soot back up to temperature to drive off the volatile, evil-tasting components in it.<P>
     Don't put a light to it and puff it to life, for the reasons in the previous section.  Instead, coax <B><I>all</B></I> the loose ash out and heat the wrapper rim until the gray ring tells you it's lit all around.  Remember, a cigar dies at its periphery first &#139; often, the center of the filler is still burning.  You want to slowly <I><B>heat</I></B> the binder back to ignition again.  Thus, the fire will burn inward, merging with the live central coal, and you can resume smoking.  But like the initial cigar lighting, don't hurry the process.<P>
     A cigar that continues to burn down one side and which requires frequent relighting, was rolled improperly and can't be saved.  Likewise, don't bother to relight a cigar that has been out for an hour or longer.  Sometimes nothing can resurrect the dead.<P>

<h2>
<CENTER>The Great Cigar Comeback Is On in Private Clubs</CENTER></h2><P>
<p><CENTER><img src=comeback.gif></CENTER>
<p><blockquote>Several years ago, the private club at 16 Gramery Park in New York City known simply as 
The Players stopped selling cigars. "We just don't get any call for them anymore," said a 
somewhat baffled bartender.<br>
Times have changed at The Players, because cigars are very much at home again in the house 
that once belonged to the great actor Edwin Booth, one of the most illustrious Players of all time.
Meanwhile, many other private clubs across the country are also experiencing upward trends in requests 
for cigars with Macanudo and Partagas clearly leading the way.<br>
Last year in New York City, the largest increases were at the New York Yacht Club, where requests 
for cigars doubled, and at the University Club and the Metoroplitan Club, which reported double-digit 
increases. As for two of the most famous Ivy League establishments in Manhattan, the Harvard Club 
recently emulated the arch-rival Yale Club, which has been known to host an affair or two for cigar 
smokers, by holding a cigar night of its own for some 70 delighted smokers.<br>
Cigars are doing equally well in some of the more renowned clubs on both coasts. Club 19, the 
19th-hole oasis at Pebble Beach Golf Club in California, does a very brisk business. And the Doral 
Golf Club & Spa in Miami is selling "a lot more" cigars than ever before. As one anonymous general 
manager of an elite west-coast club explained, "Cigars aren't just a trendy thing to do. If you 
keep offering people better and better quality and selection, they're going to go for it."<br>
And if we needed further evidence that private clubs and premium cigars go together, the man in 
charge of cigars at the Harmonie Club in Manhattan told us that "Enjoying a fine cigar is like the 
definition of a club."<br>
Elsewhere around the country and beyond, the number of cigar clubs increased during the past 
few years to the point where, in 1994, an informal organization called the International Association 
of Cigar Clubs was formed to keep track of them. In the words of Founder & Chief Smoking Officer 
Robert Langsam, IACC is a "for-the-smoker, by-the-smoker network" with only one motive: to generate 
good will among cigar lovers. To do so, IACC lets cigar lovers know where their peers are and 
provides assistance and support for existing clubs as well as clubs yet to be originated.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The problem I have with alcohol enhanced cigars is that the tend to burn a little hotter, and consequently, tend towards the bitter side as they finish.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Bill,  I smoked the El Incomparible last night. If I could have kept it lit, I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more. This cigar is flavored with Single Malt Springbank. Not a bad cigar, just not all that memorable. I have to agree with MP, it burned hot, and ashed funny. Im goingto hold off on the El Sublimado. My shop will have more soon if anyone would be interested. Ill trade one for an Opus.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Obnoxio-
     Forget the single malt Incomparable and just smoke the el sublimados, but I can guarantee that you will end up springing the bucks for a few more.  Istarted with one and now I've three on my hands.  The key to enjoying it though is to alot yourself enough time to enjoy the full smoke.  It does get costly especially for me (I'm 19.), but trust me you can't put a price on such a pleasure.  Happy puffing and get back to me!</B><P>

My requested I buy some for the humidor as she thought the aroma in the den was the best she had experienced.  I wouldn't want a steady diet of them but I'll keep some around.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>This whole cigar line is a marketing gimmick - the notion of the cigar being "dipped" or "marinated" in aged brandy.  Get real.  The cigars themselves are only mediocre to start w/ before they are dipped.  Buy some cheaper $2-$5 cigars and dip them yourself if that is what you are into.  The next day, try smoking it.  Typically, the brandy smokes hot and the residual sugar (brandy is grape-based, like wine) tends to cause the cigar wrapper to taste sweet.  Please, guys, it is not an $11 cigar.  </B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Iwas not real impressed with the Sublimado. It gave me a headache, I smoked the Churchill. I might try a smaller one, but I agree with martin, its not an 11.00 cigar. Just my opinion.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I am one happy guy when it comes to JR. Since I live in NC, I get the smokes by the next day. I have never had any trouble with them. Its the huge cigar boom that has put them up against a wall, and they refuse to pay the huge prices for the so-called premium brands. That is most likely why they dont have any of your favorite name brands. Next time you call, ask to try one of his name-brand comparibles.  You never know what surprises Lew might have.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I too have had great success with JR.  Although sometimes
they are out of stock of a lot of brands.  Ny trick is to
not order what I don't really want and to then keep calling
back a couple of times week, eventually everything you could possibly
want is available.  When you get it you know you paid a fair
price for it.  Just keep trying.  </B><P>

<B>My cigar supplier received a letter from Carlos Fuente Jr., which stated there may be some problems with the OpusX name.  Apparently, there is a California wine venture (Robert Mondavi is one of the vineyards) which has used the name Opus One for some time.  They are asking Fuente to cease and desist from using the name OpusX, even though it has been trademarked.  If they had to stop using the name, how much impact do you think there would be on the brand?  I think they'd have to spend a lot of money on promotion.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The key is substantiation.  In my legal opinion, the vinard cannot have Opus X change their name for a variety of reasons.  In the last 5 years, we've seen an explosion in trademark litigation.  The problem is, we have too many products and too few original names.  Unless the names are identical, or the products are "competing", most federal courts rule that a previously granted trademark cannot be overturned.  the burden is on the plaintiff to prove:  1.  The similarity of the names  2.  The timing of the trademarks  3.  No previous knowledge of the trademark being sought  and 4.  Actual damages.  I think that the vinard will have trouble proving "actual damages".  What do you think Smoke?</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>fuente, you are somewhat offbase on a few of your points.  First of all, in order for trademark infringment to occur, the marks in question do not have to be "identical," just confusingly similar.  Do you think you could open a restaurant and call it MacDonalds and not get sued?  Second, while the products in question (cigars v. wine) do not appear "competing," they are associated.  Many people complement a fine glass of wine with a fine cigar.  These products sometimes even appear in the same channels of trade, such as liquor stores which sell both cigars and wine.  If Mondavi indeed was the first to use the mark Opus, they could argue that they have the right to expand the use of the name Opus to similar products such as wine glasses, cheeses, and even cigars.  At this point there probably are no real "damages" to Mondavi's trademark, but they certainly may be able to stop the Fuente's from using the Opus name for cigars.  As we all know, you can never guess how a court will rule, but at this juncture, hopefully the parties involved can work out an agreement before it goes to court, such as requiring the Fuente's to always refer to this line of cigars as Arturo Fuentes Opus X and not just Opus X which may help to eliminate any confusion as to the origin of the cigars.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Interesting topic guys!  I have to side with Fuente on this one.  The word "Opus" has been traditionaly used to name specific pieces of music.  There is no patent infringement if someone chooses to name their work an Opus (as in Mr. Holland's Opus).  The Bloom County comic strip has a character named Opus.  There are two Chamber music ensambles I know of that use the name Opus.  The reason Mondavi vineyards does not sue these people or vice versa is because they represent dissimilar products.  I think these examples set pressident and should hold true with cigars and wine.  Also, if Mondavi has named a wine Opus #1, Opus #10 is still available.  The name Opus X is pronounced and known as Opus "X", as in the letter, not the number 10.  If Fuente is sued and loses, I say he renames the cigar Monda "V".</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Pauly, please do not confuse patent infringement with trademark infringement -- patents protect inventions trademarks protect names.  Also, "opus" when used in the context of music, is a generic word which means "a musical composition or set of compositions usually numbered in the order of its issue."  Mondavi cannot sue for use of the name "opus" in its generic form.  As for Bloom County, you are correct in your reasoning that a comic strip character is far removed from wine and even cigars.  However, I do not believe that Bloom County is using the name "Opus" as a trademark as it merely refers to the name of a character and is not used to identify products or services which are offered for sale.  As for the arguement that someone should be able to use "Opus" and any other number besides Mondavi's "One," I think you would have problems selling a perfume called Channel 10 or a plane called 787 or opening a convenience store called 7-12. As for the differences in X and Ten, they can mean the same and a trademark owner can stop the use of a mark which translates to the owners mark.  Two examples are EL GALLO for wine v. THE ROOSTER for tabacco and SUN for footwear vs. EL SOL for clothing.  In both cases, the courts ruled that trademark infringement had occured since the marks are identical when translated and the goods are similar.  Should be interesting to see what happens, however, I agree with Smoke that this will be settled at the table instead of the courtroom.  </B><P>

Which is admittedly my mistake in understanding law.  Even so, I think Fuente should prevail.  How 'bout we leave it up to a "Jury" vote?  For the rest of you, two questions:  Who *should* and who *will* prevail?  Mondavi or Fuente?</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>What do you mean by prevail?  Who will remain the name, or Who will get a healthy sum for the use of there trademarked initials?  If Mondavi does go to the courts it all depends on who owned the trademark first.  I'm not familiar with Opus 1.  I don't drink wine often enough to care about a name brand.  I do however enjoy an Opus X on occasion.  Ot will be a relief, if Opus1 and OpusX can live in unisom, when this whole episode is over.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I had a Puros Indios Toro this past weekend while watching football.  It was so bad that I only smoked about half of it, put it out, and unrolled it to see if someone had replaced the filler tobacco with automobile upholstery.  You guys have been raging about this one for quite a while and thought myself lucky when I saw them for $6.50 each.  The quality seemed to be fine, but the taste seemed to be reminiscent of the nasty Don Tomas Toro I tried in SF.  I'm seriously beginning to think I don't enjoy "stronger" cigars.  Let's see...I don't like Puros Indios...don't like Cubans...HATE Don Tomas.  Any other of this genre that you guys think I wouldn't like?

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Before age stripped the cover off the body I wear...Saab's were my life.  From the 3 cylinder types to the last model I owned before I moved on to different autos which was like Obnoxio a '78 EMS Turbo.  Those were truely the days. I recently opened my mind to help my oldest son rework a 1975 Honda Civic.  It is a real sleeper...we took it to an auto-cross and we both drove it hard...it put us away wet.  Needless to say, the drivers of the other cars were better than us but everyone agreed that their was no faster car on the course.  Someday we'll learn to control the beast we created.   </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Chillie....the M5 is really a super auto much more so than our 78 SAAB's. I've swayed to the farthest end of auto's 91 Towncar and 93 Grand Caravan, two boats that could only give Hanz-the-gardener a stiffy.  But on a 17 hour trip they do the trick. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I had no idea how many people suffered through the 99 Turbo. Great car, nice road manners, but when you need to do somthing simple, like an oil change, the car was a mean bastard. I have a 1991 Jetta GT Coupe. I have done too many modifications on this car to list, but it goes like stink now. That M5 is an awesome ride. Did you know about the refund on that car? Some lawsuit about it I read somwhere for the original owners. Check into it, you could get yourself a couple of bucks.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I read about it in European Car Mag. I think the suit was as follows: The M5 was supposed to be a very limited edition car, and when they first came out alot of BMW fanatics put up alot of money for the cars. 6 months later BMW dropped the price on the car and started building them like crazy, thus changing the value of the car. If you are an original owner of the car, I believe you can contact BMW of North America for mor info.   On the Jag, be careful. It really depends on what year the car is. If it is a mid to late 80's model, they had alot of quality control problems. My aunt purchased a 81 XJ Vanden Plas. It caught on fire the third week she had it, and was a total loss. Im very leery about British Cars, especially with Lucas electronics. If you can find a good M5, jump on it.</B><P>

I'm on my second Wrangler, and it is by far the best vehicle I've ever owned, and it had some pretty good competition.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Love cars!  Love 'em, love 'em, love 'em.  I've got a '70 Mustang Fastback that's in mid-restoration (since 1986!!!).  Owned it since I picked it up back in the USAF in Alabama in '77.  But I miss my old Fiat 124 Sport Coupe.  Alpha Giullietta Coupe is another old beauty. Classic lines.  But, my favorite is an early Pantera (pre-GTX days).  Yellow with a nice 351 Cleveland purring over your shoulder! Recently built and sold a Cobra replica.  Fun, but almost got divorced over the damn thing. Bad timing with two new kids.  Any other kit car enthusiast? Or if anyone is getting ready to buy/build one, let me know!! I can help you avoid all the perils. And believe me, if you think you've got them all covered, forget it.  There are plenty more to bite you in the ass.  After the kids graduate (2018 or so!!!) I might build another.  Dream car...1933 Packard Roadster.  How 'bout the new Prowler from Chrysler?  Who is going to buy one without a TOP?  OOOHHHH!! ALmost forgot the new Viper Coupe.  Now THAT is a car.  Probably closer to the Cobra Daytona Coupe than the original Viper was to the Cobra.  Lucky Leno!!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The I-30 is an outstanding car. It is refined, luxurious, dependable, and economical. I have a pearl white color with tan leather interior and burled walnut trim. It comes equipped with a Bose 200 watt am/fm/cassette/cd 6 speaker sound system. An 8-disc cd changer is optional.It has an excellent climate control center,power seats with lumbar support and heated seats.Tilt steering, cruise control, power sunroof, map lights , dome light, automatically adjusting rear-view mirror , built in garage door opener and house lighting controls (in the visor)auto alarm system with a remote control that lets you do a variety of things such as rolling the windows down etc.Lighted ignition switch,tachometer, oil gauge , temperature gauge, overdrive,trunk access through the back seat (armrest). I could go on and on about the little things this car has but the most important thing is the " Total Ownership Experiance".They treat you like a god when you take your Infiniti in for any kind of service! I mean ROUTINE service like oil changes and such, because thats all I've ever needed! They give you another Infiniti to drive even if it's just for an hour. The service plan for the Infiniti is the best! The car is absolutely beautiful and always turns heads. I see the longing in peoples eyes as they look at my Infiniti. Some people might prefer a Lexus but for my money , it's INFINITI!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Well, I have to say that the absolute best car, that I cannot see without
drooling over, would have to be the Ford Shelby Cobra 427.  I have vowed that 
within ten years of my college graduation, I will own one.  It has the pickup
of a Dodge Viper, the cornering ability of a Nissan 300ZX, and is classier to
drive than anything on the road, possibly even a '53 Vette, due to the Cobra's
rarity.  I like most cars, but none have the same effect on my.  That said, I
also like MG Midgets, the Triumph Spitfire, Fiats, and the Mazda Miata.  At 6'5",
I don't know why I love small cars, but I do.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Mongo - Forget buying the Cobra.  At 6' 5" you won't even fit in one!  Original or replica, unless it's a stretched one.  The tallest person to fit comfortably in an original or authentic replica is only about 5'-10" to 6' max.  Some replicas have been made to accomodate a taller frame, but are not as attractive IMHO!  We are, Penn State!!!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>My favorite cars are (in no particular order):  1957 Chevrolet,
1970 Chevelle SS 396, 1967 Mustang, and the 1958 'vette.
I drive a '95 Toyota Tacoma in 4WD since I like to get off

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>There seems to be a lack of postings regarding Porsches, so I'll put in my little bit for the car I love.  Although I've never owned my own, I've had the pleasure of driving a number of different Porsches over the last few years (including the new Boxster) and have been thouroghly impressed with each of them.  In the world of high performance automobiles, I beleive there is no substitute for this fine piece of German engineering.  
It's also nice to see that there are a few out there who appreciate SUV's.  I only hope that your appreciation takes you off the beaten path.  It still bugs me to know that 90% of the SUV's sold never get taken off-road.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Feex- to tell you the truth, I don't care.  I WILL fit in that car.  But actually, I've
heard of some that are quite large.  For example, on replica company makes them 2 inches
wider in the back than a Lincoln Towncar.  I know I could not fit in an original,
but the reason I want a replica is to take advantage of all the technological improvements
since then, but still drive a Cobra.  But mark my words- If I have to pay extra to have it
specially lengthened, I will do so.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Speaking of Beetles... I bought a '72 convertible after I graduated college, and another 'vert as soon as I wrecked the first one.  Unfortunately, #2 fell apart on me before I could get around to restoring it.  Great fun to drive!  Just wish they had used better sheet metal...  I can only dream of a '67 GTO convertible;  a mid-60's Galaxie, Fury or Impala is (hopefully) in the cards within a few years.  Right now, I'm thinking about buying a Nomad to use as a driver, (and accommodate all the baby paraphernalia my 14-month old requires)  if I can find one that won't break my meager bank.

believe it to have the nicest interior, back-seat ( hee,hee! ) excluded,
of any expensive GT. However, I'd like to see a V8, with overhead cams,
possibly turbos, and titanium rods. They could take an example from the
new Lotus Esprit V8, a fine-performing car. Also, it is too heavy. But as a 
Gran Turismo, the car is sleek and femininely pretty.</B><P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Wasn't that question from the movie SMOKE. It
goes something like you weigh the cigar before you light it. While smoking
it you place all of the ashes in a tray. You then weigh the whatever is
left of the cigar plus the ashes that are in the tray. The difference is
the weight of the smoke. Pretty cool!</B></P>

fields and factory, D) To identify the roller responsible for that cigar,
or E) fortunes used to be written on the underside, since the cubans couldn't
figure out how to make fortune cookies?</B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The answer is &quot;A&quot;. Actually, it was
to protect ladies' fingers (not necessarily mens') when smoking. Once upon
a time, many women were avid cigar smokers as well.</B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>C2 is sorta correct as well. After cigars started
to be banded, the companies realized it would be easy advertising. But
the finger protection came first.</B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Unfortunately, Bobby K is not a winner this time.
The cigar band was originally created by a Dutchman ( whose name slips
my mind at this point) simply to distinguish his cigars from the others
on the market. The protectio of ladies' fingers' was a myth that was perpetuated
by the wives of the russian czars who indulged in cigars and found the
band ( which was already there) to be a much easier way of holding their
smokes.</B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>OK. Try this one on for size. Tobacco seeds are
relative in size to: A) Poppy seeds; B) Sunflower seeds; C) Pumpkin seeds;
D) None of the above because tobacco can't be cultivated from seeds. They
have bulbs like other flowers.</B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Well hell. There hasn't been a unanimous answer
to a single question I've asked. I had heard bobbyK's answer, about the
band protecting fingers from getting stained. Makes me wonder what was
going on with their tobacco that stained their fingers. I like Pauly's
question, but you forgot to include the humorous answer. I'll go with A.
on yours, but I really am making an educated guess.</B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>As far as the band question, &quot;A&quot; is
the correct answer. The reason the cigars stained the White Gloves of Gentleman
was because the wrapper was nowhere near as perfect as the wrapper of today.
The manufactures of that time dipped the cigars in a tobacco dust paste
to make them visually more appealing.</B></P>

<B>I guess this is one for General Cigar's QC Dept. I had a call yesterday from a shop clerk who had found a box of Partagas Aristocrats in his inventory. He called me long distance to see if I still wanted them.  Sadly, I have spent what I will right now. So I contacted a friend in San Antonio who I met on the ASC newsgroup; he likes Partagas' too. I just got an e-mail from him saying the box was mis-labeled. One side said #4 and one side said Aristocrat. Inside were #4's. He almost bought the box just as a collectors item.  I'm glad I didn't drive 2 hours to go pick them up. I've got #4's. What's up GC?</B><P>

<B>With so many new "fresh" cigars today, how long should they be aged prior to smoking?</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by gupfish at <p></FONT></TT>
<hr>
<form method=POST action="Helponaging.pl">
<B>That's sort of hard to answer.  For the last year or so, I've been buying cigars that
I intend to save 4-6 months.  So now I'm smoking cigars that I purchased in the Spring.  This may
be overkill, but I'd rather play it safe.  Of course there are times when I'm craving a certain
cigar and don't wait.  With all the money to be made right now in cigars, I wouldn't be suprised if
companies are shipping them without aging them long enough.  Especially some of the newer brands.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Cigars are very much like fine wines.  Some age better than others.  Maduros typically don't age well because the wrapper's maturation was deliberately arrested during the fermentation process, so, normally, they can be smoked without significant aging.  However, for the best advice, I always ask my tobacconist.</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by Peter at saitta@msn.com on Saturday, December 07 at 10:22 AM EST<p></FONT></TT>
<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Drew and Peter are right when they say there are no hard 
and fast rules.  I believe that Connecticut wrappers in 
general don't age as well as Cameroon or Indonesian, although
I have several boxes of Excalibur #1s that are two years old
and are terrific.  I don't think you'll go wrong if
you age all your cigars for at least six months before
smoking.</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by Tim at  on Monday, December 09 at 05:04 PM EST<p></FONT></TT>
<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>There is a good article on aging cigars in the online version ofthe latset SMOKE Magazine. http://www.smokemag.com/</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by MP at  on Wednesday, December 18 at 12:20 PM EST<p></FONT></TT>
<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Read "Components of Fire" from SMOKE's Summer issue if you can find it for helpful
explanations of the aging process. I am no expert on this, but I generally go by the cigar itself.
Certain cigars I receive have already been well-aged and kept
properly humid for long enough that I could smoke them any time. When you
receive new cigars that have been dated within recent months, I'd say to lay off
them for a couple of seasons. For instance, I received a "green"
Cohiba Siglo IV that was obviously young, and made the mistake of smoking it atr my next party.
If I had let it alone for six months, it would have matured more nicely. But ask an expert for a definative answer.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I just picked up a box of Don Carlos #3s.  From what I have
heard the filler is 12 years old already. So is it safe to
ASSuME they can be smoke right away?  My problem is there
NO room left in my humidor for them.  Should I remove some
of the other cigars and make room for the DCs or continue 
to store them in my iglodor and smoke one at a time from 
the box?  If I do remove them from their box I see no 
positive reason to remove the cello as they are aged already
, right?  </B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Cigars are NOT like wine.  They  no longer age or mature once
they have been shipped in there boxes.  The tobacco leaves
are fermented over a long period of time to achieve the 
perfect flavors the manufactures specifications.  The cigars
are allowed to rest after rolling to allow the flavors to
marry to each other, but no further aging takes place.
Take a read of The Cigar Insider, December, 1997 issue.
They have some great articles about the same.</B><P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Timmy, this is a discussion area for cigar enthusiasts.
Children shouldn't be hanging around here, nor should they be allowed unsupervised
access to the Internet. There are several chat rooms that cater to children.
I'm sure you will find some that are to your liking. If/when you ever grow
up, and you discover fine cigars, you are welcome to enter into discussions
provided you maintain a civil level of maturity. I guess we'll see you
in about ten or fifteen years.</B></P>

<B>To Joe:  There is not "set price" per se on authentic cuban cigars.  However, there is a suggested retail price from the distributors to the retailers in Europe, Canada, Mexico, etc.  Typically, La Flor de Cano are much cheaper than Cohibas or HdM's, etc.  Any Cuban retailer can set his/her own prices but there is, indeed, a common thread throughout the price structure of premium cuban handmade cigars.</B><P>

<B>I finally made the big move and spent alot of $$$ on a good quality humidor
which holds about 60-80 of my favorite smokes,  it took a while for the 
humidity level to even out in there but now its at a perfect 70%.
the problem is that the cedar has swelled up on one side and it no longer closes
flush.  its been about a month, the tobacconist has "assured" me that
it should even out soon.  Is this normal?  I really dont want to bring it back
but.....HELP!</B><P>

<B>Yikes.  Trust your tobacconist if you have reason to.  Your problem
is one of the reasons I don't agree with spraying the inside of a humidor
with distilled water.  Wood does warp, and if you're not careful you could get
too much water in it.  I don't know what to say.  Good luck.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The wood will swell a little, but now enough to "not close". I have one that gets tight when the outside humidity changes, but not enough to not be functional. Good luck!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Also, if you have dividers that pressure fit into the box
they could be bowing out the cedar lining preventing the 
lid from shuting the whole way. To check, take out the 
dividers and see if the lid shuts. This happened to me.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>icone420 (cool name), I went thru this also.  If you spent
big $$$ take it back.  A good builder; eg, Daniel Marshall,
Elle Bleu, etc., would have taken this into consideration.
If your humidor isn't closing and you have $$$ worth of your
best cigars in it it is doing about as much good as "Tupperware!"
Much cheaper.  TAKE IT BACK!</B><P>

box of Coronas del Ritz out to Spade.</FONT></B> <BR>
<ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=+1><B>-</B>Dashiell Hammett</FONT><BR>
</P></CENTER>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P><B>Samuel Spade took a cigar, trimmed the end, and lighted it. Caspar
Gutman was a man who would tell you right out that he was a man who liked
to talk to a man who liked to talk.</B></P>

<P><B>That was swell, said the private detective. Would they talk about
the black bird?</B></P>

<P><B>A moment later in Hammett's <I>The Maltese Falcon</I>, the 1919 private-eye
classic that has been the touchstone for every hard-boiled yarn since,
Spade blows smoke above the fat man's head in a long slanting plume and
frowns thoughtfully at the ash at the tip of his cigar. Then the talking
turns to a woman.</B></P>

<P><B>With Humphrey Bogart as Spade and the extra-portly Sydney Greenstreet
as Gutman the scene unfolds even more thrillingly in the 1940 movie. And
how fitting it is that their co-stars are a brace of double Coronas. Cigarettes
finish too soon. Pipes are both cumbersome and not in keeping with either
man's character. A discussion that ranges from a fabulous jeweled statuette
of a bird to a dangerous, double-dealing woman requires something formidable,
long lasting, and conducive to some serious thought, weighty business,
and gentlemanly conversation.</B></P>

<P><B>Of course, the cigarette has enjoyed its share of dramatic moments.
There is the scene in<I> Now, Voyager</I> when Paul Henreid lights two,
one for himself and the other for Bette Davis. The love-wracked Bogart
in <I>Casablanca</I> has a cigarette in one hand a glass of whiskey in
the other while he laments to Sam, piano player and friend, that out of
all the gin joints in the world Ingrid Bergman had to walk into his. But
such instances in which the cigarette is integral to the illumination of
character have been few and far between. Although Bette Davis could wave
a cigarette and underscore her warning to guests at a party to &quot;fasten
your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night,&quot; most of the time
handling a cigarette has been a way to keep an actor's hands occupied.
In everyday life, recourse to a cigarette has been either habitual or a
method of relieving nervous tension, rather than a clue to the smoker's
inner being.</B></P>

<P><B>This rarely pertains to a pipe, which has been stereotyped in the
public's mind as symbolic of braininess, due in large measure to images
of Sherlock Holmes as he tackles complicated mysteries in books, on stage,
in the movies, and on television, and countless other images of men as
thinkersprofessors in tweedy jackets or sweaters with elbow patches; scientists
of the Albert Einstein caliber; friendly family physicians making house
calls; and concerned TV fathers of the stripes of Fred MacMurray in <I>My
Three Sons, </I>Robert Young of <I>Father Knows Best,</I> and Hugh Beaumont
as Ward Cleaver in <I>Leave It to Beaver.</I></B></P>

<P><B>Nor has the subject of this book ever been put into a man's hand
in literature or the visual media merely to serve as a prop. The cigar
has been, and is, far more symbolic. Carrying or smoking one conveys, as
noted earlier, a potent statement that can be personal, social, political,
or economic. Poet John Galsworthy was right: &quot;By the cigars they smoke,
ye shall know the texture of men's souls.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>Zino Davidoff writes of cigar smoking: &quot;Sublime moments. Precious
moments, and like the smoke that rises from the gray ash, fleeting but
unforgettable ones.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>Mentioned and quoted throughout this book, Zino Davidoff stands as
a giant in the story of cigars. He is one of the few individuals whose
names are associated with promoting excellence in making them and in setting
high standards in their marketing. His book, <I>The Connoisseur's Book
of the Cigar</I>, published in 1967, is a landmark in the literature of
the cigar. And the firm he established to sell and promote cigars still
bears his name and continues to thrive in Switzerland.</B></P>

<P><B>Born in Russia, he fell in love with cigars as a youth in his father's
shop in Kiev at the time of the Russian Revolution. His book relates how
one of his father's customers, one Vladimir Ulyanov, changed his name to
Lenin and went on to bring Communism to Russia, while leaving behind for
the Davidoffs a bill for cigars that to this day exists, stamped not paid.</B></P>

<P><B>Sent by his father to the Americas &quot;in order to learn something
about the tobacco trade,&quot; Zino spent time in Brazil discovering &quot;black
tobaccothe tobacco of cigars.&quot; From there he went to Cuba feeling
&quot;a state of anticipation a young archeologist might for Greece or
a seminarian for Rome.&quot;</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>&quot;Eventually,&quot; he remembers in his book, &quot;I knew which
were the best cigars in the worldand why.&quot;</B></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>He meant Cubans, of course. But by the time he published his book
that fair island and its tobacco growers had fallen under the heel of Castro-style
Communism and many of its most illustrious tobacco families had fled, taking
their skills elsewhere in the Americas. Yet he insists in his book that
&quot;surviving every vicissitude, a good Havana with a gold or purple
band, in its wooden box with cedar shavings, encased in its baroque splendor,
is still the master of the cigar world.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>Among Davidoff's many contributions to the world of cigars is the
humidified storage room, and he claimed to have made &quot;the first of
the humidors.&quot; In the pages of his order books one can find the names
and cigar preferences of kings, dukes, millionaires, adventurers, celebrities,
and even some &quot;beautiful women,&quot; all brought together by a common
bondthe cigar.</B></P>

<P><B>That bond continues to bring people together all over the world and
from every side of life, and in increasing numbers. Between 1992 and 1995
the covers of <I>CIGAR Aficionado</I> have featured comedian Groucho Marx,
comics Bill Cosby and George Burns, millionaire and boss of Consolidated
Cigar Ron Perelman, conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh, and movie
superstar Jack Nicholson. Other celebrities and prominent individuals of
the 1990s counted in the ranks of cigar smokers are comedian and television
pioneer Milton Berle, sports broadcaster Ahmud Rashad, actor Ben Gazzara,
comedian Jim Belushi, professional football Hall-of-Famer Terry Bradshaw,
film director Francis Ford Coppola, historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., and
a star of one of the decade's most popular television dramas, Dennis Franz
of <I>NYPD Blue</I>.</B></P>

<P><B>Another television personality who considers himself a cigar lover
is the host of CBS's popular <I>Late Show</I>, although David Letterman
did succumb briefly to antismoking critics. They had faulted him for smoking
cigars, especially when he did so on the air or was caught by the camera
after a commercial break in a cloud of smoke from the cigar he had puffed
on in the interim. The respite from cigars lasted less than a year. Admitting
to another talk-show host, Larry King, that he had resumed smoking, he
said, &quot;I missed it desperately. I missed everything about it. I like
the feel, I like the smell, I like the taste.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>In answer to criticism by Edgar Lichstein, chairman of the public
policy board of the antismoking American Heart Association, who said Letterman
ought to &quot;set a good example&quot; by not smoking on the air, Marvin
Shanken retorted, &quot;It's nonsense. It's a late-night program, not something
for the kids. It's a program that represents the good life, and I don't
know what represents the good life better than cigar smoking.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>No one appears to be more in tune with the good life than John F.
Kennedy, Jr. The handsome son of the late president has been a frequent
customer of Barclay Rex, a midtown Manhattan cigar emporium where he is
reported to favor Griffin's, Davidoffs, and Larranagas. However, one of
Kennedy's shopping forays impelled a newspaper gossip page to point out
that the senior John F. Kennedy had &quot;put an embargo on trade with
the greatest tobacco country in the unfree world, making it a real pain
in the buttalthough not impossiblefor cigar smokers to enjoy a good Cohiba
now and again.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>Young Kennedy is not the only member of the family favoring cigars.
His uncle, Senator Edward (Ted) Kennedy, is rarely seen at a white-tie
function in Washington, DC without lighting up a cigar after dinner. In
doing so, he is seldom alone. Among the denizens of Capitol Hill who favor
a good cigar (despite the specter of &quot;the smoke-filled room&quot;)
are: Supreme Court Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia,
U.S. Senators Howell Heflin and Christopher (Kit) Bond, Representative
Henry Hyde, and a cohort of other congressmen from both parties. Perhaps
the most public of these devotees of &quot;the stogie&quot; is pugnacious
Congressman Jack Brooks of Texas, who did not give a damn if he was seen
with a cigar in his mouth while sitting on a committee. He once warned
a smoke police complainant, &quot;Just try and get this cigar away from
me.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>Former Washington luminaries who light up an occasional cigar are
ex-Secretary of State Alexander Haig; Bernard Nussbaum, ex-council to President
Bill Clinton; ex-House Speaker Jim Wright; and the man who also presided
from the same podium, the late Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill. It was Tip who
once advised Vice President Walter Mondale, &quot;Enjoy the good cigars,
Fritz. They're about all that damn job's good for.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>Although Mondale was careful not to be seen smoking a cigar while
he was antismoking Jimmy Carter's running mate in 1976, neither he nor
President Ronald Reagan had any problem with their faces on the bands of
cigars sold as fund-raisers on their behalf during the 1984 campaign for
the White House. While Reagan was not known for smoking cigars during eight
years as the country's chief executive, he smoked them in many of his cowboy
movies.</B></P>

<P><B>The first chief executive on record who smoked cigars is also the
first to reside in the executive mansion. John Adams moved into &quot;the
President's house&quot; in 1800 (the mansion would not be formally named
the White House until the administration of Teddy Roosevelt, a non- smoker
because he had asthma). Those after John Adams who favored a good cigar
are James Madison, John Quincy Adams (like father, like son), Andrew Jackson,
John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, Andrew Johnson, Ulysses Grant, Chester Arthur,
Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, William Howard Taft, Warren Harding,
Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard
Nixon.</B></P>

<P><B>President George Bush also enjoyed cigars, as did his press secretary,
Marlin Fitzwater, although both often found themselves upbraided for it
by the otherwise delightful Barbara Bush.</B></P>

<P><B>To make matter worse in the capital, new federal laws were passed
to prohibit smoking in public buildings and Senator Frank Lautenberg of
New Jersey went so far as to attempt to officially declare the Senate a
smoke-free zone, just as Hillary Rodham Clinton had no smoking signs put
up in the White House. They are enforced, except on rare occasions, such
as following the rescue of an American airman from hostiles.</B></P>

<P><B>One can only imagine the damage that might have been done to the
&quot;special relationship&quot; between Britain and the United States
if Eleanor Roosevelt, Bess Truman, or Mamie Eisenhower had had the temerity
to inform Winston Churchill during his frequent visits with their husbands
that he would not be allowed to light up his cherished cigars under the
roof of the executive mansion. Given President Clinton's acquiescence to
the ban it seems unlikely that future cigar smokers will find themselves
smoking a Clinton as they do a Churchill.</B></P>

<P><B>Clinton's apparent schizophrenia on the issue of smoking does not
go unnoticed by the Washington press corps. Reminding him he had authorized
tough new regulations to keep cigarettes away from teenagers, reporters
quickly pointed out his own indulgence in cigars. This prompted a newspaper
column by Jeff Greenfield in which he suggests language Clinton might have
used to chastise the press for equating cigars with cigarettes.</B></P>

<P><B>It read, in part, &quot;In fact, it's you people in the media who
have defamed the cigar. Every time you need a villain you put a cigar in
his mouth: the blood-sucking capitalist lighting cigars with $20 bills;
the rich, fat movie villains portrayed by Edward Arnold or Sydney Greenstreet;
[and] the political bosses in their smoke-filled roomsit's nothing less
than group libel.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>Greenfield argued that Clinton should have silenced critics with
the rejoinder, &quot;The cigar is the symbol of success; when the great
Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach would light up a cigar, that was his
way of signaling when the game was won. When a man becomes a father, what
does he pass out to his friends? Cigarettes? Don't be ridiculous; he hands
out cigars. When someone falls just short of achieving a goal, what do
we say? 'Close, but no cigar.' When that goal is finally achieved, what
do we say? 'Give that man a cigar.' But do we really mean to drive every
mild indulgence out of our lives? Can't we make room for the occasional
marbled steak, the hot dog and beer at a ball game, bacon and eggs for
Sunday breakfast, and, yes, the after-dinner cigar?&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>What the ban on smoking in the White House achieved was the removal
from the State and East Room dining tables of a prized souvenir of a visit
to the White House. Gone are the elegant white match-folders embossed in
gold with the president's house.</B></P>

<P><B>These desirable mementos also disappeared from the fleet of presidential
aircraft. Undoubtedly they would have been taken off the presidential yacht
as well, had Jimmy Carter's administration not sold it.</B></P>

<P><B>However, all is not bleak for cigar smokers in the nation's capital.
They still light up and enjoy at the embassies of the cigar-producing countries
of Latin America. Yet one can only wonder if the law barring smoking in
U.S. government buildings would include the American embassy in Havana,
Cuba, that one day will become a reality in the years after the demise
of the Castro regime.</B></P>

<P><B>Meanwhile, the antismoking crusade has affected nongovernment places
in Washington, as it has everywhere else. Some of the city's most famous
and historic restaurants imposed smoking restrictions to the point that
Washington wag Art Buchold moaned on behalf of cigar smokers, &quot;A man
could get killed these days lighting a cigar in a restaurant.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>Rebellion was inevitable.</B></P>

<P><B>New Yorkers with a passion for literature as well as cigars have
a choice of three enterprises described in an article by Neil Graves in
the <I>Daily News</I> under the headline &quot;Saloons with a sense of
humidor.&quot; Devised by Mark Grossich, Bar and Books operated on First
Avenue and 50th Street, Hudson Street in Greenwich Village, and 1020 Lexington
Avenue on the Upper East Side.</B></P>

<P><B>Trademarks are paneled walls, lush seats, subdues lighting, and wall
units piled high with literary classics.</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>&quot;Patrons may think they have stepped back in time into Cornelius
Vanderbilt's study to share a puff with the baron,&quot; wrote Graves.
The establishments offer baby boomers &quot;a place to close a deal by
day or to groove on live jazz weekend nights.&quot;</B></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Appropriate attire is a requirement: &quot;We've brought back the
dress coat,&quot; Grossich said. &quot;It's a return to a bygone era when
that was considered the way to go.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>A General Cigar subsidiary, Culbro, announced another Manhattan spa
for cigar smokers. Called Club Macanudo, it opened early in 1996 at 26
East 63rd Street, the former site of the upscale Quo Vadis restaurant.
Club Macanudo offers a full range of cigars, wine, scotches, port, and
brandies, as well as light food, in a luxurious leather and brass atmosphere,
complete with private humidors.</B></P>

<P><B>Also for the benefit of New York cigar smokers is a thirty-four-seat
restaurant/lounge &quot;catering to the sophisticated cigar smoker seeking
the finer things in life,&quot; in the words of a press release. The Cigar
Room at Trumpets is in the Grand Hyatt hotel next to Grand Central Terminal.
The room was announced at a charity gala aboard the retired aircraft carrier
(now a museum) <I>USS Intrepid</I>. The affair was for the benefit of the
Sorvino Asthmatic Foundation, founded by actor, opera singer, restaurateur,
and cigar lover Paul Sorvino. Guests enjoyed a sampler of Bolivar pre-embargo
Havanas from the Nat Sherman humidor.</B></P>

<P><B>When asked to reconcile an event for the benefit of asthma sufferers,
Sorvino, the author of a book on how to overcome asthma by using a breathing
technique he developed, answers, &quot;If you have asthma you can't smoke
cigars. But I don't have asthma. I've been smoking cigars ever since I
was cured.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>Other new oases for New York cigar smokers are in some of the city's
smartest eateries. The West 63rd Street Steakhouse, which previously closed
on Monday nights when most of the theaters were dark, announced that it
would open its doors on Mondays to the $150-a-year members of The Cigar
Club. Another restaurant, Felix, invites cigarists to dine at $75 per head
and smoke to their hearts' content.</B></P>

<P><B>Taking note of the burgeoning movement to accommodate cigar smokers,
Michel Mariott wrote in the Style section of the <I>New York Times</I>
on Sunday, November 19, 1995, &quot;Reminiscent of scenes of Madison Avenue
fantasies found in many glossy magazines these days, three old friends
relaxed in butter-soft sofas and armchairs fashionably arranged in a well-appointed
little refuge from the rush of midtown Manhattan. For hours, the men, handsome
and crisp as new money, alternately laughed and joked and spoke seriously
about their work, family, and selves. All the while, each blissfully puffed
away on a premium cigar, heavily scenting the Cigar Bar of the Beekman
Bar and Books on First Avenue at 50th Street, with the heady aroma of expertly
aged and spiced tobacco.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>The article goes on to record that from New York to Los Angeles such
cigar-friendly places are &quot;popping up like palm trees in a no-smoking
desert of shifting public tastes and manners. &quot;A case in point is
the Grand Havana Room, opened in July 1995 in Beverly Hills, attracting
Hollywood celebrity smokers, including Joe Mantegna, Tony Danza, Dennis
Franz, Alec Baldwin, Christian Slater, Jonathan Silverman, Jason Priestley,
LeVar Burton, and Billy Crystal, who pay $2,000 a year and $150 a month
for the privilege.</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>&quot;The new cigar smokers,&quot; the <I>Times</I> points out, &quot;have
little in common with the stereotypical stogie-chomping truck drivers and
fat-cat politicians of old. This new wave tends to be young (mid-20s to
late-30s), better educated and very discriminating as to what cigars are
smoked and where.&quot;</B></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Although Hollywood's fresh crop of cigarists is youthful, the kings
of the cigar in show business were two old-timers. The legendary comedian
Milton Berle, who credits reaching his eighties to almost all those years
spent performing, claims he never smoked cigarettes, although he began
smoking cigars at age twelve. His friend and fellow comedian, George Burns,
also began as a young man and, as he reached his 100th birthday, remained
a devoted cigar smoker who never went on stage without one. In a tribute
to Burns and recognizing that for some reason there was a link between
a cigar and great comedians, Stand-Up New York, a Manhattan club for budding
comics, sponsored a competition for the up-and-coming gagsters in which
the only requirement, other than being funny, was the use of a cigar in
their acts.</B></P>

<P><B>Probably nowhere in the United States has the comeback of cigar smoking
been more conspicuous than in the film capital. And why not? It is in Hollywood's
movies that the image of the cigar as a symbol of success and power became
indelibly impressed upon the public's consciousness. In the heyday of the
gangster movie it was a rare film wiseguy (Edward G. Robinson, Edward Arnold,
Sydney Greenstreet, James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, among others) who did
not smoke a big black cigar in at least one scene. And the off-screen movers
and shakersthe movie moguls (Jack L. Warner, Darryl F. Zanuck, Harry Cohn)were
hardly ever seen without formidable black Havanas.</B></P>

<P><B>While the era of such all-powerful studio titans has long passed,
their modern equivalents stand solidly in the motion picture business,
cigars in hand, in the form of independent superstars, producers, directors,
and agents. At the top of Tinseltown's A-list in 1995 stood Arnold Schwarzenegger,
Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, and Tom Selleck in the superstar category;
superagents Lou Pitt, Robert Bookman, and Fred Specktor; producer Andrew
Bergman; and the directors Sydney Pollack and Francis Ford Coppola.</B></P>

<P><B>It was Coppola who united the image of the cigar-smoking Hollywood
bigshot with his counterpart in organized crime in his classic gangland
epic <I>The Godfather</I>. Sent out to Hollywood by mob boss Vito Corleone
to &quot;make an offer he can't refuse&quot; to a surly movie producer
with a passion for thoroughbred racehorses, Robert Duvall as the family
adviser and John Marley as the producer have after-dinner cigars while
talking business. Unwisely, the producer refuses the offer. The gory scene
that follows gives new meaning to &quot;getting ahead&quot; in the movies.</B></P>

<P><B>A real Hollywood mobster who enjoyed a good cigar became a pal of
another cigar- smoking film tough guy, George Raft. Then Benjamin (Bugsy)
Siegel went on to be the godfather of another mecca for cigars, the Nevada
desert gambling oasis of Las Vegas. Unfortunately the brainstorm of this
transplanted New York gangster led to Bugsy's invention of the practice
of skimming the profits, for which his gangland buddies paid him off with
a fusillade of bullets while he lounged on the sofa in the parlor of his
girlfriend, Virginia Hill.</B></P>

<P><B>While Bugsy was not blasted to Kingdom Come with a stogy in his mitt,
mob boss Paul Gigante was. The cigar was still there as the coroner walked
into the garden dining area behind Umberto's Clam House in New York's Little
Italy to cart away the remains. Anyone riffling through the photo morgues
of New York's tabloid newspapers can find scores of pictures of wiseguys
of past and present in which the center of attraction was snapped with
a cigar in hand or mouth, from the Roaring Twenties' Gerald Chapman (the
first man to be labeled Public Enemy No. 1) to 1930s godfathers Lucky Luciano
and Al Capone, and the 1990s' &quot;Teflon Don,&quot; the dapper John Gotti.</B></P>

<P><B>The most famous cigar-smoking gangbuster was G-man Melvin Purvis
of the FBI. Personally ordered by J. Edgar Hoover to round up the most-wanted
hoodlums of the 1930s, Purvis first set his sights on Pretty Boy Floyd.
When the baby-faced gangster was gunned down by federal agents in a cornfield,
Purvis stood next to the body and celebrated the occasion by calmly lighting
a stogy. A cigar also played a role in Purvis's triumph over the decade's
biggest name in crime. Informed that John Dillinger would be attending
a movie at the Biograph Theater in Chicago, Purvis told his band of crimebusters
that his signal to them to swoop down on the target and make an arrest
would be the lighting of his cigar. But when the fateful moment arrived,
Purvis was so excited and nervous that he couldn't get it lit. No matter.
Merely putting the cigar up to his mouth sent the G-men into action. Dillinger
fell dead in a burst of gunfire.</B></P>

<P><B>The Depression era's most famous female bandit also enjoyed a cigar
now and then. One of the most sensational photographs of Bonnie Parker
shows her with a cigar-holding hand up to her lips and a revolver in the
other. The shot was re-created in the movie <I>Bonnie and Clyde</I>, starring
Faye Dunaway as Bonnie and Warren Beatty as Clyde Barrow, both of whom
smoked cigars.</B></P>

<P><B>Another woman named Parker (Dorothy) was a writer in the 1930s. One
of the most acidly witty members of the &quot;smart set&quot; whose lunches
at New York's Algonquin Hotel became immortalized as the Round Table, Dotty
was observed enjoying an occasional small cigar even before she went Hollywood.
Were she around today she would have no trouble fitting in with the fresh
female faces who take advantage of the Grand Havana Room in the film capital,
as well as the three Bar and Books in New York.</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>&quot;Women come in and ask what's a good starter cigar,&quot; notes
Bar and Books owner Grossich, who has held cigar seminars for women. &quot;As
we say: Panatelas are not just for fellas.&quot;</B></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Certainly one of the interesting aspects of the comeback of the cigar
in the 1990s is the willingness (even eagerness) of some women to enter
the ranks of smokers. So pronounced has the movement of women into a predominantly
masculine domain become that the <I>New York Times</I> felt compelled to
take notice. Its &quot;Here New&quot; column of August 27, 1995, bore the
headline:</B></P>

<H2>Stogies, a Gal's Best Friend</H2>

<P><B>It begins: &quot;The back room of the Monkey Bar was thick with spirals
of smoke from 120 cigars. A guys-only, deal-clinching dinner? Not at all.
In fact, barely a man was in sight.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>The invitations to the $95-a-ticket event declared that it would
be an evening &quot;dedicated to women of the '90s!&quot; Similar to the
&quot;Big Smoke&quot; and other convocations of serious cigar smokers,
it was sponsored by purveyors of premium cigars, such as Davidoff of Geneva,
and offered as accompaniment superior drinks and fine cuisine (seared striped
bass and roast guinea hen).</B></P>

<P><B>The women who filled the trendy Upper East Side restaurant with smoke
were successful financially. A printing executive from New Jersey, asked
about the steep costs of a night of good cigars, shrugged: &quot;I pay
more than that for a skirt,&quot; she said.</B></P>

<P><B>Questioned as to why she smoked, another blew a column of smoke and
answered with a smile, &quot;It's one of the greatest pleasures in life.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>In making that assertion she was not, in fact, proclaiming a sudden
discovery by women. They had been taking to tobacco in the form of cigars
in the middle of the nineteenth century. A style of cigar called &quot;queens&quot;
was made especially for women. Diminutive in length and girth, some were
fitted with a straw mouthpiece. Earlier literary references to women who
smoked go back to the 1600s, although the preferred method was more likely
to be the pipe rather than a cigar. In 1665 no more distinguished a person
than the Reverend Giles Moore, Rector of Horsted Keynes, Sussex, made a
note in his account book that he had expended three pence for &quot;Tobacco
for my wyfe.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>On September 21, 1710, Jonathan Swift, author of <I>Gulliver's Travels</I>,
wrote to a friend, &quot;I have the finest piece of Brazil tobacco for
Mrs. Dingley that ever was born.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>In November he wrote directly to her: &quot;I have made Delaval [a
companion of Swift] promise to send me some Brazil tobacco from Portugal
for you, Madam Dingley.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>The cargo list of a ship carrying Quaker women from England to Philadelphia
in 1756 notes a trunk containing &quot;balm, sage, summer Savoury, horehound,
Tobacco, and Oranges.</B></P>

<P><B>A hundred and fifty years later a Scotsman on a train asked a woman
who sat opposite him in the compartment if she objected to him smoking.
&quot;Na, na, laddie,&quot; she replied. &quot;I've come in here for a
smoke ma'self.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>Visiting Switzerland in 1846, Charles Dickens detailed his expectation
of an affable evening of conversation in a hotel with his daughters and
&quot;an American lady&quot; and her daughter of sixteen. He notes an employee
of the hotel &quot;brought out a cigar-box, and gave me a cigar, which
would quell an elephant in six whiffs.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>He continued:When I lighted my cigar, [American] daughter lighted
hers at mine; leaned against the mantelpiece, laughed and talked, and smoked,
in the most gentlemanly manner I ever beheld. . . .American lady immediately
lighted hers; and in five minutes the room was a cloud of smoke. . . .But
even this was not all. For presently two Frenchmen came in, with whom the
American lady, daughter sat down to whist. The Frenchmen smoked of course,
and daughter played for the next hour or two with a cigar continually in
her mouthnever out of it. She certainly smoked six or eight.</B></P>

<P><B>The author who would give the world <I>Oliver Twist, David Copperfield</I>,
and <I>Tale of Two Cities</I> was shocked.</B></P>

<P><B>In 1851 the English magazine <I>Punch</I> had a drawing captioned
&quot;A Quiet Smoke&quot; that depicts five women in short wide shirts
in a tobacconist's shop. Two are puffing cigars.</B></P>

<P><B>The woman writer with the male pseudonym of George Sand asserted
in 1867, &quot;A cigar numbs sorrows and fills the solitary hours with
a million gracious images.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>Although history is rife with women who adopted a contrary view,
such as the monarch who reigned during the lives of Dickens and Sand, their
disdain for the aroma of cigars was not shared by writer Kate A. Carrington.
In <I>The Scent of a Good Cigar</I> she finds the smell to be something
sweeter than the jasmine scent and more potent in power than orange or
musk.</B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The ode continues:</FONT></B></P>

<H2><I>I am all alone in my quiet room,</I></H2>

<H2><I>And the windows are open wide and free</I></H2>

<H2><I>To let in the south wind's kiss for me,</I></H2>

<H2><I>While I rock in the softly gathering gloom,</I></H2>

<H2><I>And that subtle fragrance steals.</I></H2>

<H2><I>Just as a loving, tender hand</I></H2>

<H2><I>Will sometimes steal in yours,</I></H2>

<H2><I>If softly comes through the open doors,</I></H2>

<H2><I>And memory wakes at its command,</I></H2>

<H2><I>The scent of that good cigar.</I></H2>

<P><B>Some cynical observers of societal norms and countertrends find in
cigar smoking by the women of the 1990s another attempt to drive a feminist
wedge into one of the few areas of modern living that still hangs out a
men only sign. These commentators view a cigar in the hand of today's woman
in the same light in which another generation looked upon women wearing
trousers and toting briefcases while they &quot;invaded&quot; that most
hallowed place in the world of successful men, the corporate boardroom.</B></P>

<P><B>Yet, if a cigar could be the symbol of success for a man, surely
a woman ought to be allowed to claim, as did the unknown author of the
following:</B></P>

<H2><I>I owe to smoking, more or less,</I></H2>

<H2><I>Through life the whole of my success;</I></H2>

<H2><I>With my cigar I'm sage and wise,</I></H2>

<H2><I>Without, I'm dull as cloudy skies.</I></H2>

<H2><I>When smoking, all my ideas soar,</I></H2>

<H2><I>When not, they sink upon the floor.</I></H2>

<H2><I>The greatest men have all been smokers,</I></H2>

<H2><I>And so were all the greatest jokers.</I></H2>

<P><B>Historically, although most women who decided to smoke chose cigarettes,
the vast majority of their sexas well as overwhelming numbers of mendisapproved
of women smoking. But at least one English cleric, in a lecture he gave
at Harvard University in 1913, in a time when smoking by women was about
to become all the rage, was able to report that many women in his home
country &quot;who are well thought of, smoke.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>He went on to express a view that would appear to explain the taking
up of the cigar by women more than eighty years later. He preached:</B></P>

<P><B>I do not attempt to enter into the ethical part of this matter, but
this much I say: If men find it such a pleasure to smoke, why shouldn't
women? There are many colors in the rainbow; so there are many tastes in
people. What may be a pleasure to men may be given to women. When we find
women smoking, as they do in some branches of society today, the mere pleasure
of that habit must be accepted as belonging to both sexes.</B></P>

<P><B>Should there ever be a Smoking Hall of Fame, we believe Bishop Boyd-Carpenter
deserves a plaque.</B></P>

<P><B>With no significance to the order in which their names appear, and
aware that others might place different people on this roster, we respectfully
nominate:</B></P>

to say about almost anything, except the cigars he smoked.</P>

<P><B>Montezuma</B> The Aztec king welcomed the <I>conquistadores</I> with
the cigars used in courtly ritual. Unfortunately, his guests responded
by taking over his country and doing him in.</P>

<P><B>Alfred de Musset</B> French poet, he said cigar smoking was &quot;the
best way to kill time.&quot; He killed a lot of it in the company of George
Sand, whom Davidoff called &quot;the greatest of lady cigar smokers in
history.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Aristotle Onassis</B> Before he married Jacqueline Kennedy he was
famous for his millions and a yacht equipped with a magnificently stocked
humidor.</P>

<P><B>Ron Perelman</B> Owner, Consolidated Cigar Corporation.</P>

<P><B>Prince Rainier of Monaco</B> Few had ever heard of him until he married

and Rafael Gonzales Lonsdales.</P>

<P><B>Sir Walter Raleigh</B> It would be cute to say that the champion
of American tobacco lost his head over it, but King James I condemned him

<P><B>Edward G. Robinson</B> In 1949 cigar importers named him &quot;Mr.

<P><B>Rothschild</B> Banking family for whom the cigar is named.</P>

<P><B>Arthur Rubinstein</B> Classical pianist, once owned a tobacco plantation

<P><B>George Sand</B> There is no evidence that her manly pseudonym had
anything to do with her passion for cigars.</P>

<P><B>John Singer Sargent</B> American portrait painter. When he did not
have a paintbrush in hand, the man who painted the world's most famous
personalities held a cigar so frequently that the right side of his mustache
was the color of tobacco.</P>

<P><B>William Tecumseh Sherman</B> Civil War general. He had his men set
fire to Atlanta and other places in the Confederacy with as much zest as
he lit cigars. &quot;War,&quot; he explained, &quot;is hell.&quot; And
a good cigar was a smoke.</P>

<P><B>Mark Twain</B> The author of <I>Huckleberry Finn</I> and <I>Tom Sawyer</I>
claimed to have given up smoking cigars a thousand times. His ever-present
cigar contributed to its popularity in late-nineteenth- century America.

that smoking a cigar provided &quot;the best of all inspirations.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Jack L. Warner</B> One of the founders of Warner Brothers Pictures

department.</P>

<P><B>Evelyn Waugh</B> English author, best known to American audiences
for the public television series<I> Brideshead Revisited</I>, based on
his novel.</P>

<P><B>John Wayne</B> One can only imagine what the Duke would do if he
were still around and someone from the smoke police demanded he snuff out
his cigar. For some of his classic western films, if the script called
for him to light up, he had a supply of specially made smokes that were
extra-large, in keeping with his generous physiognomy.</P>

<P><B>Virginia Woolf</B> One thing the British novelist and essayist loved

<P><B>Darryl Zanuck</B> Longtime boss of 20th Century Fox Pictures, he
used some of his personal profits to ensure a steady supply of Havanas
by investing in Cuban tobacco plantations.</P>

<P><B>So what is it in the cigar that has proved to be such a lure for
smokers, both celebrated and not?</B></P>

<P><B>One of the most succinct explanations was the one given by David
Letterman. It is the feel, the smell, the taste.</B></P>

<P><B>All those who have appreciated the cigar since Columbus's time have
agreed. They found in the cigars cradled gently between thumb and finger
a beckoning to contemplate life and in so doing engage in a singular communication
with the self that Galsworthy defined as the soul.</B></P>

<P><B>In plumes and eddying clouds from a cigar, the poet Horace Smith
found nothing less than the transience of human life:</B></P>

<H2><I>Since life and the anxieties that share</I></H2>

<H2><I>Our hopes and trust,</I></H2>

<H2><I>Are smoke and dust,</I></H2>

<H2><I>Give me the smoke and dust that banish care.</I></H2>

<H2><I>I soar above</I></H2>

<H2><I>Dull earth in these ambrosial clouds like Jove,</I></H2>

<H2><I>And from my empyrean height</I></H2>

<H2><I>Look down upon the world with calm delight.</I></H2>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Rude Boy, double coronas are meant to be smoked ever so slowly; one-and-a half to two hours on average.  They are the classic after dinner length, usually accompanied by strong coffee or strong drink.  Take your time and use the double C to help you shrug off the day's headaches.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I bought a box of Hoyo Double Coronas (Cubans).  When I smoked
one, the thing fell apart in my hands!  The cigar tunneled,

Anyone have any explainations.  At $40 each, I am disappointed

that they don't make a size less than a 50 ring gauge. But I haven't seen
them in any cigar shops around town. Low and behold, a cigar of the month

<B>I have had a few - they are like a lot of these new brands; o.k. cigars for $4-$7.  You can tell they haven't been aged and are made quickly w/ fresh tobacco - shipped out to make some $$$ before the fad dies.  I can name 10-15 brands similar to it which have emerged in the last 2 years.  Try one but don't waste your $ on an entire box.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I know a shop that has aromatic cedar in it too.  Cigars
taste like shit.  Makes them acidic.  The guy gets really
nuts when you ask him about it and I imagine after putting
all that money in a new walk in  he doesn't want to remove
the stuff.  I won't waste a cent in the shop and he can
hang his clothes in there so they smell pretty.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I'm new to this site and I know this will be a novice question
to you guy's but I find this topic very interesting. My question is how 
can you tell the difference between Spanish and aromatic cedar? Is it
color, scent, the grain of the wood. If someone could explain in lots of detail
I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank You! Ted.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>That gives me a good laugh. All of those idiots who jumped on the cigar bandwagon, built their aromatic cedar lined humidors so they could sell overpriced cigars to the trendy masses. Now they couldnt give a cigar to anybody who knows what the hell they are doing. 
I have no idea what the difference is between the two kinds of wood. But, I know if you put aromatic cedar near a cigar, it will taste very much like dung.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I'm not an expert in humidor technology but Spanish Cedar has a slight grain difference than American Cedar. The growth rings are tighter.  It has much less aroma than American Cedar telling that it holds less humidity.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Spanish cedar smells much different than American cedar.  Also, usually American cedar is sanded smooth whereas Spanish cedar is usually a bit rough.  To tell the difference, take a piece of Spanish cedar from an old cigar box and take it with you to your local hardware store.  After locating some American cedar, pull that Spanish chunk out and smell that bad boy.  Do the same with American.  Now you can identify the differences by smell.  As for choosing which works best for smokes?  I know of only three absolutes in life:  There is a God;  I'm not Him;  and Spanish cedar works best for storing cigars.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Well Pete, here goes. The cigar started out with some hints of coffee, followed by some spice and a taste of leather,followed by a quick slap to the back of the head.  My dog wouldnt go near me when I was smoking this bad-boy. Man, I had to take a break in the middle of smoking it, and it was only a robusto. Seriously, I enjoyed it thoroghly with some of Gregg's espresso, but it is not an everyday stogie. Sorry Mark, I havent gone to the Ebonics class yet. I tried it in Shankenonics.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>She-ra, my love, you have a winner.  Nestors come in a cabinet-style box, and are without a band.  Although they are officially referred to as maduros, they are so dark, almost black, that they could easily qualify as oscuros.  In the thirty-plus years I've been smoking cigars, I've never smoked one more powerful. Light one up and hold on to your knickers.</B><P>

<B>My wife and I had a great weekend in San Antonio and I was seldom found without a great cigar in my mouth. First, it was just the two of us at Morton's Steakhouse. We were their second customers for the night and for about an hour the place was quite intimate!! After dinner I sparked up a Partagas 150. We then went to the Humidor at the Menger Hotel and picked up a half box of AF Petit Coronas. Damned good smoke for $2.30 each. Saturday we did the Alamo tour and bummed around the Riverwalk. While Susan was getting ready for our 10th anniversary dinner, I made it downstairs to the Humidor again. I ended up in the walkin humidor with none other than the infamous Tom Arnold. After I checked out, I stayed and talked to him for a minute. Tom was getting a box of Dominican Montecristos and a full box of some breath mints. I asked if his group was so bad to need a full box of them. The clerk went over and got him a free La Diva in a big glass tube. Tom asked if I had a big cigar for myself. I opened my vest and showed him the Partagas Anniversario I had been saving for my 10th anniversary that night. I told him I was just getting a couple of Macanudo Caviar Cafes for my wife. He told me to wait a second and bolted into the humidor. He came out and handed me a couple of $4.50 Davidoff Ambassadrice's "for the little lady" and told the clerk to add them to his bill. Classy move, I thought. He said if we got over to Planet Hollywood, we would be his guests. Well, we didn't make it. Susan was disappointed to miss meeting him, but thouroughly enjoyed the cigars. She's saving one. We had a fantastic dinner of glazed lamb chops and grilled pork tenderloin topped off with their famous mango ice cream at the Menger's Colonial Dining Room. We took a long ride in a handsome cab and we each smoked our cigars. The driver commented how good they smelled and when we got out I gave him a nice tip and a Partagas #2 from my front pocket. He about fell off his perch. The rest off the night is none of ya'lls business. Thanks to all who sent their congrats. It was great.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>A belated congrats on your anniversary MP. I love San Antonio- it's a very romantic city! Next time I'm there I'm stopping by The Menger's humidor- Do they have a good bar if we want to stop for a drink?</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>She-Ra, the bar os OK. It is a reproduction of a english pub. It was built in the 1880's (I think) and has great woodwork and lots of beveled glass. It is quite small, though. We don't drink anymore so we really just went in to look. The entire hotel is furnished with what should be museum pieces. Definately check it out.</B><P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Berings are generally good for the money. They
are consistent and very rarely surprise you with bad draw or uneven burn.
The flavor is generally consistent. The only Bering I that I will avoid
in the future is the Hispano Maduro, which was simply awful (and did not
taste anything like the other Berings I have tried). </B></P>

and it's just not a very delightful smoke. Dish out just a little more
cash and you can get something 20 times better.</B></P>

<B>I had one last night.  There wasn't much to it, but it wasn't unenjoyable.  Good
draw, nice smoking experience.  Just not enough to it, really.  I guess it was a bit
more mild than I prefer.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Berings are a really bad cigar for the money. Some of them are machine made with long filler tobbacco. You can get a JR Ultimate, an Arturo Fuente, a Montesino, or a La Uncia for just a little more cash.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I had a Bering once and it was putrid! It came in a glass tube and was presented well......but it was a facade, I was only able to smoke a quarter of the damn thing! It was rancid and I don't think I could even bring myself to even consider smoking another Bering cigar of any way, shape or form!</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>If you're going to buy a Bering, buy only *one*.  Chances
are, that may be your last one.  While you're buying that
Bering you'll also want to pick up an Arturo Fuente or an
H. Upmann so that you'll get a *good* smoke that will make
you forget about that Bering.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I got a box of Bering Coronas for my birthday.  They're good for smoking while you work on your car or mow the lawn.  The gift-giver was well-intentioned, but he paid WAY too much (he left the $39.99 price tag on).  If he had asked, I would have directed him to the Fuente display.</B><P>

folks who bring us Swisher Sweets.</B><P>

It freezing outdoors, but I am goning to serve this crowd until they are stuffed.  Boy they do eat much better when I'm picking up the tab...but they are smoking up a storm and drinking like a seive.  Me thinks I will need the coach wagon again to take them all home.  The staff is happy...pockets lined with big tips, knowing that I have the bonuses in my top pocket.  Wish you guys were here...plenty to eat (cornish hens basted in honey-dijon sauce or steamed fillet of sole in a lemon butter or the ever so popular BLT sandwich platter). I did not save any specific smoke for tonight but am getting ready to place several in my humidor as I've been given a few gifts.   </B><P>

Oh by the way...one of my guests wanted to offer me a gift I would never forget...she lit herself an Ashton, removed her blouse and sat at the bar bare brested while smoking it down to her fingers.  I was impressed, the other guests acted as if this happens everyday...I brought her the Cornish Hen dinner now I'm hiding in the office. Her male escort is sitting with her apparently worried over the bizarre behavior. Merry Xmas from the cafe </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Christmas eve my wife gave to me the ok to smoke in the house after
a great dinner for the first time. (It was a cold and rainey night)
anyhow I agonized over the choice and decided on an Opus X double
corona that I had since October. It was worth the wait! For Christmas
night I enjoyed a Partagas Limited robusto and it was truely impressive,
even outdoors on my sister's deck at 35 degrees. I hope to enjoy one 
inside one day...</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Would you believe it...  After we came home from the "family circus" I pulled out one of my few Cubans- a Cohiba. I dropped it on the floor and almost split it.. then we sat at the fireplace to enjoy cigars.. Halfway through it I got a bellyache from all the food and Pinot I had scarfed all day long! I couldn't even finish it! I ended up throwing my halfway finished treasure in the bushes outside... That's okay, because for New Year's, we're going to Del Frisco (fru-fru steak room) we have a party of 15 and we're sitting in the "cigar smoking allowed" room. I'll enjoy the Partagas Lusitania I've been saving.. Hopefully!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>You poor lads, it seems to me that cigar smoking is almost a 'forbidden pleasure' in most households. As a devout lady cigar fan, I believe cigar smoking is an experience to be shared and savoured with your loved ones, be them male of female. I wish for all of you,hopefully in the near future, to enjoy not only a wonderful smoke but also a tremendous company. Happy Holiday ! By the way, I just finished a La Flor de la Isabella - Coronas Largas. Interesting . But for the price I think I would prefer something else. Party on everybody !!</B><P>

Christmas day an Ashton Cabinet Selection #???.  On New Years day at midnight an Opus X double corona.  All three were excellent cigars & the holidays were great.</B><P>

Please if you still want a copy send msg...It can be faxed or sent snail.  Sorry I'm so slow at these things...business has been creating a vacuum which keeps me upon the mainstream. </B><P>

<H2>Holiday Booty</H2>

<P><B>It seems like we all made a post to the &quot;HO HO HO&quot; thread
with our best holiday wish list. Well, I haven't got a box of Hemmingway
Classics, but did receive a Colibri lighter, a new Plieades (Davidoff knockoff)
cutter and a box of Butera Royal Vintage Bravo Cortos. Also, I finished
the humidor I was building and was able spend two hours finding the best
way to fit my cigars into it. The humidor is my first excursion into fancy
woodworking and through tons of patience, several hours of planning and
about 15 hours of actual work, I came out with a humidor as nice as most
I've seen in the shops. I'm happy about the gifts but I'm most proud of
the gem I produced by my own hands. </B></P>

Cuaba (a new cuban figuado shape) cigar from a friend in England and one
Trinidad. I don't know what to do with Trindad since it not easy to replace.
I also receive a Colibri Prime Minister lighter ( to replace the one I
lost in Vegas). All in All I'm with happy X-mas. I'll try one of the Cuaba
after dinner.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>That's funny. I sometimes go to a different shop
and the guy is always trying to push some cigar. Either Schwartzenager
smokes it or owns part of the company. It's just a matter of what he has
that isn't selling and what day of the week it is. But that's OK, sometimes
he actually has some decent cigars at decent prices.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>KBW, it looks like your English hasn't improved
much. The Siglo line was introduced in Havana in late 92, then exported
to London in late 93. This first run of cigars came from vintage 90-91
yields. KBW, If I'm smoking a Padron Anniversario today, am I smoking a
97 cigar or a 92, since the Anniversario line is aged for a minimum of
5 years? KBW, think before you post. </B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>R.W. Maybe you bought your Siglo in &quot;94&quot;
. The blend come from three diff. years 91,92 and 93. What vintage is this
cigar? Since Cohiba Doesn't vintage their cigar how can you do this?</B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>RW, your punctuation, grammar and syntax leave
much to be desired. It's ironic you would chastise someone else. BTW, this
is an international community. In all likelyhood there are people here
who do not speak english as a first language. Why don't you get off your
high horse and stop the personal attacks?</B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>BobbyK, YOU'RE something else. I see you've learned
little from our last exchange. (You didn't use a contraction with YOUR)-good
job, thumbs up to you! But you do get an (F) for the word English, the
(E) is capitalized. That is the problem with the good old U.S.A, the melting
pot! English, should be mandated as the official language. Keep YOUR customs
dear, hold them tight and never lose them, but one must learn English.
-----KBW, the Siglo I smoked was one of 5 choices from a New Years party,
at a private smoking club. In retrospect, I wish I chose the Simon Bolivar,
since we could only choose one. Anyway, each smoke had with it, somekind
of mock parchment paper with a full account of the cigar. To YOUR question
on vintage, YOU'RE right. Vintage is my word for describing this cigar.
I will call any cigar that consists of tobacco 5+ years back, vintage!

<TITLE>How Small Can a Cigar Get?</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#002090"  text="#FFFAFA" link="#ffff00" alink"#ffff00" vlink="#ffff00">
<p><h2><CENTER>How Small Can a Cigar Get? Try On a Macanudo Miniature.</CENTER></h2>
<P>
<CENTER><img src="mini.gif"></CENTER>
<p><ul>Making a small cigar is hardly a small undertaking.
"A typical small cigar tends to smoke hot," said John Rano, Senior Vice
President Marketing of General Cigar. 
To make the 3 3/4" x 24 ring-gauge Macanudo Miniature, the Macanudo cigar makers developed a unique way to make a small cigar.<BR>
To begin with, the same tobaccos and Connecticut Shade wrappers that are used in making the large Macanudo cigars are used in making the Miniatures. And significantly, the aging process for the blend as well as the wrappers takes at least two years,  just as it does for large Macanudo cigars.<BR>
The result is a breakthrough brand 
in the small-cigar category, because Macanudo Miniatures are the only American-style small cigars that are made with all-natural tobacco. <BR>
(American-style refers to a small cigar that's supple rather than brittle like European-style baked cigars.)<BR>
  Just as important to the smoker, Macanudo Miniatures not only 
deliver true cigar taste, they draw smoothly, burn slowly and smoke coolly. 
Macanudo Miniatures are available in many tobacco shops, hotels, 
airports, gift shops, newsstands and duty-free stores.
"The strong sales results speak for themselves," said Mr. Rano. "And they 
indicate that cigar smokers are turning to our small cigars in a big way."

the Niners fall short (Treeman, even though Dexter Carter
has been benched, you know he has one killer fumble left
inside him), then I'd love to see a Jacksonville-Carolina
Super Bowl.  I assume the ratings would be terrible, and
I always enjoy seeing the NFL lose money.  I will always be
a Cleveland Browns fan.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>O.K. O.K. all you dreamers out there!  Now that week one of the playoffs is over, there is a clearer picture.  Sure, the Cowboys are going to win a few, but not all the way.  Love Emmitt and Troy, but hate the 'boys!  Green Bay is going to be tough to stop, but I'm going to ride "The Bus" all the way with PITTSBURGH!!  Go Steelers!  BTW, "The Bus" is Gerome Bettis. It don't stop 'till "The Face" gets the Silver Football. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Well, as a Chicago boy, I would hate to see Green Bay in the
Super Bowl, but I'd rather see them than Dallas.  I think
that Dallas is high on itself.  And Deion just plain sucks.
The only reason that he is half a threat on offense is
Irvin and Smith taking the heat off of him.  And a 
sportscaster put it best when he said "Deion couldn't tackle
my wife Emma."  Now, I don't know his wife's football talents,
but Deion is all hype.  Overall, my hope would be to see San
Fran in the Super Bowl, but if it's GB or Dallas, the Packers
get my vote.  That said, I don't think any current team can play
with the '85 Bears.  But, I think I'll take plenty of heat
for that statement.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Brad, I am right with you on your statements about Deion. I just don't see what all the hype is about. Sure, he can keep up with some of the premier receivers in the league, but he certainly cannot tackle anyone. He is just an overpaid, overhyped showboat.... I would also root for Green Bay to be in the superbowl instead of the Cowboys. But, my first choice will be the 49ers.......</B><P>

Super Bowl, they lost 46-10 to the bears.  The game was Jan 26, 1986, the day
before my sister was born.  Payton didn't score (which was an absolute shame),
but Perry, the Refridgerator, did.  I'm sorry to say that the Patriots could not
have won that game on their best day.  BTW, I was formerly known as Brad, I just started

The Patriots will lose because they are playing for the hearts of Bill Parcels and Drew Bledsoe.  You don't know how happy I am to not see Dallas in this one.  Once again, the "49er" offense (Mike Holgren) proves itself to be the best in the league.  Next year baby...next year.</B><P>

Does anyone honestly believe the Lord gives a rip who wins the NFC Championship game.  Is Reggie and the Pac more "God's Team" than Carolina.  Just more silly self-rightousness from a man who claims to be a Rev.  Has he no shame.  Thanking Jesus is one thing, being an ignorant baffoon is another Reggie!

At least he did when he was in Phila. I, for one, was sorry to lose him from the Eagles and am glad to see that he will finally get his much deserved super bowl ring.

I've been fortunate to have received the robusto, lancero, esplendido and Siglos III, IV and V.  They're getting tougher to come by nowdays.

try a fit into my schedule. Also if anyone knows of any smoke shops where
I may pick up a few smokes, that would be helpfull also.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>lb, two establishments just opened downtown within
the last few weeks. I haven't had the opportunity to visit either place
yet. The first is Ruth's Chris steakhouse, an excellent but very expensive
place for steaks. It claims to have a &quot;dedicated cigar bar&quot;,etc.
plus excellent wine selection. (There is also one on the northeast side
of town). The second is Ybor's Martini &amp; Cigar bar, located on the
fourth floor of the newly opened Circle Centre mall. If you're staying
downtown anybody can direct you to either place quite easily. As far as
shops go, I frequent Pipe Puffer on the north side. Another place reputed
to have a good selection is Hardwicke Pipe &amp; Tobacco, but I haven't
been there. E-mail me if you want more info.</B></P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Randy I appreciate the info and will indeed drop you a line. There
is a Ruth Chris here in Baltimore and they are indeed cigar friendly.
They allow you to smoke in some of their dining areas after a certain
time, and their bar and lounge area all the time. You are right about 
them being expensive though, but the food and service are worth it! Just
remeber to bring your own cigars when you go as their prices can run 3x 
the retail rate from a tobacconist.</B><P>

<B>Last night I attended the cigar smoker at the New River Marine Corp Air Station near Jacksonville, NC.,  in response to an Internet invatation placed by Obnoxio on our website.  Had an absolute blast. First of all, Obnoxio does not live up to his webset moniker.  He is one of the nicest guys I've met in a long time.  And,  for a paltry $35.00,  we were served drinks, a great meal and five excellent cigars. Seated at our table, in addition to Obnoxio, was a Navy Lieutenant, who is a flight surgeon, and our group was supplemented over the course of the evening by visits from the base chaplain, who is a prodigious cigar smoker and a Marine Lt. Colonel who is a chopper pilot and a fine officer, and others who stopped by just to say hello.  Sitting there listening to these men talk about their responsibilities honed my appreciation for the job members of the armed forces do to proect our national and personal interests.  I was honored to be in their presence.  Although Obnoxio is far too modest to admit it, he somehow manages to juggle a full family life, with two beautiful daughters and a lovely wife, who is also in the service, with his military mission as a Navy Corpsman on a search and rescue helicopter. He was up at 4:30 this morning, after acting as my host at the smoker, so he could be on duty by 6:00 and will not be off duty until 7:00 PM this evening.  So the next time you're all nice and cozy , sipping your whiskey and puffing your stogie, remember the Obnoxios of the the world; they accord you that freedom.  The MCAS plans to hold another smoker in the Spring.  If you can get down to Jacksonville, NC to attend, it is well worth the effort.  It was a real treat.  Thanks, Obnoxio, for a great evening.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Drew, I don't know who flies into  Wilmington, NC anymore,  but if you can fly in there, it's only about a thirty minute drive to Jacksonville.  If you have to fly into  Raleigh-Durham, you're talking about two, to two and a half hours, but virtually all of that is Interstate at seventy mph..  That's what I drove getting down there and I live on the Chapel Hill side of Durham about six minutes from the Chapel Hill city limits.  However, either way, it would be worth the trip.  The smokes and meal were great, and the company was the finest kind.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Thanks for the kind words Peter. I had a fantastic time also. If any of you would like to attend,  the next one will be in April, I will keep you all posted. Drew: We have two or three small airports near us, New Bern being a close one, and a small airfield in Jacksonville NC that takes commuter aircraft. Im not sure how far of a drive it would be from Atlanta.  I was a bit surprised at how nice of an evening it turned out to be, and I am sure the next one will be even better. Thanks for making that long drive Pete, I hope it was worth it.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The '59 Punch was remarkable.  It was our dinner cigar, and it was perfect( we were given the Punch churchill as our cocktail cigar, when we first arrived).  I also ended up with one of the Jose Llopis thanks to the generosity of the flight surgeon who won one of the five packs as a door prize.  He split the box with Obnoxio and me...what a champ. </B><P>

Obnoxio introduced himself to me several months ago with the offer of a free cigar. His generosity was rewarded with a Partagas #10. Over and over, he has taken the time with newcommers, trying as they may be. I am proud to share a box of a great, rare find with such a gentleman. Walmart, Greggorio, BobbyK, PaulM, mhershey,  have all taken the time to share some great finds with me and I rest better each night knowing there are many people out there looking for more than just a cigar. We can all learn from each other and make this the best cigar site on the web; I think it already is.  </B><P>

<P><B>Sorry this took so long! Here's Peter's recipe: &quot;Pamlico Pete's
Grilled Breast of Wild Duck&quot;- 4 duck breasts (mallards are best),
4 strips of bacon. Waterfowl marinade: 3/4 bottle of Kikkoman soy sauce,
1 cup lemon juice, 1/4 bottle of ketchup, 1/2 bottle A1 sauce, 1/4 cup
cream sherry,1/4 cup molasses, 1tbs. coarse groung pepper,1tbs. dry mustard,
1/4tsp ginger, dash of cayenne pepper. 1.Combine ingredients of marinade
in sauce pan and stir over low heat until well blended., (do not overheat
or molasses will harden.) 2.Set aside to cool. 3.Place well washed duck
breasts in flat tupperware container, and add marinade. 4.Place in refridgerator
for 48 hours- turning duck breasts twice daily. 5.Preheat outdoor grill
to medium high heat. 6.Secure bacon to the duck breasts with toothpicks.
7.Place duck breasts on hot grill and sear each side. 8.Close cover on
grill and cook, bacon side up for about 15 minutes. Continuously baste
breasts with marinade while grilling. Do not overcook! Ducks should be
slightly pink in the center. Serve over toasted sour dough or cracked wheat
bread, accompanied by wild rice, stewed apples with cinnamon and a green
vegetable. Warmed peach or pear chutney can be offered as an optional glaze
for duck breasts, but only after they are ready to be served. Serve with
a good quality Gerwertztraminer (preferably Alsatian) or other full bodied
(not dry) white wine.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Here's Treeman's recipe: Start with a good duck-
mallard, sprig, widgeon and teal are the only ducks to eat! Wash them good-
inside and out. Coat the breasts with olive oil and salt to taste. Place
them breast up on a roasting pan in a HOT oven (450-500 degrees) for 25
minutes (large bird) or 10-15 for teal &amp; widgeon. Hot and fast is the
only way to cook them. Make sauce of 1 part lemon juice, 1 part worcestershire,
2 parts red wine, 1tbs currant jelly, dash of cayenne, garlic cloves &amp;
butter- It's great! The duck should be on the rare side when eaten. Serve
with wild rice and french bread and red wine.</B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>and The Cuban Crusader's recipe: 1 4-5 lb. duckling,
dressed, 1 clove crushed garlic, 1/2 cup wild turkey bourbon, 1/2 cup cranberry
juice, 2 tbs lemon juice, 1 can Bing cherries, salt and pepper to taste.
Preheat oven to 325 and wash the duckling inside and out. Rub it inside
and out with salt and pepper to taste. Place the bird on a shallow roasting
pan in the oven for 30 minutes. Mix the cranberry juice and lemon juice
and use it to baste the duck once every 20 minutes until done. This takes
about 40 minutes on both sides, but you'll know when it's done. When it's
cooked, remove it from the pan and skim off the juices. Drain the cherries
and mix the cherry juice with the wild turkey, then add it to the pan..
Add the cherries themselves and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour some of the
resulting sauce over the bird and keep the rest in a sauce boat to dish
out with a ladle. Serves around four. Enjoy! </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>She-Ra, thank you very much for personally resurtrecting
this exciting thread. I know I was too lazy to do it myself. By the way,
on a culinary note: Has anyone here heard of the great Italian-California
chef John Pisto? He hails from my homeland of the Monterey Peninsula, and
hosts a cooking show here, which is syndicated nationwide on the Nostalgia
Network. His recipes include ducks, and comprise of delicious dishes of
all kinds, excluding desserts, to make up a Mediterranean style diet. His
ingredients are almost all healthy, with the exception of olive oil, which
is used frequently, but may be beneficial if used in moderation. If any
of you should get a chance to see his show, tell me what you think, if
not, order a video or and cookbook from montereybay.com. It will revolutionize
your appreciation of food. By the way, Pisto is also a great lover of fine
cigars, and last June I was afforded the opportunity to have a smoke with
him. Buy the cookbook, you won't be disappointed.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I'm one of those people that would much rather
have someone cook a meal and bring it to the table! I'll let you all know
how this duck breast turns out! The poor guys have been out to the lease
almost every weekend and haven't seen any ducks. They think it's because
it's been pretty mild (70 degrees here in Dallas!) and the duck have had
no reason to fly south. Now I hear it's been really cold from Northern
Oklahoma and up! Keep you fingers crossed!</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>If Mr. Duck won't fly over the duck blind...one
must move the blind into the supermarket where the great boxed frozen mallard
lives. Even the hungriest hunter can catch his fill in this wild hunt.
If you can not get any duck at your meat market...e-mail me and I'll order
my meat company to quick freeze some, pack them in dried ice and send them
to you. Definately not as good as fresh but will satisfy the nature of
the beast. Or...Peter...do you know of a good source of mail order mallard?

<B>I just got back from visiting with my tobacconist. Actually, I sent my husband to pick me up some vitamin C since I'm fighting off a cold and he called me from the tobacconist... to tell me of the large assortment! Just got home with a box of Onyx 650. They had boxes of Dom Tomas Special editions, all the Ashtons, all the Joya de Nicaragua, Partagas! Still no Fuente, no Hyde Park, no Excalibur.. But there was alot more to choose from than usual! Looks alittle more promising!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>PaulM,  i too got lucky when i called holts this week. i had some chateau fuente's so i picked up a box of 8-5-8's.  i haven't had these but wanted to try them.  what is everyone's comments on these?  i'm going to my tobacconist today and hopefully he will have some fuente's.  the last two times i went he had a couple different boxes of fuente's (but only three sticks out of each box per customer).  he gets his shipments in on fridays, so hopefully my timing will be on today.</B><P>

it's light blue. This post would of been more exciting if the boxes and boxes
were Padron Anniversarios, or Fuente Hemingways, maybe even Partagas Aristocrates! But
if Joya Nigaragua and Don Tomas tickle your pickle well?!?. The smokes S.R. mentioned
can be found with little or no difficulty-- mailorder. If she was happy walking into her local
shop and eyeing some Don Tomas Limited editions, than all to her!---Go Girl.....</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I also got lucky this weekend. Ran accross a box of Opus X Double Coronas. Differt box than the last batch I saw. Instead of a slide-off lid this one was a traditional pick up lid. Still a beautiful box. Also, the box held 32(?) cigars instead of 25. Not cheap though, I had to take out a second mortgage but it had to be done. One more treat, another box of Don Carlos Robustos! You can't have enough of those. Hope everyone else was as lucky.</B><P>

<B>If I had a choice of either one I would go with the natural. I found two maduros in San Antonio and really like the natural better. The maduros are good, don't get  me wrong. I just believe the naturals will improve more over time. Get one of each. For the box price you can't go wrong.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>No kidding.  Maybe it's because I don't have a girlfriend and I find myself with more disposable income than usual, but
I'm thinking that if you have a good humidor, that you can't go wrong buying the good deals that you find.  Who knows what the cigar boom
will create?  She-ra's got the right idea, I believe.  If our favorite cigars became impossible to find, at least she'd have some left.  And if 
they become easier to get, so what, yours will be aged better.</B><P>

I thought was open. It wasn't. It bounced off the closed window and dropped
into my lap while I was doing 70mph. on the Interstate. Burns of a private

with me, thought it was a scream. I've long since given up smoking cigars
in the car.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Went to my annual visit to church on Easter two
years ago and had been smoking a fine AVO on the way. Just before getting
there I placed about half the cigar in the cars ash tray to let it go out.
I knew that once the services were over I'd want to get out of Dodge quick.
So I put the cigar in my jacket pocket and was listening to the services,
I kept thinking that was one powerful cigar, I can still smell it. No thats
not a cigar, somethings burning. Then I got that feeling everyone was looking
at me. Sure enough it was me and the coat smoldering away. I gracefully
got up and left to put things out. The minister finished his sermon and
came out to the lobby where I was waiting and told me that its a bad sign
when you catch fire in church. Maybe you need to come more often!</B></P>

thought I was doing a James Brown impersonation. Luckily I didn't fall
off the balcony, but I came pretty close. And people say that cigar smoking

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Joseph, I plan to be buried in my camoflage duck
hunting coat. Once, while duck hunting on Pamlico Sound in North Carolina,
our boat capsized after losing power. Fortunately, we were close enough
to shore to swim in by holding on to the decoy bag. We hunkered down in
an old trappers shack and managed to survive the evening on two Moon Pies
( a real southern delicacy, for you Yankee fellas who've never heard of
them), a couple of Pepsis, and, you guessed it, some primo Macanudos we
had stashed away in a waterproof pouch. When the Coast Guard picked us
up the next morning, we had pretty much lost everything, except our sense
of humor and a great story to tell our grandchildren and our cigar smoking
friends.</B></P>

up a Rico's, and started puffing away. Someone came to the door so I set
down my cigar in the ashtray, and went to talk to them. When I came back,
I didnt look at how I had set my cigar down. I picked it up, and stuck
about 1 1/4 &quot; of ash and burning cigar in my mouth. Can you say, &quot;Doooh!&quot;</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Obnoxio, that Beaujolais will do that to you,
especially the nouveau...you tend to want to polish off the bottle because
it's not very good after it's been decanted. If cigars tasted as bad as
the ash they produce, we wouldn't have a cigar boom on our hands, that's
for sure. </B></P>

I went over -- she put her hand out to shake and I responded by stuffing
the entire ash in my mouth. I invented a few new words and made it a short

Cola with Moon Pies. Pepsi with a Moon Pie is as a big &quot;faux pas&quot;
as having Thunderbird served at a black tie banquet. By the way, I grew
up with Moon Pies in Ohio and get them regularly in California, so don't
think that just Southerners enjoy this treat.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>My most embarrassing cigar moment came several
years ago at a baseball game at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. I was
enjoying a cigar and a beer and watching the recently installed Diamond
Vision screen on the center field scoreboard. It was between innings and
they were showing live shots of the crowd. All of a sudden, I appeared
on the Diamond Vision. I was so surprised that my jaw dropped and my cigar
fell into my beer. Naturally, this all appeared on the Diamond Vision and
I received quite a round of applause from the crowd. They have since banned
smoking at Candlestick, so this will never happen again.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>If you are ever worried about dropping a cigar,
here's a tip. Wedge the thing in between your middle finger and your ring
finger. Push it as far in there as it will go without hurting the cigar.
Unless you have very large, flexible hands, it's not going anywhere.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Buzz, as far as I know E.R.d.M does not make a
cigar, like the one you speak of. There is the &quot;Originales&quot; a
46x5, or a &quot;Montecarlo&quot; a 48x6, both are great smokes, IMHO.
The E.R.d.M line should be easy to find. These smokes are one of my favorites.

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Thanks Wizard and Right Wing. This cigar is still
a mystery. It is (I remeasured) 6.75x47 (maybe 48) and it came uncello'd.
It sounds like the Habana Club sizewise, but it didn't come in a glass
tube (unless the shop owner purloined them). Right Wing, while we have
disagreed elsewhere, we agree on this fine cigar. You started quite a stir
on that thread. It was fun.</B></P>

here in my catalog. Good luck... </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Buzz, I have dealt with many attorneys. I have
fired more than I have had court cases. The first major flaw I spot in
an inexperienced attorney could be stated best: First you need to remove
the log in your own eye before you criticize the splinter in your brothers
eye.-----Now, I learn something everyday from women and see them as an
equal. The femin-nazis I see as a destructive movement. Buzz, do you understand
now?!?...........</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Right wing. Somehow I believe that you have the
constant need for an attorney. Maybe you would be better understood if
you just said what you meant and cut out all of the bomb throwing. As to
the &quot;log&quot; talk above, what a bunch of nonsense. Oh, one more
thing. We understand what you are saying, most everyone just disagrees
with what you are saying. Repeating yourself ad nauseam just doesn't cut
it. You've made your point, now move on. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Buzz, yes--- I have many attorneys and they get
paid very well. Your problem is you target one sentence out of a paragraph.
Sort of like disgarding the smallest, weakest puppy. If you only stayed

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>R.W.- fortunately the ranks of the NOW and other
feminist groups are so riddled with militant lesbians that most main stream
Americans don't take these groups seriously. Surveys show that the vast
majority of American women do not identify with these groups. I wish that
we could just ignore these wackos, but something tells me that that would
be dangerous.</B></P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Wit and gupfish- you're both right. When I bought them, I
bought the last five. Then Smoke magazine reviewed them and
they are nowhere to be found. The Bullet is a lot of smoke.
Gupfish- did you smoke the light or dark wrapper Bullet?
I had the light and liked it almost as much as the dark
which I have tried in the next size up. These cigars taste
very Cuban to me. Also, if you like the Cusano, give the 
Maxius a try if the Cusano are unavailable. </B><P>

dark wrapper (Sumatra or Cameroon?), I still love the light.
I hope they make the Bullet in the dark wrapper as this is

<TITLE>Which Cigars Go With Which Single Malts?</TITLE>

<br><br><CENTER><h2>Which Cigars Go With Which Single Malts?</h2></CENTER><P>
<blockquote>
<B>By Robert M. Rothberg, M.D.</B><P>
Hundreds of single-malt Scotch whiskies pair well with premium cigars. The trick is to 
select a single malt that either enhances or plays off the flavors of your chosen cigar. 
Here are a few suggestions in the spirit of Slainte mhor, which is Gaelic for "good health."<P>
<br><br>

<CENTER><img src="cig1.gif"></CENTER><br>
<B>Macanudo Vintage Cabinet Selection Number II  6 1/2" x 42 Ring</B> <BR>
The intense flavor of this cigar is due more to its Lonsdale shape than to its blend, a 
Dominican-Mexican mixture that creates a mouth-filling, mint-like sensation. Edradour, 
the only single-malt Scotch whisky that develops minty flavors, is a natural pairing.<P>

<CENTER><img src="cig2.gif"></CENTER><br>
<B>Partagas Limited Reserve Royale 6 3/4" x 43 Ring</B><BR>
This cigar has an espresso-like spiciness, but avoid pairing it with one of the heavier 
single malts. Stay in the Highlands instead with a sweet, medium- bodied whisky such as a 
10-year-old Aberlour. The Glenlivet, The Macallan and Glenfiddich are excellent sweet choices as well.<P>

<CENTER><img src="cig3.gif"></CENTER><br>
<B>Ramon Allones Redondo </B><BR>
7 1/2" x 49 Ring<BR>
The tailored look of the Cameroon wrapper belies this cigar's playful flavors: a hint of 
pepper, a touch of chocolate, 
a bittersweet finish. The diversity marries well with a range of light- to medium-bodied 
malts. One of The Balvenies, from the austere Founder's Reserve or Single Barrel to the 
sweeter taste of DoubleWood, is a good place to start. Or try a fruity, older springbank 
if you're lucky enough to find one.<P>

<CENTER><img src="cig4.gif"></CENTER><br>
<B>Temple Hall Estates No. 700</B> <BR>
7 1/2" x 49 Ring<BR>
In keeping with its fine Connecticut Shade wrapper, this cigar evokes 
elegance and finesse. A light background sweetness comes from its Dominican tobacco and 
balanced, earthy flavors come from its Mexican tobacco. As a result, a single malt that 
balances its malt and peat is the ideal pairing. Try the whiskies of Highland Park or the Isle of Jura. <P>

<CENTER><img src="cig5.gif"></CENTER><br>
<B>Canario d'Oro Lonsdale</B> <BR>
6 1/2" x 43 Ring<BR>
If you're wondering what to pair with your treasured Islay malts, try this full-bodied 
cigar made with Mexican and Dominican tobaccos. The maduro wrapper balances the intense 
spice of the blend, a roasted nuttiness permeates the smoke and an Islay malt such as 
Laphroag or Lagorulin smoothes the edges. Their smoke and peat fit the
after-dinner character of this cigar.<P>

your brother in law that Mont.#2 and on the way over it combusted and all the smoke went

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Cass - What a fool you are!  Chicago?  The best city in America?!?  The place is an armpit!!  Big buildings do not a great city make.  For your approval, some of the cities of the US that could actually be considered "The Best":  New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Las Vegas, Denver.  Now these are GREAT cities!  My personal favorite is "The City", San Franciso.  Anybody else have a favorite?</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Lets see. Holts is one of the biggest and most established cigar shops in the UNITED STATES. They will sell in excess of 4 million cigars on the Ashton label alone (their own cigar). They are back-ordered and having trouble getting cigars. Surely you won't have any trouble getting cigars.</B><P>

MODEL), limited production Z-Car, [FUENTE OPUS X CIGARS] are in fact limited
in production, You will [NOT] buy for 5%, 10%, or in some cases 30%. It
all boils down to this. A good deal is in the mind of the buyer. If he
(or she SUZI F.) knows a goos smoke and is willing to pay a premium to
have it around (and Opus are worth havin around), so be it. Some things
in life are worth the premium they get. The 10% bird don't fly in this

Jeff, and Brian, no offense, but if you've been here for any amount of

is unequaled here. Kudos for your recent procurement of the Opus X, but

<B>See the humidor threads below.  If it's a really good looking box it might be worth keeping.  You might want to line it  or re-line it with Spanish cedar.  Then add a credo or home-made humidifier with a PG/water mix.  A decent hygrometer will complete the job.  I'm currently making a humidor out of an antique cigar box that is thick, solid Spanish cedar. It looks great sealed with 4 coats of polyurethane on the outside and then a coat of paste wax.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I too have an old humidor that has metal lining.  The only 
problem is someone painted it silver :(   I've placed some 
cedar inserts in it and it works just fine for my smaller 
smokes.  The metal helps to keep the RH in and stops some 
leaking you might find with the older humidors. Pop in
a credo and you should be set for short term staorage or place
some spanish cedar inserts if you plan on long term storage.
Best of luck and Happy Holidays!</B><P>

<B>Yes, but read many of the other threads in this sight 
related to temporary or low-budget humidors. As a an old-
Newbie, I have found them to be very useful.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The wooden box will warp very quickly. I've been using a
TupperWare box with a few pieces of a wooden box inside for
seasoning. The big problem with the tupperware is that it
is TOO airtight and even with a small credo I over-humidify.
I wind up taking the credo out every other day</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>newbie, another good temp. humidor is the pleiades box.  it has a hp 70 humistat in it.  check with you local tobacconist.  sometime if you are lucky they will give them to you or may have to pay $3.00.  it makes a good traveling humidor also.  good luck.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Thanks guys! We all appreciate that. I've met more people through smoking cigars. Mostly men who are simply curious to what kind I'm enjoying. And, I can honestly say I've had no mean or rude comments so far. I do, however, wish that the women who are trying cigars for the first time would at least try to act confident in the new experience. (Most men seem to have accomplished this) I just hate seeing a woman complain that hers has gone out, and hold it like it were a bug!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>You know, that quote doesn't do it for me.  Maybe I misinterpret, but it makes me like women more
and cigars less.  I mean, a cigar will soon be smoke, but a woman will always be a mysterious, attractive,

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I smoked my first cigar with a girl and it was, well, great.
She was a waitress at my favorite cigar bar, here in Palm Springs.
It was very slow, so on her lunch break she sat down with me. She lit a
Tinder Box Reserve, and when she put the cigar up to her red lipstick, like George of Seinfeld would say- "I think it moved" :)
She was very attractive, and great company. I even weaseled a couple
of free Bourbon and cokes off her. So---I guess you can say 
I appreciate a women cigar smoker.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Nothing.  I've never seen a woman smoking a cigar that looked natural.  On the other hand, I've never seen a man smoking a cigar that didn't look natural smoking one.  I certainly don't object to women smoking cigars I just don't find anything attractive in it.  Same holds true with pipes.  Ladies please don't take offense.  We need feedback from the other side of the fence, what do the ladies like about a man with a cigar ???</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I think men with cigars are great. Especially if they have a good personality to go with the "look"! I see some guys that are obviousely smoking a cigar becuase everyone else is. But, for the most part, a well dressed man, smoking a good cigar is FABULOUS!</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Now don't go reading anything Freudian into this, but I think the size of the cigar makes a difference.  I think a woman smoking a lancero, or one of the smaller ring gauges presents a much more attractive image than one smoking a double corona or a robusto.  The way a woman holds a cigar also makes a difference.  If she holds it as if she were examining an extaordinary piece of jewelry, I assure you, she will look elegant. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>It's quite obvious to me, at first glance, whether or not a man is smoking a cigar because he sincerely enjoys it, or becase it's the thing to do.  After that has been defined...a gentleman cigar smoker denotes a certain aire of elegance and sophistication.  It's generally this gentleman that I prefer the company of because we share the appreciation for the finer luxuries in life.  Rather than the sports crazed beer guzzeling pig that's trying too hard to act cool.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Bingo, Angie! I also agree about the size of a cigar. But I do really like a corona, Gran Corona or Lonsdale.. When I smoke a cigar, I tend to REALLY try to be more feminine. It sounds stupid, but I hold my cigar between my thumb and ring finger. That way, I get the pinky lift, and index and middle.. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>OK, here's my pet peeve about cigar smokers.  It is obvious who knows what they're doing.  Watching
people tap their cigar on the ash tray after every puff drives me nuts.  I don't know why, but sometimes
I want to grab them by the lapels, shake them vigorously, and then apologize.  Luckily, I'm a big guy, so I get
away with silly behavior like that.  Just kidding.  But I have actually considered bringing along little print-outs of my
top 10 things that real cigar smokers do, and hand them out to those who need help.</B><P>

<B>There is something I do want to get off my chest.  The city
of San Francisco is using tax money to post signs and air
TV commercials comparing cigars to dog excrement in the
belief that this will discourage cigar smoking.  I buy
virtually all my cigars at Alfred Dunhill in San Francisco,
so I am paying for this through the local sales tax, which
makes this particularly galling.  I feel like I'm a victim 
of extortion (any lawyers out there willing to sue the city
on a contingency fee basis?).  I know, I could buy elsewhere,
but I can't abandon the place where I've been buying cigars
for over 10 years.  Of course, if we had trade with Cuba,
the city would use tax dollars to encourage cigar smoking
in order to help their beloved Fidel Castro (San Francisco
loves to conduct its own foreign policy, blithely ignoring
the U.S. constitution).  Those of you who live where elected
officials have a proper respect for the role of government
and the taxpayers' money should consider yourselves 
fortunate.     </B><P>

you realize the throat of S.F. is held by the Castro district..........

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Next time I'm in San Francisco, I'll light up as I'm 
walking along Fisherman's Wharf.  Willie Brown (their
mayor) has taken plenty of money from the tobacco companies
(the cigarette kind, that is) so if anyone doesn't like it
I'll remind them of who owns the mayor.  I'll also remind
them of how SFans are supposed to be "tolerant" of different
lifestyles.  The SF Board of Stupidvisors can all go to

signs, and I'll be sure to display facial expressions of
pleasure (which won't be difficult).  My wife has been

to it.  Given that policy that that city has come up, it
makes me even more glad the 49ers lost.  Go Packers! </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>There is a segment of the population that cannot stand to see anyone else enjoying themselves. It seems to center around the notion that it is wrong to engage in a pleasurable, self-indulgent activity so long as there are still some people suffering somewhere, anywhere!!  I call them the Pleasure Police and it seems to me they might not have so much free time for this if they were out working long hard hours like the rest of us to try to provide the best for ourselves and our families. I subscribe to the viewpoint that they have something to learn from the rest of us, not the other way around. Cigar smokers stand strong and proud and we will prevail over this willie-nillie nonsense!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Beancounter:  right on!!  And I'll tell you something else
about the screwy politics of SF:  they think it's GREAT that
they have a "Cannabis Buyers Club" whose sole existence is 
to invent medical needs for marijuana (to therefore justify
its legalization) and they bitch and moan about the state
attorney general shutting them down.  Then they tell us we
can't have cigars!!!  I think you're being kind in calling
them "Pleasure Police".  I call them "Nazis".  They sure
can't stand it when they meet someone who thinks or do
things different, yet they're damned insistent that everyone
all think alike when it comes to "diversity".  These 
hypocrites preach endlessly about the "need" to "tolerate"
different "alternative" lifestyles but they can't so much
as stand it when they actually encounter someone who thinks
different.  If they can "tolerate" people walking down 
Market Street wearing G-strings in their annual June parade
then surely they can "tolerate" cigar smokers!!!  I haven't
been to SF in years but I am seriously thinking of going
there just to light up.  Maybe all the cigar smokers who
can get there ought to meet there one day, and march down
Market Street with lit cigars!  If there's room for the
Cannabis Buyer's Club then there's room for us!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Joseph Barnyard you are on the money. The Cannabis Buyers Club plays to 
human emotions, soothe our pain. The problem I have with the Cannabis law is
it exploited cancer patients. They new H.I.V. would be interpreted as the "dirty" disease,
thus resulting in non-acceptance. There is an irony in accepting cannabis and educating the public
that a cigar is dog excrement.</B><P>

although I would in fact consider a lawsuit if I were a 
tobacconist in San Francisco.  This strikes me as being
similar to the Beck case, except that a government instead 
of a union is "extorting" the money (Buzz, care to 
comment?).  Everybody's comments here confirms San 
Francisco's poor reputation, which saddens me a bit.  I've
lived here for 14 years and enjoyed every minute of it.  
If you do visit and can get past the nitwits, nimcompoops
and knuckleheads, you will find there are some great
tobacconists and some wonderful places, both indoors and
outdoors, to have a smoke.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Obnoxio....  I think that the marijuana issue is more of the latter.  Folks are trying to justify smoking it.  On a forum on CIS, I was having a discussion with a couple of doctors (MD's) and an opthamologist. All three agreed that in the past there was a serious need in certain circumstances for the use of THC, but since those studies were made, there are better drugs developed and now on the market to alleviate certain medical problems.  Two that spring to mind from that conversation are Glaucoma, and Chemotherapy distress.  Both now have much better drugs for alleviating pain/distress with less side effects than THC.  As for the city of SF....  If i'm ever back there again, I'll be sure to smoke cigars much more in public than usual due to their assinine adds <g>.</B><P>

and this is a gross misuse of yor money.</B><P>

<B>A Visit With Cigar Master<BR>
Benjam&iacute;n Men&eacute;ndez</B>
<P>

CIGAR WORLD: Do you think you were born to be a cigar maker?<BR>
MEN&eacute;NDEZ: My father certainly thought so. So did my uncles and my gandfather. They were all cigar 
makers.<BR><img align=right src="men.gif">
<BR>
CIGAR WORLD: Where and when did you make your first cigars?<BR>
MEN&eacute;NDEZ: In Havana. In the early 1950s.<BR>

<BR>
CIGAR WORLD: With what company?<BR>
MEN&eacute;NDEZ: My family's company -- Men&eacute;ndez Garcia y Cia.<BR>
<BR>
CIGAR WORLD: Which brands?<BR>
MEN&eacute;NDEZ: We made several, and the most famous were H. Upmann and Montecristo.<BR>
<BR>
CIGAR WORLD: When did you leave Cuba?<BR>
MEN&eacute;NDEZ: November 26th, 1960.<BR>
<BR>
CIGAR WORLD: Where did you make cigars after that?<BR>
MEN&#180;ENDEZ: I was in the Canary Islands for 15 years and Brazil for six years. Then, in 1983, Edgar 
Cullman -- who had known my family for many years -- asked me to come to General Cigar Company as a 
consultant. A year later, things had worked out so well, I was asked to oversee the production of Macanudo 
cigars on a full-time basis.<BR>
<BR>
CIGAR WORLD: Do you have a favorite Macanudo?<BR>
MEN&eacute;NDEZ: The Baron de Rothschild is my favorite. And I also like the Hyde Park.<BR>
<BR>
CIGAR WORLD: Is there any one word that best describes a Macanudo?<BR>
MEN&eacute;NDEZ: Yes, the word is mellow. And by mellow, I mean a smooth, well
rounded, perfectly balanced taste that makes you want to savor the experience.<BR>
<BR>
CIGAR WORLD: True cigar taste?<BR>
MEN&#180;ENDEZ: That's right.<BR>
<BR>
CIGAR WORLD: What about the Connecticut Shade wrapper leaves? Why does General Cigar grow its own?<BR>
MEN&eacute;NDEZ: We want only the very best Connecticut Shade. And the only way to guarantee that we get it 
is to grow it. By doing that, we control every phase of the tobacco process.<BR>
<BR>
CIGAR WORLD: Is there anything else that makes General Cigar's Connecticut Shade unique?<BR>
MEN&eacute;NDEZ: We are the only company that ages the leaves a second time, just the way it used to be done 
decades ago in Cuba.<BR>
<BR>
CIGAR WORLD: And what does that extra aging do for as cigar?<BR>
MEN&eacute;NDEZ: It makes a cigar as mellow as a cigar can be.<BR>

<h1>And The Runner-Ups Are...</h1>
<p>
<h2>Thank you to everyone who participated in Cigar World's Oh-What-I-Go-Through-To-Smoke- Cigars Contest.  Here are the Runner-Up entries:</h2>

<B>Christopher Stephens from Kent, WA</B><BR>
Here's what Christopher wrote on Mar 6, 96 0:6:34 . . .
I can't smoke in the house because my wife complains, so I always smoke
outside or in the garage. I love smoking a good cigar and doing yard work. My
wife noticed this behavior and now encourages me to smoke - outside doing
yard work that is! We have the best looking yard in the neighborhood! Now I'm
happy, my wife's happy, and the yard looks great!  
<P>

<B>Dan Leadbetter from Costa Mesa CA</b><br>
Here's what Dan wrote on Dec 14, 95 . . .
I'm in quarantine again. I just finished a Partagas 150 AA. My lovely wife
hates the smell of cigars. I tell her I don't small a thing. My wife says the
only way I'll get in the house is if I strip down, put my clothes in a
plastic bag, take three breath assure and take a long hot shower with lye
soap. Then and only then will she let me get in bed. Thank God for Vaseline
intensive care
lotion. Thank God I only smoke 5 days a week. Thank God my skin only takes
two days to heal. 
<P>

<B>Philip Gamm from Boca Raton, FL</b><br>
Here's what Philip wrote on Nov 28, 95 . . .
When I lived in New York, my wife didn't like me smoking in the house,
especially in the winter. She wanted me to smoke outside. So, I always
volunteered to walk the dog and I would take a Prince Philip with me and walk
until I almost finished the cigar. I would sometimes drag the dog home after
two hours of walking in 25 degree weather in the snow.
<P>
Now I live in Sunny Florida and I still walk the dog with a Prince Philip in
my hand. I treat my Macanudos like my American Express card - I don't leave
the house without them!!

<P><B>I have smoked a number of Macanudo Prince Philip cigars. I find then
to be both enjoyable and economical. I have thought about trying a Macanudo
vin cab, such as a number one or a number five. I am wondering if the difference

<B>I smoked a Vin Cab last night (first one).  I found this 
to be a smooth and enjoyable smoke, but for $15 a pop I 
won't be smoking very many of these.  I liked the cigar,
but I like the H. Upmann Monarch just as well, and the 
Monarchs are around $7 each.  </B><P>

<B>Today I went to a cigar shop to pick up a few special cigars for some friends. Of the particular cigar I wanted, there were just 10 left of the last box. There happened to be a gentleman (that's being generous) who was making a BIG deal about being with one of the BIG hotels in town and was buying cigars for a BIG party. He had a couple boxes of Habana Golds, a box of Macanudo Portofinos, lots of La Unicas, the last 10 Partagas 10's, the last box and a half of Partagas 1's and 2's, some Carribean Rounds and some Old Fashioned Macanudo seconds. When I reached for the '59 Vintage Punch Robustos, he asked me if I like them. I told him yes, very much and I was buying a few for presents. He said that's too bad, that he needed them for his BIG party. I told him that he was welcome to what I didn't buy, but that he had no claims on them since he was at the other end of the humidor, looking at seconds when I reached for them. He told the shop owner that if he couldn't get all ten of them he would buy somewhere else. The shop owner incicated to him, rather bluntly, where the door was. Chris, the shop owner, told him I was a regular customer and he had no claim on any cigar in the store. Any way, I told the guy I wanted only six of them and he was welcome to the rest. He said he was only interested in sets of ten or more. I got so fed up with the SOB that I bought all ten. Then I gave one to Chris  to smoke "on me". I later found out the man spent $740, mostly on seconds and bundled cigars. When he found out what the Habana Golds, Macanudos and Partagas' were selling for, he put them back. These people should be against the law. I have since called the hotel he mentioned and talked to the manager about the incident. He does work there and will probaly be "pulled in on the carpet" for his actions.   Anyway, I have a few more great smokes to put away now and a better appreciation for my tobacconist. Has anybody ever had a similar experience?  Merry Christmas to All. BE SAFE.</B><P>

<B>What a fool.  I hope that guy gets chewed out, especially if it was a classy hotel.  Must not be
if they're handing out seconds and bundles for their party.  I was once in my favorite cigar shop, happily
looking through a newly stocked humidor.  A man walked in dressed in yellow polo, blue blazer, white shorts,
loafers.  This guy thought he was big money, and may have been, but he was little class.  He took a look around, obviously
not knowing what he was looking at, and stormed out to get an attendant.  I chuckled in his direction.  The man came back
in with one of the attendants, and said he only wanted big, long, expensive cigars.  The tobacconist pointed out several good cigars
and indicated a wide range of tastes and countries.  The man said "Ok, you wrap all those up."  Then he went to the register to wait.  I finished my
selection and went to the register.  The man was saying, "....and add your most expensive humidor."  The man spent about $1,000 and when he left the store,
I said, "It must be great having customers like that."  The man behind the counter laughed, and then commended me on my selection (San Luis Rey, Excal #1, Onyx
650, Mi cubano, La Unica #100, Flor de Gonzales).  I'm glad that these tobacconists are making money, but get a little upset when people buy their way into a hobbie.  Being
a life-long golfer, and spending years working at a country club, I've seen lots of this behaivor.  Luckily, money will never buy class or experience, so that we
can all tell people that truly love their hobbies.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Al:
A pogue is a term used by military airwing people, usually used to describe knuckleheads, doofuses, etc. A good example would be a person who does not fly, and has no affiliation whatsoever with aviation, but, has a leather flight jacket complete with patches and sea stories to boot. This can also be used to describe the person in the bar who insists on how great Cuban cigars are, but cant name a single one. Get it?</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>people like the man in your experience should be banned from
cigar/tobacco stories and publicly identified as the pretentious
losers they are. there are plenty of good smokes to go around.
the true enjoyment of cigar smoking and collecting, just like
wine, is sharing the experience with friends and fellow aficionados.
if this guy thinks it's all about impressing his customers with
his clearly inferior knowledge of cigars, then that's his loss.
however, i would think a guy like that would be bad for business
and the storeowner's reaction was justified and on the money. i'm glad
i found this site!</B><P>

So I reached into my pocket and whipped out a cigar and offered it to the owner...we laughed,  then together went to the cafe across the way for a sip of latte.  I wish I could sell down to the last bean....Santa are you listening?</B><P>

<B>You'll have to forgive me but I'm just a NEWBIE.  I also 
have a wife and family.  I need to budget my cigar expenses.
I'm sure that many of you understand that buying cigars can
border addiction.  I need to budget my cigar money and would
rather buy a good cigar.  If I'm lucky Santa will get me a 
nice humidor for Christmas, but, for now I keep my cigars in 
a couple nice wooden cigar boxes that I purchased at my 
cigar store.  I've sanded, varnished, etc until they look 
very nice and let them air until there is no lingering paint
odor and added a humidity system.  Will this work or am I in
danger of putting my little friends to a horrible death?
Why are humidors so expensive?  I understand that some use 
very rare and expensive wood and are well crafted, but, am I
missing something.  Is there some secret like in a 
Stratevarius violin.  Is there a special finish that 
breaths or something?  Can I use one of these boxes until
I can put enough non cigar money away for a hmidor?  Also
what is the advantage of distilled water over tap and what 
is that PG stuff? 
odor. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Newbie - I think you've headed in the right direction in regards to storing your smokes.  Old cigar boxes are perfect.  My only concern is that the finish you applied might still continue emit odors while it continues to cure.  This could have a very adverse affect on your smokes.  While letting those boxes cure for a while longer, pick up another couple of old boxes and *don't* finish them.  Store a few smokes in the cured and a few in the non-cured for a few weeks.  Then, smoke from both storage systems and note any differences.  And don't forget the Spanish Cedar.  Humidors are so expensive these days because they can be made of rare woods, take hours to complete, are true pieces of furniture if completed properly, and people are willing to pay such prices for these things!!  As for favoring distilled over tap water:  Tap water has impurities (minerals, salts, chlorine, flouride, odors) that can be transfered to your smokes, which produces bad tastes.  PG is propylene glycol (sp?) and is used in a 50%/50% mixture with distilled water to provide a perfect humidity balance within your humidor.  Your pharmacist can sell PG to you over the counter for cheap.  Credo sells this stuff at a premium and calls it Credo Juice.  Save your money.  If you enjoyed finishing your own cigar boxes and it worked out well, the Fuji Cigar WebPage has listings for humidor manufacturers.  A couple of them sell their humidors unfinished and at a much reduced price.  Good Luck!</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Newbie. Your interim solution is probably satisfactory. The reason you want to use distilled water is its lack of additives and chemicals which can affect the performance of the PG solution. PG's natural properties cause it to reabsorb water above 70% humidity and release it below 70%. This is a chemical property and can be altered by chlorine or other impurities. I forget what PG stands for but the G part is "glycol".</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Newbie, don't forget to rotate or "turn over" your cigars on a bi-weekly basis, especially if you're using a discarded cigar box as a make-shift humidor.  Typically, your smokes are in close proximity to the humidification souce because of the relatively small size of a cigar box.  Therefore, those closer to the humidification source tend to over-humidify if they are not turned over regularly.  Also, its not a bad idea to leave your box open for twenty-four hours after you've turned over your cigars,  to give them and the box a chance to "freshen".  Hope this helps.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>wow i din't know there was so much work put into storing a keeping cigars.  i pay $60 a year at my local tobacconist to store my stogies in a locked box on the stores membership humidor.  $60 bucks is a whole lot cheaper but i admit it isn't as convienient.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>A great idea for any one using a make shift humidor is to pour the 50-50 solution of 
P.G. and water into one of those green foam/sponge type things that florists use to put 
flowers in. They holda tremendous amount of liquid and work great.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>HELP!!! I'm looking for a reasonably priced cabinet humidor  about 5 or 6 ft. tall about 3-4 ft. wide to store boxes of cigars. I found one at a shop in Texas and it was made by "Ashley"? has anyone heard of these humidors and are they any good??? It's a display humidor with glass front and sides.</B><P>

<P><B>While I have not found any way to ELIMINATE smoke odor, I have found
a way to control it. First, if you have central air, pick a room that has
a intake and out-take vents. I picked a small room so that the air would
be re-circulated faster. Next I purchased a Hunter 30100 air cleaner. It
is a model meant for medium sized rooms, so by putting it in the small
room I get better performance.(alledgedly it cleans the air in the room
six times an hour, as opposed to three times in a larger room) I run the
Hunter at full speed while I am smoking and at half speed when I am not.
I have not found it necessary to run it all day because I do not smoke
non-stop, if you do, run it full speed all the time. This seems to work
for me and my situation. I do not know exactly why it works or if it will
work for anyone else. So if anyone runs out and spends 100$ on an air cleaner
and they are not satisfied, sorry. </B></P>

<B>A friend just returned from South America with what he claims are Cohiba Robustos. I have the labels and I want to check for authenticity. I once saw a web site that compares real Cohiba bands to fake ones with pictures, but I can't find it. Anybody else been there and can help me out? </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I have read so much literature on how to identify fake Cohibas and all is useless...Labels and Boxes can be stolen from factories. Just smoke the stoogie if you have it! That is the only way to know if it is fake or not.  If you are not allowed to sample a cigar from the box you are considering to buy or if you can't identify the  flavor of a Cohiba, you better stay away from dubious source Cohibas. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>TC...Thanks for the web page reference. It is beautiful page. One more thing that you should consider is that in South America you can buy Cohiba rejects and even if the box does not have the proper factory codes they are Cohiba after all. That is why is so important to get to know how the Cohiba really taste. Bye now..Good Luck with your cigar.</B><P>

cellophane wrapped. A carton of Cohibas(25) consists of 5 packages of 5 individual cellophane
boxed cigars.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Well, I'm not too suprised to be in agreement with KBW again.  The two times I've seen
Cohiba Robustos, they have not had cello on them.  Maybe ya'll are talking about the same thing, and
maybe the tobacconist at the shops I visited overseas removed the cello from the 5-pack, but The Indian's question
definately meant is each one individually celloed, and the answer is KBW's, no.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>KBW, Thanks for the web reference. That's a great web site. What do you think: My friend paid approx. $15 a pop for the Cohiba Robustos in South America. Does that price pretty much take them out of the running as authentic?  Or could they be the rejects that Ram refers to above? And if they are real, why are they so cheap? I haven't seen them on any order form for less than $20.00 each. Is that commercial mark up?</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by The Indian at  on Friday, January 10 at 06:13 PM EST<p></FONT></TT>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The Indian, Cuban don't have set prices. If they were from Spain that price is pretty close. I don't know pricing in South America. Cohiba has taste of it own no other cigar in the world taste like one let your taste bud tell you.</B><P>

<h2>THE ART OF THE CIGAR</h2></center>
<blockquote>
<IMG align=left hspace=10 SRC="../gif/film.gif">
The film with everything that everyone wants to know about cigars.
There has never been a film like "The Art of the Cigar."
In 75 entertaining minutes this brand new documentary with a classic-jazz sound track capture the essence of premium cigar making and the spirit of today's growing legion of cigar aficionados.<p>

You will learn how the premium wrapper leaves are grown, harvested, cured and aged for Macanudo cigars in the fertile Connecticut Valley.<p>

You will see how Partagas cigars are bunched, wrapped and rolled entirely by hand in the Dominican Republic.  You will hear the insights of prominent experts such as cigar master Benjamin Menendez, tobacco agriculturalist Daniel Nunez, cigar executive Edgar Cullman and publisher Marvin Shaken.<p> 

In addition, host Paul Sorvino (Goodfellas, The Firm, Nixon) heads an all star cast of cigar loving men and women including Jim Belushi, Joe Pantoliano (The Fugitive, Risky Business), Jack Scalia (Shattered Image), Michael Nouri (Victor Victoria, Flashdance), Catherine Oxenberg (Dynasty, Charles and Diana), John Amos (Good Times, Die Hard II), the great Milton Berle, singer Englebert Humperdinck, sportcaster Pat O'Brien and artist LeRoy Neiman, all of whom share their thoughts on the pleasures of premium cigars.<p>

Directed by documentary filmaker John Talamini and produced by Justine McKay of V2 Film &Vision, "The Art of the Cigar" is packaged with "Jazz from 'The Art of the Cigaar," a comprehensive CD featuring 14 jazz classics by Chet Baker, Stan Getz, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Astrud Gilberto and others that were excerpted from the film.<p>

The suggested retail is just $39.95.  So stop by your nearest tobacco shop. Or charge the $39.95 plus $2.95 for shipping and handling with a Visa or MasterCard credit card by calling: 1-800-761-9126.

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Ren, I've found that Grgich Hills' 1992 Sonoma
Valley Red Zinfandel is an excellent wine to drink with cigars. We split
a case with a friend every year and have never been disappointed. It is
very rich-spirited and lingers well on the palate. I think you will be
pleased.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Greg and Ob, Beaujolais is a fine wine region
in France. There are many qualities of wines in that area. I find that
the Beaujolais Nouveau (new Beaujolais)is a very young wine, made to drink
the same year, cheap, tasting mainly the &quot;grape&quot;as we say in
french but can be very pleasant. Never tried it with a cigar, since the
cigar would override the wine.</B></P>

Need No wine cellar just a nice kitchen rack. Ren, with these guys I could
kick back and chat up a storm, sip the glass until the bottle give no more...than
3 others and smoke until my shirt looks like the embers of the pit fire
we created. Now let's grab Peter and have him take us to the duck blind.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Beaujolais is a little light to drink w/ almost any cigar - even something as light as a macanudo.  I think Port is too sweet to go w/ cigars but most people disagreew/ me.  A spicier red (like a red zin or a pinot noir) seems to stand-up to the tobacco.  Quite honestly, wine is not the best beverage to go w/ cigars despite the type of the wine.  A stronger beer, cognac, or distilled spirit seems to hold its own against cigars more consistently.</B><P>

Manischewitz concord, used to make the most of the moment at

to do better and am aware of the despicable quality of this
wine, I still have a soft spot in my heart for the beverage.
I have tasted many white wines since then, but for some reason I still
love Concords as well as the occasional Sandeman's or Fonseca.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>CC...I too have a sweet tooth in wines.  My youth was spent with a wine making father who would use any type of fruit to make his blend.  We were offered wine at every meal.  Even today I find it difficult to bear dinner at a home that offers no wine on the table...mind you I am not picky nor do I even play wine etiquette at home but I do demand it of my servers at the restaurant.</B><P>

<B>I am using a large Tupperware box with a Credo as a humidor.
(yes I know, but my wife promises to buy me one for xmas). I wonder
if I am OVER-Humidifying my cigars. I have about 12 in the box
but the last few seem to be "hard to draw" and dont burn
well. It MAY be the cigars or it may be overhumidified.

How you tell? What are the signs of overhumidified cigars?

<B>Hard to draw is definitely a sign of over humidification.  If they're really bad, you be able to taste the moisture as you draw.  You didn't say which Credo you're using or how large the Tupperware container is, but I think the smallest one is for 25 cigars or so.  You should fill up your Tupperware with smokes!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>if they are over-humidified they might be spongy too.  When squeezed
delicately, you can definately feel an over-humidified cigar.  Leaving the
tupperware cracked can help, but a hygrometer will tell you it the humidity
is too high.  If you're getting a humidor soon, you'll probably want a hygrometer
anyway.  Many humidors come with them, but some don't.  You could get your hygrometer
now and save those stogies by Christmas with ease.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Daniel - You've discovered two ways of confirming your cigars are too wet:  Hard draw and frequent re-lighting required.  I think the Credo is overkill for a dozen cigars.  I recommend replacing it with a moist cotton ball and leaving the lid cracked.  Because it's cooler, you'll have to check the moisture every 3 or 4 days.  When Santa delivers your real humidor, put the Credo in there and stock that baby up!</B><P>

<H2>Fuentes 858 Going Bad?</H2>

<P><B>Tell me it's not true! I just finished an 858 that I bought last
week. The taste was decent but I couldn't keep it lit!! It went out three
times before I gave up on it with about fifty percent left. Please tell
me it was a fluke as this is (was?) one of my favorite economic smokes.
Has anybody else experienced this lately?</B></P>

<HR><FORM method=POST action="FuentesGoingBad.pl"><B>I just lit up my first
858 and am quite disapointed, the draw on it was frustrating to say the
least. I will try again at another time and if my experience is similar
then I dont know if I will try one again. I wonder what would be said if
these type cigars are returned to the dealer, wonder if he would replace
the baddies? Hmm, makes me think!</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Randy &amp; Guido, I hope this is just a fluke.
I have a couple of boxes in my humidor aging &amp; smoke at least 2 858s
every weekend. I have not had any problem as far as staying lit or having
a hard draw. I would suspect that it may have something to do with your
tobacconist storage of the cigars. Take a look at his hygrometer the next
time you are in his humidor &amp; if you notice it is not pretty close
to 72RH let him know, he will probably appreciate it.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>It was probably a fluke. I've never had a bad
one. Guido, IMHO the 8-5-8 starts out with a draw which is a little tight,
but seems to ease up as the cigar burns. Yours may have been too wet. If
you pulled it right out of your tobacconist's humidor and it was a fresh
shipment, it would probably be wetter than it should. Generally, it's a
good idea to let a cigar sit in your humidor for a while (a couple of days
to a week, unless it needs aging) before smoking.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>All I can say is, it had a hard draw from beging
to end, my forehead was starting to hurt. The tobacconist was a new one
for me, His cigar room was packed, cigars were all over the place. I felt
the cigars and gently squeezed them, I felt hard spots near the head of
the cigar, I asked him about that and he said may it was rolled to tight,
wadda I know?</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Ok, I think the problem is the Tobaconist, I bought
4 cigars that day and 2 were montesino, I smoked the montesino about 1
hour ago and it was horrible, not at all like the other Monties I have
smoked, it was a very hot smoke. I will not buy cigars there any more.
No wonder he has Cigars all over that room piled on each other, he must
not be selling them.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I picked up a box of 8-5-8's last week and smoked
one as soon as they arrived. The cigar smoked well. At about 1/3 of the
way I let it go out. When I re-lit it I must have got it too hot and it
swelled and split about 3/4&quot; of the wrapper. Once I got past that
it was fine again. The next one I smoked last night. No construction problems.
The only problem was my wife. She kept wanting to take it away and keep
it to herself. Best $71 spent in a while.</B></P>

If so - where. I tried my local shops and they either say they it is on
back order or I just missed them. The 8-5-8 Maduro are in my top five affordable
favorite smokes. I looking to pick up a box, especially at that price you

Yep, 858's are some of the best I've found. The draw shouldn't be tight

<B>Mongo...I never dip the cap into a beverage like brandy.  Often I will take a little upon my finger or use a stirring straw to place a trickle in the area my lips touch to savor the drink.  Cognac, brandy, some dry wines and even Dr Pepper seem good to me in this fashion.  PS...I never had Dr. Pepper until Garfish mentioned it in the non-alcoholic thread.  It is now on tap at every location I manage and people are trying and buying the stuff....hint hint to you cigar bar owners</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>It seems to me that dipping a cigar in brandy (or beverage) would damage the cap or cause it to unravel by loosening the glue.  I love to drink and smoke, but separately.  However, it is said, that Winston Churchill used to dip his cigars in cognac so that he could enjoy his two favorite pleasures while riding horseback.  Just a bit of history for you.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Well, I haven't had any problem with the wrapper loosening... and it seems
not to affect the draw at all.  I think I'll have to try the Dr. Pepper for when
my buddy with the fake ID can't get me brandy.  I personally don't drink brandy
straight, but on the end of a cigar, it is very nice.  I'm considering trying
other liquors on a few of my less expensive cigars (wouldn't want to screw
with a favorite).

<P><B>i know there have been previous posts on topics similar to this one,
but mine is a little different. My question is: Is it uncommon to have
to fill a credo once a week at first after buying a new humidor. I used
pg solution and sprayed the interior of the humidor with distilled water

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>If your humidor is new then spraying it's interior
only once is not sufficient. It will take about a week of daily sprays
for the wood to reach equilibrium with the surrounding air in the humi.
You are filling your credo often because the wood is absorbing the moisture
at a much fasyer rate than normal in its effort to reach this state of
equilibrium which I previously spoke of. Take your time and it will get
there. As far as the 50/50 solution goes, the PG refers to propelyne glycol.
It can be purchased from just about any drug store or pharmacist for pretty
much nothing and helps maintain the 70% r.h. which you need for the optimum
condition of your smokes. Happy smoking.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>If you go over to the 'Cigars In The News' section
of this site and read an article called 'Inside The Wrapper', you will
begin to get an idea of why Connecticut Shade Grown is so desirable as
a wrapper. ...Also, if you happen to fly into BDL ( Bradley Airport, serving
the Hartford, CT / Springfield, MA area) during the summer, look out the
window of the plane and all the fields you see covered in a white or yellow
cloth tent will be the shade grown wrapper under cultivation. The humidity
and temperature are high under the tents, The work cultivating the lower
leaves of the plants and 'succering' them is not very pleasant sometimes.
It is performed by Jamaican, Puerto Rican and other seasonal farm workers,
and by generations of teenagers in the valley, as their summer jobs. It
is work that has gone on for generations around the Connecticut River Valley
and is a part of the heritage and lore of the area. The Connecticut River
Valley, where most of this wrapper leaf is grown, is not a very large valley.
It stretches from lower Vermont through to Long island Sound. Most of the
shade grown tobacco comes, however, from the area between lower Massachussets
and Hartford, CT. Unfortunately, real estate development, urban and suburban
sprawl, and, for many years, declining tobacco prices, ate their way into
the land suitable for shade grown farming. To top that off, tobacco must
be rotated with other crops to restore the soil so it is not an 'every
year' crop. Yes, Garfish, there are plenty of rocks in Connecticut. However,
the valley floor is alluvial owing to the snowmelt from Canada, Vermont
and New Hampshire. The valley floor is rich and fertile. The foothills
on both sides help control extreme temperature swings during the growing
season, for the most part, and hail is not a constant threat. Hope this
explains a little bit about the subject. </B></P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>In response to Dan's question, ( better late than never) IMHO Ashton makes a great cigar that uses a connecticut shade wrapper although made in the D.R.. A good smoke made in the USA with a Connecticut shade wrapper is the Flor de Gonzales. I like the torpedo ( a little costly at $7.00 each for a domestic cigar), not my idea of an every day smoke, but good. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>A lot of this increase in price is due to the newbies and the
media elite that created this sudden interest in cigars, but 
remeber that there are many new brands out there. All that tobacco must come from somewhere, and you can't produce as much quality
piloto cuban o as the suppliers want, making prices higher. Additionally, in
the rush to take advantage of the fad, prices may be jacked unfairly. As for Opus X, I'd definitely give the Hemingway and Gran Reserva line a look,
but the Opus, nice as it is, is simply too costly. For the prices I see them for, I could get
a Don Tito or Gloria Cubana, the two non-Cuban's I'll pay that much to buy.
Try to find some good seconds, if you can ( seconds are often being put into frontline
production to compensate for demand ), or devise a way to get 
a relatively less popular cigar that you can stick with. Some of my faves ( Licenciados ) could well
be in the Opus X range, with such quality as they have, but they don't tend to sell
as much. Thus it is harder to buy them, but less costly once I do.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>everyone has their own favorites, and if he puts Licenciados in the same
range as Opus X, he is by far luckier than the rest of us.  In fact, it seems
like many cigar smokers tend to "think" they like the cigars that are hardest to 
get and most expensive, as if they feel like they should like it.  I think some blind
taste tests would introduce people to new favorites and less expensive alternatives.
I'm not knocking the Opus X, or people that enjoy them, it's just that I see everybody 
scrambling for Hemingway's and Opus X when they haven't even tried a fraction of what is
out there.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Thank you for acknowledging those humble truths, drew. I know
most people don't think of Licenciados as a front-line good
cigar in the Opus comparison range, nor have many people even
smoked them. I love their Churchill as much as some Cubans, and
if that works for me, what's wrong with that? I like getting
two to three times as much cigars for my money than I would
paying for an Opus X, and that is what is important. If a
Philly Blunt is your cigar of choice and you like it better than
an Opus X, so be it.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>OK, now that I was there a few days ago, I'll answer my own
question.  Sanborn's has a good selection of Cubans, but the
Cubans will be found in nearly every liquor store up and 
down Avenida Revolucion.  The Tijuana merchants are aware of
the cigar boom and several shops have banners advertising 
Cuban cigars.  What's really great about Tijuana is many of
the restaurants and bars are cigar-friendly.  Exception:
the Hard Rock Cafe, which is now in TJ, does not allow
cigars.  They don't even serve Bohemia beer, so what good
are they?!  Anyway, Cuban cigars (plenty of them) are
available in Tijuana.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Joe B..  Having lived in San Diego now for about ten years
I have made the "TJ trip" "several" times.  I have learned
from talking to the locals and losing $$$ where to buy.  Yes,
"they" are all over TJ but from experience (I started buying
cubans there about 4 years ago) I ONLY TRUST SANBORNS!  When
I first started I got burned twice at one store selling what 
I thought were Cohibas.  Hard to tell what I got but White Owls
smoke better - MUCH better.  So for those of you going there
beware.  By the way two weeks ago Sanborns had some
Montecristo A's for $28.00!  9-1/2" X 47 (est.).  Outstanding!
Took me and my friend almost two hours and four Dos Equis to
really enjoy one of these!  I sure wish someone with some
connections would pass to "Casa del Habano" that TJ would be
a good place to open a store.  Cancun is the closest one to
me.  There are LOTS OF TOURISTS going to TJ and a lot of US
buy Havanas!

<B>I just got one for Christmas.  I was tempted to exchange it for a nice leather case, because the traveldor seemed kind of flimsy.  I decided to keep it, and I just smoked a Punch Pyramide (?) that had been in it for a week and it was still fine.  I don't plan on leaving anything in the traveldor much longer than that.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>vm,  you need to use the "travelmist" or pg solution to charge the humistat, just as you do with any other humistat you put in your humidor.  you do this to charge it at the beginning and then every six months.  you use distilled water otherwise.  i hope this helps.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I have one other recommendation for the Traveldor. I was carrying a beautiful leather case that my wife bought me at Harrod's in my suit jacket on an airplane. 
I put the jacket in the overhead compartment. After the flight I realized that I no longer had my case. Now, with a Traveldor, I can't lose more
than a $40 plastic box. </B><P>

<H2>A question for you.</H2>

<P><B>To whom it may concern: For the last couple of weeks I have noticed
a large amount of false threads posted. Basically, someone using another
persons name, saying somthing rude, and trying to bait someone into a fight.
This person has chose to use MP, Walmart, Greggorio, Myself, and I think
garfish's name to say some pretty mean things. My question is this: WHY?
This is kind of silly, dont you think. I am here to discuss cigars, and
other things pertaining to cigars and the people who enjoy the same passion
I do for a good stogie. Now, I have posted some dumb things in the past,
mainly to cass. I apologise for this, mainly because I think the shots
taken at him have caused him to do some of these &quot;Evil Postings&quot;
I would appreciate it if you would stop the baiting, and just discuss cigars.
I, for one, am all ears for intelligent conversation, and a good joke or
wisecrack never hurt either. I have posted my e-mail address, so I stand
behind what I say. If you have somthing to say to anyone on this thread,
then post your real name, and have the chutzpah to stand behind it. Thank-you.

destroyed when he didn't show up to meet LB, and his bluff was reveiled.
He now impersonates us all, and goes by manlyman the rest of the time.
It's very sad. I have no idea why someone would continue this for so long.
Obnoxio, you are a friend of mine, and I agree with you intirely. But even
I can't post my name here or cass will impersonate me. One day cass (and
the others) will realize how small they are.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I second what Obnoxio said. We all jab and duck
now and then, but we do not get anywhere with the impersonations and constant,
biting insults. I, too, have given my share of jabs in the past, Duh. In
my last post on the TEXAS thread I tried to bring some common ground to
the discussion. When I found this thread a few months ago, I had just recently
made the move from 10 years of grocery store brand cigars to premiums.
The cigar information and news on suppliers has helped me greatly. If it
had not been for Coo-Gar, fuente, Obnoxio, Pauly, and others too numerous
to list, I would have spent much more time and money to find the cigars
that are right for me. I've swapped cigars with individuals from S. Carolina
to California and appreciate the chance to smoke something that isn't available
in my area. Some of these swaps have prompted me to go ahead and get a
box of great cigars that even my tobacconist hasn't seen in awhile. Let's
clean this place up and make it a place to enjoy our cigar experiences
and knowledge. Signing off now. Thanks, Mark &quot;MP&quot; Peeples.</B></P>

and using my name (see our verbal exchange in Sigma Chi thread) I can say
he has many other names Manlyman, Sage, Garfish, and Greggorio. His attempts

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The plan of the &quot;Evil Postings&quot; ,as
labled by Obnoxio, are to cause these threads to self destruct. Someone
wasn't happy with the way they were treated and has made it there purpose
in life to destroy this page. Some people just want to belong and didn't
know how to gain our acceptance. When they are picked because of there
minute knowledge they feel unwanted. Therefore this person(s) feels that
if he can't belong then no one shall. This is merely an asumption, but
a good one at that. As far as everyone pointing fingers you are just as
guilty as the person you are accusing. Thats what I think.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I'm not sure it was Cass who was behind this all,
but I do know he hasn't been heard from lately. We also haven't heard from
Don Trejo for that matter. I wouldn't jump to conclusions just yet. Perhaps
the two of them got fed up with the childrens games and left. BobbyK had
the best advice yet, and that is, ignore the children, do not acknowledge
them, and if everyone sticks to that then they'll go away. Although I still
favor listing the originating servers of *offending* messages, I feel we
need to give BobbyK's suggestion a chance (and time) to work. OK. On a
much brighter note, I visited a &quot;Beverages &amp; More&quot; store
near where I work, and was pleased that in addition to carrying microbrews,
fine wines, and spirits, they had a wide selection of cigars! And humidors
to boot! This to me signals a wider acceptance of cigar smoking, and although
this will cause us some short term pain vis-a-vis shortages and price increases,
in the long term I think the prices will stabilize (maybe even come down...
or one can hope) and we'll have a wider social acceptance than would have
been thought possible five years ago. </B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>...Obnoxio, MP, BobbyK, Monte, Brad, Greggorio
and everyone else here....I am cautiously optimistic that you will begin
to see the intensity of the trashing diminish as from 36 hours ago. You
may also notice that several familiar names, associated with the aggressive,
disruptive 'Evil Postings', as Obnoxio labeled them, may not appear on
posts in the immediate future. Two days ago, the site was attacked, in
an escalation of a fire fight that began about a week ago. The engagement
commenced around 10:00 hrs EST and continued, non-stop, until about 20:00
hrs EST. Many threads were trashed and had to be restored. Some threads,
like 'Cooking Duck' and its interesting receipes, were 'KIA'. This section
of the site was 'off-air' for short periods while the attack progressed
and the struggle ebbed and flowed. The 'front page' of 'Let's Discuss It'
may have come up on screen, in a variety of odd configurations, during
this period. If anyone was able to get through during the 'hand-to-hand',
it was not your monitor, it was someone you 'knew', but not necessarily
loved. That person (persons) we believe, had multiple on-line 'handles'
that appeared in many of the disruptive posts. The majority of those posts
were traced back to one location. That location no longer has access to
this site. The site appears to have calmed down to a more normal level...I
hope it is so.... I would like nothing better than to be able to give you
all the Christmas present of a calm, stable, non-hostile and civil forum...To
that end, we wait quietly and watch,..unobserved..... Obnoxio,...perhaps
you might explain the function of Force Recon to everyone here........We
apologize for any inconvenience you may have incurred during the past few
days and I have a personal request,...please....I never got to save the
receipes from the 'Cooking Duck' thread so anyone who contributed and can
remember their posts, please start the thread again and re-post your receipes.
BobbyK has the right idea, ignore any further baiting and continue your
normal conversations. I will be watching and editing any interruptions
in your threads. You can leave the responses to me and I assure you all,
the term 'Draconian' is ever on my mind these days. Joseph B. was correct
with his suggestion to track the originating servers, but there are other
issues involved as well. We are focused on a goal. That goal is to forge
this site into the definitive cigar forum on the planet. Stay tuned for
future developments,..you will not be disappointed. Keep your cool, ..I'm
in your corner....Thanks and Happy Holidays to you and yours.......</B></P>

<B>It's been a long time since i've contributed.  I noticed the seriousness of this thread
and figured I'd just congragulate the Webmaster on cleaning
up this site, and also clear up a thing or too.  Both Don Trejo and I 
didn't leave because we got disgusted, we've just been to busy
to keep up with the ammount of traffic on this site.  The summer
was one thing, but now with work and school, it's very hard
to drop in on a regular basis.

Anyhow, it's nice that the webmaster is taking an active roll
in the page. It wasn't like that back in the summer.
Keep smokin'.   -Blunted.</B><P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Mark: In a couple of earlier threads, Coo-Gar
&amp; I were discussing the Opus &amp; I told him the two that I had smoked
were not that great. Both of those that I had smoked were right off the
retailers shelf. I put the remainder of the box in my humidor about a month
ago &amp; smoked a couple of them this weekend. It seemed like a completely
different cigar, one of the best I have ever smoked. I am not sure what
the difference was, but I would be eager to buy more for those special
celebration smokes. It is too expensive to smoke very often.</B></P>

really enjoyed them.  With many first choice brands being so
scarce these seem plentyful(for now).  Has anyone out there

<B>Gentlemen, I have been smoking cigars off and on for
 about 9 years but only recently have I decided to
 try and stock my own supply. Therefore in the area of 
humidors I am very ignorant.  I have been monitoring 
this page for a few days and now have a question. Can
I use a Cedar trunk as  homemede humidor if I outfit
it with a hygrometer add humidifying gear.  Ifso how
should I seal the lid.  I would love to know how to
 accomplish this. Thank you for your time. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>paul--I have a humidor made from a cedar chest.  Washing the inside with rubbing alcohol will remove a lot of the aromatic oils from the red cedar and leave it almost as neutral as Spanish Cedar.  Just let the inside air out for a week or so before using to make sure the alcohol has evaporated from between the cedar boards before using.  I have fitted two plastic VCR tape boxes to the inside lid with double sided foam mounting tape.  These are filled with Oasis wet floral foam and soaked with a 50-50 mix of propylene glycol and distilled water.  All materials are available at Wal-Mart for under $10 except for the propylene glycol and that you can get from a pharmacy of chemical supply for a few $ per quart.  In the end you will have a humidor that holds 400-500 cigars and will maintain 70-75% humidity at room temp for a long time.   And no, my cigars don't taste like cedar...the Excaliburs, Hemingways, and Macanudos are well aged and kept in great smoking condition.  Why spend $800 - $2000 on this size of humidor when $100 -$200 and a little ingenuity is all the expense that is needed.  Save the rest of your $$ for great cigars!!!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I have a couple of nice humidors (one costly, one somewhat inexpensive.
Both work very well.  Before I bought them though, I used to
just use a Tupperware-type container.  You can get little humistat
viles and thow them in with the cigars and they'll stay moist
forever.  The only disadvantage is that without the natural cedar
they don't really benefit from "aging."  But if you just want
to keep a box or two fresh, you cannot beat Tupperware.  It rivals
both of my humidors for maintaining moisture levels.  I still
pack a dozen stogies in a small Tupperware container for traveling.

<P><B>With winter at my heals, sitting on my deck in the evening enjoying
a good smoke has become difficult. I avoid smoking in the house due to
the lingering odor. Is there anything that works to keep the air indoors
fresh after a good cigar. Also is there anything that works to clean the
mouth after enjoying a cigar, something to refresh the palate?</B></P>

help get rid of the extra humidity: open up the box every day and let it
air out for a few minutes. This will help evaporate the Credo faster, which
will lower the humidity. The main thing is to have lots of cigars, though.</B></P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>cqlink:  You probably will not find them (Opus X) at any tobacco shop in Detroit or anywhere else, unless you're a preferred customer on a waiting list.  The best bet is to contact Jerry at JW's.  He just announced that he is getting them, as well as his normal supply of Hemmingweys and other primo varieties.  Not cheap though!! About $15 EACH!  You can reach JW at crp123@ix.netcom.com.  He is a great guy and gives great service.  Good Luck.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I talked to a Fuentas rep and he told me that Opus-X cigars are not shipped across the Mississippi River due to the demand and lack of supply. I don't know if this is true but he had no reason to lie. He also said they only make about 400K a year. With Europe and the increased popularity in the US he said supply is VERY low. 
Good Luck.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>If $$ isn't an option, buy her a La Diva.  They are cured in Cognac and have a sweet taste to the wrapper.  They are also very light.  Angie liked the one I sent her OK.  But, being the true CA she is, the sweetness, lightness, and price didn't rank very high with her.</B><P>

(Hess Select Cab., Treferen Merlot), and moneymoneymoney(I love to spend

in Ted Turner (TBS). Coo-gar, a dirty martini is made with olive juice
and tons of olives. Not to my liking. If I'm going to drink a martini,
I like it made with Kettle One Vodka - Bone Dry with a twist. I like the
Vermouth to be &quot;introduced&quot; from across the room, or sometimes
the bartender can just pass the bottle in front of my glass, that will
do just fine.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I am a Senior Marketing major at the University
of Houston, thus Coo-GAR. I have smoked many, many, many brands of cigars
and am fairly knowledgable on the subject, reading anything and everyhting
on the topic. I also engage in long discussions with many of the long time
tobacconist of Houston. I love buying 2-3 new smokes, trying them out and
voicing my opinion on them through this thread. I also build humidors in
my spare time. I have built humidors holding as small as 25 cigars up to
200 cigars and have sold many through a local tobacconist for $100's. Some
of my all-time favorite cigars include any Padron, Avo #2 and #7, Hugo
Cassar Mystique (two-tone), Cuban Punch and Partagas, Partagas #10, Puro
Indios Pyramids, and of course, Arturo Fuente don Carlos and Hemingways.
My everyday smokes are Bering Hispanos, HdM #55 maduro, Padron 3000 maduro,
and Montesino (Gran Corona when available.) I like to drink Courv. VSOP
cognac, Oregon Pinot Noir, Merlot, and darker beers (Newcastle Brown and
Paulaner Oktoberfest) with my smokes. I really enjoy talking with all you
guys and gals out there and look at this thread everyday, except weekends,
to see what's up. What I think ought to happen, at some point, is we hold
a Let's Discuss It Smoker in some centrally located place (Dallas or St.
Louis) and lets all get together. We would have to wait until Mr. Blonde
got out, though. Or would we? (If we had it in Dallas, She-ra and her hubby
could do all the grunt work!) Your thoughts? Your smokin' pal- Coo-GAR.</B></P>

easy going life. But...I need to make more money. I live in a rural area...I
love it. But...moving to the city is tempting. As some of you know, I used
to do investment banking. Now a bank want to hire me...and I'm really thinking
about it. I'm a little worried about the heavy work load, but the money
is good. And here's the best part: I'd be working in trust, e.g. private
banking. I have a background in investing...but this job would really build
on those skills. After I make enough money, I can move back to the country,
and manage my money from the ranch. All I need is the internet and a satellite
dish. Then I can spend a couple of hours a day doing research...the rest
of my time I can run the ranch.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Hi She Ra. I'm a long time cigar smoker dating
back to about 1955. I smoke everything, cigars, cigarettes, and a pipe.
Currently I'm a Systems Manager with an engineering firm and do a lot of
travel. I hate to travel because of smoking restrictions. I do however
end up in Canada a good bit where I can enjoy the Cubans. Even though I
make a living from computers I don't spend a lot of time on them. I finally
bought one for myself recently and tried out Internet. I found this board
and I've been hooked ever since. My favorite cigars are: Cohiba Robustos
&quot;while in Canada&quot;, thick Macanudo's, Hemmingways, and others.
This board, if I have the term correct, is neat. Everyone is so opinated!
Navy Veteran as well with many. Many sea stories.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I'm not creative enough to think up a nickname,
so I just use my real one, &quot;Jeff&quot;. I live near Charlotte, N.C.
(transplanted from the eastern end of Long Island, N.Y.). I love living
in the South (although I do get tired of the &quot;Yankee Jokes&quot;.)
I have been smoking cigars about eight years and have been reading (and
sometimes jumping into) these threads for about two months. I enjoy Padron
3000's, Fuente Hemmingway's, Zino Mouton Cadet's and most any Cuban cigar.
As for adult beverages, I enjoy gin (Boodles, Sapphire or Beefeaters) on
the rocks. I am in banking, as most of the Charlotte population is and,
like Ike, am on the verge of taking an investment banking position. I'd

around here? I want to ask She-ra and Coo-Gar about their pinot habits.
Especially you Coo-Gar... if you drink Oregon pinots you have to be from
the Northwest. Does Sylvan Ridge or Sokol Blosser ring a bell? To the rest
of you, they're wines, not smokes. Also love merlots and 858's. As far
as the personal stuff goes...been to various universities in the U.S. soaking
up chemistry (yes,chemistry!!) prior to joining industry in Indianapolis
five years ago. (Hence, the E-mail address). I enjoy numerous cigars, although
I've never had a Cuban yet. I miss the Northwest, truly God's country.
However, as alluded to earlier I still enjoy fine Oregon wines. For you
wine lovers, if you haven't tasted one, try one. That's all I'll say about
wine because this is a cigar forum.</B></P>

for a system integrator in the Baltimore area. I have been smoking cigars
off and on for about 18 years and really got back into it when I went to
DR on my honeymoon a couple years ago. I enjoy a lighter smoke now and
then (Avo Belicoso, R&amp;J,1884), but I prefer richer smokes for the most
part (Hemingways, 1866, Partagas, HdMs, and the occasional cuban. I like
microbrews, single malts, wines (mostly California reds and Australian
ports), and an occasional cognac with my cigars. My wife smokes on occasion
and enjoys sharing a smoke with me out on the porch with a couple of beers.
The nickname is a family thing from my grandfather (the first cigar smoker
I ever knew, and ever bought cigars for). My wife and I have no children
but our &quot;family&quot; consists of a Rotty, a Lab-Retriever mix and
a 22lb black and white short hair cat. I like hanging out with my friends,
browsing antiques and pub hopping, hiking, playing an occasional game of
tennis, and fishing. My wife and I also enjoy wine tastings (the fun outdoor
ones, not the snobby indoor ones) and a cigar dinner every once and awhile.</B></P>

I currently do performance analysis for a major 3 letter telecommunications

teenage children a son 18 and a daughter 13. Those of you that have teenage
children know how badly I need a good cigar right now. I just found out
that to let my son borrow my car to drive to school will cost me $350 per
MONTH. He wrecked the first car we bought him...then he wrecked the replacement.
Looks like its too bad for him. He's going to have to actually FIND a job
now....or walk. Sorry, I digress. I could really use a good cigar right
now.... I smoke 1 or 2 cigars per day...usually 1. I enjoy the search for
good, affordable cigars. I like mild to medium bodied flavorful cigars.
Favorites are A Fuente corona imperial maduros,Baccarat,even La Aorora's.
Everyday smokes include Cuesta Rey 1884's or Louis Martinez Dominican Handmad
Maduro's. I enjoy this thread and as a &quot;newbie&quot; appreciate the

and a shepard occupy the house while we are working, the boys return from
school during the summer months and holidays. We own a gourmet beverage
company and sell high end special roast coffees and fine import teas to
those finicky shop owners who only want the best for their guests. As a
side business we consult and manage several newly opened cafes. This has
proved very interesting that we can train and develop SOP for these new
companies than return control to the owners that they might beat the small
business failure rate. It has been a big success thus far for everyone.
Soon my wife and I will open the first of what will be our own cafe/cigar
lounge here in Louisville. With intentions to franchise from here, we are
excited about the adventure soon to be a landmark in Louisville. My hobbies
include woodworking and cooking. I have created several fine pieces of
furniture and written several cookbooks. If you ever want to swap recipes

near future. When I have some free time I enjoy sailing and golf, and smoking
cigars. I have to say I have read many of the messages in the numerous
threads and I am greatful for the knowledge I have gained. Not recognizing
the petty slander I have found that the majority of the posters are intelligent
and interesting people. I am glad I found this forum and look forward to
gaining more and more knowledge concerning the newances and practicalities
of our favorite hobby. P.S. Along these lines I have posted some questions
in some of the threads, so I request your forgiveness if they bother anyone
(me being a newbie and all)</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Andy...those friends you find amongst these threads
are in no way offended by your questions. As you are tought in the class
room to question the nature of all things you can not control...so we have
learned not to give chiding answers to smokers just starting out. Welcome
to the threads...don't mind some of our practical jokers, they are amusing
at times; frustrating at others. Some of the smokers have a great off thread
cigar swap going. If you manage to get in on that gang you are in good
hands. Merry Christmas to you and yours....we welcome you to that which
the companies Macanudo and Partagas have created with the help of a rather
amazing computer web wiz known as the Webmaster. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Hey Greggorio- Why do you reassure him that he
shouldn't feel ashamed to ask uneducated questions, when you insulted Cuban
Crusader fornot knowing whether English was spoken at a shop in an area
where he had heard French was the main language? It's not like he was trying
to insult the French Canadians, he probably didn't know anything about
Quebec and wanted to find out? Is there some crime to being uneducated
about a place? </B></P>

Since you are in the Annapolis / DC area, check out the Annapolis YC site
(http://www.us.net/ayc/)for news about racing and sailing in general around
your area. Latest scores and standings. Should you get to Annapolis (and
it is great in winter during a snow storm), stop by McGarveys on the square
for a libation and a chat. The Chart House in Eastport is also an absolute
beauty on a snowy day (or night). All the best and again, welcome.</B></P>

we seemed to win the majority of races we sailed in. I think there might
even be a few photos / paintings of her around town, like behind the bar
at the Chart House, if memory serves me well. I lived on Prince George

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Greetings and happy holiday's to all... I, too,
am a relative newbie to the fine cigar world, but have smoked machine rolled
stuff off and on for years. The name Feex is an old high school joke from
an English class. It was a play on the plural of fox! (Goose, geese...fox,
feex!) Anyway, I am a Mechanical Engineer involved in advanced microelectronic
packaging for a company on the east/central coast of Florida (My email
gives it away!). I turn 40 on Christmas Eve, when I plan to smaoke my Arturo
Fuente Canones! I have a wonderful and beautiful wife and three children
(6,3, and 5 months). I enjoy auto restoration, kit cars, golf, roller blading,
Jazz (classical and modern) and just lounging in the pool!! Those of you
on AOL may be familiar with a friend of mine, the Wineboss. He hosts the
AOL Cigar chatroom and recently sponsored a tour to a cigar factory in
Miami. Look him up! As far as cigars go, of course I love Hemmingways,
but a also love Partagas, Juan Clemente's, LaUnica 300's and other mild
smokes. As my taste buds develop, I hope to move on to some more robust
cigars, but for now, I've got plenty of the above to keep me happy. I enjoy
the threads and have really learned a lot from all (most) of you. </B></P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>DAVID T. HUNT
My Biography:

I was born a poor minority child.  Seventh son of a seventh son of a migrant sharecropper. I was raised in the rural community of Roxborough, PA.  

I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice.  I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat retention.  I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees.  I write award-winning operas.  I manage time efficiently. Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row.

I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing.  I can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cook Thirty-Minute brownies in twenty-two minutes.  I am an expert in stucco, an outlaw in Peru.

Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of ferocious army ants.  I play bluegrass cello, I am a master of the bass guitar.   I was scouted by the Mets.  I am the subject of numerous documentaries.  When I'm bored, I build large suspension bridges in my backyard.  I enjoy urban hang-gliding.  On Wednesdays, after work, I repair electrical appliances free of charge.

I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie.  Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening wear.  I don't perspire.  I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail.  I have been caller number nine, and have won weekend passes.  I bat .400.  My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles.  Children trust me.

I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy.  I once read Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day, and still had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening.  I know the exact location of every food item in the supermarket.  I performed covert operations for the Chamber of Commerce.   I sleep once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair.  While on vacation in Canada, I successfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery.  The laws of physics do not apply to me.

I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid.  On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami.  Years ago I discovered the meaning of life, but forgot to write it down.  I have made extraordinary four course meals using only a spoon and a toaster-oven. I breed prize-winning clams.   I have won bullfights in San Juan,
cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin.  I have played Hamlet.  I have performed open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis (recently).

In the off season I play with my best friends in our band "Empty Suits".  We are beyond good.  We all aspire to greatness soon.  We shall achieve

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Well, I certainly feel inadequate compared to Dave above, but here goes. I am an officer in the Navy, currently stationed in D.C., live near Annapolis, originally from Atlanta (Stone Mountain to be exact). I've been smoking cigars since college, about 10 years ago. Started off with H. Upmann Coronas Major but with a real paycheck I now am on the higher end of the scale. Hemingway, Opus, Avo, Dunhill and the like. I'll read any cigar info I can get my hands on, and have "collected" about 30 boxes of various stuff over the years. I enjoy reading these threads, I am new to the internet thing. Looking forward to seeing some of the great ideas proposed to the webmaster enacted. Greeting and salutations. </B><P>

<H2>Smoking for looks</H2>

<P><B>Back in the days when I smoked cigars, I liked to smoke. But I also
enjoyed the image. The cuttin' deals, greasin' wheels look. Or whatever
you call it. I suspect many of you smoke for fashionable reasons.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I, too, smoke for the pleasure. I don't go to
bars and don't hunt out restaraunts where I can smoke my stogies. I normally
smoke one during the day as I drive to or from a job-site. Then I smoke
one in the evening as I sit with my wife or I play with the dogs. I don't
worry about if the band stays on or off since nobody would ever see it
anyway. Sure, I keep some premiums around nowdays for special occaisions,
but mostly I smoke some good seconds and enjoy nearly every cigar I smoke.

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I used to smoke cigars in the car sometimes. But
it never worked very well because the cigars put out so much smoke that
I couldn't get any oxygen unless I rolled the windows down. That's ok around
town, but not on the highway where I drive. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I don't consider the image thing myself, either.
Most often, someone will look at me as if I've got lobsters crawling out
of my ears for having a cigar. I'm talking about in New York, so I can't
imagine boosting myh image with a cigar. I smoke them because I like them.
I had a teenage girl walk past me as I sat on a bench in Cape May, New
Jersey last summer and tell me that &quot;that thing stinks&quot;. So I
said, &quot;Good, because I lit it with the sole intention of keeping YOU
away!&quot; Needless to say, she wasn't ready and didn't respond to that.
By the way, my favorite expression is Drinkin', smokin' &amp; dirty jokin'.

fire up cigars at the bank when we cut a big deal. Then they would take
pictures of us looking all investment bankerish...with those shiny black
shoes, those watches...suspenders and coronas. Those were the days. I quit
with the old cigars, but I think I'm going to start banking again. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Well, it definitely isn't the image thing for
me. I smoke most of my cigars alone. Usually relaxing in the backyard with
a magazine and a glass of wine, or going for a long walk at night. Taking
an hour to smoke a cigar is a complete luxury, plus they stimulate the
mind helping you to ponder the mysteries of the universe and solve all
of the world's problems while you're on your walk. :-)</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Well investment banking was my bread and butter
at one point. That's how I made it through college. I made telephone calls,
trying to line up the debtors with the creditors. It wasn't very glamourous...I'd
sit at home, often in my bathrobe, and man the telephone. If I lined up
a deal, I'd go to the bank to help close it...I knew the details. But I
never got a Merc doing that. Well...one bank wants me now...so maybe I'll
start up again...but now I'm more interested in trust. The capital markets
are more stressful than I like...I'm looking into private banking. But
so what...I don't live for the bank...just live for duty. At least I try.
I like ol' Mike's cigar smoking strategy...the perplexion, pondery...deep
thoughts--so wonderful. I love the late walks...around the lake...in the
forest...with the silence with the possible exception of the birds and
water. That is a good time to smoke, I know. You can look at the glowing
end of the cigar, and become captivated by the redness, the only light.
And you puff... just barely seing the smoke...but seing the temporary increased
luminance of the burning tobacco. Yes, the tobacco...nice if it's a little
spicy. A rich flavor. And nice if you can sit comfortably. Aside the stream
perhaps. And you can think about the native indian boys who once had to
prove their manhood by spending time alone in the night. You can sit and
think as the stream trickles...I...</B></P>

masquerading as a college student, otherwise you are just proving to the
older crowd that the generation Xers are truly a disrespectful, self pitying
group of losers who wouldn't know class if it bit them in the ass. Young
boy, you don't know diddley, having a Montecristo &quot;A&quot; hanging
out of your mouth wouldn't help you out with any women for as soon as the
smoke clears and words come out of your mouth they'll have no doubt an
idiot has spoken! Show some respect if not for yourself then for the community
at large, challenge on a topic, any child can hurl insults.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I guess I've missed out on all the &quot;fun&quot;
these last couple of days. Thanks to those of you who stood up for me.
I guess you really don't know whether or not I'm attractively worthy of
attention, but definately my mind is able to keep up with your conversations.
(When they are worthy.) Thanks lb, I'd love to share a smoke with you.
I don't think anybody here is kissing my ass, just giving a little attention.
Besides, I enjoy it, and if they didn't, they wouldn't be doing it. Rude
Boy: What in the hell would a two bit whore be doing smoking expensive
stogies, swilling the finest cocktails, and entertaining conversations
on the net?! Yeah right. Edgar: I guess you're right that anyone could
sign Angie. But, I think a lot of you would be able to tell when it wasn't
me. Besides, if/when I saw it, believe me, I'd make my anger known. Don't
mess with me. Drew: You've seen me in person, am I hard on the eyes?</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>No Rude Boy, that just means don't be pretentious
twit while doing it. If you smoke because you enjoy it, thats one thing,
but smoking a cigar merely to make a trendy fashion statement (while ones
right) is downright embarrassing. Things are difficult enough for those
of us who smoke in public without some boorish grandstander making a spectacle
of himself (or herself). Such people merely offer the pleasure police ammunition
against those for whom cigar smoking is not a &quot;flash in the pan&quot;
&quot;in thing&quot; to do. While I recognize every American's right to
make an ass of themselves, such behavior reflects poorly on the rest of
us.</B></P>

I mean I like doing it, but the watch is my statement to the world, that
I am a person that can afford a several thousand dollar watch. It is really
no different with those frikken cigars. I used to like smoking them...but
I didn't spend $300 for a box of rolled tobacco just because I wanted a
really fine smoke. No. I bought the damned cigars to say &quot;look...I
am quite a cat, sitting here smokin' my stooge.&quot; I'm sorry if that

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Rude Boy- The image is fine if you are real cigar
smokers such as Ike and yourself. My problem is with the people who do
it for image ONLY. The image thing is a nice added bonus, I can't deny
that. I enjoy it too. But these these &quot;trendies&quot; have the cart
before the horse. Ike- God bless conspicuous consumption. I enjoy top drawer
personal possessions myself. Question- would you buy a counterfeit Hamilton
watch? Only you would know. Of course you wouldn't. Because first and foremost
you are concerned with quality. The prestige of wearing the watch flows
from impeccable quality of the watch. The trendy cigar smoker would buy
a knockoff because he has no appreciation for the quality of the watch.
His purpose is equally served because he is merely concerned with image.
This is only an analogy, but the main point is that for the true cigar
smoker the smoke itself if the point with image a nice added bonus. Of
course as the cigar craze becomes less vogue, the trendies will move on
to the next craze. For some lucky trendies they will be fortunate enough
to develop a love for cigars despite themselves. &quot; </B></P>

I'm social and enjoy social people quite a lot. That's one of the reasons
I enjoy going to cigar dinners and seminars...to talk to people that have
the same interests I do. Car Clubs and Shows (especially Ford Mustangs)
provide me with the same enjoyment. Know-it-all's, Cuban elitest's, and
all others who live by absolutes are the real scourge of the cigar boom.

Instead of blindly kissing women's butts, as you do, why don't you try

Numerous times, people such as Peter, She-ra, and Pauly have had to put

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Wake UP! WAKE UP! After a while you people can
ruin any good thread. At issue here is smoking for looks...not kissing
ass or any such nonsence. Buzz: I think your response was reasonable about
people enjoying the inherent quality of an object, and gaining associated
status as a secondary benefit. I would say your analogy about watches is
understood, but to tell you the truth, I have a fake Rolex. Yeah... I wear
it when I travel... I don't want to risk loosing an expensive watch, but
I still want to have &quot;the look&quot; sometimes-- so I pack the fake
Rolex. But I wouldn't smoke a cheap cigar. For example, I wouldn't remove
the label from a fine cigar and place it on some cheap crap-- even if I
could do it convincingly. For me, the pleasure of the smoke is why I was
willing to destroy my health-- not because of the swanky look. But o.k.
when I used to smoke, I would fire one up, a good one, to look cool sometimes.
Sure. You might know that I quit smoking cigars. But the other night, I
got drinking... and that's when I REALLY like to smoke. So I couldn't resist.
I fired one up. Well..the next day I payed the price. My lungs hurt, I've
had a cough, and a mucous buildup. I didn't even inhale. I just don't think
I can handle cigars, as much as I like to smoke them. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I usually smoke in the office in my home. I smoke
in bars, and the occasional restaurant that allows it. I enjoy my daily
cigar. It is calming, and it gives me time to think. I dislike the trendseekers,
mostly because they buy cigars like crazy, and jack the prices to high
heaven. Example: I was in my shop today, and I had to wait in line to get
into the humidor! The humidor was filled with 19 and 20 year old Marines.
These guys were buying up everything in sight. (my tobacconist hides a
box of fuentes for me, so Im not too concerned) but then, they proceed
to WALK the 3 miles to the base. They spent a ton of money on cigars, but
dont have the money for a car. Later, Im in the mall with my wife. I spot
a young Marine with a box of &quot;New York Te-Amo's&quot; under his arm,
and a chewed one in his mouth. He really looked silly. I overheard him
say, &quot;These Cigars are from New York, and so am I!&quot; DOOFUS! This
is what I dislike about cigar smoking becoming so damn trendy.</B></P>

things in life... are not free... they are expensive... there are no free
lunches. I used to drink... I had to quit. I smoked... quit. Sex... out

they aren't. But look... if you must smoke, then smoke cigars. </B></P>

if I smoke outside, my throat and lungs are never affected. And according
to research. there are no adverse health affects from the occasional cigar.

I've never been like this... I don't know what it is... I must have lost

<B>At the end of 1989, the turn of the decade, I quit smoking cigarrettes as a suggestion from my physician.  Know I have been smoking cigars for the past three years.  I am curious, many people tell me that smoking cigarrettes is far worse than smoking cigars.  Is this statement true?  Has it ever been proven or is it still a myth?  Time to go have a cigar, just got a box of A.F. Dantes and I need to inspect.  </B><P>

<B>Just on the mend from heart attack #6.Docs go ballistic about cigarette smoking so I'm back to trying cigars. My opinion is that cigars are not as bad because you don't inhale. I'm really enjoying these sample packs of cigars I got from Smoker's Depot and a local shop.I cant live forever so I may as well live each day as enjoyably as I can </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I've heard significant debates on this subject.  Most of them in favor of the cigar smoker.  I'll find the web page address to a great article so that you can have documented knowledge done as a medical study.  I'll get back to you as soon as I find it.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I'm fairly convinced that the debate between cigar and cigarette smoking
is over.  The obvious facts are the difference in inhalation.  The less obvious include
the fact that most cigar smokers smoke one a day (if that) while many cigarette smokers
smoke several throughout the day.  Also, most people take up cigar smoking later in life (20s or 30s) while
many cigarette smokers started as kids.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Angie - I believe you are refering to "www.cigarsmokers.com/nevermerely/cigarnet.html" which has a good medical FAQ section. But the general consensus is - if you smoke less than 5 cigars a day, your risks of cancer are the same as a non-smoker.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Interesting information Joe!  I wasn't aware of the fact that smoking less than five cigars a day is equal to not smoking at all.  Now what I would really like to know is what is the cigar to cigarette ratio.  I smoke, respectively, one cigar a day.  People around me are always arguing that giving up cigarettes to smoke cigars is an even trade.  I haven't solved the problem only put a new perspective on it.  Well right now I am smoking my first Don Lino Havana Reserva.  What a delicious sample of fine crafstmenship.  Not a single flaw in this cigar.  Perfect burn, great aroma, and smooth smoke.  Arguably my favorite smoke as of present time.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I think you just spelled out the difference right there in a nutshell, Monte. Cigarette smokers are looking for a fix, so to speak. When I smoked Cigarettes, I didnt care about construction, taste, burning qualities, etc. What I wanted was that buzz. I quit smoking about two years ago, and I must say, it was tough. Now I enjoy a cigar or two a day, and the key word is enjoy. If it burns crappy, or goes out often, I dont finish it. The pleasure I get when I light up a great cigar after my kids are in bed, and my wife is doing her thing cannot be described, but you all, for the most part, know what that is all about.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>As an add on to the above:  About three years ago, my Mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Any of you in the medical field will understand this, Pancreatic Cancer has a 95% fatality rate. My Mother smoked for about five years of her short fifty, and it was social smoking back in the 70's.No drugs, and an occaisonal glass of wine.(I think her downfall was in the saccarin that she put in her coffee every day, known as Sweet 'n Low. but anyway...)  Here is my point: I don't think it really matters what you do, if your number is getting pulled, then its getting pulled. I enjoy life to the absolute fullest, and cigars are a part of that. Just be thankful every day when you get out of bed you are still drawing breath, then enjoy a cigar later on. Sorry to be so long.  -Obnoxio</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I agree Obnoxio.  Living life as long as I have, I have come to the conclusion that things will happen no matter how hard you try to prevent them.  You can't just sit around worrying about what curve ball life is going to throw at you this time.  Live day to day.  Worry about tomorrow, tomorrow.  I think that things happen for a purpose.  For instance I was told to quit smoking cigarettes so that I could learn to enjoy the tranquility behind smoking cigars.  Now, as I originaly stated, I'm addictive to smoke!  I've smoked everything from pipes to pot and cigarettes to cloves, and I must say that cigars give me the most satisfaction of all.  Thank you and smoke up.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Monte, if "addidcted" means you can't wait to kick back and begin again the ritual of lighting and smoking your favorite cigar, then I'm addicted too. Its a mental addiction as opposed to the physical cigarette addiction. But this being true, I'm also "addicted" to italian sausage, real cajun gumgo, and a ribeye, charred nicely! And like any addiction, if I have to go too long without any of the above, I go nuts.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I smoked cigarettes for many, many years.  I smoked my last
one about 7 years ago.  I began smoking cigars about 6 
months ago.  I now average a little over one per day.  Come 
on guys...lets get real.  Cigars are not healthy.  Even if
you do not inhale, you inhale the smoke in the air around 
you.  And you get a healthy dose of nicotine through your
cheeks and tongue which affects your heart and vascular 
system.  With that said, If you smoke in moderation, maybe
one per day, and consider the relaxation and pleasure that 
it gives, and the social pleasures that occur when you sit
back and smoke with friends and chat I think you end up with
a wash.  Something will get you, just understand and be 
honest about your poisons.  We all have pleanty of them, fat
in our diet, alcohol, smog, all drugs, no exercise........
A fine cigar a day, by itself, is probably not what will 
kill me.  But, be careful out there...but also enjoy life a
little.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Joe you sound like a man after my own heart.  Gumbo, only when my mother or grandmother make it, is the greatest food to eat just before you light up.  I love cajun food I live in Atlanta, Ga but am originally from New Orleans, La.  I believe my grandfather is the person responsible for introducing me to pipes.  
Grim do cigars emmit more or less nicotine than cigarettes?  I'm curious to know.  I feel the "buzz" of smoking two cigars consecutively.  When I smoked cigarettes i could smoke a whole pack and not blink.  As far as poisons are concerned there are poisons everywhere like you mentioned.  Just live as if they didn't exsist.  This doesn't solve the problem of them being in our enviroment but it does take your mind off of them so you can concentrate on more important subjects like work.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Yep, I've watched people around me die while living very clean lives.  There are
powers out of our control, and some must go before others.  But there do seem to be ways
to extend your health.  Exercise a bit, eat healthy foods that come from the earth, be nice
to others, keep a positive attitude and keep laughing.  Everything in moderation.</B><P>

The real secret to getting the taste right is carefully browning a real rue at the beginning, if you don't, it just ain't right! By the way,I live in the Atlanta area also. OK, I know we are talking about addiction here, I'll get off the gumbo.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>That's quite alright Joe.  While you are sitting there drooling over gumbo, I'm sitting here enjoying a big bowl of Alligator Sauce Picante.  I got the alligator from my cousin when I visited him last in November.  Yes he did kill it himself.  A six or seven foot bastard.  I cooked the Sauce Picante myself.  When I finish I'm going to have a Don Lino Havana Reserva.  Au revoir!  </B><P>

<B>I get a bit distressed about not finishing my cigars.  I enjoyed a Cohiba Especial (sp?), not Cuban, Saturday night.  It cost $13. at the tobacco store (not a bar).  It was fantastic, and I loved it, but, I smoked it for a good hour, just halfway, and then I put it down because my taste buds were done.  (BTW: I hate a pre-smoked cigar, so I never keep leftovers.)  Anyone else feel this guilt?  (It was a damned good cigar.)  Sob.</B><P>

<form method=POST action="UnfinishedCigar.pl">
<B>In some cases, but at $13 a pop, I'd save it.  What I do is cut off about 1" or so of the end, blow out the old smoke, and save it in a cedar lined tube. I just did this recently with my Canones and it was fine.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Sounds like you're a prime candidate for the Cigar Savor.  Check out the thread concerning them under
lighters and other stuff.  If used properly, you can save a cigar very well for a day or two.  Make sure to blow
the smoke out of the leaves before you put it in and before you relight it.  Also, either cut of the end as Foxes (or Feex) suggests,
or knock off all the dead ash before relighting.  Since the last half of the cigar is my favorite part, I'll be damned if I throw away
the last half of a $13 cigar.  Then again, I don't smoke $13 cigars.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Oh, the first few draws on a pre-smoked cigar are going to taste a bit sour,
but after those, it'll taste just like it did the first time.  This is if you follow
a few guidelines of course.  If your previous pre-smoked cigar experience is with a cigar
you set on your counter for a week and didn't blow the stale smoke out of the leaves, I can't blame you
for being scared of a pre-smoked cigar.  Keep an open mind, and try again sometime.  I think you'll be pleasantly
suprized.  Just like food, leftovers aren't always bad.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Well, if I don't have over an hour for a cigar, I smoke something else.  If I'm
going to spend $13 on a cigar (I currently have a bet for a Mac. Vintage Cabinet),
I'm going to be darn sure that I'm going to have enough time to smoke it.  If it's
a question of taste buds, try italian ice.  It will clean your palate.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Thanks Mongo!  That's the problem.  I didn't want to be finished with my cigar, it was an excellent smoke, but my tongue was way over it.  I think that my question should have been: How could I enjoy it longer.  I make the time to enjoy a good cigar.  Too bad Italian Ice isn't served at any of the cigar lounges I've been too.  But, it sounds like a perfect solution.  Hey, Greggorio, are you taking notes?  Does this cancel my opinion on smoking with eating?  Double standard!</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>That's an interesting solution Mongo.  Does it work?  I mean, let's say that my taste buds are "sick"
of drinking wine.  I could eat some crackers to cleanse my palate, but upon drinking wine again, it wouldn't take
but a sip or two to be sick of it again.  I'm just wondering, that's all.  Tobacco and cigars are pretty strong and
when I'm done smoking, only time can refresh my buds.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Angie, I've been saving parts of cigars for a long time and I guess I have just gotten used to the taste of a relit cigar.  Every night I save a little for first thing in the morning.  I like the taste of the leftovers!  I know...  I'm told I'm crazy all the time.  I think my wife has over the years not enjoyed so much the smell of a burned up stogies in the bedroom and other places I tend to leave them.  Well anyway, she got me a Cigar Savor for Christmas and it does help to improve on the relit cigar.  Its nothing like a fresh cigar, but its not too bad either.  To me, after a few minutes they tend to taste almost the same as before.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I'm with BobbyK on this one. Why force yourself to go beyond
the point of enjoyment due to guilt. By smoking beyond your
desire you may only ruin the whole experience loosing what

One of the enjoyable aspects of cigars to me is getting those last few puffs.  Damn I wish I could smoke in my office.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I agree that its hard to throw away a high priced cigar, but I can't stand a re-lit cigar. I only smoke about one or two cigars a week and I want a "fresh" experience. Using the steak example from above, how good is a great steak that is two days old and microwaved? Sure, its still good but not the same. Angie, a good french restaurant serves a "intermezzo" of a small scoop of sherbert to cleanse the palate. It does work, I would suggest trying that to recharge the taste buds. Also Angie, I've seen you write about Chef's in Atlanta. My folks live there and my father is also a lover of the leaf. Where and what is it? </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>A microwaved steak is not an accurate analogy.  How about a bottle of fine wine?  Throw it away after drinking
only half?</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Angie, I'm a little confused as to why your taste buds were done. If they are getting burned out you might try puffing at a slower pace. A good rule of thumb is to take a puff every 45 to 60 seconds and if your mouth starts to get burned out chances are your cigar is getting too hot. Slow down and enjoy. If slowing down doesn't help you might want to smoke smaller cigars. When I smoke a cigar I get between 45 mins. ( Short Story) and two hours plus (Fuente Churchill). How long do the rest of you normally spend one each stick? </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>If at all possible, I take over 2 hours on an Excalibur #1, Canones, La Unica 100 or other large cigar.  While it's hard to
find that block of time, I have turned my balcony into a study, with lights, stereo, desk, etc. so that I can read, study, or kick
back for a few hours.  I agree with you completely C-gar.  While it's tempting to smoke fast, slow smoking is much better.  By the way, it
takes about 3 to 4 hours of continual cigar smoking to wear me out.  Then I'm done for hours.  No little gelato will help.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Theo, if you're not going to able to finish a good bottle of wine after it has been decanted, it will turn and you'll have to throw it away.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Yeah, I second BobbyK.  If you only drink 1/2 a bottle of wine, but don't come back for it until the next week, it's spoiled.  I think that the particular incident I had last weekend was because I was smoking in at a bar alone, and having trouble relaxing after a very hectic day.  A combination of the aggitation and desire to unwind probably made me puff a little more than I'm used to.  I prefer the bigger smokes, when I have time to enjoy them, otherwise I'll smoke something smaller.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>ML:  The shop that I speak of is called Chef!, it is in Virginia Highland, corner of Virginia Avenue and North Highland Avenue downtown.  (a few blocks away from Ponce)  Please send your dad in for a stogie, tell him to ask for Angie (everybody usually directs cigar customers to me when I'm there anyway) and I'd be happy to help him!  Chef! is a gourmet kitchen store and coffee shop.  We added cigars to our store a year ago, and WOW, it has been a great business move for us!

<B>I WAS IN LONDON LITTLE OVER TWO YEARS AGO AT J.J.FOX(SHAWN). TALKED WITH ME ABOUT BRITISH CUSTOM OF LAYING DOWN. WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WHEN YOU BUY A BOX OF CIGARS. YOU SHOULD TAG THEM WITH THE DATE, WHERE YOU PURCHASE THEM. THEN DIVIDE INTO THREE GROUP IE:(5,5,15) LET THE FIRST GROUP AGE ONE MONTH THEN MOVE THEM TO YOUR DAILY STOCK MAKING NOTE ON TAG DATE MOVE AFTER YOU SMOKED ONE NOTE THE TASTE, AROMA,BURN AND FLAVOR ON THE TAG. THE NEXT GROUP YOU WANT LAY DOWN FOR LEAST SIX MONTH DO SAME SAME THING WITH THE TAG AFTER SOMKING ONE. THE LAST GROUP YOU WANT TO LAY DOWN FOR A MINIMUM TWO YEARS. WELL I HAVE REACH THE TWO YEAR MARK, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT (SHAWN) KNOW WHAT HE TALKING ABOUT.(IMHO) THE MELLOWING TASTE OF DELIGHTFUL FLAVOR OF COHIBA ROBUSTO HAD MY MOUTH AND BRAIN SAYING IT DOSEN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!! SINCE IHAVE THREE HUMIDORS I USE THE LARGEEST FOR TWO AGEING. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE OTHER CIGARS TO REACH THIS POINT INTHE AGE PROCESS I KNOW IN TODAY WORLD OF CIGARS SHORTAGE THIS WILL BE HARD TO DO,BUT IF YOU CAN I STRONGLY RECOMMEND GIVE THIS A TRY. IT WORK GREAT WITH HEMINGWAY AS WELL!!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I don't think all cigars are going to benefit from this ritual. Wines are the same way, some are better aged, some don't improve over time. But it sounds like fun if you've got a couple of humidors and enough cigars to do it. If I have 15 cigars I am "stocked" but these won't last but a month or so.</B><P>

<B>HEY CIGAR FANS!!!
Being from Jacksonville, FL we do not have many if any Cigar friendly devoted locations.
But, I do a good bit of traveling across this wonderful country. As I travel I would 
like to visit some towns that have progressed with time. If you have a good local
spot(i.e. bar, restaurant..) let the rest of us know. Or if you are traveling to a particular
town, post it and hopefully someone will respond. I'll be in
Houston, TX on the 6th on Jan. any ideas?

<B>What are the differences in maduro cigars?  I tried an Onyx 750 on New Years Eve and was very pleased.  My only other maduro was some type of Te-Amo which was crap.  What difference in body and flavors does a maduro wrapper typically have from other wrappers?  What are the better brands and models of maduro cigars?  I really like Macanudos and recently found some Baron de Rothchilds maduros, I might give one a try.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Smanky, I wouldn't be surprised if Te-Amo cooks their tobacco in
a pressure chamber! A good/great maduro should have a strong flavor with a 
mild aroma, even producing a slightly sweet taste. The nicer/premium maduro 
wrapped cigars will be silky and oily to the touch. "The difference in taste"
as you state, is characterized by the region/origin of the tobacco. The Macanudo is a 
very light smoke, produced in Jamaica and the Dominican. Try a Nat Sherman, Fuente or a Temple Hall.
The Sherman and Fuente are Dominican and might seem strong to you. The Temple Hall is Jamaican and will
be a lighter cigar. For my tastes I prefer Honduran and Cuban.

<H2>&quot;In the Good Old Days&quot;</H2>

<P><B>I had been home from work about a half an hour and was half way through
with my cigar when my neighbor drove up and saw me puffing away quite pleasurably.
He then told me about when he was a young Marine Corps officer around 1959-1960.
He belonged to a rather unique &quot;Cigar Club&quot; that sent him 100
(four boxes) of Cuban cigars a month! He used to keep half in his refrigerator
(!) and take the other half to work. He said that even back then cigar
smokers were somewhat ostracized even in the smoke-filled officer's clubs
when cigarettes were still VERY popular with GI's. He said he remembered
being at one formal occasion and a General approaching him. He was smoking
one of his favorites and thought sure the General was going to reprimand
him for smoking cigars at the function. Instead, the General said: &quot;Son,
I can't even afford to smoke those, where the hell did you get that?&quot;
He quickly replied with: &quot;Would you like one - SIR!&quot; I thought
that was a nice story. And now my neighbor and I, based on a cigar, are
better friends and have some stories to share. I can't wait to hear how
much he used to PAY for 100 a month. Thought some of you might enjoy that.
As a follow-up, he said his &quot;Club&quot; went defunct shortly after
1960 for reasons known to all. </B></P>

<HR><FORM method=POST action="IntheGoodOldDays.pl"><B>Ed, I've often wondered
if the Marines stationed at Guantanimo have access to Cuban cigars. I know
that Cuban nationals work on the base. I wonder if there isn't some sort
of &quot;barter&quot; system in place down there. Ask your Marine friend.
I'll also ask my son, but he was only recently commissioned and has only
been in the Corps about four years.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>There was a letter from a Marine officer stationed
at Guantanamo in Cigar Aficionado about a year or so ago. He stated that
Cuban cigars can *not* be purchased there. I'm surprised to hear that Cuban
nationals (as opposed to ex-patriates) work there. It is my understanding
that there has been a complete cutoff between the base and Cuba, including
water and electricity, since 1959. What would keep the Cuban nationals
from defecting? As several of my relatives have told me, one doesn't hesitate
when there is a chance to leave a Socialist Workers' Paradise. I should
note that these relatives in 1956 all left Budapest the very moment they
heard the Russians had driven out and walked over 100 miles into Austria.

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Peter, at least officially, any kind of barter
system is illegal - BIG TIME! This is according to my neighbor. I don't
really understand this in that when I travel to Europe, Canada, Mexico,
etc., I can smoke Cubans cigars to my hearts (and lungs) content - legally.
I can possess them in the good old USA. I just can't transport them into
the US. Maybe this embargo will end soon. I certainly have MORE heartburn
buying anything from China after seeing the ill fated try for a more democratic
government demonstration/suicide in Tianiman Square. Cuba isn't even close
to being that repressive. They have a way to go yet but time will take
care of that - I'm sure. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I was visiting my Grandmother a while back. As
I was enjoying a smoke on her front porch she came out to talk. We talked
for a while and she said it was ok to smoke inside. &quot;Your Grandfather
always did&quot;, she told me. A little while later, I noticed she was
quiet. When I asked her if she was alright she said she noticed the cigar
band, a Punch. It was the same brand Pa always smoked in the 50's. I never
got to spend much time with Pa, he died when I was 8. I do remember the
different smell to their house. I remember all the cigar boxes in the garage
and workshop. I remember him giving me a brand new silver dollar, &quot;too
save away&quot;, 2 weeks before he died.</B></P>

Have high tea in the Palm Court at The Plaza Hotel (begins at 3:45pm), then move over to the Oak Bar (also in The Plaza) for a pre-dinner drink and smoke.  The Oak Bar looks out over Central Park at just above street level.  You'll get a grand view of NYC midtown afternoon pedestrian traffic, limos, horse and buggy carriages, etc.  The Plaza hotel is on 59th (Central Park South) and Fifth Avenue.  If you need any more info or ideas, let me know.  I may be able to meet you, if you were so inclined.</B><P>

<B>OK guys, I'm relatively new to the site and read thru many of the threads but have not come across this topic yet.  I live only about an hour from Windsor and am cosidering driving up to look for Cubans. Questions: 1) Does anyone know about bringing a couple of boxes across?  I've been through customs on I75 at Detroit/Windsor several times and have never been searched. What happens if they find a couple boxes in your car?  Can their dogs sniff out cigars if they are hidden?? What happens if i got caught with just a couple (like 5 or less)?   2) Does anyone know of any good stores that keep good supplies of Cubans?  I'm interested in Bolivars, Hoyos, Cohibas, Montes, R&J, Punch, etc. Any help, advice (positive or negative), recommendations, feedback, or experiences (good or bad) would be appreciated! I don't want to get in to something I'll be sorry for but at the same time - it seems like it would be SO EASY!!</B><P>

<B>Beancounter, forget it! It could mean long prison time, biggggg fines and forfeiture of your vehicle. There are plenty of good cigars around and although prices seem high they are a bargain when compared to what you will pay if caught smuggling contraband into this country!!!  </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Adrianne,   I appreciate the advice. The same thoughts go thru my head when I think about it. I know so many people who've either brought a few back or had friends do it that it almost seems rediculously easy. In fact, the only Cuban I've ever smoked was brought across in Mexico for my friend by a friend of his while on vacation. They were R&Js, I don't know the name but it was a figurado approx. 46-48 x 41/2" and they were delicious. I do agree with you about some really great non-Cubans though. About a year a young employee at a cigar store Toledo turned an inexperienced smoker (me) onto a Padron 2000. I have since become a HUGE fan of all the larger size Padrons. In fact, I don't think the R&J I smoked was any better. Have you ever tried these? I,d also appreciate any other feedback on bringing in Cubans from anybody. And what about stores in Windsor? If nothing else a buddy of mine and I may take a trip up for a day and smoke one there. Maybe play a little blackjack as long as we're there. By the way,this is a great site! There are some very knowledgeable smokers here and I've picked some great tips. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>It's a risk reward choich you will have to make.  As stated in the prvious thread the penalties are substantial.  Where you live close by I suggest that you just enter Canada for the day and find a shop with a lounge area where you can enjoy a Cuban or two and return clean.  I travel to Toronto some and usually have a smoke or two while there.  I have a favorite shop where I call ahead a week or so in advance and ask them whats on the shelf and if they would put away a couple for me.  My favorites are the Cohiba Robusto, and the Monte Cristo #2.  Both of these are unforgettable smokes.  In recent months the shops in Toronto have had a lot of Cuban seconds as well.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I also live in the same area, and although I've gone over to Windsor to sample the cubans there, I don't bring any back... ever.  It's just not worth it.  One place in windsor that does have a parlor where you can sit and enjoy a cigar is called La Casa De Habano's (Havana House).  I'm not sure exactly where it's at as my friend drove both times we went, but it shouldn't be hard to find in the phone book, or if you stop by a nice hotel and ask at the front desk.  It;'s in the downtown area, not too far from the tunnel though.  My friend went there Friday after his last final exam, and he said they were VERY picked over this time of year.  He also mentioned they had seconds available.  (cuban seconds, not knock-offs).  Hope this helps.</B><P>

The tobacconist I went to on the last trip had a table in their humidor room with probably 50 bundles with different sizes.  On the second day when I went back there were just a few bundles left.  They were selling well.</B><P>

to me and my buddy John Rambo's M-60. Juuust kidding, of course.
But I think the real reason there's all this victimization
of Cuban traders is that the government is too cowardly and
weak to stop real drugs that destroy peoples' lives like cocaine and heroin,
so they try to make themselves appear big and strong this way- the same way
a 150-lbs sixth-grade bully beats up a kindergartener. I think
they ought to have a WCW Tournament of Warriors between the
smugglers and the customs officers to teach 'em a lesson.
By the way, if you do smuggle, do so discreetly and only a few boxes
at a time. Keep a box of the same sized Dominicans with corresponding
bands to help you out.

I don't know if they came that way or if idiot customers had been handling them too much. I wish they'd put a sign up that said "If you sniff it, You bought it!"

I tend to agree with you in principal, but the fact remains that the law is the law.  I've been across the border to smoke cigars, but I won't bring any back.  Just something in me about commiting a felony that gives me the willies.   I totally agree about getting a good Hemmingway here instead.  There are a couple of places locally that have Hemmingway's on a fairly regular basis.  At least regularly enough that I usually have a dozen in my humidor most of the time.  Give me Hemmingway's, Padron's, and Cubita's, and I really don't need to spend $20 on a cuban cigar!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Apparently, chewing tobacco is as addictive as smoking cigarettes.  I never knew this until recently.  My tobacconist just quite chewing and chomps on a cigar all day instead.  He acts as if it is an incredible feat, not putting chaw in his mouth the minute he wakes up in the morning.  Every day I see him, he lets me know how long it has been since he stopped.  It must be hard to quit.  Maybe seeing an Opus X to a cigar-chewer is just as exciting as for a cigar smoker.  Hard to imagine, but it could be so.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Licking the cigar started way back, when people thought that their dried-out cigars
could be re-humidified by licking the wrapper.  Nice try, eh?  People somehow hear of this, and

how I'd lick all the cookies so that my sisters wouldn't eat them and I could have them.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Apparently there is a proper way to bite it (ask Carlos Fuente Jr. next time you see him), but I've never
bothered to learn.  A bunch of work people were out the other night and we had a box of cigars.  I watched as
they tried biting them, sticking keys in the end, etc.  Then I went to the bar and asked to borrow their cutter.  I mean geesh,
it is a cigar bar.  Then one of my coworkers proceeded to break the cutter by using it wrong.  I think I'll print him out a copy
of my top 10 lists.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I know that this has nothing to do with the topic of cigars, but I really want to get this off my chest. A couple of days ago, Bill Cosby's son was tragically killed. It is, Im sure, very painful for his family to deal with the death of their son. Here is what really gets me pissed: I cannot believe the way the media has gone crazy over this. Showing pictures of the man laying in his own blood, setting up camp outside of his parents house, the list goes on and on. Where have our values gone? Who gave these people the right to invade the privacy of this family in their time of pain?  The media has stepped way over the line this time, way over. I am an ardent watcher of CNN, but I could not believe when they showed those pictures. Angie, you work in that field. What is the story with this, dont they teach journalists a little thing called TACT?  You should call your boss and make some heads roll. This story and the covering of the tragedy of the little girl who was killed in Colorado has made me unplug the TV. I wont even go into what I think of the tabloid TV shows and papers. I am utterly disgusted with the media. Thank You.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Obnoxio, I agree. The problem is that coverage of news like this sells newspapers and TV stations hope to capitalize on tragedies like these- Especially if they coincide with the Nielson sweeps. (How many people are watching their station during a set period of time.) These sweeps ratings set the advertising rates for that quarter. What I'm saying is-  If people watch it, then they'll keep showing it. I'm also seriously starting to believe that if nothing happened for the media to cover- they'd simply make it up.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I am similarly upset by Cosby's media harassment, and as long as we're on the 
subject of tragedies, how about Jonbenet Ramsey? My father, who's an attorney, and I
have been following this one, and the parent's guilt is so
likely I can't believe that the media hasn't brought it up.
Tampering with evidence? The miniscule ransom? The hired media

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Crusadoer, it's exactly that attitude which allows the media to exploit these tradgedies.  Whether the parents had anything to do with this is not the point.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I discussed this issue with people at Turner, and as horrible as it is, the fact is people watch.  Just like they slow down to see an accident on the interstate.  WHY?!  I have no idea.  I rarely watch the news, it's so upsetting.  I feel really behind on current issues, but I really can't handle the heartache.  One thing I don't know, (and maybe it's because I turn the channel when it's brought up now) but about Jonbennet's parents tampering with the evidence... I have a friend who's child committed suicide, they were required by the police not to bring him down.  It was 12 hours after the investigation that the police/coroner took his body down.  Can you imagine seeing your child hang like that?  I'd have probably took Jonbennet down too.  This is a very confusing, hard to understand case.  And Richard Jewel is being compensated grandly through lawsuit winnings.  (Right?)</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Angie and BobbyK, I understand your views. But Richard Jewell
was merely the one who found the bomb at the scene, and nothing more.
The media must have decided, " Wouldn't it make a great story to implicate the supposed
"hero", in an unexpected turnout?". It was pure cruelty. But
Jonbenet's case is different, to my mind. What about the fact that
a "practice" ransom note was found? Would the real kidnapper have
brought along a practice note? There was no sign of forced entry.
This family is wealthy enough to have good security- so whoever
got in undetected must be very close to the family... or a member.
And it is likely that the dad was drunk the night before. So
think of this: He goes to bed drunk, after previously making
grandiose cover-up plans. He kills his daughter in a fit of violence,
meaning to torture her but killing her in the process- which he hadn't counted on.
He then falls back to sleep, and wakes up with the mom- at five in the morning.
Nobody gets up at five after a Christmas party unless something's wrong- which is a generalization but fits
perfectly here. The father tampers with the evidence in the hopes
of removing clues, and calls the cops to cast suspicion off of himself. But he has indirectly made a big mistake-
remember that he denies the cops the permission to search the home.
That means they need to spend another several hours with the magistrate
getting a warrant. That gives the frenzied father time to remove some other evidence. However,
his logic is flawed: A real kidnapper would never molest the girl while
still in the house- nor would he leave the body. And the practiced ransom note is
too ridiculous to be true. This seems to me to be an originally planned-out,
but ultimately botched, crime. And how about the media consultant. This guy was hired
by the family right after the murder to better their image. They even staged a church appearance!
These people are oblivious to reality, and I think once you examine
the admittedly circumstantial evidence, it looks mighty incriminating. 
I hope you will think this over. And Angie, I am truly sorry to
hear about your friend's child, whom I hope has gone to a better place.
This tragedy befell some of my good friends, so I know what it
feels like.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Crusader, your opinion is only formed by what the media is feeding you.  This is the problem.  Your assumptions on how a real kidnapper would behave are skewed.  Plenty of kidnappings and attempted kidnappings are sexual in nature.  I usually wake up very early in the morning, and even after a late party I can and do wake up as early as five am.  This guy is an executive of a billion dollar company; to him it's natural to hire a media consultant when confronted with the press.  I don't blame him, guilty or innocent.  None of us, including the media, have an access to the information which the police have.  It is easy to speculate on the circumstances, but it is not fair to the family to publicize this speculation.  Again, I don't know whether or not the parents had anything to do with this, but until they are convicted of a crime, they are innocent.  BTW, my beef is with the way the media handles stories like this, not with the kind of public debate which we're engaging with here.  KBW, thanks to the screwed up system of retribution in this country, Richard Jewel will never have to work again.</B><P>

<B>I am a cigar wholesaler of a couple of lines of cigars. They
are hand made in the cuban tradition and are reasonably priced.  
I will sell some at wholesale prices(10 box min).
Or at 20% below retail for smaller orders.

<B>My local cigar shop recently received a few boxes of these cigars.  This place is a discount tobacco store (mainly cigarettes) and doesn't have much of a selection, but the few good cigars they carry are usually at very good prices.  They have mostly the mexican line, with natural robustos (at $1.61), maduro toros (at $2.19), and maduro churchills (at $2.39), and also have the mystique dominican churchill (at $5.85).  They have the "Hugo" robusto (with the green band), which I believe is also made by Hugo Cassar or a parent company.  These prices seem reasonable to me, so I was wondering what the general opinion is one these cigars.  Let me know your experience and if these are reasonable prices.</B><P>

<B>Shmanky, My only regret about buying these cigars is not buying more.I purchased his Private Collection (honduran) and found them to be a fantastic smoke. I really dont think you can go wrong with these. You can get them wholesale from Kretek Imports, (800) 358.8100. He evn has a line of bundled cigars which were great as well. Get the catalog from Kretek, you'll thank me.

<B>Can somebody expalin this to me. I realize prices are out of control but this was very strange. I hit three of the local shops in my area, seeing what was new etc... and noticed the price range of the exact same cigar at the different shops. The cigar was a Habana Gold white lable, torpedo in a maduro wrapper. Shop 1 had them for $4.60, shop 2 at $9.60 and shop 3 at $6.08. I was very confused to say the least. I can understand markup and reasonble profit and all that, but prices seem to bordering on the ridiculous. </B><P>

<B>Go with Shop I.  It seems to me that some shops get them in, think that they
have the only boxes in town, and feel justified to charge about double of what they'd
cost if you bought from the manufacturer by the box.  Other stores are much cooler about
it, and charge what the cigar is worth, plus their cut.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>It sucks one big hot tamale! This is frustrating when you are
trying a new smoke at a store you have not visited before. I've been
stung a few times. Drew is right, stick with the shops you are familiar with.
When in a new shop, I check the prices of those smokes I know, then I can judge
pretty well if this shop is sticking it to the consumer. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The prices of cigars are "whatever the traffic will bear" at least around here in Northern NJ. The only local shop that regularly gets Fuentes sells them at MSRP while you drive 3 miles away and there sold at twice the price  when they have them. Habana Golds are all over this area. and while nobody is giving them away the prices are all pretty much the same as there seems to be no big demand for them. Many cigar shops overcharge or "Gouge" because they cannot get them through normal distribution, but must buy them at retail prices from other stores in order to have inventory. This seems to be the cause of some of the outrageous pricing.</B><P>

<B>My Parents just returned from Cuba and brought me back 2 boxes of "La Corona, Perfectos".  They are a small torpedo cigar.  I hadn't heard of them before so I looked them up in "The Cigar Companion" where the label is listed as a Dominican manufacturer, but the Perfectos aren't even mentioned.  The ones I have are excellent, incredibly flavourful!  They however are the Cuban ones - Hecho en Cuba  Totalmente a Mano.  Has anyone else ever heard of these?

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>My favorite Non Cubans are the Fuente Fuente Opus X line, especially the No. 2 Robusto & the No. 5 which is a Toro size. The Fuente Don Carlos Robusto, The Fuente Hemingway Classic and then several Padrons, especially the Anniversario Series Exclusivo which is a Robusto size. The standard Padrons are all very good as well. I prefer their 2000 & 3000 in a Maduro. I also love the Partagas No. 10.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>MP, here is what Smoke has to say about the Tabantillas.
Mild flavors, not overly complicated, but a very consistant, pleasant taste from
beginning to end. Full bodied, earthy, woody almost macho. Slightly spicy but not harsh.
Aftertaste: smooth, with no bitterness, slightly acidic with a little spice. Summary: The
Tabantillas have earned a small, devoted following. Medium strength and straightforward. Offers
good quality for the price. -------- MP this was taken from the latest issue of Smoke pg. 188, the cigar
was a corona "Condado Real" hope this helps.  </B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Well,I tried one driving home after work. I think I don't like them. The SMOKE review is about right. They are an OK cigar, nice roll, fine ash. The only thing I differ with them on is their referrence to them being "good quality for the price". The box was $57 plus postage. I got some cigars from Holts a few weeks ago called Honduran Rounds. They were one of their monthly specials at $17.95 for 25 coronas. Now they are $19.95 for the 25. The Tabantillas are no better than the Honduran Rounds. If anybody likes them and wants them , e-mail me. I'll let them go at cost. Otherwise, they get sent back on monday.  I really can't see keeping them when I have a box of AF Signatures and Petit Coronas on the way.</B><P>

<B>Greggorio, for some reason, I couldn't get my post to go up on the "Cooking Duck" thread.  With regard to mail order mallards, sometimes I think the mallards I shoot at are carrying the mail, but, I don't know of any source for mail order mallards.  There are places that offer so-called "wild" duck, which are commercially raised, but these are a pale immitation of the real thing. I would recommend that you go with Long Island duckling as an admirable substitute to true wild duck.  A different taste, but most excellent, especially when cooked in the French fashion, a l'orange.</B><P>

The highlight of the trip was sitting out under the stars around a roaring campfire, smoking our stogies, drinking sippin' whiskey and telling war stories until about one o'clock in the morning.  I'm going again the last week of the season and the prediction is for cold weather.  Maybe we'll have some luck.  If I do, I'll ship you some birds. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>It is intriguing to me to learn of your other interests.  (You, being my friends of the web.) It's refreshing to learn that even educated, modern men are hunting for sport.  The only people I've known who hunt are backwoods rednecks, that can barely read or write, much less converse on the net.  And, don't worry, that's one arena of male domain that I for one will never venture.  Happy hunting, or whatever I'm supposed to say.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Angie, I went on my first hunting trip when I was seven years old.  I'm now fifty-four, so, as you can see, I've been at it for a long time.  Contrary to what some might have you believe, it is not an issue of blood-lust.  I enjoy the comraderie and the culture that is part of the hunting tradition.  I only hunt what I consume and my freezer is usually well stocked with game.  I say usually, because I lost my cache when we lost power for seven days during Hurricane Fran.  However, we unloaded the freezer and cooked everything we could on our gas grill, and then distributed the bounty to our neighbors who were unable to obtain food during the aftermath of the storm. The storm menu included ducks, geese, venison, quail, and wild boar.  It was quite a treat for us all.  Hunting has been an integral part of my life since my childhood.  As you noticed, on my most recent trip, we didn't kill a thing, but I wouldn't give anything in the world for that weekend and the great time we had.  Thanks for your understanding and for your kind words.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Peter, it sounds like we had a similar experience with having to empty out our freezers.  I scuba dive & do quite a bit of lobstering/spearfishing.  I, like you, am not in it just for the kill.  I enjoy the fine eating that follows the hunting/diving.  I had a freezer full of lobster tails (about 40) when we had an ice storm last year & was without power for 5 days.  I had to pull everything out of the refrigerator & freezer and grill it.  I had 4 friends that came over & we ate steak & lobster tail, smoked cigars & drank way too much during that storm.  As it turned out, it was a pretty enjoyable disaster.</B><P>

I have been around while he has caught some sunning on the Rainforest Hwy in Panama...he goes crazy trying to get them in his trunk.  The 4-6 footers have some nasty teeth and Grand Pa was often a victim in retreat not conqueror. Angie some of these had an abundance of meat...but the old boy would never share his catch.  I've paid (big $$$) for iguana and it is tasty...but I'm not a fan like that old viejo.  SeaFood is my flare...grouper, some types of shark, monk fish, shellfish, squid, I like just about all types.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Greggorio, GrandPa is right. The Eel is quite a delicacy.  Sometimes restaurants substitue eel for scallops.  Most people never know the difference.  For myself, scallops is my favorite seafood and can tell the difference. I'm not sure about the Iguana, but the rattlesnake is darn good eatin'. We get lots of it here in South Texas.

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Talk about a true touch of class... The other
day, my wife stopped to buy me a couple of nice cigars for my birthday.
Since she doesn't know much of anything about them, she simply peeked in
my Humidor for some brand names, knowing that my really nice smokes are
in a separate compartment. Well... when she went to my favorite smoke shop,
one of the 'assistants' there obviously tried to pawn off a few defective
Avo's on her. The wrappers were badly ripped up on both, and he charged
her $9 (!!) each for the double corona size (I forget the number of that
size). Well, she brought them home, and I thanked her for the gift, knowing
that she knew not what she bought. The next day, I went to the store and
showed one of the owners what someone there had sold my wife. (Things hit
the fan, and one guy was called on the carpet there and then). In apology,
not only did Andy (the co-owner) replace these with nice ones, but handed
me two La Gloria Cubana's in apology for his employee's 'error'. Then..
to my amazement, he pulled out a Padron Aniversario Pyramid from his own
cabinet and gave it to me with a smile, handshake, and a happy birthday.
Now, that's class... </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Good job, smokem. I'm glad your tobbaconist realized
the importance of keeping good customers and providing quality service,
and glad to know you wouldn't put up with it. As far as this site goes,
the jerks will never completely disappear, but there are a good 10-15 people
here that can effectively eliminate the trash. I know Buzz and I enjoyed
teasing Borg, and Peter has a way of halting useless banter. It's quieted

to do is ignore the nasty's. And yes, my tobacconist does know how to make
amends doesn't he <g>. He's had my loyalty for a while now as his store
is a quality place with reasonable prices on most smokes. (BTW. That should
have read Anniversario in the post above.) I know how to smoke them better

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Your tobacconist is a good man, Smokem. Mine also
stands behind his smokes. I've never had any difficulty returning defective
cigars. This makes a strong case for the value of purchasing cigars from
a tobacconist versus a mail order establishment. Very few of them have
a return policy or a money-back guarantee.</B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>BobbyK, I think that part of the problem may be
that unlike many other cigars, these do not have cello wrappers, and therefore
get manhandled in the store by folks that don't know what they're doing.
Currently at my local store, wherever there is a box of unwrapped smokes
(such as Avo's, Cubita's, etc.), there is a little tag by the box asking
that patrons please not handle unwrapped cigars unless they plan on buying
some. There are however all too many that ignore the sign, and pick the
thing up anyway, just to take a look. (Although, if you know how to handle
a cigar I don't see the problem). The part that really gets me is when
someone crams one right up to their nose, taking a big whiff as they wipe
the entire length of it with their mustache, then put it back. I really
want to smoke that particular cigar.... NOT!</B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Drew &amp; Peter... I couldn't agree more. Shopping
around in my local shops is fun. The folks you get to talk to, the wonderful
aroma inside the humidor... it's all a part of the experience, just like
cutting and lighting the cigar is. My shop isn't all that much more than
mail-order, plus you can't sit around and chat with a mail order clerk.
Add to that the fact that the two shops I frequent stand behind their cigars
100%, and you've got one guy that does his business locally. The only reason
i'd mail order is if I really wanted a particular brand BAD and couldn't
find it here. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I had a bad experience with an Avo just the other
day. I purchased it from a store that I do not frequent; I was on the other
side of town (Dunwoody), but since I found them, I had to have one. The
store keeper sealed it in a ziplock bag and the next morning it was completely
unraveled. I guess I should have put it right in the humidor, but I planned
to smoke it that night. By the time I got home I was so exhausted, I went
straight to bed. I'm really disappointed in this. ($9) I can't figure out
exactly what the problem is. Does anyone know how it could have happened?</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>You either had gremlins or the cigar was not stored
correctly by the shop where you purchased it. It was either too dry or
too damp, I can't remember which, but I suspect too dry. Also, since this
cigar is not stored in cello (naked), it would tend to dry out faster.</B></P>

The quality was okay, but they didn't taste the same as I remembered. Just
real bland and papery (They were both about $6 each)</B></P>

moist to the touch. When I &quot;listened to the band&quot; nothing. (Even
when I discovered it all unraveled.) The Cigar Merchant is about 30-45
minute drive for me. I didn't bother to take it back. I did take it to
my store to let the owner see. It's always good to learn about what can
go wrong. - - - About the company, I've started hearing more and more about
rushing and poor quality to push quantity. How unfortunate, because the

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Almost without fail, I am buying cigars now that
I plan on smoking in about 4-6 months. It's a pain to look at all those

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>You're definitely right about the no-cello Avos,
Smokem. That, combined with the fact they probably rush them to market
makes it difficult for me to buy them. I used to smoke them pretty regularly
(#5) but don't bother anymore. Unraveling is usually caused by too little
humidity. To much humidity will make them expand to the point where they
bust out of the wrapper, but I wouldn't count that as unraveling. </B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Drew, Now that you mention it, I can't remember
the last time I went to a good shop and walked out empty handed. I have
however walked out of not-so-good shops that didn't have anything worth
buying. One &quot;smokers shop&quot; I went into had aromatic red cedar
all over the place and nothing but popular brands at very inflated prices.
I walked out of that one fast. (They wanted $5 for an H. Upmann Corona!!).
As far as the Avo's go folks, I have to agree that they just aren't the
same as they used to be. I've got several sitting in the Humidor to age
for a while. The two that I mentioned before won't see the light of day
until spring probably. By then they should have aged enough to be tasty.
One brand that still seems to be smokable right out of the store is almost
anything by Arturo Fuente. I've not been dissapointed yet, and hope it
stays that way. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>My favorite cubans never have cello on them either.
When I'm shopping for these, I have to spend much more time checking them
out. There always seem to be little nicks, dings, etc. I think that the
Avo company would benefit greatly from using cello wrappers. It may not
be the traditional, purist, attitude, but it would probably make them more
money. If for no other reason than the people reading this thread that
won't be trying any soon.</B></P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I had an interesting experience the other day.  I went in to one of my regular cigar shops & bought the last 5 cigars of some unparticular, unknown Honduran brand in my quest to find something new to smoke.  I took the cheap wooden box with me to the cash register as I usually do when I buy the last cigars in a box.  I also had 5 Macs, 5 Partagas#10, 3 Hemingways & a couple of cheaper cigars, in all about a $150 purchase.  After the clerk rang up my bill, she told me that they were not going to let customers have the wooden boxes anymore, they were getting low on their supply of them.  I rather politely told her she could put all of the cigars back in her humidor, and I would be doing my future purchases elsewhere.  All that for a $2 cigar box.  Thank goodness I live in area where demand is not that high & I can get my Fuentes, etc. from another source.  I will, I am sure, try to visit the store again when I know the owner is going to be there & question his new policy? I have introduced 6 or 7 new customers/new cigar smokers to his store in the year or so, what some treatment </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>At the cigar shop where I work, we have started selling our boxes too.  It's quite ridiculous, I agree, but following are a couple of reasons why:  Girl/Boy Scouts etc. have come for them (all) for projects and they started hounding us once a week for our boxes; some of them are quite nice and we (employees) fight (friendly) over them; and some of them have little humidifing devices in them (we sell those for even more).  HOWEVER, if someone comes in and spends a bundle, and wants a box, we give it to them!  Our regular customers, we give it to them.  But, for those (non-smokers) who come in asking for boxes we sell them; and believe it or not...THEY BUY THEM!  We sell those cheap paper covered boxes for $3. nice wooden ones for #5., and the humidor boxes for $20.  You'd be amazed, we sell out every week!  So, of course the owner thinks this is a great idea, and doesn't want any given for free, but we always take care of our regular customers and those big spenders!  </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>So, selling cigars individually, you sell all 25 cigars for more
than the toal box would sell for.  Then you sell the box itself.
If you carry out that logic to its end, pretty soon they'll stop selling cigars by the box.

I cut about 30 holes in a plastic tube from some Antonio y Cleopatra's and fitted it with oasis foam. Using a 50/50 mixture seemed to release the moisture so slow that I went to using just water to saturate the foam with. I saturate the foam once a week and unless I open the box more than twice a day it works just fine.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Andy, I too am trying to use a cigar box as a make-shift humidor.  I picked up a Bering box from my tobacco store, bought a Credo humidification device & a hygrometer to go in it.  Now it looks just like a bought humidor.  Unfortunatly, it does not function like one.  The wood on the inside is not finished, it is very rough & seems to absorb more moisture than do the cigars.  It seems that the wood is actually pulling moisture out of my cigars.  I pulled my Ashtons, Avos, & better cigars out of the box & put them in a ziplock (slightly open) with a moist cotton ball & the hygrometer out of the Bering box.  The bag is actually maintaining about 70-75rh vs the Bering box 60rh. Any suggestions from anyone on how to salvage the Bering box (sand it smooth?, varnish it?).  I am afraid to put any finish on the inside wood, won't it ruin the taste of my cigars? </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>You are correct about the interior wood.  It is NOT to be varnished.  It should feel a bit
rough.  From what i hear people say, it seems that some cigar boxes work better than others as 
functional humidors.  If you read all the threads in the humidor section, you'll see that Pleaides
boxes are popular.  A humidor is built for long term storage of cigars, but a cigar box is more of a
packaging device, that is then placed in a humidor (at your cigar shop).  Maybe the wood is different, or
the fact that it's thinner makes it not work as well as a humidor.  </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Brent, I ran into the same problem with many of my early
attempts at converting my old boxes into humidors.  Finally I
have found a method that seems to work for me.  Finding the right box
(one that appears that it will be more airtight than others)is the first
step.  Then I remove any interior lining so I am left with 
just the shell.  I line the shell with those large laminating sheets
(the clear plastic that is adheasive on one side). This makes the box
almost air tight and prevents the exterior wood from sapping
up all the humidity. I then put the lining back in and get Spanish cedar sheets from my store
and line the inside of the box.  After this I stain and Urithane the outside
several (6) times till I get the extra moisture protection and 
the look I want.  I guess after all this rambeling all I really 
wanted to say was that for me lining the shell of the box is 
the key to retaining the proper moisture.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Drew & Andy, Thanks for the advise.  I think I may try the laminate idea, that it certainly the first time I have ever heard that one.  At this point, I don't think I have anything to lose.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Andy's idea of using plastic laminate is outstanding. I have
built a number if cigar box humidors and wish I had thought
of it at the time. This laminate should make the box more
airtight with the added bonus of greatly reducing the 
humidors break-in stabilization period.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>By the way, I just converted the box from a box of Padron
3000's. I put in the smallest Credo with a Radio Shack 
hygrometer. It is keeping perfect 70% and holds 15 to 25
cigars of 5.5 inch length (or longer but less in number
if placed lengthwise). Great cigar and a great small humidor.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Buzz...Just finished one myself.  A small Te-Amo box, sanded and stained, 
that holds about 5 at 5.5 or so.  Put a small humidification tube
in it and a small analogue(sp?) hygrometer.  I am planning on using
it as a travel humidor. It might not be as pretty as the real thing
but it is a hell of a lot more fun to make than it would be to buy.

P.S...I made one a while ago that I really liked. I took my time 
and it turned out better than I ever expected.  Unfortunatly I 
used a new type of adhesive (pretty stupid) and after I humidified the box I 
opened it to put some cigars in and the stench from the adhesive
was overwhelming.  Too bad, to this day it sits in my closet 
in hopes that the smell will die, but it has not.  Don't make the 
same mistake I did.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Buzz, or anyone, I was at my store today and there was a real
nice box made for the shop (Signature) that was solid and looked
very nice.  I was going to buy it and turn it into a humidor, but
the box was similar to a Mi Cubano box where all the cigars
stand upright.  While I think this would be a good way of storing
a lot of different brands (since they are seperated), I heard somewhere that standing up
cigars is not a good way to store them.  Is there any truth to this?
And if so what are the disadvantages.</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by Andy at  on Monday, December 23 at 11:14 PM EST<p></FONT></TT>
<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Andy, some people say that the upright position prevents
even moisture dispersal. I tend to believe this. the main problem that I see is that
the compartments may prevent a free flow of air throughout
the box. I would opt for a more traditional box. My recommendation
is a box with a raise inner lip akin to a traditional humidor.
This helps create a good seal.</B><P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Thanks Coo-GAR and everyone else. I got quite
a few postings removed from the bottom of the stack and am going through
the rest. I'd like a little more input from everyone on the subject, however.
1) How long would you like to see each thread remain idle before deleting
it? 2) We are thinking of the Compuserve Forum model where the information
available for immediate viewing is dated from 2 weeks previous. If you
want to follow a thread back, however, you can reset the message date and
access back a bit further. 3) Any other suggestions are very welcome. Thanks
for the help. We are working on making this site better and your ideas
are a big plus. </B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Webmaster- As far as how long a thread should
remain, I think it depends on the information. You have new people tapping
into this site everyday. Those new people have questions that us old users
have answered several times. Useful info like humidity levels, building
humidors, best bundles, inexpensive smokes, etc., are threads that may
be looked at and added to for months. But some of the others get old fast!!
If no one makes a comment on something for 2 weeks, I think everyones has
seen it and is done with it. I feel it is up to you to decide what is useful
and informative data to keep on for long periods of time.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Thanks again, Coo-GAR. Another idea that has been
going around here is discussion topic headers. As you also point out, useful
ideas like Humidity, Bundles, Humidors, Inexpensive Smokes, etc. are perennial
topics of interest. However, as you also point out, the topics have already
been explored pretty thoroughly by some knowledgeable people. Going over
the topics again would be counterproductive, waste everyone's time, but
still should be available for newcomers as a source of information. How
about suggestions, starting here, on what headers everyone would like to
see posted as sub-sections of 'Let's Discuss It' to see so threads can
be organized. You've started the list with (Humidity, Bundles, Humidors,
Inexpensive Smokes). I'll throw in Cigar Specs, Tobacco, Wines &amp; Spirits,
Cigars &amp; Food, Accessories and New Found Favorites. Anyone else care
to make some suggestions?</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Those sound great!!! How about &quot;Mail Order
Cigar Companies&quot; with the addresses, phones, e-mail. But wacth for
company's doing there own advertising. I feel that comments on service
and such should come from consumers, not the companies. How about a topic
on &quot;Cigar Dinners and Gatherings&quot; and sub-divide the topic into
regions. You can do the same with retail outlets so when someone is travelling
to a specific city, we can list and look up the best stores.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Webmaster, Our cigar categories are &quot;Famous&quot;,

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Thanks for the suggestion..... Do you mean I should
take the contents of the two threads sort them alphabetically by Brand
name or by the first word of each thread? I thought about doing it that
way and rejected it for a couple of reasons. First, the 'Not So Famous'
threads seemed to ask questions about cigars from places or regions, rather
than specific brands. Second, the 'Famous' and 'Favorite' headings were
sorted, after reading them all, by which threads advocated something strongly
(Favorites) and which threads dealt with famous brands but not necessarily
as a preferred item., (Cigars or otherwise). I'm not saying this will be
the final set of headings by any means. I asked for opinions a while ago
on what features people would like to see in a renovated site. The responses,
along with my reading of all the threads over a period of time, and managements'
desire to improve the site led to the initial trial format. We would like
opinions and suggestions from all of you so we can continue developing
the site as a joint effort. Our goal is to make it one absolute knock out
of a site. We want your help in our efforts. Thanks again. </B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I suggest you put only the threads that deal with
specific brands in alphabetical order acording to brand. It shouldn't matter
if a brand is somebodies favorite or not. It would be nice to know exactly
where to look for specific brand information and reviews. Also, why don't
we make a humor category for threads? I have one more question: is there
a spell checker I could use to check my posts?</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Barfolemu,...Thanks for the suggestion. You are
correct, an alphabetical sort would be very helpful, but as with everything,
there is a price. In the site's current context, we are dealing with a
text document that is added to from the top down. Since that is the case,
each thread is a running document, not a series of smaller documents nested
under a frame header document. What this means is that each thread is listed
in an alphabetical format but is dated by the date it was originally created,
NOT the date it was most recently updated by a new posting. Readers have
asked for a method to know what is current since I am moving threads from
the top of the main page into the headings I think they best fit under.
If I then do an alphabetical sort under the various headings, it will be
very difficult to tell what is current and what is not. For the moment,
if you use Netscape Navigator, I suggest you go to the EDIT menu and use
FIND to locate whatever it is you are interested in. It works very well.
......HUMOR....... I agree with you on this. I am looking at threads from
the archive and am finding that most threads that dealt with humor, in
the past, quickly deteriorated into scatalogical or sexual contexts. While
there has been quite a wealth of humorous subject matter dealing with these
frames of reference over the years, I also have to address the preferences
of management as regards content, so it's a fine line I must tread. Check
out the Cigar Quotes and Philosophy thread under the 'Favorites' section....
Finally,....SPELL CHECKER....The answer is YES,..we want one. It ws suggested
before that the Wall Street Journal had a very good one so I contacted
them but with no success. I am working on that one. Last.. We also want
to make the 'Follow-Up' reply window large enough to see and review all
of your message before posting it. We are working on it. ......Greggorio......Thank
you for bearing with us, It is my pleasure to help make this site better
for everyone and thank you for your kind offer. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Webmaster, I notice that most of the threads in
which I participate have been deleted. We have several non-cigar threads,
and I see from the above post that we may have more coming in the humor
section, so I don't think that they were removed bacause of lack of cigar
relevance. You must have removed them because of the language of some of
the participants. If you check them again, you will see that I have never
used obscene language. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Sage....Those threads were removed because each
one of them had almost immediately deteriorated into baiting and invective.
Yes, some of what you have to say is informative, humorous, and relevant....However,....you
seem to delight in 'stirring the kettle' so to speak. This is fine, in
and of itself, but I have to read each of the threads and then edit out
what is relevant and what is drivel...I also have to justify the time spent
here as more than schoolyard supervision....If you want your posts to remain,
I suggest you reach an accord with the people you have baited in the past
and begin having reasonable discussions rather than name calling sessions
just to demonstrate how acerbic your wit is....If I see that I am spending
an inordinate amount of time cleaning up the debris you leave in your wake,
I will continue to utilize that most expedient of editing tools,..the clean
sweep! ....your call!.... </B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>She-ra....while you were on vacation there were
some very crude threads posted that referred to you in an unflattering
manner, to say the least. I deleted every one I came across. For the past
few days, a person or persons was/were attacking the site vigorously. It
culminated in a session that went virtually non-stop and lasted from early
morning yesterday until about 20:00 hrs last night when that person/persons'
access was blocked. Numerous threads were affected, among those were the
ones you mentioned. I had intended to copy the receipes from the &quot;Cooking
Duck' thread for myself but the thread got trashed before I had a chance.
My attention was directed towards keeping the site viable and 'on the air'
so I couldn't save all of them. I would be happy to have you start another
one and ask that whoever contributed receipes before please take the time
to repost them so we can all enjoy them during the holidays. ....Sorry
for the inconvenience......btw,....you may notice that one or two of the
'handles' are non-active from now on. We traced the majority of the invasive
threads to one location and feel that site may have been providing us with
'multiple, destructive, snide personalities on-line', if you get my drift.

Great Britain III was docked just north of Lauderdale off A1A. Have you
ever seen her? I began my sailing on that beauty before it was sold. Have
not seen her since.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Webmaster, I was wondering if you could help me.
I inserted a comment about the rules on bringing Cuban Cigars back into
the U.S. from overseas. I think it was deleted before anyone replied. Was
I out of line? I've been smoking cigars regularly for a year now and I've
been pretty lucky to have had a few good Cuban Cigars. I have relatives
in Buffalo,NY (about 2hrs from Toronto) and alot of friends in the military.
I don't want to get anybody into trouble so, that's why I'm asking. Great
format! </B></P>

thread about the subject in today's new posts and another in the 'Other
Topics' section. I have no idea which is yours. At the moment, the best
way to find the threads is to do a search (for example: in Netscape 3 go
to Edit \ Find and type the word Bringing) You are not out of line but
check the responses (including the one from US Customs) regarding the practice
of importing prohibited articles....It doesn't sound like a very good idea
to me, personally. </B></P>

I have enjoyed every minute of it. I was always told that you should
never buy the first car you look at or the first house you tour.  With this

I can honestly say that my first experience with such forums has remained the best.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Do a net search for Napa Humidors on the web.  I had Kevin Foley (the owner) make me an Ahab Model which holds about 60 good size cigars.  The cost was only $225.00 and it is extreamely nice.  It is solid mohogany and walnut ion the outside, and non-aromatic cedar on the inside with brass hinges and a brass closure.  Trust me, you will be impressed.  Also, check out J & S Humidors, they have an inexpensive model that is also top of the line for around $200.00.</B><P>

with nice grain.  It works very well too, and is big.  It was only about $200,
and is lined with spanish cedar.  I'm very pleased with it.  The only drawbacks
are that they don't take credit cards and they have a 2 month wait.  There is a good

<B>Andy, I have a Peterson box case.  It holds three churchill length cigars or smaller, has a hard leather shell and will fit comfortably in a coat or sport jacket pocket.  I prefer it to the cigar-shaped cases because of the flexibility.  As far as how long to leave cigars in your case, I've never pushed it beyond eight hours.  Hope this helps.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Andy, leather cases are for show only.  I wouldn't keep a cigar in them for more than a few hours, say an evening out.  The leather sucks the humdidity right out of the cigars.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>These cases are great for protecting your smokes from getting crushed while in your jacket. As far as keeping them humidified, I wouldn't put my cigar in there if I wasn't going to smoke it that day/evening. If your cigar has a cellophane wrapper, it might be less critical. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>For about the same price, they sell cylindrical travel humidors that hold
6-10 cigars, are spanish cedar lined, and have a small humidifier on the screw-off
lid.  I'm probably going to get one of these.  They appear to be able to keep cigars
in good shape for over a week.  They are a little bulkier than the leather case, but much
more functional.  Right now I travel with a tupperware container, which is getting old.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Andy, My wife bought me a nice leather cigar case for my Bday. 
It got stollen in Havana Cuba last Oct. It was an Italian, 
telescopic, 2 cigar capacity and it had hard plastic tubbing inside to protect cigars 
the leather was specially treated to resist humidity (but not thievs) 
and would keep cigars in perfect smoking condition for up to
a week. This case was over $100 dlls. Very sturdy and elegant...
I'll miss it!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I've got a three fingered leather job.  It sucks the moisture out of a cigar in just a few hours.  I've even put it in the humidor for a few days to see if it would take on some moisture but that didn't help either.  If it hadn't been a present I'd pitch it.  Be careful in what you buy.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Unless I'm planning on a torpedo I use one of two tubes I've
bought cigars in:  Macanudo Hampton Court or Romeo y Julieta
Churchill.  The R&J gets more "attention" since it held the
real thing - Havanas!  Wish I had more of the real thing
inside but sadly they're gone.  These hold most of the
sizes I smoke and seem to keep whatever's in them fairly 
fresh for three to four days.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>My husband and I share a Peterson leather case (the kind Peter speaks of) and a 3 finger R&J leather case. These are strictly for carrying your cigars for the evening (Sometimes I forget to empty the cases when we arrive back home and I've found our precious cargo hard and crispy!) The Peterson fits any size cigar. The R&J holds only up to corona sizes. However they do make the R&J in a Churchill size but if you only have smaller cigars inside it will telescope to fit them- and I think the R&J is more attractive! I'd also definitely get a 3 finger- you can never have too many cigars!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I have two offbeat suggestions about leather cigar cases. I think they are beautiful, but
I lost my first one on an airplane. It was in my suit jacket pocket which was in the
overhead compartment. When I retrieved the jacket, I forgot to check for the case. 
So, there went $100. Second, everything above argued to me to buy the plastic pocket 
Traveldor. It's only around $30 if you lose it. It doesn't look that bad. It keeps
the cigars better than the leather.</B><P>

but continue to look into the plastic ones as well as the cases with the 
aluminum tubes.  Thank you all for your advice, it has been very helpful.</B><P>

celebratory cigar. OpusX is always a good choice. They have a double corona
which goes for almost 20 bucks. I would also buy a bunch of less expensive
cigars for your friends who won't know the difference. Get some Chateau
Fuente Double Chateaus or 8-5-8s for them. You'll still be giving them
a classy cigar, but won't be spending an arm and a leg.</B></P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>As several people have noted, the perfect cigar is the one
you enjoy the most.  In this case, Steve, I think you'd want
a big (i.e. Churchill or double corona) cigar.  My favorite
big one is the Partagas #10.  The Ramon Allones Redondo is
similar to the Partagas #10.  On my wedding day, I lit up
a Cuban Romeo y Julieta Churchill, but we married outside
the U.S.  Best of luck.</B><P>

<B>I am spending the weekend after Christmas in San Antonio. We will celebrate our 10th anniversary on the 28th. I know of the HUMIDOR at the Menger Hotel. Does any body know of any other good cigar shops in S.A.? Also, what about cigar friendly restaraunts or lounges? I know most of the outdoor seating at the riverwalk is OK on cigars, but the weather may be a bit cool for much of that.</B><P>

<B>We all have our top five cigars, and for the most part they usually include the "classics".
To make it challenging and informative how about everyone's top five that do not come from
the "usual suspects" (ie. Hemingway, LGC, R&J, Partagas, etc.)  Qualify your answers.  For example
the top five that are usually available, or the top five that people may not have heard of, the top
five everyday smokes, top five morning smokes, etc. (be creative)

Mine is the top five under 5$ and readily available: (in no particular order) La Unica 400, Fighting Cock-Rooster Arturo,
El Credito, Havana Classico, and Puros Indios. (all in the 5x50 range)</B><P>

<B>Montesino Diplomat, La Unica 400, JR Special Jamaican, Tresado, and as a last resort AF Curly Head (Maduro).  These are all under $5 (closer to $3) & readily available.  These are great smokes to keep in your humidor along with your favorites, as they are much easier handed out to your non-cigar friends than is an Ashton or Hemingway.</B><P>

folks will think I'm very strange (at best) for liking these.  In
order: 1) Dannemann - this is partly a tribute to the 
greatest cigar smoker I'll never meet, my wife's grandfather.
He smoked Dannemann 2) Muniemaker Long Naturals - I went
to college right where this tobacco is grown 3) Joya de
Nicaraugua Viajante - a good cheap smoke, but still not
what they were in the '70s 4) Royal Jamaican Churchills -
the first premium cigar I ever had.  5) Casa Blanca 
Jeroboam - the biggest cigar I've ever had.  10"/66 gauge and
it's very mild.</B><P>

<B>Okay, I need some clarification.  A cigar rating book I was looking at listed
two Hoyo de Monterrey Excalibur #1s.  It gave the same origin, wrapper, size and ring
gauge for both, yet gave them different rankings.  When I looked up the comments on the
two cigars, they were completely different.  One received an 89 ranking, and the other an 80.  What's
going on here, and if there are two different cigars, how can I be assured I get the one I want?
The same "problem" existed for the Macanudo Hyde Park.</B><P>

<form method=POST action="sillycigarratings.pl">
<B>Drew - the different ratings could be due to the different year in which the crop was grown (like wine), or, the editor was an idiot.  Forget about the ratings.  Smoke the cigar man!  If you like it, buy more.  If you don't, don't!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>right!  I agree.  It's just that the one ranked 89 was described the
way I think of them.  The other sounded like smoking a dirt clod.  I just

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Drew these people are giving it to you straite , forget who or where one says anything about anything, but see the big picture, Hoyo's or Excaliburs are a fantastic experience for someone who likes a fine smoke. My favorits would be Excalibur # 1 with the EMS wrapper, Hoyo Cuban Largo Maduro Wrapper or a #2 Maduro, then Cuban's of course have a sweet spot in the humidor </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Drew, I have the same book as you, and I noticed the listing for that Excalibur. I'm not sure what they mean by this- Plus they don't even list an Excal #4. The Hyde Park is available in a maduro- Maybe that's what they're referring to? (Maybe same with the #1?) Good luck!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>A cigar rating is always someone else's opinion.  In general,
*some* of the good cigars are rated high, along with those
that I have tried and don't like.  I think the only thing
most people agree on are that you shouldn't buy Te-Amos,
but Arturo Fuentes are good smokes.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Maybe ya'll don't understand what I'm asking, though Pauly might have answered
it in his first comment.  I don't care what the cigar is ranked, and first tried one
years ago on the advice of a friend.  It just suprised me, when I looked up one of my
favorite cigars, and saw two listings.  I was just trying to find out how that was possible.
I know I like the cigar, and could care less what it's ranked, or who else in the world likes
it.  That's all.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>No Peter, just a doctorate. But again, you miss the point.
what does it matter if a cigar rates a 76 or a 96 if one 
truly enjoys it as Drew does. Being so concerned with ratings
is ridiculous with such a subjective activity as cigar 
smoking. Ratings are for those too mentally lazy to form
their own opinions, or, in Drew's case, unwilling to accept
what he already knows. He loves the damn cigar, what does it
matter what anyone else thinks.

LISTEN to the man. What he was trying to clarify is, are there two (2) "different"
cigars with the same name but different; origin, wrapper, ring size, etc. He appears
to know what he likes and doesn't need a lecture from you, maybe he's onto something.

point is represetative of the consensus, that the main idea
is to enjoy the cigar. He enjoys the cigar- great, wonderful,
but why in the world should he get his bowels in an uproar
over ratings in one book. As to my doctorate, I only 
mentioned because I was referred to as a cretin. When my

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>You had best LISTEN to the man. He states that both cigars
have the SAME origin, ring size, wrapper, etc. By suggesting
that he may "be onto something" you aren't doing him any
favors. While Drew states that he doesn't care about ratings,
if you look at what he is really saying he is indeed hung
up on ratings. So much so that I expect that the next time
he is presented with buying a box of Excalibur #1 he will
not do so because he is afraid that he will buy a box of the
"inferior" sticks because the tobacconist cannot answer his
nonsensical and irrelevant question. And the next time he
smokes this cigar and it doesn't taste the same as his 
first(which  we know can be because of a multitude of
reasons that have little or nothing to do with the cigar)
he will blame it on a silly rating in a silly book, and will
pass on purchasing a great cigar that will soon be quite
rare.  Everyone heard Drew and gave him the best possible
advice: take ratings with a grain of salt.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Here's the deal, Borg.  I read about cigars a lot, on the web, in the book store, where ever.  I remember
what I read and am able to recollect the information when people ask.  In the "98 in CA Ranking" others
will notice (you seemed too dull to) that I was passing on what I remembered from skimming a book.  Also, you'll
see that I don't necessarily go by them, as I've said numerous times.  Why can't you just refrain from all the 
immature "allowance" type comments and assumptions that are completely unfounded and childish.  I don't mind a friendly disagreement, but
it takes two intelligent people, and I can't consider "Borg" one of them.  I'm not sure what your real name is (most honest, constructive
people here provide a real one), but you've said nothing constructive in this thread.  You say you're done with me.  Let's see if
you can live up to your word and stop being so petty.  The world is a much better place when you use your energy to help others rather
than try to put them down.  Unfortunately, people like you never seem to learn this lesson.  </B><P>

<B>Greggorio, look below in the Quebec thread where you rebuked me. You have my apologies for the misunderstanding incurred, although I felt
a bit brutalized overall. I feel I have posted a reasonable clarification of the miss-stated original query and that you have me all wrong.
I would appreciate if you could check that and respond; if we reach an understanding I may buy
some tea or coffee, provided I am no longer ridiculed for "having very little actual cigar advice" or
belonging to the NWO thread.</B><P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Cuban Crusader, I, too, am an ardent fan of bourbon,
especially straight Kentucky's, (I'm not overly fond of sour mashes, although
I'll not turn one down). But, Crusader, the Beaujolais Nouveau's are only
released once a year, and only remain drinkable for about sixty days. That's
why I look forward to them so. They're like a great, limited edition cigar.

Don't spend over $9.00 for it elsewhere. If you are still having difficulty

<B>I just bought a bottle of this today. $9.00. By the way, I didn't see it anywhere here, but according to the experts, you can keep Beaujolais Nouveau for up to 2 years. I'll let you know what I think! Thanks for the suggestion! </B><P>

Although, it could be done.  2/15 has been ruled out because of sweetheart obligations.  I think it's going to be hard to plan a three day weekend, is that necessary?  If you traveled in on Friday night, stayed over a Sat., left Sun. you'd still get great rates.  I really want to make this possible for as many people that would like to come.  So please offer as many suggestions as you can think of.  Just trying to make everyone happy:)</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I think that we have already decided on a date: 2/8.  (see above posts)  Location?!!!!  I need some help.  I'd kinda like to dominate one of the rooms at the Martini Club.  But, Drew has voiced his objections to that.  I don't want to go to the Havana Club, it's very corporate/pre-fab.  I walked in and thought I was at Chili's Bar & Grill.  Even their private room was uncomfortable.  It gets a BIG FAT NO from me.  Someone suggested Earle's room at the Ritz?  What's that?  Has anybody been to the cigar lounge at Mambo Jumbo?  Excellent resteraunt downtown on Park Place.  I haven't been upstairs to the private lounge, but will check it out this week!  Any suggestions will be appreciated.  Drew:  no offense on that Havana Club, but remember that anything in Buckhead is going to be obnoxious on a Saturday night.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Think you're getting me confused with someone else, Angie.  I never recommended the 
Havana club.  I'm just over all the fake people at Martini Club, especially on weekends.  I recommended
somewhere more quiet, such as a hotel lounge/bar.  Mumbo (not Mambo) Jumbo gets packed on weekends, and the 
dinner crowd is usually so large that they spill over into the bar.  Plus they have (or used to, I haven't been recently) free drinks
on Friday happy hour, making it a zoo.  I'd still say that Martini club is the best bet so far.  Didn't Matty or someone suggest a place where
one of his friends works?</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Winston's, if I remember correctly, is a bar/grill, kinda like 3$.  I doubt they'd appreciate us taking up that must space in a resteraunt for that long of a time.  Pardon me on the Mumbo madness.  Still waiting to hear about the club room at the Ritz.  If we close the door to the private room at MC, only the server would come in and out.  I've never had a problem with unwelcomed intruders.  Let's kinda keep that as an option.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I've eaten at the Ritz-Buckhead once, and spent some time downstairs at the bar.  It was nice, but drinks
were pricey and I don't think they really want/need you there unless you're a guest.  It has been named the best
restaurant in Atlanta each of the last 3 or 4 years.  Luckily I had my firm paying the tab.  So I'd vote that out too.  Oh Angie, in
a totally unrelated (well kinda) subject, how's that humidor working now?  What's in it?</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Well, I'm ashamed to say...that I was a little slow in getting a Credo device (my humidor didn't come with one) and then I had to get the distilled water.  So, it really hasn't been that long.  Besides, don't forget, I've got that nice big humidor at Chef at my disposal.  So, I just kinda buy as I go. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Ah, well, I thought I remembered you saying you couldn't store your cigars at chef,
and since you don't get a discount there, I figured you bought at a store with more reasonable
prices.</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by drew at  on Monday, January 13 at 03:33 PM EST<p></FONT></TT>
<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Yeah, well...I kinda find room for them in the back.  I just can NOT store Cuban's in there at all!  Our prices aren't too high.  On some yes, but a lot of them ($) are comparable to TB at Lenox.  Besides, have you seen the $ at the bars?!  Ouch!  La Gloria Cubano at Chef: $9. at MC: $15.  I also don't like the attitude of the cigar girl at MC.  And, a lot of times, I get rude service at TB, and Cigar Merchant.  So I tend not to go back.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Gotcha.  The only way I'd ever buy a cigar at the Martini Club (or any other cigar bar) is
if my date wanted one.  I usually will bring my own, but sometimes you end up at a cigar bar without
planning to.  In that case, I can curb my desires.  Yes, your shop isn't too much (if any) higher than other
places.  I compare prices to what I can get direct from factories or mail order.  And as you know, I'm a loyal
Edward's customer.  But Chef definately has the nicest and coolest employees, as well as the best looking by far.  Hmmm...that sounds
like I'm kissing your butt, doesn't it.  Well for those that haven't been there, there are honestly at least 5 or 6 very cool, fun,
good looking women working the counter.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Thanks Drew, not butt kissing, it's flattery...and that never hurt anyone.  Did you hear about our (now nixed) plan to have our own cigar label printed?  It was called "7 Senoritas" (did I spell that right?)  But, the manufacturer only had certain cigars to choose from that these bands could be placed.  And they were horrid!!!  The manufacturer said that it didn't matter because they would sell as a specialty cigar and people would buy them anyway.  We didn't want to put our name on crap, so we didn't.  Too bad that fell through, because I loved that name.  </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I think I suggested the Havana Club, not out of knowledge, just throwing a name out, You're probably right about Winston's  but I'll ask my wife's friend works there, also it is in Roswell I'm not sure if that is a good location for everyone. So far The Martini Club sounds good I like the idea of our own room.   Angie I just bought a Humidor from W&W Humidors in Alpharetta, it is great only $75 holds 50-75 (depending on size) and I was able to get it to 70% RH in just a couple of hours (came with a humistat). Sometimes wiping the inside with distilled water </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Yes, you spelled it correctly, although the n has a little ~ over it.  And yes, Caroline told
me about the cigar ya'll were going to have named after you.  I would have bought one, just for the band.  Too
bad they couldn't give you a good cigar, but I'm not suprised.  It would have been pretty cool for you, Caroline, Allie, LaShondra, Kim, and
the owners to have been immortalized in a cigar band.  Not a bad cigar fact, having one named after you.</B><P>

this meeting, I was fairly sure that we'd end up there.  It's been my vote the whole time.  Maybe some
other night we Atlanta smokers (6 of us) could go new places.  So we know the Bat-Time, Bat-Channel.  Now for the smokes -- Someone

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Oh yeah, and I bet we will have some stories to tell!!!  OK, for anyone who doesn't know what we are referring to with the "cigar swap".  Everyone who is coming to Atlanta 2/8, should bring two extra cigars to trade.  We can put all of them in a cigar box, and each person gets to pull two cigars out.  Then, you can trade or keep.  Everybody needs to be respectful and honorable, no crap cigars in the swap.  Maybe even - we could initial the bands and then that way, for instance, if I pulled a cigar that I'd never heard of, I could go to "JO" (John O) and ask his advise and opinions.  If it was a really harsh/strong cigar, I could trade for something someone else got.  If anyone doesn't want to participate, they wouldn't have to.  I'd also suggest that each person bring their favorite cigar to enjoy that night.  That way, in case you're not in an adventurous mood, you know that you'll have your own to enjoy.  BTW:  The cigars at the Martini Club are ridiculously expensive, so don't plan to wait and buy them there!</B><P>

swap sounds great, as I'm sure they'll be some great ones.  I'll want them all no doubt.  Angie, you might be showing your tender young age.  In the

Maybe you guys could set it up through Angie's store (Chef?), or even throught the Martini Club.  Now that GC has gotten us all together, maybe they could send us a few cigars for our dinner & an on-line review thereof.  What do you think: Angie, Drew, John O, Matty?

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Directions to the Martini Club as requested: Take I75/85N connector through downtown Atlanta.  Exit at Techwood/10th St./14th St. (all that's on the exit sign) travel the exit ramp and turn on 14th Street (toward the buildings).  Turn right on Crescent Avenue (it's before you get to Peachtree St.) and find a place to park.  The Martini Club is on your right, between South City Kitchen and Mystic Pizza.  Meet us upstairs in the room to the right.  Also as requested: Dress is whatever makes you happy.  I'll probably dress up (I always do), Drew will probably wear jeans.  I've seen everything there from evening gowns and tux's to jeans and a sweatshirt.  So just be you.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Well Angie, as you know, the thrift store thing in this town has become more
expensive than buying things new.  North Carolina is still old school.  Yes, I used to 
go to Kaya a lot, since I love Jazz and had been going to Ying Yang before Kaya opened.  We'd happen
to be there some of the Romeo Cologne nights, but thought he was a goof.  The disco revival was fun last year
for about a week.  The 80's are way more hip.  And with the gay bar moving in next door to Kaya, the overflow
made Kaya different.  Maybe a weeknight for some good jazz, but it's been a while.</B><P>

If you want to bring a friend or two, no problem there; but, once we start inviting sales rep.'s ect. it might get outta hand.  (Business networking, etc.  I want this to be purely pleasure.)  I've contacted Greggorio and he has offered to help me organize a "Smoker".  I'll definately recruit the help of you guys, and then we can include everybody (like sales rep's., local merchants, etc.)  But, this was really intended to let us meet each other face to face.  The official smoker I'm thinking about might happen in the early summer.  BTW: I've not heard back from General Cigar.  I figured since they are responsible for this gathering, they would be happy to contribute something.  Well, it never hurts to ask!  I'm not giving up on them yet.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Okay, this is looking great.  John O's got some Nestors, I've got some cubans, brent is
bringing me the short stories I've been trying to find for years, and general cigar is undoutedly
sending something.  Along with everyone bringing several of their own, and angie's cigar shop chipping in.
So, we'll start smoking at noon on saturday and won't leave the bar until sunset sunday.  It's gonna take forever
to smoke all these.  Yes, John O, I'll buy a Nestor from you.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Drew?  What do you think about a time?  For me, the Martini Club is more of an end-of-the-evening kind a thing.  So, it's usually been close to or after mid-night; and the weekends are always crowded.  When I asked about the room, the manager said he'd be happy to reserve it at 7.  I wonder if that is what time it opens.  </B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>that sounds fine.  We have quite a few cigars to smoke.  7 it is?
The crowd will get furious, and maybe from there, as we all wrap up a cigar, we
could go somewhere else?  Or we could just keep our tight grip on the room.  Either way, I'm 
starting to look forward to it.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Starting?!  I've been excited from the get-go!  7:00 pm at The Martini Club.  I'm sure that there will not be a problem with maintaining our presence in the back room.  Everytime I've seen a "party" in there, I have not intruded.  Who would want to?  I know there are some rude people in the world, but lets hope for the best.  After a few hours there, if people want to see the rest of Atlanta, that'd be cool.  We can just play it by ear.</B><P>

<B>I'm looing for another humidor of moderate price to house any extra backups I may run into in my travels. While on Smokin Joe's website I saw under their humidor list that they sell humidors under the title "new humidor line". They range in price from about 150 to $190 depending on the finish. It is stated that they hold up to 65 corona gorda sized cigars and that it is accompanied by a credo humidification device.  Knowing the price that most humidors even half this size sell for this price seems too good to be true. Does anyone by any chance have one or heard anything about them, quality, construction etc. They even include a picture and they look alright. Should I risk it?</B><P>

<B>I got one for a friend from W-W Humidors. It's their Starter 75. Hold 65-75 cigars at maybe a Churchill size. It ran $85 and is holding the humidity levels just perfectly. You can find them on Fugi's list.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Tee, I have the one you speak of. It's the burl gloss and it's beautiful. It was one of the first humidors we bought. It's of good construction- The reason they are this inexpensive is because they use a burl veneer, not a solid burl wood. (there's no difference cosmetically) it's lined with spanish cedar and keeps a cigars just as good as my $1000 humi. Good luck!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>65 coronas really isn't that big of a humidor.  Two boxes of your favorites
might not even fit.  I'd pay a little more and get something larger.  You never
know when you'll find a deal on a box and it would be better to have extra room
than not enough.</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by drew at  on Wednesday, December 04 at 07:37 AM EST<p></FONT></TT>
<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I agree. Buy the biggest one you can find/afford. My husband and I have several because we kept buying a little bigger each time. We know use an end table model- Might as well get a small pretty one and a peice of furniture for the boxes!</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I agree with Drew, better go ahead & buy a larger humidor or you will probably end up with 2 or 3 smaller ones.  I bought the W-W Humidor Starter 75 ($85) & I love it, but I wished now I had went ahead & bought the 150.  I have 2 boxes of AF 858, about 30 Opus X, a few HdM Excalibur #1, then a random sampling of others & it is hard to decide which ones to keep in my W-W (which maintains a perfect 72rh) & which ones to keep in my converted Bering box/humidor (Rh varies greatly).  Guess now I'll have to break down & buy the larger one & carry the 75 to the office.  I just have this fear of coming in to work one morning & seeing a few of the janitors sitting around smoking my $20 Opus!!  Fear That!!!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>She-ra, I think I have read elsewhere that you are also an AF858 fan.  If so, do you have any clue as to where I could get some 858 in maduro??  I have had a box on back order from JR for probably 3 months, and have out an APB with 3 other tobaccionist that I deal with. All I have been able to buy lately is the natural.  I drool with anticipation that maybe you can locate some!!! Thanks.</B><P>

<B>I'm located in an area where there is only one cigar shop.  Selections aren't great these days and I have tried two different mail order houses.  Without getting a single shipment.  Any suggestions?  Does everone go on a waiting list?</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by AL at <p></FONT></TT>

<form method=POST action="MailOrderMerchants.pl">
<B>Looks like a lot of folks are on the waiting list.  For the most popular premium smokes (i.e. Fuentes, Partagas) some places I have called the sales person literally laughed out loud when I inquired about Hemingways.  Some places are not taking new orders, other places you need to call and see if the have what you want in stock.  Most will put you on the waiting list and then, you wait.  I personally am a member of the Thompson Premium cigar club and the are supposed to automatically ship me a box of 25 Fuente Signatures every 90 days.  It doesn't work that way, however.  I average four to five months between the shipments.  My best advice is to check out the Fuji Cigar site and call around to the shops listed there.  Sometimes you can catch a new shipment of premium smokes before they have all been spoken for.  This is rare, since most major brands have a waiting list; but I called Holt's once and was able to procure a box of Hemingway Classics on the spot.  Sometimes you get lucky.  Since Hemingways don't grow on trees, I have settled for a less expensive, somewhat more readily available everyday smoke, and save the AF's for Saturday Afternoons.  My everyday smoke is the Don Lino Churchill in either maduro or natural.  But even these have a limited availablity according to Thompson.  One day I called and they told me 2 to 3 weeks backorder.  On a whim several days later, I called again and they had them in stock!!!     One thing I have noticed:  I patronize a small smoke shop in a town south of where I live, and while he doesn't have Fuentes, Partagas, Davidoffs or anything big name, he does have several other cigars which are not as well known as the above mentioned brands.  If your tobacconist  carries lesser-known brands, I would recommend trying them.  Sometimes a really choice smoke will hide behind an unknown name.  Ask your tobacconist. He or she should be able to recommend a smoke which leans towards your tastes.  And in the meantime, make some calls, be tenacious and you may find what you are looking for.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Yes there are many good, relatively unknown brands out there.  But there are a lot of
new brands that are not very good.  Companies are smart to get in on the cigar fad, and 
are putting out a lesser product then the well known favorites.  While you need to be careful
in what you buy, experimenting is fun.  If you read the threads here you'll see many people
refer to cigars that are pretty easy to get.  Ask around, here and at your tobacco shop.  If you
hear a certain cigar mentioned favorably a few times, chances are you'll enjoy it too.</B><P>

6 cigars for $50 is terribly reasonable.  For half that cost you can get 6-8 very quality

I deal with a small news stand/ tobacco shop that seams to always have an abundant supply of all the finest cigars. He also sells them to me at what I consider more than fair prices ( 10 to 20 % less than Holt's). My humidor is filled with signatures, classics, shortstories and many sizes of opus X. I also regularly smoke 858, Spanish Lonsdale and double chateau fuentes. I guess I am truely blessed. I hope everyone has a great 1997, and keep on puffing.  </B><P>

<B>On New Year's Day, I had a Diamond Crown Robusto #2 (7 1/2",
54 ring gauge).  Diamond Crowns are apparently a separate 
but equal version of the Fuente Opus X for us folks who 
live on the West Coast (for reasons known only to them, 
the Fuente people won't sell the Opus X out here).  A
Diamond Crown doesn't have a Dominican wrapper, though.
Anyway, it was the most even burning, well made cigar 
I've had in years.  It was also too mild for my taste (it
reminded me of a Macunado), and overall I thought it was 
nice but nothing special.  Has anyone else tried a Diamond
Crown?  If so, what did you think?  Has anyone had both
a Diamond Crown and a Fuente Opus X?  How do the two compare?

timeframe it does well.  You must remember to blow (yes, blow) the smoke out of the leaves before putting it in the cigar savor.  This way there won't be 
all that stale smoke trapped in the cigar for days.  Do this and I think you'll be happy with the little device.</B><P>

every day. It frees me up to smoke a cigar for only 10 or 20 minutes if I want, then 
put it away for later. I do use a cigar cutter to remove the old burned foot before
relighting. Blowing through to remove bad stuff before storing is a good idea. </B><P>

<B>Yes.  I tried a bundle of the Fumas.  The draw on several (out of 25) was very tight, but most smoked evenly.  They were VERY mild (especially compared with most Padrons I've tried.) But I found them well worth the price for an everday smoke. I'm going to try the Cazadores next.  And the delivery was very fast--less than a week.</B><P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>A good scotch should be sipped very slowly - shouldn't
be any burning. Or try it with a bit of ice or splash of water if you prefer
to smooth things out a bit more. I like a lighter scotch like Glennfiddich
with a cigar. Some of the heavier ones, like Lagavulin, have enough smoky
flavor from the peat -- it can clash with the smoke of a cigar.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Dewars rocks is my normal &quot;everyday&quot;
scotch. I wait 5 minutes or so for some of the ice to melt. I started years
ago with scotch and water. Try it that way Joe. And yes, drink it like
a martini -- very slowly.</B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Give Cardhu a try. Slightly sweet with less of
a peaty note than, say, Laphroaig. For a strong peat, Laphroaig is my favorite.
I also like all the Macallans. I think single malt is one of the most pleasurable
accompaniments to a good cigar. As GTK says above, there shouldn't be any
burning with sipping. The more single malts you try, the easier it gets
to identify the different elements of the taste. A lot of fun.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The Macallan 12 year old is rich, but has a little
more bite than the 18 yr. old. Both are favorites of mine (haven't spent
the money on the 25 yet.) I prefer mine with water on the side to sip in
between when the thirst hits, because good scotch is meant to sip. I also
started on Dewars and water and if I'm out for just a couple I still have
it if I can't find a single malt. I also like the Glenmorangie and Glennfiddich,
but find the peatier scotches too strong for my taste, they seem to clash
with the cigars I smoke.</B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I like the Islay whiskies the best, since they
have the strongest flavor. Normally, I buy through the Single Malt Whisky
Society, as they sell unfiltered, uncut, unblended, straight-from-the-barrel
scotch, which is different from the commercial single malts. For the commercial
single malts, I like Laphroiag most. The best blended scotch I've found
is White Horse, which has Lagavullin (sp?) as its base. I'll drink White
Horse on the rocks, but otherwise I'll just mix some water with the scotch.
To each his own. If C.C. likes it with Coke, good for him.</B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Joe, i find that blended scotches like Dewars
combine too many different distillations to hold true individual character.
Now, on the other hand, a single Islay malt like Laphroaig has a robust
but not overpowering flavor and unique oily texture that is too individualistic
to be found mixed with a bunch of other whiskies. Now, I know I sound like
a troglodyte saying that considering I sometimes mix with Coke, but I honestly
believe that Coke, being the finest cola in the world, brings out the individuality
of a fine malt and makes a tasty combo when I want a lighter drink, the
same way I like Jakes ( Jack Daniel's and Coke ). By the way, has anyone
tried the evil new Glennfiddich &quot; Friday Scotch&quot; cask strength,
102 proof? This stuff is like Wild Turkey Rare Breed, only it's Scotch.
Backed to blended, it just doesn't cut it for me. The first Scotch I ever
had was Johnny Walker Red Label, a name that to this day summons my gag
reflex. It misled me into being prejudiced against all Scotches, before
I discovered single malts.</B></P>

Do not waste your money. It might be good 25 years from now but it is a
little rough around the edges when compared to some of the other aged whiskies
I have tried. I'm donating the bottle to the cafe in exchange for a box
of any type of smoke. If you ever get to Panama...buy some there...no tax

Like a couple of you, I grew up on Dewars and water. I eventually moved

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>KBW....I keep the GOLD in stock at my home...the cafe business/cigars are new to eachother in my world (put them together as a concept within the past 7 yrs)  the crowd I serve is usually the young upwardly mobile status seeking person and they ask for the unusual...like Stewarts Rootbeer (giggle) and this J Walker Blue.  You are right....the gold has a smoother taste to me but to the guy who just bought a round of $20 drinks to impress...He claims it is the best scotch in the world and this is the only place in town that serves it.  Ahhh what the hell...I let them say anything they want when they are sitting in the American Express position; I just nod my head where appropriate.    </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Can any Scotch aficionados out there taste any difference between John Walker Red and Black labels?
I am not familiar with any differences because I don't drink the stuff anymore.  It was a question 
that I asked myself a few times.  Now I stick to Glenmorangie and Glengoyne.  Also, I enjoy sipping
 on GlenLivet 12 or 18 year old.  This stuff is the smoothest and mildest 
Scotch I have ever had the pleasure of toasting to.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Some do. But it's hard to say if you are getting the real deal.
I am an American-Born Canadian living on Grand Cayman... I make frequent trips to Cuba to buy direct from the factories.
I then sell to guests here on island. The only successful way to send the Genuine Cuban Cigars is to remove the labels, and put in say, 
a Jamaican cigar box. This involves alot of faith on your part, however... because the Government seal and all signs of Cuban origin must
be removed, Thanks to the lame U.S. (Yes, I know you guys are watching...) government policy on Cuba. Call me uncle tom, but, it's a 
great time to be Canadian! Call me if you want Genuine Cigars... and don't take my word for it. We can discuss a way to let you see the product before I send it.</B><P>

I guess it's another one of those- to each his own deals.
I had a long discussion with a friend, about this very leather thing.
We both agreed, that we have never tasted hints of leather. I think of
the smell of leather then try to somehow correlate it with
the flavors of cigars. Thanks again MP for the offer, after reading
the last issue of Smoke, I made it a point to have my brother bring me
some of those things. These coming days better bear fruit!?!.....  </B><P>

If you don't like the price on the Hemingway, there are plenty of others to choose from, such as the 8-5-8 or Double Chateau.

They are less expensive than most Fuentes, easier to find, and taste better. However, my most recent purchase of 2000's was a little disappointing in that they need some age. I'll have to let them sit a couple months in my humidor. Can't wait to fire one up.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Drew, The short evaluation of the LVCC cigars which is posted above is not mine. I tried about 4 of the 14 and have left them alone for a couple of weeks now. They are too loose, burn unevenly, tunnel badly, and leave a leathery taste. They also leave a strange taste of browned butter on my lips. Not my kind of cigar. I'll check them in 6 months or so. </B><P>

of the LVCC.  I was happy to support an American company and after reading the article in Smoke, thought they deserved
a try.  There was one quote from a roller stating that LVCC cigars are the best he's ever had, including his time working
in Cuba.  That should have tipped me off.  Anyway, mine are sitting around too.  Maybe we should try one again on the same day

<B>Hi there everyone, hope you all had a pleasent holiday. I was wondering
if collectively we can come up with an answer to the following situation.
My wife located a antique humidor at a local auction that is in need of
some repair. Since I am not a craftsman there are certain things I do not
want to risk touching concerning this project. The humidor appears to be
made of maple, it has an opening where the lock is missing, the hinges are
intact and the lid is fairly well aligned. The only outside work I wouldn't
want to tackle would be the lock. The problem is the inside, the inside apears
to be cedar lined, except for the inner top lid which looks like milk glass or 
porcelain. This would probably date this in the 1920's I think, the problem is 
the inner lip to form a seal is missing and it may need some more inner restoration
that I'm not aware of. Does anyone know of any reputible sources for this type of work?
Even though this wasn't a huge investment I would very much like to make this operable
as it has much character. It will probably only hold 50 smokes, but my wife was thrilled
to find something of that nature by accident. I live in the Baltimore area if anyone has
any ideas. Thanks for your help.</B><P>

<HR><FORM method=POST action="Nonalcoholicdrinks.pl"><B>Dr. Pepper is excellent
with a cigar. I'm not sure why, but it works. Iced coffee is good too.
Made strong in a room-temperature toddy, then mixed with some sugar, water,
ice, and milk. Don't just pour hot coffee over ice. That's not the way.</B></P>

I've found hot tea in the winter to be excellent with cigars, especially
the Maduros. Also, did you know that cigar tasters, (those who do it for
a living) use strong, unsweetened tea to cleanse their palate between smokes.

wood, change the color of your mustache, fill gaps in vinyl, and cure urinary

from it but that may also be true. I do walk a little faster, jump a little
higher, and find myself wearing my blue suit with the red S on the chest.
Clinics should try using Turkish roasts to ween amphetamine addicts from
the drug. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>If you like beer, a premium non-alcoholic, such
as (excuse any misspellings) are Hacke Beck, and Claus Haller. These, and
other brews are made by great breweries such as Beck's, Guiness, Thomas
Brau, etc. Go to any large liqour store or any store that prides itself
on their beer selection and get some advice. These brews are better than
any large domestic variety i.e., Bud, Miller, Pabst et al. Suds like O'doul's,
and Sharps (NA products from big domestic breweries) are just as tateless
as thier alcoholic counerparts. Since I quit drinking I have found the
premium beers to be very good. I hope more independents (micro breweries)
start making good NA stupouts, porters,ales etc. Try some of the beers
I recommended with your favorite smokes (like a nice Partagas Robusto)
and let me know what you think. </B></P>

retorts to my requests. How does a cigar friendly coffee house sound to
you afficionados out there. This is an idea I have owned for a few years
now. I want to open a cigar shop/coffe shop. I don't enjoy coffee with
my cigars so I thought this was a bad idea, but after reading this thread
i'm reassured that it might be a good idea after all. Respond now.</B></P>

Can not wait for the smoke...I made a mistake by stopping at JR's and buying
several of the JR Ultimates...I gave them all away last night and to my
surprise several guests actually asked for JR's toll free #. Go figure!
I love America everyone can have at least somethings their way. </B></P>

having a good smoke, I drink Coors Cutters. I know that it is not as tasty
as some of the premium NA's out there, but it suits me just fine. When
I used to drink beer I would always order A.B.C. (Anything But Coors) becuase
I couldn't stand the taste. The coors cutters, however, seem to have a
much more pleasing tast to me than it's domestic counterparts...</B></P>

generally anything but heavily flavored teas.  I really dont
want something that is going to cover up a mild note in the

you drink (n/a) with your favorite tobacco product?</B><P>

Since Jamaican is a med acidy coffee perhaps a Guatemala HUEHUETENANGO might really catch your fancy and save you money.  It is like rootbeer to the cigar,  just tastes damn good.  Even a peppermint tea is awesome when brewed with a pinch of Ceylon tea and smoked with a maduro wrapped cigar.  I invite you to a taste if you want. </B><P>

If you order now they'll eventually come, and if you like them, you can reorder and

we all want our cigars now, but with a little patience and a little planning you can make

Also the phone # on the fax is 305-642-1653 not 305-858-3110.  The 800 number is the number I have for El Credito Cigars which I thought (I know there I go thinking) made La Gianna Cigars.  Does El Credito distribute La Gloria and La Gianna? </B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>It's a trick. La Gloria is a knock off factory trying to capitalize on the success of La Gloria Cubana. El Credito on 8th St is the maker of La Gloria Cubana (not La Gloria). There was an article in CA a year or so ago about this deception. El Credito makes 3(?) lines of cigars. The La Gloria Cubana is the top and their best. My father was just in Miami two weeks ago and brought me a bundle of La Gloria Cubana Churchills for Xmas straight from the factory. He also mentioned the confusion about La Gloria and El Credito.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I have been able to purchase La Gloria Cubanas the last couple years both ways - I have sent them money and waited the 2 to 4 months and received my cigars.  I have also coerced friends - and non-friends to visit the factory and pick me up a bundle.  Both ways work and for the money you pay by doing it this way, you are truly receiving a bargain.  Wavells at my local stores (when available) cost $7.50 or better, compared to $under $4 from the factory.  $4 for that cigar is a bargain that I certainly am willing to wait 4 months for.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Gentlemen, what alot of you are failing to realize is that, Mr. Carillo is also rolling in the D.R. now, and I am telling all of you, that the Ecuadoran tobacco lots that he is using from the D.R. DON'T HAVE THE SAME CONSISTENCY OF THE MIAMI PRODUCT.  I'm also sorry to say that I just returned yesterday from home with a box of Churchill's, Wavells, and a Medaille d'Or. I sold them to a shop owner for $465 even.  Although that may seem like,"highway robbery" the fact remains that he will still get $9.00 a unit even after i doubled the price.  By the way guys, alot of the El Credito Frontmark, (contrary to whatever any gringo might tell you, is a  separate product, is the trademark registration for L.G.C. seconds.  HERE'S THE CRUNCH! ALOT OF L.G.C.'S THAT WOULD HAVE BECOME EL CREDITO FRONTMARK...ARE BEING BANDED AND SOLD AS CUBANA'S.  This might not mean much, but it is the principle behind it.  Fact is gentlemen, if you speak the language, things happen.  To cuban's, hard cash speaks, I know because I have lived in Coral Gables my whole life.  El Credito and Ernest are a respectable operation, but they are sand bagging on retail shipping because of the over the counter demand, and the harsh reality of ethnic selectivity of what is available to whom in miami, even if you have the cash. Happy Smoking. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>  I'm the parrothead that has the first post after the initial qiuestion
posed by The Cuban Crusader.  I too have a varying taste in music.
I do indeed dig the blues.  No arguments here about smokky bars, good cigars
and loud blues.  The whole atmosphere seems to slow my mind and metabolism down
as I sit there engrossed in the sound and the taste.  I almost feel like I'm in
a movie or something.  It's a pretty cool thing.  But Cuban Crusader, as far as Buffett
goes, get a hold of the album A1A or Son of A Son of A Sailor.  These are two 
of mmy favorite Buffett albums.  That's hard to clarify though, as all Parrotheads
know.  With the quantity and quality of Buffett to choose from, favorites are more the
norm than a favorite.  Rock on, fellow smokers!</B><P>

Needless to say after we were halfway through our cigars, and a guy had yelled "Merle Haggard" as a musical request for the thirtieth time.. Finally a guy took his worn old topsider (shoe) off his sockless foot, poured his beer into it, toasted the piano player and drank it.. My husband promptly paid the tab and walked outside..

I cannot believe that folks who tuned out in the sixties, danced disco in the seventies, and made hollow fortunes in the eighties would be attracted to so patrician a past time as cigar smoking. Classical music is the only music to listen to when smoking a cigar. Any other type of music, and you might as well throw in the house on wheels as well. Oh, God when will this trend pass? When will it be returned safely to the hands of the true aristocrats? Go back to your cigarettes oh generations of the "Wasteland." </B><P>

I do not like is Country.  My tastes vary from alternative to classic rock to blues
to rap to opera to classical and everything in between.  I think that the best old
music is the stuff that has survived until now, and that is why most modern music
sucks.  For example, you hear Led Zeppelin as 70's music, but do you ever hear
Stealer's Wheel without it being linked to Reservoir Dogs?  As far as smoking a cigar
goes, however, I need mellow music I can relax to.  Usually something about the speed
of Pink Floyd (I'm a die-hard Floyd fan).</B><P>

Al Eremchuck is probably the best big band dancer I have ever met.  We would go to the Inner Harbor on Sunday afternoon to dance.  The gals were kind enough to take a greenhorn like myself under their wing until I could do the Lindey Hop, The Jitter Bug, and even Tango.  Now to a soldier that was sissy girl stuff...until we had a big band dance contest at Pope Air Base.  I danced for several hours and took home a whopping $50 in prizes.  Almost 1/2 my salary back than.  Two thumbs up for SGT Maj Eremchuck and the tunes of Tommy Dorsey....they both live on...see them at the Holiday Inn on Sunday's in the Inner Harbor  </B><P>

As for other music, I like the original Pretenders, U2 before they got all weird, the Who, Doors, and all the other "classic rock" which is beaten to death on the radio.

As for the strange 70's music like "Stuck in...", it is good if you take into the

that "Stuck..." is one of the one-hit wonders that may now have a second chance due
to the popularity that reservoir dogs gives to it.  I don't feel right dismissing it
simply because it was overlooked through the years.</B><P>

<P><B>Wow!!! Old Webby's outdone himself. What a delightful suprise and
what a superbly organized website. I think I speak for all of the cigar
regulars when I say that we appreciate your creativity, your diligence
and your patience. I, for one, am particularly grateful for your efforts
at trying to keep the radicals and the crazies off this web. I know this
amounts to a full time job. You have my vote for Webmaster of the Year.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><FORM method=POST action="WorldClassWebmaster.pl"><B>..Peter,...glad
you like it....Stay tuned, it is only just beginning!...As I said in an
earlier post, we intend to forge this into the definitive cigar site on
the planet...We need your suggestions and comments to help make it so.
Keep them coming. ...Now, what was it you said about those Duke of Devon
Maduros???? Maybe I should try one (just to make sure they light properly,
of course!)</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>As for those Duke of Devon's....how about I empower
the Webmaster to give the source of what he considers the best suggestion
for the site a box of said Duke of Devon's. Time limit will be January
15, 1997. It will be up to him to tell me where to send the cigars. Just
a small suggestion, my boss would love to find a way for this site to give
us names and addresses of cigar smokers. These names would be used as a
pool of names for focus groups or as the recipients of special offers in
a direct mail program that has not been developed yet. They would not be
sold and any material sent would be relevant to the cigar lifestyle. For
instance, Club Macanudo is opening up in Chicago in early April. Smokers
in that area might receive early notice about pre-opening parties or an
opportunity to rent a humidor before the Club opens officially. I was involved
in the opening of the New York club and they were sold out the day they
opened. Just an idea.... Maribeth </B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>That's a &quot;no brainer&quot; Maribeth. Have
each of the participants of this website submit, to your e-mail address,
the names and addresses of a minimum of ten cigar smokers with whom they
are personally acquainted, (excluding, of course, current website participants)
and the name(s) and address(es) of their local tobacconist(s). You're bound
to get excellent coverage this way, and as part of the focus group process,
the list can be expanded by requesting the same information from new members.
Can I have my cigars now?? Huh?? Please??</B></P>

That makes three, possibly four origin addresses for him that have been

seems a little out of context at the moment...One thing I do know is that
Maribeth Schneider in Marketing authorized me to offer a box of Duke of

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>PaulM.  The first time I tried to calibrate mine was a disaster. I realized that I was turning the screw too far. I considered it a slight movement, but just moving it from about 1 o'clock back to 12 o'clock changed it about 4%. I was originally off by 5% so I left it at that. Don't rush it.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>David thanks for the URL.  I've gotten my hydrometer as close as I think it will go.  I have two osasis and 50/50 homade credos in my humidor and everytime I check it reads either 69 % or 70 %.  This makes me a happy camper to say the least.  I was unable to reach a 70% with just two store bought credos.  it seems I needed the larger ones to fully stablize my new humidor.  I'm sure after a month or so I could remove one of the homade credos and still maintain the proper humidity. </B><P>

<B>Thanks, but no need to defend me. I threw my back out this 
weekend and took some heavy duty painkillers. To do it over again
I would not have addressed my comments to the webmaster. My
judgment was clouded by those blessed pain pills. If anything
I should be, cited for posting under the influence (PUI).
Regardless, my point was made: no one of us dictates what
topics are discussed. How we discuss those topics shows
our class, breeding, and intelligence. Some of you lack all
three. See some of you at Shanken's web soon. I plan to use
my real name there. Do you all have the rocks to do the same?</B><P>

<B>Call the sales department at General Cigar 860-769-3600 and ask them to refer you to a rep in the area that can give you a wholesale source.  Another alternative is to place your name and address here so that the Webmaster forwards it to me as a sales lead.  I then turn it over to the Sales guys.  You are right though, supplies are still very tight...the cigars are snatched up as soon as we ship them.  Good luck!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>ROB, This is one of the best cigars I've run across lately. The one I smoked had aged for about 3.5 - 4 months. It was sweet and full on flavor. Like OB says, not at all overpowering, though. I have a couple set back, wrapped in cedar from a Chateau Fuente. I'll try them in a couple of years and let you know how they age. Definately a dessert cigar. I think they are right up there with Hemingways. Gotta go,... I have a AF DC#3 from PaulM waiting on me.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I need to correct a misconception I had. The Vinatge 1959 has no old tobacco in it, it's 1992 tobacco. As per Bob Curtis of ASC. The 1959 refers to the plantaion where the wrapper is grown. The plantation broke ground in 1959. It is rather deceptive, one of my tobacconists said it was a "thirty year wrapper". I'm sorry to have misled anybody, it was not intentional. It's still a damned tasty cigar. Thanks.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>First, there are no Cuban cigars for under $10 worth paying for.  You are better off w/ a premium dominican.  Second, most decent cubans are (depending on size) $13-$30 w/ a few over $30.  Third, the best cuban R & J I ever had was the churchill (about $23).  In fact, it was one of the best cigars I have ever had period.  I have tried all cohiba's, hoyo de mont.'s, partagas, etc.  I have tried repeatedly the best Cuba has to offer.  R & J churchill is a winner!!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>R & J Churchills are the best in my opinion.  But I will say that a Cedro Deluxe #2 was a fine smoke as well.  Under $10?  You got to be kidding!!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I had a R & J at a conference a couple weeks ago. An Army friend who just returned fom parts unknown gave it to me. I think it would have been better if it had not been so dry. Mighty strong little smoke. I also had a Dominican Petite Corona that MP sent to me. That one packed a punch too. I wouldnt know about prices because I got mine for free. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I'm smoking one right now. R y J corona grandes a wonderful full taste. The same problem with youthful tobacco are present, so you do need to age them. When you see some bloom it time to enjoy life little blessing. You can buy r y j for under 10 dollars the smaller ring size are MM. If you are in Spain where I bought a box of churchill for 275 dollars coronas grandes which isin my hand now for 190 dollars. Granted it been 18 months since but cuban don't have set prices. Tabacalera in Spain control 50% of cuban export of cigar that why Spain is the best place on planet to buy cuban.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I have gotten away from the thinner rolls of RyJ's.  The only thin Cuban's I have found to be typical of a Cuban styled smoke, are the Monte Cristo's. As mentioned above, the RyJ Churchill is an excellent Cuban smoke.  Very fine.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Good Cuban cigars for under $10 per gar can in fact be had.  The best place I have found are the duty free shops in airports or at border crossings in countries that do not honor the trade embargo.  However, you do have to buy by the box.  I have primarily found the Monte Cristos and Partagas brands here (Canada and Paris).  Both are very good smokes.  Had the RyJ about two months ago.  Very good robust smoke.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Had a box of R y J peitit coronas (I think) in tubos less than a year ago, about $185 U.S.  Smoked them all in 10 days while in Los Cabos. Due to the weather and lack of a humidor the cigars were on the dry side (and getting drier as I smoked each one) and tended to unravel a bit.  But great little cigars, tasty and robust.  The Churchills, also tubos, I smoke when I can get them.  Some of the best I've ever had.  My favorite memories of cubans, however, were Cohiba Lanceros I once purchased in a five pack.  But like any cigar, last year's Prince Charming can easily be this year's Toad.</B><P>

They are flavorful cigars, starting out smooth, then in the middle they get almost fruity/flowery,
and finally at the end developing a good spice.  No bitter aftertaste.  Some neat cigars!
I wish I had bought a box of larger size so they'd last longer!

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Romeo y Julietas are my favorite cigar.  The best is of course the Churchill, followed by Exhibition #4, Exhibition #3, and the Corona. I keep an ample supply of Petit Coronas and Mil Fleurs on hand for that hour smoke. Two good machine made Romeos are the #1 tubo and the Coronitas en Cedro. I was not impressed with the Deluxe #2 en Cedro but it was still a good cigar. I find the Romeos to be the most consistant Habano.</B><P>

<B>Attention all cigar smokers:

My father, Willard Cohen, is turning 65 and retiring on December 27, 1996.  

He is an avid cigar smoker as well as a cardiologist, which I think is the definition of irony.  He even ahs a "smoking permitted" sign in the living room. 

My brother and I are asking everyone we know to e-mail birthday/retirement wishes to Willard, as he is also a cumputer user.  

Just a quick note, from cigar smoker to cigar smoker, would be greatly appreciated.  I can almost guarantee you he'll read and respond to your e-mail(s).

His address is MDHeart@aol.com.  Thanks in advance, and Happy Holidays.  </B><P>

<B>I buy my cigars at a small tobacco shop in Chapel Hill, NC called "Pipes by George".  As the name denotes, they started out, many years ago, by carrying a fine array of pipes and pipe tobaccos, and still custom blend pipe tobaccos for you on the spot.  But it is their fine array of cigars that is tryly enviable. The tobacconist is a fine gentleman by the name of Antonio Tarascio, who is one of the most knowledgeable persons I know on the subject of cigars.  The shop is well stocked, and Antonio, wise man that he is, saw the cigar boom coming, and managed to secure exclusive distribution on a number of brands that are now in high demand.  But, the most appealing thing about "Pipes by George", is that they will take the time to explain the merits of the brands they carry.  I've never picked up a bad smoke there, and, in fact, several of the brands that are now standards in my humidor were first introduced to me by Antonio. So, if you're ever in the Chapel Hill area, a trip to "Pipes by George" and an opportunity to meet Antonio Tarascio, will be well worth the effort.</B><P>

<P><B>I have seen a few strings about what folks like with their cigars,
usually you get alot of people who tell you about their 1915 port they
had while eating a 300.00 steak, then smoking a 50.00 cigar. Well, Im from
this planet, and I have kids and a mortgage, plus I work for the government(Navy)
so Im not wealthy. I drink beer with my stogies, usually a Guinness Stout,
Saranac Black &amp; Tan, or a Sam Adams. What is your favorite beer with
a stogie, and WHY? -Obnoxio</B></P>

I like stout microbrews. The flavor of the beer goes really well with a
cigar. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I agree forget Port unless your trying to impress
some chick or business client! For me, the ultimate is Red Hooks Double
Stout. It is about $4.00 to $6.00 but well worth it. Another favorite Micro-
is the Portland Honey Beer. Another Micro- just came to mind and what a
treasure it is the Rogue Mocha Porter you have got to try this one.......Good
call Obnoxio </B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I like a good drink with my cigars, preferably
cognac, but one of my favorites is a home brewed beer that is a Nut Brown
Ale. You should try making your own beer. It's not very complicated &amp;
very satisfying. I normally have two or three batches going at a time.
It's a great hobby and if you can print your own labels, you can have lotsa
enjoyment when you have friends over. I name my beers after friends, then
make a small caricature on the label. ie. &quot;Spanky's Black Bear Brew&quot;
&amp; &quot;Steve's Solitude&quot;. This adds somewhat to the atmosphere
while enjoying a cigar. You can get into home brewing for about 50 Dollars,
and that includes your first batch of beer (about 48 bottles). As far as
commercial beer, I love Guiness Stout!</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I forgot to add, the reason I like Guiness with
my cigar is that the cigar, 98% of the time is a maduro, and they both
complement instead of overpower each other.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>A good combination I stumbled upon was a Partagas
Maduro and One Eyed Jack Lemon Brew. Try a nice Single Malt. I have not
calculated it, but I bet I can smoke more cigars with one bottle of single
malt (plus or minus $40) than with 6 six packs of &quot;premium&quot; beer
(plus minus $42), or maybe not, but it is close. :)</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Somebody mentioned Red Hook a while back, that's
an excellent brew, kinda tastes and smells like apricots (I think?). Most
of the Oktoberfest beers from Munich, such as Spaten, Hacker-Pshorr, and
Paulaner, go great with a strong cigar like a La Gloria or Puros Indios.
Ever had an EKU 28? This stuff comes from the Black Forest and will absolutely
knock you on your ass. Tucher Weissbrau is good, too.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Obnoxio, check your locale for British or Irish
pubs, which almost always has ultrapremium dark brew, usually on draft.
Gourmet shops and some delis have them, too. By the way, when I was a kid,
there used to be a parody comic book similar to Mad Magazine called CRAZY,
and they're &quot;mascot&quot;(?) was a clown called Obnoxio; is that where
you got your call sign from? Just curious.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Richard, Yes, and no. My call sign is twofold....
I used to be a semi-professional (read: not very good) clown before I joined
the Navy. Being the rude little bastard I am, I got into a pissing contest
with a pilot during a medevac in 29 Palms ca. After the flight was over,
I was told I saved the guys life, but I was the most obnoxious bastard
that pilot ever met. Thus was born Obnoxio. Long and short. Thanks for
the info on the brew. Obnoxio was a stogie chompin fool, as am I.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>obnoxio, the red hook brewery is in Seattle Wa.
They have a brew pub in Seattle and just opened a state of the art micro
brewery in Woodenville Wa. I ofter stop by there when i am on that side
of the mountains. red hook brews a esb, blackhook porter, double black
stout (tastes like coffee/stout if you watch the drew carey show which
is called buzz bear), wheat hook-unfiltered wheat bear, ipa, rye hook (unfiltered
rye beer), and they do a winter hook during Christmas. If you get a chance
to try one you will enjoy. The esb is the most popular. Happy sipping and
smoking.</B></P>

in beer is impressive. I tried it for the first time at the Carolina Brewery
in Chapell Hill and have yet to find anything else as enjoyable. Although
I am always hunting for new tastes. I will say that I tend to favor the
classics like Heinekin, Becks, and Bass. Things become classics because
they deserve to be. I am still testing the waters with cigars so my knowledge
and my tastes are continually being refined. To of those that suggests
some of their favorite cigars, thanks. I'll give every one of them a try.</B></P>

I hang with the high sugared stouts, or a mix of a really dark beer and a really light one like Corona.  But I stay away from the likes of cold brewed or flavor added after the bubbles were forced into the water...for AnnheiserBush can create in 12hrs what nature takes 28 days to do...I prefer the later.  </B><P>

Ales, especially the darks. I live in Northern Alberta, Canada and get by on the local
Big Rock Ales produced in Calgary. I also like Newcastle Brown, John Smith (this side
of heavenly) and Bass. Alas, I prefer a single malt Scotch (Oban, Glenlivet, etc) to
accompany the proverbial smoke. And remember, a woman is a woman but a good cigar is
a smoke.

<B>I have just purchased a new humidor which holds 50 smokes nicely.  I have been purchasing cigars to fill it so as to do some aging prior to smoking these gems.  The directions of the humistat said to add distilled water every month.  Is this accurate?  Please give me some advice, I don't want these gems to go bad.  	
I do not have a hydrometer(sp).

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>How much distilled water to add will depend a lot on the
quality of your humidor, how many cigars you keep in it,
what kind of humidification device you have in it, and...
You do add ONLY distilled water NOT tap water.  Occasionally,
add a 50/50 mixture of distilled water and propylene glycol.
I'm giving you this from experience not from a book.  You
need to buy a hygrometer.  They're pretty easy to come by
now in most good tobacco stores beginning around $15.  This
isn't something you need to constantly guessing at by 
squeezing on the cigars to see if they're nice and moist or
CRACK!  I really had a hard time maintaining 70% until I 
started using the propylene glycol on occasion.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Radio Shack sells a digital hygometer for 20 bucks, which doesn't look as fancy as the brass analog ones, but is more accurate.  You can calibrate a hygrometer by putting it in a container with a salt and water slush which will maintain a steady humidity.  I don't remember the formula, but it's out there in a FAQ somewhere.  With a hygrometer, you'll know when to add the distilled water.  The frequency which you refresh your humistat will depend on the size of the box, the temprature, the number of cigars, etc.  You can't rely on once a month as being absolute.  To reiterate what Ed said, only distilled water.  Tap water contains bacteria which can cause mold.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>salt slush will calibrate a hygrometer, at 75%.  Give it
six to eight hours to stablize, and make sure it's in a sealed
container, such as tupperware or ziplock.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Help, I just tried to calibrate my hygrometer.  I put a tablespoon of salt (moistened with a few drops of water) in a ziplock bag & left it overnight.  It read 70% the next morning, so I took it out & reset the needle to 75%.  I put it back in the bag for another 6 hours to check the accuracy only to have the needle drop to 70% again.  Do I have a bad hygrometer, or are most all of them going to have that much variance? </B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I also have tried to recalibrate my hygrometer - both the Radio Shack digital and standard analog.  I have been unalble to make any progress.  No matter what I do as far as resetting the RH after 8 hours in the bag with damp salt, stays the same.  I have given up tinkering and just add 7% to whatever the reading is.  Should would like to find a nice, moderate price hygrometer that doesn't require all this fiddling.  Richard</B><P>

<B>I just got back from Toronto on business.  Upon having about
half a day free time, I set out to find some good cuban 
smokes.  As I have done for the last several years, I did not 
come back empty handed.  I went to the usual stores and 
found their prices too high.  Then I went to a small dealer
in antiques who has a passion for good cigars.  He sells 
them on the side at very little profit.  He set me up with
a boxes of Hoyo de Monterrey Double Coronas and Hoyo Epicure
# 1.  I'm good for another two months or so.  I did find out
that there won't be many cubans in Toronto until February or
March.  Hope I can hold out.</B><P>

cigars (non-Cubans as well) was dismal. Absolutely no

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>There's no doubt about it. I'm from T.O and the selection here is horrible. It's hard to fing any decent smoke for less than ten bucks. Last week I bought a couple of new cigars for about ten bucks a pop to try them out, they were called La Pantera's. Litle did I know that they were machine mades and I couldn't even smoke them they tasted so bad. If anuone can tell me where that antique shop is it would be awesome.</B><P>

<B>I can't believe you mentioned Coppell.  I lived in Coppell for four years I have been buying from Up In Smoke in the Vista Ridge Mall in Lewisville which has a nice selection.  Recently I have heard of the opening of a store in Coppell.  I believe the name is Cigar World and it is located near the Tom Thumb on the corner of Beltline & MacArthur.  I haven't visited it yet but hear it has a good selection.  I'm going to Dallas for New Years.  I will fill you in later on my findings.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Ah, Travelin' Man.. My hometown! I'm not as familiar with the tobacconists in Coppell, but Coonass is right, there is Vista Ridge Mall and it's right there in Coppell! Try my tobacconist- Tobacco Club at Trinity Mills & Midway. Nice shop, good selection, great people! Also, the guys at Tobacco Lane at Prestonwood Mall (Arapaho & Dallas Tollway) are real nice too, and the prices are a little better. There are several fun bars here that cater to cigar smokers as well: Flying Saucer, Old Chicago, Rockbottom Brewery- all in Addison (15 minute drive from Coppell) and Fox & Hound in Far North Dallas (about 20 minutes from Coppell) Are you going to be here for the holidays?</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>She-ra, I found the folks at Tabacco Lane in Prestonwood to be Jerks. I was in there a couple of days ago looking for some smokes and the guy was lurking around the humidor with the door open. It seemed like that was their s.o.p. I like the Up in Smoke store at Valley Veiw, they have what i like usually. I will take a visit over to your favorite stop to check it out.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>kc, I'm sorry that it was that way. I don't go there much, but they always wave to me when I walk by. The humidor is pretty small. The only Up In Smoke shop I've been to here is at the Galleria- Talk about JERKS! I've never been back. You'll like Tobacco Club. Are you located here in Dallas?</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>What about Edwards? I like it as well as any other.I have not had any bad experiences at Up In Smoke in the Galleria. There is a new upstart cigar store in Allen, Tx. called(yechh!)" Cigarettes for Less ". he has a limited selection at this time but is expanding the cigar business. I get Excaliburs, Partagas,Thomas Hinds, Macanudos, Astrals, Avos,and a few others there.He has discount coupons in the Allen newspaper that give 10% off any purchase.The prices are reasonable. He also has handmade humidors for unbelievable prices. The proprietor is not an expert on cigars by any stretch of the imagination, but he's friendly and he listens to his customers. How's that for a plug?</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>My husband and I dropped $275 at Del Frisco's on New Year's Eve. (That's an 8oz. filet mignon, 22 oz. lobtser tail, 1 veggie and 2 bottles of Medoc Merlot...) But hey, we go there maybe once a quarter. You have to request the cigar room... and be sure to bring your own cigars! It's not a snooty place either. KC, I usually stay away from the 1/2 yards at Fox & Hound. (But I used to have chug contests with them at Medievel Tavern on Greenville. We'll have to get together for a "Dallas thread gathering" soon!  </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Just returned from Dallas area. Due to the Ice problems, I never
made it to Del Frisco's. I was afraid of Texas drivers, not the
ice, as I hail from PA. I did find a nice little cigar store
in the Irving TX mall, across from Hooters on Beltline Rd.
A small but interesting, humidor, run by a nice little grey
haired man, with a passion for International Scout.
I bought a couple of interesting smokes, such as Macanudo,
H.Uppmann and Canaria D'oro. The name of the store was
Tobacco lane, the staff and the other customers were very
outgoing, and pleasant to talk to, and I will go back.</B><P>

<B>I smoked a candela the other day for the first time in over ten years.  I bought a corona length Primo del Rey on impulse, attracted by its beautiful light olive wrapper.  Smoked it with a glass of soft chablis on one of those infinitely beautiful late autumn afternoons we experience here in North Carolina.  I finsihed it just as the sun set behind the pine tops. It was an event.  If you've never tasted the grassy sweetness of a candela, I highly recommend that you try one. They're not your everday smoke.  They definitely march to a different drummer.</B><P>

<B>I enjoy smoking *after* a good meal.  I've never opted to smoke and eat at the same time.

I didn't have a good experience.  I rarely do when I go to a tobacco shop alone.  I tried to strike up a conversation with the storekeeper, but he had no time for "my foolishness".

cigarettes, pipe, or cigar.  I think Greggorio wanted to nkow if anyone nibbles on anything
while smoking.  I would imagine that while the tastes of certain beverages enhance cigar smoking
pleasure it is entirely possible that certain foods could do the same.  I'm not talking about eating
a cheeseburger while smoking a cigar, but maybe beernuts, as mentioned above, go well with a cigar.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>No smoke with food.  I want no smoke ever.  I think that the smoke's pretty icky even when there's no food around.  It may be an oxymoron
of types, but the air I "breath" I want smoke free.  That's why I prefer a very slight breeze when I smoke
to constantly provide me with fresh air.  Tonight I'm going to try an Onyx 650 with Chocolate pudding.  Tomorrow
it's butter-toffee peanuts with my La Unica 100.  Sunday it'll be a Dove Bar and a partagas.  I'll let you know how
it goes.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Drew you crack me up! Here's advice: NEVER smoke a treasured cigar after eating any kind if seafood like crab dip (Lobster doesn't count because it goes with everything, including nuts and chocolate pudding!) It will ruin the taste of your cigar!!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I disagree with the consensus here.  There is a new steakhouse in New York called Angelo & Maxies' (formerly Canastels for you New Yorkers) which has a sealed-off smoking area to comply with all the onerous NYC anti-smoking regs.  I recently had the great pleasure to enjoy a fabulous steak, a pint (or three) of Guiness, and a huge Cohiba.  Simultaneously.  It was splendid.  The flavors complemented each other perfectly.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Angie, sorry to take so long to get back to you. I go to the Cigar merchant in Alpharetta. Todd Trahan is the owner and a great guy. There are a few regulars some older(50's - 60's) and younger men. They are all good guys. I been going their for a couple of months and really enjoy it. I can understand how you feel, my wife used to run into the same problem (business related). Send me some e-mail or leave a post here. I'll meet you there at lunch, if that would make you feel more comfortable. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>We have the shavers and the syrups to serve the Italian Ice desserts but it flopped upon us in our first attempt and we quickly went to a Ben&Jerrys type icecream (plug for my favorite bunch of crazies) the cafe sitters often ask if I'll serve the Italian's again but the summer will tell the tale.  PS They are good...I buy the Gelato Classico flavors from Italy...very soothing and will certainly cover up cigar taste in your mouth...give you a stain on your tongue too.  </B><P>

<B>Anyone out there been getting bad Prince of Wales? These are my favorite cigars but the last few months I've been getting boxes of Mac's that are harsh and bitter and have hard plugs instead of the usual mild and mellow Prince's that used to be common. If anyone else has noticed this do you know whats going on at Macanudo? All the bad ones I've been getting are coming from JR Cigar in N. Carolina. I've got a suspicion that maybe General Cigar is sending their seconds and rejects to JR because they are a wholesaler. Can anyone advise???? </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I would be surprised if it was a problem with JR's. You might have just gotten a bad box, you know how quickly cigars are being pushed out the door these days. If I were you, I would call 1.800.JR.HELP.  That is the customer help line. Ill bet a JR special Jamiacan that they replace the box if you send them back. BTW, try the Special Jamaican line, I think they are BETTER than many Macanudo's I have had, at a quarter of the price. I got a bundle of churchill size, and I really love them. 30.00 for a bundle. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>JR's is really good about taking back any cigar that you
have a problem with.  They will replace them, even with 
something a little more expensive for your trouble.  I never
asked for a refund.  BTW the Special Jamaican's are quite 
good. </B><P>

sense of humor, and everything I read about them makes them sound so big and
so busy that I figured their service and quality would be affected.  Sounds like
ya'll with more experience with them know more than I do.  I try to stick with little

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Guys it was not irony. I take the ratings of C.A.
very serious. I am new to cigars, and I believe that going to a shop and
trying a few is for the trendy. I do not want to look trendy! even though
I am new. Therefore, I buy only what is highly rated in C.A. Even if it
tastes (or smokes) bad who cares, you look like you know what your doing
at the very least. The Joya maduro was a highly rated cigar, so I know
that it is good regardless of what you state. Smoke it even thought you
do not like it now, it will grow on you. It has to because those guys at
C.A. can't be wrong.</B></P>

a good smoke in their price range. I usually keep a few in my humidor.
If anyone has surplus you are thinking of &quot;junking&quot; you are welcome
to send them my way. I'd surley cover the shipping. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>O.K. guys, here's my $5. With the surge in popularity
of cigar smoking the past couple of years, it's been nearly impossible
to get the cigars I use to enjoy and have, as a result, had to sample other
brands. C.A. has been a help, and is a very quality magazine, but basing
your purchases on their recommendation is highly speculative. The best
source, I believe, is your tobacconist. As far as Joya de Nicaragua is
concerned, I recently purchased a box of their petit coronas and a box
of Cuesta Rey #95 and found them to be to tight to draw and virtually tasteless.
I U.P.S.ed them back for a box of Thomas Hinds - marginal at best. Find
5 or 6 brands you can count on and shop around when ordering time is getting
close. Happy smoking.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>While I realize that there are many who don't
like Mr. Shenken or blame him for driving up the price of cigars, I believe
that he has created a whole new appreciation for cigars and the commaraderie
that goes along with it. Without magazine like CA and Smoke, many of you
would not be enjoying your LGC's, Fuentes, Davidoff's or whatever. I believe
websights like this one and the ASC newsgroups wouldn't exist. Fancy cigar
shops would not exist and many cigar companys would be facing bankruptcy
or moving into other businesses. I'm no millionaire and I don't like paying
outrageous prices for cigars, but for years I smoked stuff like White Owls
and Robert Burns and didn't know what I was missing. Also because of M.
Shenken and his mag many restaurants are allowing cigars to be smoked again,
whereas the trend was for banning smoking; period (or should I say dot
in cyberspace). Now there are cigar clubs and restaurants, neat accessories,
new great(and not so great) cigars, increased tobacco plantings, taste
tests, etc. These things would not have exisited if the cigar fad had not
been nurtured and helped along by CA. There may have been some resurgence,
but I do not believe it would have been so big as it is. Yea, there are
lots of guys making a fortune off this rage, manufacturers, retailers,
gougers, magazine publishers, etc. I am not one of them. I spend more on
cigars today then I ever thought I would and used to think that anyone
who spent more than a buck on his smoke was nuts, but CA gave me an appreciation
for these things, that I might never have discovered. Oh well,just my 2
cents.</B></P>

before C.A. He may have stimulated the industry some, but I still think
he caused more harm than good. Then again, it's just the way I see it.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Shanken gets blame for the prices and shortages
because the current cigar boom happens to have started about the same time
as CA. And when CA rates a cigar as tops, everybody who hasn't smoked enough
to form their own opinions, goes right out and depletes the cigars in question.
Its not really Shankens fault, he's just riding the crest of this wave,
he's got good timing. And furthermore, have you ever seen a picture of
him? I wish he would either grow that beard or shave it! He looks like
he just came off a 3 day drunk. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I've picked up copies of CA and found it to be
interesting reading. I'm not convinced that M. Shanken is solely responsible
for the cigar shortage; several million people have seen David Letterman
light up and I'm sure some of them thought that was cool and they wanted
to try it for themselves. I can't fault M. Shanken for anticipating the
resurgence of cigar smoking and profiting off of it. If he hadn't started
CA someone else would have. Now a few words about the ratings: a cigar
rating is always someone else's opinion. I check theirs out for curiosity.
Sometimes I agree with them and sometimes I don't. I have found some brands
I like and I stick with them, irregardless of what someone else thinks.
I also try out unfamiliar brands from time to time to further my cigar
education. I'm sure most of you do the same. </B></P>

any one person. Cigars are fashionable for some people and they are the

rough ride for awhile. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I think a lot of people hate Marvin Shanken because
he is wealthy, successful and can get all the goddam good cigars he wants,
probably for free too! I personaly do not agree with CA's rating systems.
In the spring issue, they rated the Montesino Diplomatico Corona at 91,
the highest score right along with the usual cubans. I've had many of them,
and they are a good cigar, but they are not my favorite and I can still
find them for less than $2.50. so I don't think that CA's ratings always
drive up the price and reduce availability. I like Smoke's rating system
much better. Still I don't go by ratings in magazines. I've got to buy
em (or mooch em) and smoke them before I make up my mind. I think though,
I am becoming a cigar snob. When I see someone smoking a White Owl (my
old brand) I now tend to think of that person as someone who probably drinks
grocery store brand beer and thinks MacDonalds is fine dining.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Paraphrasing from something I read: A couple of
months ago we shipped you a heretofore unheard of cigar called the Flor
de Gonzalez. Now, C.A. listed the cigar as seventh on it's list. This cigar
wasn't even on the market six months ago, and now is near the top of M.
Shanken's list. Congrats to the Flor de Gonzalez Co. I just hope M. Shanken
has not tried (here they list their current favorites). You see, the day
after the mag. came out our supplier informed us the we are severly limited
in the number of boxes of Flor de Gonzalez we can order. &quot;Once again,
Marvin's blessing is a curse to the real connoisseur who ferrets out great
cigars even before Marvin finds them.&quot; Now I guess it his Shanken
&amp; company's job to inform people about cigars, but wouldn't it be nicer
to have a friend or tobbaconist recommend a cigar, and have it be available
and cheap, rather than read about it in a cigar (after being tasted by
someone you don't know), then having the price raised and availability
lowered. It would be great to have ya'll recommend cigars that are still
unheard of. But with our jobs and busy lives, we don't have the time to
try every unknown brand out there. I just think the whole shanken debate
is a double edged sword. I do 95% of my smoking on my balcony, which didn't
need his help to become an acceptable smoking establishment.</B></P>

<B>Another of Marvin's magazines, Wine Spectator, rates all types of wines with a similar numerical rating and no one seems to mind when they can't get their favorite $10 cabernet because the magazine gave it an "89" score, etc.  Marvin is the first to admit that he didn't think his cigar magazine was going to work as successfully as it has.  Obviously, the trend was inevitable.  Many people were waiting for something like this magazine but really didn't even know it.  In the last 5-7 years, "less but better" mindset has emerged including, but not limited to, cigars.  Red wine consumption is up, micro brewed beer is popular, cigars are way up, and there are more examples.  To blame Marvin for this shortsighted and childish.  I have a hard time finding Excaliburs or Partagas 10's @ the prices i could 5 years ago - but I don't stand in the walk-in humidor at the cigar shop blaming Marvin.  You can make ties to the rise in cigar smoking and the magazine's inception but they are not inextricably linked.  </B><P>

<B>A post at www.cigargroup.com/faq/#7.4 states that by freezing cigars in an airtight container one can alleviate the threat of tobacco worms.  The post also states that this procedure should have little effect on the cigars themselves.  My question is:  If the maturing of cigars is somewhat dependent on micro-organism activity, then would not freezing inhibit or halt such beneficial activity and thus alter the maturing process in some way?  Any experiences pro or con on freezing would be appreciated.</B><P>

<B>AAAAUUUUCKH!  DON'T FREEZE YOUR SMOKES!!  The ice crystals that will form from the moisture in your cigar will expand and ruin the tobacco.  The wrapper, filler, and binder will all turn frail and fall apart after thawing.  Spanish cedar is an excellent tobacco worm larvae inhibiter...and no thawing required!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Dont freeze them. Does your tobacco shop keep them cold? No.  I was in Nebraska last year, and I had to go outside to smoke. Well, I left my lovely Chateau Fuente outside in -15 weather.( I had to pee) When I re-lit it, it unraveled like a yo-yo. The wrapper just fell off. Dont freeze them. Send them to me, Ill make sure they have noo larvae in them at all.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I used to think that freezing cigars was a good option to 
store them fresh without the need of a humidor. I had a 
couple of "Cerdan" from DR in my freezer for about a year 
and they were fine for the first couple of months, but after
a year,my last four were ruined, the wrapper fell right off.
Therefore, I don't suggest doing it.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I think it might have to do with the moisture freezing inside of the cigar. If you let it thaw and re-humidified it, Im sure it was fine. But, if you light it straight from the freezer, I think its probably going to suck.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>You're right to advise against freezing cigars.  Not only do the ice crystals cause problems, but freezing breaks down the binding agent in the vegetable gum that is used to hold the wrapper together.  The combination of these two elements has runined many a fine cigar.  Again, use common sense...if it was appropriate  to freeze cigars, wouldn't our tobaconists do so?</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I've had this argument before. The manager of the Dunhill store in Atlanta (now closed and moved to Japan) told me that Lane's in Tucker Ga. (the distributer for Dunhill) has a huge freezing unit in the warehouse and they freeze all cigars when they come in from down south to kill any bugs. I have also frozen cigars. When this same Dunhill store closed in 1993 all cigars were sold at 50% and I bought 10 boxes of 1987 Romanas (yum!) with nowhere to store, I was in a dry apartment during the winter. Freeze them in a ziplock freezer bag. When you want to smoke, take them out and put in refrigerator for 3 days still in bag (slow thaw). Put them in a humidor and "lay" them down for 3-6 months. All of mine have smoked fine, no explosions. Would not recommend with a fragile wrapper like the Paragas 150 or for a long period of time.</B><P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Kornholio, two reasons: They don't want OpusX
to play second fiddle to another product and they are involved in a trademark
dispute with Opus One wine marketed by Robert Mondavi. If they're selling
OpusX alongside of Opus One, it will weaken their case, since Mondavi could
argue a customer might come into the store with $20 in their pocket to
buy a bottle of Opus One, see the OpusX cigar, figure it must be good because
it carries the Opus name, and buy the cigar instead.</B></P>

<H2>State Tax Rates on Cigars</H2>

<P><B>As my job requires me to travel I thought something I have noticed
might be of interest to others - the HUGE variation in price for the same
cigar in different states. I have known for some time that the state tax
rates differ but thought others may not be aware how much this can affect
the price of a cigar. Example: California has a 31.2% tax on cigars while
Pennsylvania (Holts) AND the good old District of Columbia (no politics
involved here) has 0%! Others with big catalog sales: Florida - 0%, North
Carolina - 2%, Tennessee - 6%, and Virginia - 0%. Good old California!
Anyway, for a complete list look at the &quot;Fuji FAQ Corner&quot; on
the Fuji Cigar Page. Now you know why that Hemingway Signa- costs $4.50
in Florida and upwards of $8.00 in California. Well, that's PART of the
reason.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>It's good to know that catalogs like J. R. Cigars
is absorbing some of the tax incurred on cigar sales. Here in Massachusetts
they recently increased the tax on cigars and pipe tobacco. Some retailers
have absored the cost, but others have opted to pay the percentage on the
wholesale and then charge the customer the sales tax on the retail. Thus
some shop owners have been given a wider profit margin thanks to the &quot;help&quot;
of the Massachusetts Legislature.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Bobbyk in an earlier post stated that JR is paying
halh of the NJ 24% state tax. Actually this is not quite so. the 24% NJ
state tax is on the WHOLESALE price of tobacco products, not retail. I
assume JR is marking up their products close to 100% on most items, so
when you pay that 12% surcharge in NJ you are pretty much paying the whole
tax, they like to let you think they are paying half however, this is just
a clever ploy on their part. With the 6% NJ sales tax, a cigar will cost
you almost 20% more than the price on the individual cigar. Even though,
I love their Whippany NJ store, and shop there often, even with the surcharge,
their prices are the best around here. </B></P>

I read the signs they've posted in the store and thought they were doing

are still very good and I love the Whippany store as well although the
last few times I've been there, their selection was pretty beat. Almost

- Dukakis). The state reps. recently passed a 10% sales tax on cigars,
in addition to a 5% sales tax. Oh joy! I now get to give even MORE of my
money away. What more could one ask for?</B></P>

<B>HA HA HA!!  Not to discourage you, BUT...if you have not jumped on the bandwagon yet, you might as well not.  It is SOOOO extremely hard to get a distributor for cigars.  They are SO tapped out by existing clients, many are not even accepting orders from new clients at all; or they are adding them to a waiting list that's already miles long.  At my store, we might only get a third of our order each week.  It's very frustrating because business is booming, but manufactures can't keep up with the demand.  The new lines that are just being introduced are being mass produced, and from what I've seen, quality is poor!  Sorry to burst your bubble, and I could be wrong.  I'm just sharing knowledge that I've acquired through experience.  Please let me know how it goes if you do decide to venture.</B><P>

<H2>My Brother-in-law, Part III</H2>

<P><B>I gave the Montecristo #2 to my brother-in-law, as promised. You'd
think that I'd given him a Mercedes Benz. It was a great feeling for both
of us and cemented a close bond even closer. Now, here's the really unbelievable
part: As I was leaving the family gathering, my wife's neice's husband,
pulled me to the side and handed me a little package, telling me not to
open it until I got home. When I did, I found two...can you believe it...two,
Cohiba Esplendidos. What a prize. But, it even gets better. If you look
back on my original thread on this subject, you will find a post from KBW
offering to replace the Monte #2, if I gave my last one to my brother-in-law.
Guess what? A beautiful Montecristo #2, along with two other fine cigars
arrived in the mail today. KBW, I'll not embarass you by disclosing your
real name on the web, but that has to be one of the nicest things anyone
has ever done for me, and, being a firm believer in reciprocity, I went
to the package delivery store this afternoon and, my friend, one of the
Cohiba Esplendidos I received, is winging its way to you as I type. The
world is filled with wonderful people and sometimes they show up in the
most unexpected places...likeThe Internet. Thanks, KBW, you are truly a
generous soul, and I won't forget you.</B></P>

<P><B>A new deal on a classic cigar has become available to all. The Partagas
#1, found in Atlanta at around $8 and sold by a frequently named cigar
source for $7, is now available for under $4. Go to http://www.cigargroup.com/deals
and find out how you can order 5 of these for under $20. I don't mean to
advertise (and of course I'm not benefitting in the least) but this seems
like a win/win situation, for manufacturer, retailer, and consumer.</B></P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Drew: I received my order also.  5 Partagas #1 for $15, plus inside the tube Thompson's put a certificate good for $10 off my next order.  That makes for $1 each, what a deal!!  I have not smoked any of them yet, I am going to leave them in the humidor for a couple of months first.  Thanks for the advice on the good deal.  Also, don't you live close to W-W Humidors?  If so, have you ever seen their 225 & what is your opinion of it?  I have one of their 75s, plus a Colibri that holds about 60-75 cigars, but I am interested in a larger one.  I don't mean to turn this thread into another humidor thread with the 100s that already exist, but would be interested to hear your opinion on the W-W.  Thanks.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I bought the J & S model 100, which I am happy with.  I placed my order with them
about a week before I heard about the W & W factory.  It's probably about 5 miles from me.
I need to buy a friend a wedding gift and was going to run up to the factory to see if I can
find some cheap 225s.  They might sell slightly damaged humidors or humidors with wood with bad grain
or something.  I'll report my findings, but probably won't have free time to get up there for a few weeks.
If you go to cigargroup.com, and follow the web site threads, you can see a picture of the W & W.  It looked nice
to me.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Drew: If W & W has some cheap 225s (slightly damaged or whatever), let me know or pick me one up.  It looks lice a pretty nice humidor on the cigargroup.com page.  I have this compulsive purchasing problem with cigars.  I can't quit buying cigars although I have no room left in my two smaller humis.  By the way, if you are a Hdm Excalibur fan try some of JRs Rosa Cubas.  I'll bring you one to Atlanta at the dinner or email me your address & I'll get you one in the mail.  brentp@cneti.com </B><P>

<B>I'm in the market for a new lighting device for my treasured smokes, and from what I can see collibri is the big name. Is this true or what? What is the reliability of their lighters, as well as performance and cigar friendliness. Essentially what I need is something which is very versatile that I can use inside or out and from what I've read these new high powered butane lighters are all the rage. In particular I'm interested in the new quantum prime minister lighter. I've also been looking at their other waterproof rectangular models. They range from 50 to $100 in price range. So basically my question is, are they worth it? Any comments would be greatly appreciated.  </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I have a Prime Minister and it is great, but lighters do
tend to get lost. At $115.00 I am too paranoid to carry it
anywhere. Also, the gold finish on it is so pretty it looks
like it would scratch just by looking at it. For an all
around great lighter I would strongly recomend the Blazer
Microtorch. It is the ultimate. At $40-$50 it is a great deal
and less of a loss if lost. See "Matches, Zippo's, Torches
Part III" below.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I've had a Colibri for about 6 months now, and it's a great little lighter.  I don't remember the name of it, but it's the one with the metal body and see through window so you can see how much fuel you have.  I got mine for about $45.    BTW.  Colibri is very nice about repairs to all their merchandise.  I had a Colibri pen for about two years when the nib broke off.  I called their main office in RI, and they sent a new part to me within 5 days... free!  Now that's standing behind your product.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Agree with Brent - the Colibri Firebird is a great lighter
for the price.  After "losing" a $$$ lighter at a party I 
won't spend that kind of money again.  I've had my "Firebird"
for over a year and it still works great.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>charlie, COLIBRI is a good product. If you have a problem just send it to their factory and they will fix or replace it for $4.50 P&H. Send to Colibri 100 Niantic Ave. Providence, RI 02907.  Or call their Service Center at 1-800-551-1351.  </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>BRENT: I'm stranded here in RI recovering from a heart attack. I can almost see the Colibri Factory out my window.The factory store is only open on weekends for X-Mas shopping. I would be glad to pick up those items for you if they still have them. The place is very crowded and things sell like hotcakes. The Quantum Force I got was Army Green. What color would you like if there is a choice?</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>BC: Sorry to hear about your heart attack.  I would prefer black in the Quantum, but would be pleased to get any color (I would like to have 3 of them if they still have them).  I also would like to have 1 each of the 3 & 5 finger cigar cases (any color).  I feel like a kid making out my Christmas list, what fun this is!!  Let me know your address or whatever & I will get you some $$ in the mail.  I appreciate greatly your taking the time to do this.  Just curious, are you still smoking (cigars or cigarettes) after your heart attack or has the doctor made an indication to you that the cigars were a contributing factor??  Sometimes I get this heavy feeling or rapid heartbeat in my chest while/after smoking a cigar.  Not sure if it a physical reaction to the tobacco or just my inner self asking me what I am doing smoking something this expensive.  Whatever the case, Happy Holidays & Good Smoking.  THANKS!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Thanks to all who took the time to send get well msg's.I was a 2pk/day cigarette smoker before my last heart attack. The cigars are to help me quit cigarettes. I'm down to about 5-6 cigs/day. The doc says that cigars are much preferrable to cigs. I think the high price of  cigars is the most likely cause of heart attacks! Regards to all and good smoking.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I liked my Quantums while they lasted (about 2 months).  I have had 2 of them already to quit lighting.  I can still see the spark & have checked the fuel/refilled it with Colibri fuel.  Anybody have any ideas??  Thanks</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by brent at  on Tuesday, January 14 at 09:18 AM EST<p></FONT></TT>
<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Brent, sorry to hear about the lighters. Mine is working fine as are all the others I gave as Christmas gifts. If you have spark listen closely and you should hear a hissing if the gas is flowing. If you hear the hissing and it won't fire up the problem is most likely an air pocket in the fuel path or tank. Check the instruction for how to bleed air out. Then refill. Please let me know how you make out as I feel badly that I sent you any problems.  My sincere appoligies, BC</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by BC at adriannecarroll@msn.com on Thursday, January 16 at 04:59 PM EST<p></FONT></TT>
<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>BC: Don't feel badly, I am very appreciative of the favor you done for me.  Of the 3 that you sent me, only one of those has quit.  The other one that is not working I bought at a shop $$ a while back.  They told me I could bring both lighters back to them & they would take care of it.  From your advice above, it must be an air pocket.  I can hear the gas coming out of the lighter, I guess I will have to break down & read those directions (when all else fails, right?).  I had a feeling it couldn't be too serious of a problem, with both lighters being fairly new & having the same malfunction.  I'll try the air bleed & let you know how it goes.  Thanks again! (And certainly no apologies needed)</B><P>

<B>This summer while on Cape Cod I smoked a fantastic cigar
made by Nate Sherman called a Metropolitan. It was a 
pyramid approx. 7 inches in length with a ring gauge of 
at least 54 (possibly 56). I have finished the four that
I brought home with me and have been unable to find this
cigar. Tobacconists cannot find any such cigar listed. Does
anyone know anything about this cigar, or, has anyone tried it.</B><P>

<H2>A Question for the experts!</H2>

<P><B>I just received a box of fuente Churchills from JR Tobacco and noticed
that about 6 of them had some &quot;green&quot; spots on them. Is this
normal, will proper aging cure this. Please help with this problem!</B></P>

<P> <TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by fuente at </FONT></TT></P>

<P>
<HR><FORM method=POST action="AQuestionfortheexperts.pl"><B>Fuente, the
green spots are tobacco leaf mold, and that ain't good. If anything, aging
in a properly humidified humidor will just make matters worse, and you
run the risk of contaminating your other cigars. The mold won't hurt you,
but it will diminish the quality of your smokes over time. Best thing to
do is keep them isolated from your other cigars and smoke them right away.</B></P>

<P> 
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Fuente, I have some blue/green spots on my Partagas
#1's and a few on my Don Tomas SE 500's. They arrived that way from the
wholesaler. Each box has been in my humidor for about 3 months and I have
not noticed any spreading of the spots. I read a thread a while back saying
they were sunspots(?). </B></P>

<B>I've read that you can delicately wipe some of this off with a paper towel.  Sounds risky
I know, and you may tear the wrapper, but maybe you could experiment on one.  Do tobacconists provide
any guarantee against this, or is it just part of the risk involved?  Since Blue cheese is just mold, I'd
probably just smoke one of those "bad ones" first, see how it is, then smoke them all to get rid of them.  But that's
just me.</B><P>

I heard that the mold is due to increased humidity levels either at the production stage or while aging.  It won't spread.  As for altering the flavor...you probably will never notice.  It is too small of an area to change the flavor of the cigar.  Don't worry and enjoy.

<P><B>Today my wife and I went to town to do a bit of shopping and ended
up at the nicest tobacco shop in town. They have always been courteous
and helpfull. Their prices are competative for this area. The shop had
two ladies working. There was one customer at the counter being rung up.
The clerk who was free greeted us as we went in the walk-in humidor. There
was one gentleman shopping in the humidor. After 2 or 3 minutes the gentleman
took his selections and left. We looked at the new 898 Collections, Filipe
Gregorios and Puros Indios. I was trying to educate my wife on a few of
the higher end cigars as one of the clerks came in and asked my wife to
please remove her purse from the humidor. She said last week somebody stole
a $300 box of cigars. Well, my wife hit the ceiling and refused to deposit
her purse with any shop clerk and the shop was about to loose more than
$300 worth of business if she left. As Susan went out the front door she
told them she would never be back. I didn't get any cigars, just some lighter
fuel. I asked what kind of cigars were stolen and was told it was a box
of Macanudo Duke of Windsors. I told them I did not appreciate being lied
to; the Duke of Windsors might have cost them $125 but nowhere near $300.
I noticed a 3&quot; x 5&quot; card on the glass door of the humidor stating,
&quot;No Purses, Shopping Bags or Coats Allowed in the Humidor&quot;. I
thought it was a bit small for the purpose. They have no mirrors, cameras
or any other theft deterent. I know shoplifting is a problem, but when
did it become acceptable for a store to spend nothing for security, yet
be so blatantly intrusive toward their customers. I will not remove a coat
and I would expect no woman to deposit her purse with a retail clerk. Has
anybody had a similar experience at a cigar shop or is this an isolated
incident? I believe store security is the store's responsibility and should
be handled with respect and courtesy to the customers. They didn't realize
I was about to buy a box of Filipe Gregorio Belicosos at $210. Now I'll
just wait. </B></P>

<B>Now wait Gerard, have you ever worked (or owned) a shop?  Well, I haven't either.  But theft is
a problem and protecting your inventory is very important.  Slipping a box of cigars into a purse or
backpack would be easy in an empty walk-in humidor.  It's a shame that our society has lead to that shop feeling
that they need to have that policy, but I really don't think you can fault them for trying to protect their lifeblood.
They were rude, I agree, and for that they deserve to lose business.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I agree that they were indeed rude & probably could have handled the situation a little more discreetly (like coming in the humi & counting a few cigars or moving a few boxes around).  I was in my regular shop a couple of days ago with a big raincoat on & the thought hit me that I might look a little suspicious in there.  I had been in the humi for about 30 minutes picking up various cigars & did not have anything picked out at that point.  I finally made my selection and left the store without incident, but I did have the feeling (paranoia I think it is called) that they were beginning to wonder if I was ever going to leave.  Once I left the humi & had paid for my cigars, I noticed that the owner had a new computer.  I ended up spending about 3 hours with him bookmarking all the cigar sites and showing him around the net.  When I left he handed me a cigar out of his pocket and thanked me.  Guess I was just feeling paranoid.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>As a person who does work in a retail store, I've never, ever asked anyone to leave their bag at the counter.  It's not the type of establishment we have.  I have been a bit concerned about people (who obviously didn't know what they were doing) fondeling the cigars.  I've had someone come in and "pack" a cigar, the way you would a pack of cigarettes.  Yikes!  I wanted to swipe it out of his hand.  But, if you are in business, you've got to be polite to customers, no matter what kind of an idiot they might be.  Because the location of our humidor, it is easy for me to position myself next to it and be available for questions.  I love offering bits of knowledge and trivia if I think the person would appreciate it.  Otherwise, I kinda let the customers shop as they wish.  But believe me, I always have my eyes watching for the pockets and coats.  The only stores that I ever heard of that ask you to leave your bag at the register are down in Little Five Points (a very alternative area), even then, I wouldn't leave my PURSE!  That's a ridiculous invasion of privacy, and not to mention unsafe!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>To answer your question : Rudeness.  Maybe they do lose some cigars that way, and that is a shame, but that is a loss the store should be willing to take. If they want to install some other security device, such as a video camera, I would have no problem with it. They have no right to tell you that you cant have your purse, or much less your COAT, with you. MP, you did the right thing.  I suggest calling up the manager and explaining to them that as an honest customer, you were upset by the policy, as it presumes that you are there to steal from them. If they argue, tell them that they will probably lose a lot more business with the policy than they will save money from 'cigarlifters'.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I, too, enjoy Matacans a lot - especially for the price.  My first "real" cigar after getting back into them semi-recently was a Cruz Real #19.  I got it in Mexico and it was great, but was disappointed when I got some more in the U.S. and they weren't nearly as smooth.  I know that many of the cigars from Mexico are not good, but the Matacan's seem to be consistently smooth flavored and tasty.  Has anyone else experienced a difference in Mexican cigars purchased in Mexico being of a better quality than Mexican cigars purchased in the states?</B><P>

of bundled cigars, but both of the Matacans were smooth 
smokes with a spicy finish.  The burn was even, construction
was good, and I will be buying more of these.  If you're
looking for an everyday smoke, the Matacan is it!  Now, if

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Angie, perhaps you recall we had some discussions a while back concerning
cigar themed art. If you print an address I can send you a
new sample. On another note, I am also a die-hard WCW fan.
As an employee of Ted, you probably have better chance than most to 
get the real story on the miracle of WCW. Although you said
you aren't a sports person, I urge you to check this show out.
I used to hate pro wrestling, but it's definitely some pretty cool stuff
going on. If you can get tickets from your employer and
want to attend a match, I know that WCW is currently touring the South, although
they have passed Atlanta. Anyway, if your e-mail can handle 
JPEGS or GIF's then I will e-mail you some neat artistic images.
By the way, congratulations on your network's excellent wrestling coverage as
well as the tasteful "Thunder in Paradise".</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I have enjoyed the LR's more than the 150's.  The 150's filler & binder are nothing different than regular Partagas.  That is not my opinion; it is a fact put forth by the Partagas themselves.  Their only distinction is that the wrapper is aged for (they claim) 17 years.  I realize the importance of a quality wrapper.  However, the LR are the best Partagas has to offer throughout the filler, binder, and wrapper.  Wholelistically (sp.?), it is a better cigar.  Also, the LR is usually a little cheaper - as an added bonus.</B><P>

The 12 year old filler and binder is married to a rich Camaroon wrapper.
They go best with a heavy cognac, such as an XO. Save'em if you can. The

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Don Carlos is one of the best kept secrets in
the cigar world. I travel alot and am always on the lookout for a box.
I have two boxes but smoke them very rarely. A year or so ago, CA had a
interview with Fuente Sr. who said that only 100K cigars of these were
produced per year. They use vintage 1984, no missprint, 1984 tobacco and
it is running out fast. Holt's in PA is one of the few cigar stores that
actually list them in a catalog. Yes, they are fantastic. Incredibly deep
and smooth because of the excessive aging. Robuto is the best. Fuente Jr
said in a recent CI that he employs 800 rollers but only two roll the Don
Carlos. Good luck finding them in quantities. Enjoy if you do. Let me know
if I'm right.</B></P>

d.c #3s sitting right there on the shelf. I have never had one but hearing
all of you rave about them I had to try one. They were priced at $6.75
which seemed to be well below what most of you are paying for them. AS
I reached into the box to grab two sticks, Matthews above statements flashed
through my mind. ---Fuentes Sr.--- ONLY 100k cigars-- 1984 tobacco----
only two rollers!!!! In a moment of weakness I grabbed a BOX. I quickly
left the humidor, paid for the box and sped home before I could change
my mind. I put the box in my igloodor as my humidor is FULL! How long should
I let them sit and should I open up the box and let them breath? If they
are half as good as all of you say I know I made the right choice. Only
time will tell.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I happened across a box of DC Robustos last week.
I contemplated for about 2 minutes before breaking down and buying the
whole box. Are they everything they're cracked up to be? IMHO, yes they
are! They taste quite a bit like a Hemingway, but the flavors are richer
(almost but not quite as good as the Opus X.) I smoked four of these over
6 days and I plan to lay the rest away for awhile (at least till next summer.)
If you should have the good fortune to find some of these choice smokes,
sieze the opportunity. You will not regret it!</B></P>

one of my #3s. What a nice smoke they are. Flavorful but smooth. The aftertaste

for a #3?</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I smoked one about 8 weeks ago and I thought it
was a mediocre cigar, at best. However this is my opinion, not meant to
downplay others enthusiasm towards this cigar. I paid 6.75 for mine and
distinctly remember it because it was purchased along with my first Opus
X which turned out to be the largest campaign for something that was a
farce since Clinton, oh well, I think I would have enjoyed it more if I
would have done research into it. A local shop here in Pittsburgh has them,
but they are awfully small, about the size of the &quot;Fuente Fuente&quot;

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Paul, my favorite lengths are 6 1/2's and 7+'s.
One of my favorites happens to be the A.F. &quot;Spanish Lonsdale&quot;.
Being from Miami I am currently basking in the warm, cozy feeling of getting
La Gloria Cubana's like they were Garcia y Vegas...hence the whole line
of L.G.C. with a few exceptions are great as well. However there is a brand
new cigar called a &quot;Romantico&quot; that is rolled in Miami (as well
as the D.R.) by a childhood friend of mine now. they are setting up operations
to really market this thing and they are exquisite, no joke. As for &quot;schmoozing
cigars&quot; Avo, Santa Damiana, L.G.C. &quot;gloria inmensas&quot; as
well as Peterson and Davidoff Grand Cru (I DO NOT BUY THESE CIGARS ON ANY
BASIS...THEY ARE WAY OVERPRICED BUT NOWADAYS YOU NEED THEM TO MAKE PEOPLE
SHUT UP, ESPECIALLY AT BARS WITH THE BARTENDER/RESIDENT CIGAR EXPERT MENTALITY.)
Anyhow take care and Happy Smoking</B></P>

<B>Edouardo, try the Brevas Fina.  They are not expensive,
snobby, Tres  Chic cigars to smoke but I REALLY enjoy them.
They are good little cigars with a small BITE to them.
Up here in NH I can never find them.  I'm down to my last 
three.  What type of prices have you seen them for by you?
They should be between $2.75 and $3.50 for singles.  Boxes
should be no more than $60 or $65.  Try one and let me know
what you think.</B><P>

<B>Hi, when I was visiting South Africa over the summer I came across
two kinds of cigar, The Macanudo and the Cuban Havana.  Needless
to say both were excellent but now that I'm back I can find 
very little Macanudos. I'm wondering if anybody knows when the
drought will be over.</B><P>

<form method=POST action="Macanudoisthereadrought.pl">
<B>The Macanudo has become a "popular" cigar in this cigar craze and is becoming harder and harder to find. Everyone usually recommends the Macanudo to the first time smokers, cause they ARE a great smoke (IMHO). Just find a good tobacconist and hopefully they have the method of keeping a steady supply coming in. Maybe when the fad and nouveau of cigars wears off on the public, things will get back to normal. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Macanudos are all over in Southern California.  The Indian is right about the Macanudo.  It is a great first time smoke. 
I recommend a Portofino or Baron de Rothschild.  I hear the Hyde Park is also a nice one to try.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Yes, even though Macanudos are extremely popular (justifiably so), you 
can usually still find them in cigar shops.  Every cigar shop in every city
I've been to has at least one line of Macs.  Maybe you're just experiencing
a little bad luck.</B><P>

<B>For anyone living in, around, or travelling to Toronto, there is a great shop called "Tobacco Haven".  The staff are very knowlegeable and helpful.  They have an incredible selection, especially of the Cuban brands, and because they are not in the financial area around Bay & King streets, or in the Yorkville area( where there is a cigar shop on practically every corner) their prices are comparitively reasonable!  Of course, because they are not in Yorkville, they don't have a smoking lounge, or built in Cubita coffee bar, but for the service of selling good cigars, they are equal or better than all of those upscale stores.  They are located at 595 Bay St., Toronto, Ontario   M5G 2C2 
 (416) 593-1863.   They also have a mail order service, but I don't know the number.</B><P>

<B>Tobacco Haven is one of my favorite stops too.  Since you mentioed the Cubita coffee bar you must have tried the Thomas Hinds as well.  I like their upstairs lounge.  You did'nt mention what you found there in the way of smokes, keep us up to date because you never know what is available in Toronto.</B><P>

<P><B>As you have noticed in the past couple of months, this site is now
monitored very carefully by a Webmaster. His function is to make sure that
the posts match the objectives and reflect the image that the General Cigar
Company wishes to project to the public. This site is not intended to sell
cigars. It was designed as a service to loyal cigar smokers looking for
a forum to discuss relevant topics and to be a source of information for
both new and old cigar lovers. Racial slurs, bigotry, foul or obscene remarks,
or topics that have no relevance to the cigar lifestyle are not to be tolerated
and are removed at once. We benefit by learning what you are thinking about
brands, identifying trends, and learning more about our customers. There
is a budget for this site. The dollars can be spent making it exactly what
you want it to be and adding new innovations or we can pay him to remove
the trash. You can help by not responding to any postings that are obviously
meant to be inflammatory. The Webmaster has some great ideas for this site
that I would love to see happen. Your feedback is great and much appreciated.
This site is definitely still under construction and the Webmaster is the
foreman....please keep your comments coming!</B></P>

done a superb job throughout the year. At first I fell prey to the nasties
who left garbage on this web and responded to their insults. But I learned
that the quickest way to disarm them is through non-response. The Amish
call it shunning, and it is the most effective weapon we can use to keep
idiocy and bigotry off the website. Thanks for making the site available
for our use, and for your generous subsidy. Now, all that being said, I
will expect my free box of Duke of Devon Maduros at your earliest convenience.
Just kiddin'...the devil made me say that.</B></P>

from your competitors. I am still a rookie cigar smoker as that I've spent
less than a year at it, but your site has accelerated my education in cigarology,
and for that I am grateful. In the future I hope you can add a &quot;live&quot;
chat room, so that we can get to know each other better. Although I have
not met anyone here in person, I feel that I am among friends. Thanks again.</B></P>

the use of its customers and others interested in cigars.  It
does not allow its retail customers to advertise or otherwise
compete for business on this site, in the interest of fairness to all.
You have been posting numerous threads asking to purchase and offering 
to sell quantities of cigars...It is beginning to sound very much like
 a brokerage or commodity trading venture.  As such, it is not
allowed here....The policy here is reasonably tolerant so that visitors
can exchange information and the occasional cigar...When it takes

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>rob,  i wouldn't put your smokes in the freezer, as it will dry them to a crisp after some time.  i have heard of some people bringing them back in their humidor, but i would think this would alter the taste and possibly the draw.  you may want to try a temporary humidor, such as a zip lock bag with a wet paper towel (keeping the paper towel away from your smokes.  you can also use tupperware for a short period of time using the same method for humidity.  you always have to do what you need to do to keep those smokes in good shape.  in my opinion, i would stay away from the freezer and the refridgerator.  good luck.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Cigars in a humidor or tupperware will NOT continue to age.
Cigars are not like wine that will get better over time.
The tobacaco is fermented in bales to achieve i high temperature
The bales are turned a number of times to repeat the process
and make the tobacco better.  This can NOT be accomplished
in any humidor.  A properly humidified smoke will stay perfect
forever at 72% humidity and 70 degrees temperature.</B><P>

<B>BC, where did you shop? I have never encountered this. Most boxes are priced
lower than if one was to buy 25 singles or they are priced the same as 25 singles.

<B>The law states that you can be fined $50,000 and imprisoned 
for ten years for bringing in even *one* Cuban cigar, but
to my knowledge no one has ever been prosecuted for this.
That info comes from a catalog I downloaded from Smokin'
Joes.  If you were bringing in a sufficient quantity (as 
your question suggests) you might be in for a stiff fine. 
The topic of bringing in Cubans is covered in more detail
on other threads, you may want to check them out.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>It is indeed a tragedy that a country such as Cuba is in the hands of such a megalomaniac like Castro. Smoking a Cuban cigar is in no way supporting his regime, nor does it condone lawlessness.  The decision to place an embargo on Cuba is both irrational and short sighted, as it only worsens living conditions for the Cuban people and strengthens Castro's grip on the people and resentment of us.  The people have little choice but to obey him, because we have refused to support them financially with trade and tourism.  Were they economically empowered, or had a chance to have any money that they felt he was taking from them, they would certainly revolt.  My question is, why didn't we just take the damn island in the first place!?!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>A quick history lesson for Bill.  Cuba was a US possession
for brief period of time.  It became ours as a result of
the Spanish-American War in 1898.  We granted them their 
independence in 1902, I believe.  The reasons were that
we were the leading voice in the world at that time for
anti-colonialism and that the US Navy could ensure (especially
with a base at Guantanamo Bay) that no
European power would re-colonize Cuba (since we had no fleet
in Asia to guarantee the Phillipines' independence, we 
kept them and became what we condemned).  Whether this
was the right thing to do can be debated endlessly.   </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I've smoked many Cubans, including Partagas, and find the 
taste, wrap and burn to be consistently inferior to other 
products from more civilized nations.  The aura of a superior
Cuban product is steeped in nostalgia - certainly not in
sophisticated agronomy, technology or investment.  In a free
Cuban market, the quality would not compete; it is the under 
the table market that is propping up the products.
Now I think I'll light up a Partagas Anniversario.

The L.G.C's are produced in Miame (El Credito), and the D.R. Of course
we can't forget the Cuban L.G.C's-- had only one, what a treat.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>That is true; they need to be aged.  I was in the El Credito factory in Miami (quite a small, unimpressive operation really) and you can see the cigars going from the rolling tables (recently rolled) to the pre-packaging before boxing.  It didn't look apparent that they were aging @ the factory warehouse.  I could be wrong.  Plus, the ones that I have tried recently have tasted a little "fresh"; i don't know how to describe that flavor but I know it when I taste it.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Has anyone tried the other La Glorias, the ones from the La Gloria Cigar Co on Flagler St in Miami.  They have cigars available without the 3-4 month wait that other smokers have reported about the Cubanas from El Credito.  I just received some and am anxious to try them, but havn't had the right opportunity.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Wizard, post when you try the El Creditos.  I think they are excellent
smokes and would like to hear your opinion.  As for the other smokes
you are talking about the "La Gloria Miami" (I believe), I am smoking one right 
now.  They are cheap where I live and for the price I am rather impressed.  
As the saying goes "Pound for Pound".....</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Andy, I have the ones from La Gloria Cigar Corp.(the box says they were made in D.R.).  When I ordered them, I thought I was getting the El Credito La Gloria Cubanas.  Being new to the cigar world, I did not realize there was a difference.  They aren't a bad smoke, but they don't always burn evenly.  I will have to place an order for some of the El Credito ones sometime and see what all the talk is about.  Happy smoking.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Wizard, let those La Glorias age for a couple months in a humidor. 
You might be suprised at the increase in quality.  I'm not saying they 
are anywhere near the real LGCs but the burn and taste improved considerably
after a couple of months in my humidor.  </B><P>

<B>If you are looking for a cheap yet functional beginner humidor do not
spend 50$.  Instead look at all the humidor threads.  There
are many ideas included within these thereads for cheap/temporary 
humidors.  I personally make my own out of old cigar boxes, and they work
great.  If you want to try this leave a message here and I will

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>CC is right...I do like Filipino smokes, especially the Double Happiness corona length.  They're great summer cigars, enjoyed in the late afternoon with a Vodka Tonic.  They have a light, spicy flavor, and leave a salty aftertaste on the tongue; an occasional, pleasant alternative to Central American tobaccos, which, for me, always seem to smoke better in cooler weather, especially the Maduro wraps.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Dan, I just finished a Rooster Arturo that had absolutly
perfect draw (IMHO).  This leads me to believe that it is
that the tight draw on the others may have been due to the
construction.  As far as leaving them in your humidor, I have
always been under the impression that over humidification is
a reason many cigars draw tight.  But I am no expert.  
Overall I still really enjoy the Fighting Cock.</B><P>

was an OUTSTANDING cigar, it looked like it might be machine rolled and
packed. I've heard that many of the Bolivars' are. Is this true? They were
fairly plentyful in London and fairly reasonably priced at about $12 (US)
each. I see that they are highly rated in the CA book. What does everyone

<B>Some of the Bolivars are machine made. Don't let that sway you. A good cigar consists of good filler, binder and wrapper. Whether it is rolled by a person or a machine will not change the flavor. I am partial to the Bolivar Belicoso (hand rolled). This is a beautifully made, very tasty torpedo shaped cigar. It has, unfortunately, become very difficult to get. If you find one, however, by all means buy it and set aside some time to enjoy it. I think that they put the MOntecristo #2 to shame. </B><P>

Susan and I ground and packaged the beans tonight. The open-house at the

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Gentlemen- life is too short to spend it hurling
insults and hurting others. And its not just cruel remarks here and in
other threads demeaning my religion. No, unfortunately I'm used to that.
But look throughout the threads and see what we've got. Utter contempt
and disgusting remarks towards women. Gay baiting. Gay bashing. Profanity.
Bigotry. Argumentative cheap shots. Demeaning mean spirited insults hurled
for no reason other than to hurt. Endless sophmoric oneupmanship, not spirited
civil debate. The First Amendment is a beloved right, not a carte blanche
license to demean. I have enjoyed exchanging ideas and information with
many of you, you know who you are, but, without fail the threads degenerate
into mindless schoolyard trash. As an attorney I am paid to deal with this
type of pathetic behavior, I don't expect to come home to it. So, I will
choose not to participate. Type what you wish, I shall not read it. Ladies
and gentlemen, Buzz has left the building. I'm out of here.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>That's right- Cigars do make very nice Hannukah
gifts. I got some nice ones, including some of them Bolivar Gigantes. Happy

Merry Christmas and Joyous Kwaanza in the coming weeks as well. Obnoxio

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Isn't this a pretty picture! Now I know why there are posts
like: Cooking duck, Mailorder Mallard, and finger foods. You people
would kill each other with sophisticated topics. Grown men threaten to leave
then return??? religion bashing??? Please mature a little gentlemen. Then we
might take that first step, from finger foods. I enjoy this site and the few topics
that allow me to engage in (adult) conversation. Please let this site grow to full potential.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>R.W. We already have a webmaster. Knock it off. As to grown
men leaving and returning, I certainly did. Were you around
then? Do you have any idea how nasty this website got? Well,
that has all been deleted. The webmaster took the bull by
its horns and cleaned up this site. Let the maturation begin
with you. Of course, if you are the former Sage, as I suspect
you will continue with your condescending attitude. One reason
why you were attacked so in "Female Smokers" is that your
posting was a throwback to less pleasant times. I think many
of us envisioned Sage at the keyboard. </B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>R.W.. In the recent past some former participants on this
site chose to break into threads that they did not deem worthy.
They said "lets only discuss cigars". Now you come along,
interrupt adults having a conversation, and say (insultingly)
"don't discuss that, discuss what I want, discuss the "wheels
of society"". These threads are big enough for everyone. If
you don't like a topic, move on but don't rain on someone
elses parade. You're new to these threads (supposedly), why
do you insist on making so many enemies so quickly. Keep it
up and you will find out just how exclusionary THIS society is.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>R.W.- Here's some food for  thought- "Cooking Duck II" was
posted by the Webmaster. The writing should be on the wall,
and plain to see.</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by Buzz at  on Sunday, January 05 at 03:57 PM EST<p></FONT></TT>
<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Buzz, please reread my post. I never said these topics should
NOT exist. I'm merely stating that a "Gathering of Thread friends"
post turned into a mess! This thread was very thoughtful in my opinion, and was started with a kind gesture.
Because of the childish behavior, it is apparent why there are
topics like "cooking duck." If a thread on current events like "Tobacco tax hikes", or
"government intervention into smokers rights" was started, this site would turn upside down.
This is why I commented on why there are so many simple topics. I have never used profanity and never will. Also,
I have not verbally slapped someone, who did not slap me first.
Buzz, go back and reread the "female smoker" thread. After my first post I was told " I don't get laid." by
one of the regulars, I think. Nobody, jumped on him for using foul language. I have
to say on his behalf, he did comeback with a great opinion on femin-nazis, one
of the better posts on that thread. My problem was not realizing that this site
has a tightly knit group of regulars. I stated my honest beliefs in the "female smokers" thread and was hit from every direction.
Don't hate me because my beliefs are different from yours. These different views on life, cigars, whatever, will make
this site more interesting. If one insults, then you all follow suit and If one agrees, you all agree. Buzz, I have
my own thoughts, and that is not going to change. I'm not looking to find enemies, but will not
smear my views to correspond with yours. I've made some uncalled for statements only
because so many were made toward me. If someone is upset about this, I'm sorry.
Buzz, this is the second time I have apologized and like the first, it will fly over
everyones head.

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>R.W.- I would never expect for you and I to agree on everything.
That would indeed make for a boring website. But, lets look
at your postings under "Finger Foods" and "Mail Order Mallard".
Rather hard to defend aren't they. Sure the topics you mention
would be interesting. I especially like "Tobacco Tax Hikes".
So begin your own thread, but don't belittle those people
discussing that which they find interesting. You seem to be
in favor of different views so long as it is a topic that
you find to be worthy. I will say it again: discuss what you
want but don't rain on other peoples parades. My parents
always told me one thing that you should keep in mind: it's
not always what you say, but how you say it. Take a long look
at your first couple of postings under "Female Smokers". You
are the one who went nasty and personal first. Sure you 
apologized for some "out of line" comments, but understand
that if people hit you from all sides it is because they
were responding to what you had to say, not what you meant 
to say or what you really meant. It is true that you are
judged by the words that you speak. What people are responding
to is your lack of civility. The only person that I know
of who can disavow himself from the written record is Bill
Clinton, and R.W., you are no Bill Clinton (that's a compliment).</B><P>

Our database revisions should be ready in a few days but if your trip will
happen sooner, you might try searching the 'Lighten Up New York' database
at (http://www.lighten-up.com/cigar1.html)....By the way, your other post

you wrote down the title of any post you out up and then do a search for
it prior to posting another. The note at the top of the page points out

within a few days of posting...It is an awkward solution but it works until
our new database system comes on line...Good Luck in New York.</B></P>

Our database revisions should be ready in a few days but if your trip will
happen sooner, you might try searching the 'Lighten Up New York' database
at (http://www.lighten-up.com/cigar1.html)....By the way, your other post

you wrote down the title of any post you out up and then do a search for
it prior to posting another. The note at the top of the page points out

within a few days of posting...It is an awkward solution but it works until
our new database system comes on line...Good Luck in New York.</B></P>

<B>I am going back to Grand Cayman after four years and 
would like to know if anyone has been recently that can
recommend a place to buy Havanas.  When I was there
previously I bought them at something similar to a 7-11.  
R&J's.  This time I have a little more money saved up and
would like to buy a box to smoke while I'm there.  Any 
suggestions?</B><P>

<B>cigargroup.com has an extensive list of international tobacconists.  I pulled the
name of one in Bora Bora (or something similar) and gave it to a friend.  He said that
it was a great recommendation, since there were many other stores he might have ended up in which
weren't nearly as good.</B><P>

they didn't have anything in Grand Cayman.  Oh well, maybe I'll have MORE AIR to scuba dive if I don't find a good source.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Ed, please don't talk about scuba diving in the Caymans like that!  I am stuck here in Alabama, drysuit diving in a rock quarry in 52 degree water.  Do you have your diving planned out yet?  If not, I would highly recommend Greg & Terri Merren's place: Parrott's Landing on Grand Cayman 800-448-0428.  I am sure Greg can help you find the Cubans you are looking for while you are there.  Did you see the story in Dive Training about the cruise ship that came unanchored during a storm & trashed one of the reefs?  It's a pretty good article.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Brent, believe it or not the diving isn't that great in San Diego either.  Normally, average visibility is 15' at best.  We have to go boat diving to get anything good and the water, even in summer rarely gets to 70 degrees.  Thanks for the dive tip.  We used Bob Soto's last time and they were super.  Since we don't have anyone special lined up we will definitely give your recommendation a look see AND ask about the cigars.  We figured we'd hang around the Hyatt and see if anyone, possibly the concierge (sp?) might recommend somewhere.  By the way we're not staying there.  I hadn't heard about the ship, what a shame.  If we score I'll smoke one for you!  Thanks.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>In my opinion, they're fine, but nothing special.  I've had
several.  They're a typical good medium-to-full-flavored 
Dominican cigar.  A few months ago, somebody started a 
thread on this very subject; that thread has since been 
deleted.  Many people expressed indignation that General 
Cigar would make and market a non-Cuban cigar named 
"Cohiba", although no one in the thread objected to a 
Dominican Partagas or H. Upmann or a Honduran Punch. 
They're mainly sold through Alfred Dunhill.  Brent,
you can call their catalog number if you want to a buy a
box.   I never liked them enough to keep any, so I can't 
trade you.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I don't understand what would make someone say that a 
Dominican Cohiba "sucks" It's a great smoke, with a great 
name behind it.
The only sad thing is that they no longer ship them with 
that great looking ring on them. I don't know why, other 
than it's some kind of legal problem. But they're good..
can't find enough of them!

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I have yet to see any of these Dominican Cohibas.  I smoked
some Cuban Cohibas while in Mexico, and my wife and I are
thinking of spending a week in Puerto Vallarta as that the
Cuban Cohiba is her favorite cigar (in addition to the nice
weather, the cheap tequila, and the great food!).  As far 
as Dominican Cohibas....lemme say that the DR produces 
some fine cigars, and if GC has the gonads to market a 
Dominican Cohiba then I'd expect it to be as good as an 
H. Upmann.</B><P>

These ARE fine cigars. I picked up a box of these a couple of weeks ago
and have had only 3. I've given or traded more than that. If I ever get
the chance to stock up on these babes I will. Robustos are great, especially

them in a couple of days from my order. I have had success lately with

<B>I tried one of these last week.  I didn't think it had much flavor or body.
Did I perhaps get a "bad" one, or was it because I had smoked a Pleiades before it?

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Michael, nice to see you around. Was that the Pleiades I sent? It may have been your taste was thrown off by smoking the Pleiades too close to the Chateau. I seldom smoke two top notch cigars within less than three hours. I always find the second one is wasted.  </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>MP, my husband loves Robustos- especially the Chateau- except trying to take that cedar and green ribbon off! He also likes the Don Tomas Special Edition 300 and the Astral Robusto. I've never been crazy about any of these- but if you liked the Chateau, you may try them.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Gotta agree with the majority, the Chateau Fuentes are a great smoke, both the natural and the maduro but I definitely prefer the natural wrapper.  Anyone else feel the same way about the natural -vs- the maduro?</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Yes I do.  I usually perfer the maduro wrapper on Canones, 
Churchills, 8-5-8, but on the Chateaus I like the natural. 
Hey Mp read you EMAIL, would ya?;>

<B>After fruitless search for some favorite smokes I went to my local  tobacconist and picked up six new smokes to try. Two were from Mexico and to my suprise were quite good [IMHO]. The first was a MATACAN the second a TE-AMO.I am beginning to think that half the pleasure of fine cigar smoking is the suprises we find in our search for the "CIGAR OF OUR DREAMS". And dont sell our  Mexican neighbors short as fine cigar makers even if their not as PRICEY as the hard to get primos! </B><P>

<B>Agree with you...cannot wait to go back to Ixtapa next month
and taste some Mexican cigars. I do find Te-Amo a bit rough
though but each one's taste is different. Te-Amo would probably
be great with a good bottle of Cote-Rotie or Cote-du-Rhone wine.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>You're the only two guys I have seen have anything good to
say about Te-Amo's.  I haven't liked those that I tried.
I have had one Matacan which was decent.  I have one more
Matacan and once I smoke that I'll weigh in with my opinion
on the Matacan thread here.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I can say that I have enjoyed TE-AMO maduros.  They are'nt as pricey as some of the others and pretty easy to get.  I think that a lot of people wont give them a shot because they are from mexico and not as costly.  Oh well thats fine with me.

<B>Lately, I have noticed stains/markings ( a charedlGray/black color ) that appear in my humidors. They appeared after I refilled my credos with distilled water. I believe the stains were caused by small amounts of distilled water that has dripped out of the credo. I have on occasion rubbed down the cedar with distilled water to cure it. I have never experieced any difficulty when I do this. Why are the stains developing and short of sanding down the cedar, what can I do to remove them ? They are noy very pleasing to look at...

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I have noticed the same thing in one of my humidprs around
the area of the Credo. I have remedied this problem by shaking
the Credo before putting it back in place to remove excess
water. A good test is to hold the Credo ( or whatever) upright
before replacing it and see if drops of water collect at the
base of the mesh. If so, shake it (minimally) until all of
the water is retained in the unit.</B><P>

<B>The January, 1997 issue of TODAY'S COLLECTOR has a 2-page article titled "collecting cigar bands and labels".  It didn't have a lot of information -- not much of anything on current prices.  But $1.00 each for antique Cuban's doesn't sound bad.  Best though, to just collect something like that if you like the things.  Forget the investment potential.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Mr. Joe Davisson, author of "The Art of the Cigar Label", owns a company just outside of Cleveland called Aaron Industries (I'm going from memory)that deals in all types of antique papers, but especially antique cigar bands and labels. He has a wealth of knowledge and can probably give you the names of a few other collectors. In Cleveland I know of one avid collector, a Mr. Bocci, who I believe lives in South Euclid.</B><P>

<B>I've been smoking cigars for fifteen years and I don't see the reason for all the homage for the Fuente cigars. I find them to be aveage. The Hemingways are no different from the regular cigars except for the price. The Opus are good but not worth the money. </B><P>

<B>			slim,, i guess the answer is different smokes for different folks.  fuente's are my favorite brand of cigar to smoke.  the hemingways are my all time favorite.  i have six opus x in my humidor and have never smoked one, so i can't reply on them.  my guess is that they are as good or better than the hemingways.  but it all comes down to what you like to smoke.</B><P>

So what does it have to do with reading CA? Matt said it right, it's personal taste. The Fuentes are twice or three times the cigar of most other cigars at the same price.

<H2>Bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey</H2>

<P><B>I figured what with the beer and port appreciation threads, how about
one concerning the unique bourbon and Tennesse sour mash whiskeys of America.
Feel free to share any new combos or rave about your particular brand of
choice. Among bourbons I like Jim Beam, Wild Turkey, Booker's, Basil Hayden's
and Old Crow. AS for Tennessee whiskeys, I like both George Dickel and
Jack Daiels. Here's a potent one: Liquid Cocaine. Take one part each of
bourbon, amaretto, vodka, and Canadian whiskey, and fill remaining space
in glass with half pineapple juice, half cranberry. And remember, you're
NOT driving tonight, hear?</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Hello Crusader: Let me just say that there is
nothing finer than a good Maker's Mark (from Loretto, Kentucky) combined
with a good Hoyo de Monterrey Exc. or Punch Gran Cru or Don Tomas (from
the fields of Honduras). I think that good bourbon complements and refines
the taste of smooth (but flavorful) tobacco. All the best to you!!!</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Although I keep a bottle of Jack Daniels around
for a semi-annual shot, I tend to favor tequila as the spirit of choice.
I'm bringing a bottle of Wild Turkey with me to Japan, the favorite of
a friend of mine over there. If he opens the bottle, I'll let you know
how it goes with an H de M.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Let me tell you. I am laying down the definitive
word on what bourbon goes with a good cigar. It is call MAKERS MARK and
it is fantastic. I am drinking one right now. If you haven't tried it with
your smoke yet, you are in for a wonderful surprise.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Being from TN, I know how to appriciate whiskey.
Let me tell you something, instead of whiskey, try a little Captain Morgan
Spiced Rum (or any other decent rum) with a good smoke. It will give you
a whole new outlook on life.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I also like rum, coincidentally. But I find that
instead of buying spiced rum, I prefer unflavored rums so I can mix and
match myself. Try Mt. Gay from Barbados- very earthy, smoky, full flavored.
A bit costlier than Morgan's, but you'll probably like it.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Richard: Knob Creek is excellent whiskey. In New
Orleans, Knob Creek is about $20 per fifth. I am sure it is more expensive
elsewhere, but it is my favorite single barrel and would probably be worth
$30 per fifth. Give it a try. It goes well with any good cigar.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I share space with the residents of Louisville,
KY. Makers Mark is certainly a fine sipping whiskey...but Blantons is the
royals delicacy. So smooth is the taste that you'll find yourself both
loving it and broke at the same time. I keep a secret stash in my woodshop
for that day when Cuba and I meet again...for a long smooth draw. Try some
Blantons, you wont regret it. Too, I like some Red Herring, Pinch, a nice
port, a good home made beer, and the company of some of my o'le pals and
their cigar stories, told until the wee hours of the morning, while sitting
on the patio with my wife delivering coffee and cakes as we hide our drinks
like little kids. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Crusader, I recently traveled to Puerto Rico and
Venezuela. I found the Bacardi Special Rum to my liking and from South
America I discovered Cacique Rum. It gives some of the US brands a run
for their money. I do not find rum to my palette while burning a fine one
as I might a good Hennesseys 5Star. But that rum warms my bones on that
patio now that it is getting cold out doors in the wee hours of the morning.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I have this drink I like to mix. I call it a Southern
Hospitality. 3 1/2 ounces of Southern Comfort, 1 3/4 ounces of Crown Royal,
a half ounce of Wild Turkey Rare Breed, and a splash coke. Drink one and
you're having fun, two and you don't know what to do, three and you look
like me, four you don't want anymore. Not for those with weak stomachs
or low tolerences.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>gupfish....Gosling's is a fine, smooth, dark Bermudian
rum that is greatly favored in the sail racing community. It has its own,
distinctive flavor and character, and comes in a variety of degrees of
sweetness and age. It is most often consumed with a non-alcoholic mixer
called Ginger Beer that is itself like a strong Ginger Ale. In that configuration
the drink is called a 'Dark and Stormy'. I can vouch for them and, in fact,
had a couple the night before last with a Mac Vintage Cab. on the porch
of a Palm Beach club after a race from Miami. Delightful combination of
a beautiful day on the water finished by a couple of rums and a good cigar.</B></P>

Take this only after a savory meal in which you have time to enjoy the smooth rich flavor of this remarkable "Love Fluid". Enjoy with a fine H.Upmanns or Macanudo and a beautiful human counterpart. Enjoy and be safe(in every way possible)!!</B><P>

Prices are are being fueled by every novice smoker, who doesn't care what he pays as long as he feels it makes him part of the nouveau chic. He buys the most expensive cigar he can find, smokes about a half inch of it and usually leaves it lie in the nearest ashtray. There ought to be a law against these guys!!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Garo, That is the most immaculate description I have heard, to date about the present cigar situation.  I'm a college student who unfortunately has been around cigars my whole life.  My mother is from Spain,and when we would travel she always returned with a bounty for my father before 1961.  Cigars are dear to me and I'm sad that this solitary art form of sorts has been reduced by the hoardes of Davidoff Grand Ecru smoking pogues that approach me when I am smoking...and assume that we are buddies now.  I like to have fun with them sometimes, especially when I know that they couldn't tell me one country of the cigars tobacco origin.  The best is when they repeat back the same bullshit that the tobacconist used to con them into spending $14.00 on a Montesino, ha! Happy smoking</B><P>

But I do feel somewhat bad for the guy next to me who is spending 6.00 for a 2.00 Henry Clay or 7.00 for a 3.00 Excalibur when I Know he is getting screwed. I understand supply and demand but my point is that in small towns like this one the customer base is only so big and the customers you have today are the ones your going to have tommorow. Well It just so happens I have a 5.00 Temple Hall that I paid 5.00 for that I,m going to smoke now.....Happy smoking Boy's</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I work at a local newspaper in the Northwest and we recently published a full page article entitled "Cigar Chic". What was so bad about it was they several quotes from various young urban types saying things like "any decent cigar is around $11 to $15 so if we go out for drinks and a couple cigars it is going to cost us $40 - $50 for the evening." What is so maddening about it is that the idiots are paying the 11 to 15 bucks for 2 to 6 dollar cigars. They have done zero research and most only pay the high prices because the bartender who happen to be "the resident cigar expert" told them they were the best around. There are three of us in the department I manage that are cigar smokers and couldn't believe what we were reading. Sorry about the long rambling post.

And the double whammy comes when the stupid yups have bought out our favorite smokes, even at those prices and they don't even know what they are getting! I'm about to say to hell with the elite brands and settle for a cheap, machine made but pleasant supermarket cigar until this craze settles out and these greedy merchants are swamped with inventory.

from the other shops I have visited they have the biggest
selection, but not always the lowest prices.  Can anyone familiar
with the area suggest another place to try.  I am familiar
with Signature, Georgetown Tobacco, and The Tinder Box.  I would appreciate
any suggestions, thank you.</B><P>

<B>Try JB Sims in bethesda and rockville. Shelly Woodroast in rockville has back room. Since I get most of my cigars when I take trips or mailorder I don't know the prices of either place. I do know signature shop have LGC for 10 or12 dollars which 125% markup.

<B>El Rey Del Mundo keeps producing a great cigar at a great price.
This gem is no exception. A friend bought me this thing and I loved every inch of it.
A very flavorful, yet mild cigar. Cost, about 4-5 dollars. If I didn't just purchase boxes of
L.G.C. "wavells" and "corona gordas" I would buy a box of these things. Oh!, yes I said boxes,
looks like progress is being made in the D.R. for L.G.C. I hated recieving my L.G.C.'s in bundles.
I had a many cigars with damaged foots.

<B>Walmart: If my memory banks are working properly, I believe that the Flor de Le Vonda was named after Lew Rothman's (JR Cigars) wife.  I smoked a box or so when they first came out a couple of years ago, but didn't really think they were great.  Has the blend or quality changed over time?  </B><P>

you have had these a few years ago. </B><P>

And by the way, El Credito didn't want to roll in the D.R. ,but they had to because of idiot's such as yourself who drive availability stratispherically high by buy...10 boxes because L.C.G. is the thing to have.  You are a nouveau chic clown, as far as I am concerned...that is obvious to the most casual of observers since your string hasn't been replyed to in weeks, go figure? By the way...I'm sure Ricardo Wavell will be pretty upset that you by "boxes" of his cigars...and don't even know who he is...most likely. Later fool, and i'm being nice.</B><P>

Have we met before, this must be so, because your words would never
reach my ears if we were face to face. Thanks for the trivia on the "wavell" I find
that folks nouveau to cigars love trivia. I have never bought 10 boxes, but wish I did
6 years ago when I smoked my first L.G.C. and boxes were $25. This is your lucky day Edouardo, you have caught me in
a fury of a mood. Today, from dawn to dusk nothing has gone right! Your jab at my character 
is the icing on the cake. I pray that the itt (international telephone and telegragh) of your E-mail
is correct. I have two friends that work for the Cal Comp. 
If luck is on my side--- expect a visit from me.
I am not kidding ( print this out )

<B>Mine was $20, and the exact size of a bic lighter.  The brand name is
Firebird or Firefox or something.  The flame of mine is blue at the bottom
and bright red at the top.  I'm not sure what this means, as far as heat and flame
ect., but it lights a cigar very well.</B><P>

went through 20 matches just to get an uneven burn. My Blazer,
sitting at home in my billiards/smoking room was greatly
missed. By the way, Morton's is very smoker friendly. When
I pulled out my cigar, an old sourpuss went up to the

<B>I usually only buy Fuente's, but the increased cost and availibilty have caused me to seek other stogies.  Are Havana Sunrises good.....specicically, I'm looking to see how they compare with Fuente's like the Double Chatau or Churchill.  It worries me that it is a domestic.  What is the Churchill like.  I'm looking for specifics on draw, flavor, and construction.  Are there other more popular brands it smokes like?  Please help, thanks!</B><P>

<B>Casino are the most cigar friendly place in the U.S.A. Plus they have free cigar for player. I told my host it become hard to find Hemingway, so he had box of classic and masterpiece sent to my room. He hand me three partgas #10 to smoke while I played blackjack. That 38 free cigars   just for saying some cigars are hard to get today. Also you can smoke cigar anywhere you want in the main casino, restaurant or bar ( No Smoking section is four table).What great long weekend of fun smoking, eating and drinking.

Can you give me more details on the Ceasar's Palace trip? Were you throwing down big bucks at the Black Jack table to get the Pit Boss (I assume thats what you mean by host) to take care of you like that? It sounds like I went to the wrong place.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>KBW is correct. I have recieved boxes of Hemingway "Masterpieces", "Signatures" and 
Reserva Don Carlos "robustos." On my last visit, I procured boxes of
Padron Anniversario "exclusivos" and the sought after "pyramids."
I must admit, I have developed a relationship with the concierge and
have a standing joke that my winnings reflect his selection of cigars.
On one quick stop, before going on to Tahoe, I was given a box of Simon Bolivar
"Corona gigantes." The key is honesty and a sincere desire to be friendly. 
Good conversation is a must, you are going to get nowhere discussing finger foods and
mailorder duck. Good Luck, remember these people see thousands of regulars. I got my
foot in the door by spotting the off-duty concierge and offering him a cigar and drink.  </B><P>

Coo-Gar where do you have luck finding a box.  if you could give me a name and number i would appreciate it.  i am from washington state.   does anyone else or Coo-Gar do you have any other recommendations for a good every day smoke and where can i get them.  i have a thompsons catalog.  anyone have recommendations from there?  thanks in advance for you help and sorry the post is so long.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Bill,
The Thompson's Dominican Handmades are a decent value for an
everyday inexpensive cigar.  I prefer the maduro.  They are 
pretty good but they taste a little rushed.  For the money 
they are a good value.  You get two grandee's which are 
8.5x52.  The flavor is pretty good but sometimes you can 
get a bad taste if you smoke it too far down.  But, at the
price and considering the large sizes of the cigars, when
they start to get bitter, put them out.  There is a lot of
enjoyment in the box of 10, at a reasonable price.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>This is TOP SECRET do not tell anyone about this contact except the contact himself ( Ernie ) at ( openweb.com/townesquare. )mention Mike from Montreal. and  see how easy it is, he has Cigars specialy Hoyo's try the Cuban Largo's for an every day smoke. To tell you the truth I Have a Boxes of Cuban Monte Cristo # 4's Romeo tubo # 2's and Punch Double corona's and still for the price and quality will still smoke Excaliburs or Hoyo's  everyday god brings they are very very good and resonably priced. try them and love them.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Baccarat is a cheap yet enjoyable smoke.  There churchill is 50x7 and a box of 25 is only $53.45 and the petit corona 42x5 1/2 goes for $38.00 for a box of 25.  I highly suggest trying a Churchill or Rothschild.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Bill,  When I told you about the Thompson's Dominican
Handmades above I forgot that the new catalog does not 
advertize the Dominican Handmade Sampler.  It is a 
collection of 10 cigars for $13.95 plus $3.95 for shipping.
They come in Maduro and Natural and you can buy two at a 
time.  In the sampler you get two Del Rio, Three Catalina,
three Seville and two Grandee.  When you order just tell 
them you want the sampler.  The sampler is a much cheaper 
way to go than buying the individual sizes. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Bill, with all those prior you're going to have a good 
selection to choose from.  Some that I keep for just a quick
everyday cigar recently are "Jose Benito."  I got them from
Holt's.  They are Dominican and REALLY inexpensive for what
I feel is a pretty good cigar.  I smoke a wide range from
Havanas to most Dominican and some from the Phillipines but
I'd recommend these for an "everyday" cigar.  Try it. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Bill,  Unfortunately I know my brain is leaking out my ear.
I wrote you a long discussion regarding Thompson's Dominican
handmade sampler.  Duh...I have two catalogs a Thompsons and
a Luis Martinez.  I got them mixed up.  I've never tried 
anything from Thompson's.  The Dominican Handmade sampler
I recommended was from Luis Martinez.  For the price you
get some good cigars.  You can order at 800 822-4427. Enjoy!

<B>I know I saw a thread about ONYX cigars but I can't find it.  I got a chance to buy a box of ONYX maduro (658 I think) for $77.  My local shop said they will have four boxes in tomorrow.  He also said he will not get another shipment in until mid '97.  He has offered a box to me but I must tell him by tomorrow (Friday) AM. Once they come in they are <fair game> for all.  He did not have any in for me to try so I need your help.  He claims they taste like Feuntes 8-5-8 maduros <<KIND OF>> Should I buy a box or is he trying to unload some overstocked dog rockets?

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>AT: Yes, I do like Maduro!  My favorites being A.F. Canones,
A.F. 858's, Partagas Maduro.  BTW I meant 650 not 658.  I just
picked up ten HdM Excal #1 for $3.75 each so the $3 each for 
the Onyx seems a little high.  Not sure though.  
Even if I don't like them maybe I can trade over the net
for something else.  Thanks for the input AT.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>You can't go wrong with the Onyx.  I bought a box of the 650's about a year ago and they were great.  Good consistant smoke.  The problem is that I have not even seen any Onyx's since then.  If you like maduros, buy them and enjoy.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The coolest thing about Onyx is the name.  Just for kicks, ask you tobacconist
the size and ring gauge of the 650.  I think that a 658 sounds pretty cool, too bad
they don't have one.  At $3.75 for the HdM Excalibur #1, I'd stock up on those, and leave
the Onyx alone.  I don't think that the Onyx is near as good.  Just my opinion.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I'd definetly agree with Drew.  If you can get the Exc. #1's for that price, do that instead.  You won't find them at that price for long.  The biggest Onyx is the 852, which is 8" by 52 ring gauge.    </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The Onyx 650 is a great maduro smoke. Here in Cleveland they are
as rare as hen's teeth. If you don't like them you should
have no problem unloading them. Enjoy.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Thanks for all the good advice. When I went to my local shop
today I got good news and bad news.  The bad news was he only
received one box of ONYX cigars and could not sell me the entire
box.  The good news was he did get FIVE boxes of HdM Excals #1.  Well having tried the Excals and knowing that they were a good smoke I bought a box for $70. 
I guess that was my Christmas present.  I will keep an eye open just encase the only boxes of ONYX shows up ;></B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>PaulM, I can't believe you've had the good fortune of having to choose between these two! The Onyx and Excal #1 are really two totally different cigars. The #1 is a double corona and the 650 is 6x50- a corona gorda, really. These are both really good. I think you'll like them both! And boxes for under $80?! I'm jealous.. Enjoy!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>She~ra, I was able to pick up only five of the ONYX 650 due
to his lower then expected shipment.  I lit one up and was
not too impressed.  I found it very wet and young tasting. 
They came right out of a fresh box and no doubt need some 
time to sit in my humidor.  I was able to taste it's potential
behind the moist flavor and will place the other four in my
humidor to stablize some.  The excal #1 was ripe and smoked like
a dream.  A two hour dream:>  Don't be jealous, I've been a very 
good boy this year ;>  Happy Hollidays!!

<B>Anyone who has ever read a cigar magazine or other publication has come across the numerous words
used to describe a cigar.  Just for fun, I'd like to know your favorite word(s), both for their attraction to 
your taste buds and also to your sense of humor.  Also, what are your least favorite, repulsive descriptions.  As an example, I tend to prefer cigars that are spicy, and cigars
that are chocolatey (though not necessarily together).  I've seen the word 'Vegetal' used, which for some reason I find both
repulsive and sort of funny.  What about you?</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by drew at January 15, 1997<p></FONT></TT>

<form method=POST action="Favoritewordtodescribeacigar.pl">
<B>"Spicy" appeals to me, as does allusions to "deep" "rich" smoke.  I have yet to taste a hint of nutmeg or cinammon on a cigar, although I suppose it's there.  I prefer ambiguous descriptions such as "creamy" or "flavorful", to the "subtle nuance of Caladonia white pepper, infused with the denatured oil from the pineal gland of Peruvian sheep embryos."</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Drew, as long as you're getting paid, don't complain to loud.  And remember this later in the year when you are super-swamped!  I agree with BobbyK, I prefer vague terms like creamy and rich.  Drew:  that word you dislike "vegetal"  is that referring to the taste being like a vegetable?  I've noticied that some cigars have a very distinct organic, soil-like smell (the smell you get when you walk into Sevenanda) I wonder if this is what is meant.    </B><P>

It's a shame that people have actually deceived themselves into believing

tooth fairy, n'est-ce pas? The same holds true for fine California
wines, which are plentiful in my home of Monterey. Try as I may,
I still can't taste the "hints of cantaloupe and strawberries"

we'd have "subtle nuances of Kentuckian wild cherry".</B><P>

<B>We all like to smoke while being entertained in some way, at least some of the time. 
Here's to the grand master of daytime talk, often imitated,
revered by legions of devotees, but never duplicated. His show is
a microcosm of everything that is good in the world, blending
caring, emotional moments, crazed rednecks, hilariously
dysfunctional mutants, creative solutions, and warm, nostalgic
moments. The combination of the fleeting joys of a fine cigar and the wit and wisdom of
Gordon Elliot makes for an insightful, almost
religious experience. Share your comments here.</B><P>

<B>What are the regulations (how many, from where,ect..)on bringing Cuban Cigars into the U.S. from another country. I have family in Buffalo, NY (2hrs from Toronto) and alot of friends in the military. I don't want to get anybody in trouble so if somebody would please let me know the regs. I'd appreciate it!  </B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Although the law is clear on the punishments available to offenders trying to import cubans, it is rarely if ever enforced. I was caught trying to enter miami via amsterdam with a box of cohiba robusto's and they didn't even mention any punishments. They did however make me break each and every one of them in half right in front of them. I almost died at that mament. Needless to say I probab;y would have done that anyway because for all I know some stinking customs agent could have just taken them home and anjoyed my $500 investment. Unless your caught with thousands the chance of severe punishment is very unlikely. (as if that wasn't punishment enough)</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I also read today in the Dallas Business Journal that the idea of bringing or mailing Cubans to the U.S. without the bands, and mailing the bands separately is illegal as well. Something about each cigar must have an band to identify origin.. Never had heard this before. But I have heard of customs destroying them, but no fines assessed. You're right though, Tee.. That's punishment enough!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Bills Fan...There are lots of people sneaking cigars across Peace Bridge.  Along with tons of confiscated cigars.  If you fail to declare but are caught...they will ask for a receipt to check upon the items purchased.  That is where the fun starts.  Buy bundles? Buy the others on separate receipts? Pray your ass is not caught? Swap bands? I'm sure that there are over a million tricks.  Getting stopped at the Peace Bridge is embarrassing.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>At the San Ysidro border crossing (coming from Tijuana) you
now must place your bags and packages onto a conveyor belt
which runs them thru a screening device much like that used
at airports, if you are walking across the border.  I know 
someone who was caught bringing back some Cubans when he 
flew into Dallas; they broke the cigars in front of him, 
and made him sign some piece of paper where he admitted 
smuggling in some Cuban cigars.  Getting back to that X-ray
screener; I'm not sure how new that is, my last visit to TJ
was in '93 and I don't remember seeing that before.  Also, 
it helps to cross when the lines are long as that it 
lessens the chances of you being the one who is more 
thoroughly searched.  </B><P>

I had 5 Romeo Y Julieta #1's for the holidays, a friend brought them back from Jamacia in her suitcase, she didn't know and they didn'e say anything. Just wanted to make sure as I thought you could bring back a few for personal use. Allready thought of the band and tube switching and you're right, where there'a will, there's a way.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>he's a full proof method of getting cubans into the US.  Take a box of cigars (or empty the box) of honduran or domican cigars with you on your trip.  While there, take some saved labels with you in the box.  Buy the Cubans, take the wrappers off, put the old wrappers over the cubans and put them in your honduran or dominican box.  Then they cannot prove they are cubans!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Bills, everyone has given you good advice.  You didn't mention where you live but going by the handle of Bills you may be close to the border.  If so, Toronto has several shops where you can sit down and smoke the real thing.  Niagra On The Lake as well.  Just a thought.</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by AL at  on Friday, January 03 at 04:14 PM EST<p></FONT></TT>
<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>One more idea for ya Bills.  Foreign folks working here in the US can I'm told, legally have Cuban cigars sent to them.  I've never seen this in writing so don't know if it is really so.  However, while working for a company that was headquartered in Germany, many of their employees on assignment in the US smoked cigars and predominatly Cubans.  The ones I knew had a regular supply sent to them.  So if you know someone in this situaltion you may toss some hints their way.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Here's one thing you could do that I forgot to mention but that may not seem too appealing. When I was caught at the border as I had mentioned I was needless to say desperate. While enquiring whether or not there was some way i could bring them in by paying or whatever, they did say that there was one way. In exchange for allowing you to bring in the cigars they would afix a special marker to your passport and passport file so that whenever you enter or leave this or any other country it would be recognized and that you would be searched every time. It would signify that you had been caught importing illegal goods in the past or something along those lines. This is not much of an alternativge though, at least not for me.</B><P>

<B>While looking through a local antique shop I spotted a old humidor.It's rather small, looks to be walnut, has a nice brass keylock, and is about 12" x 7" x 4".  Inside is lined with tin or copper which someone painted silver ( why, I have no idea.)The inside lid has a piece of metal with holes punched in it for ventilation and what appears to be a piece of cardboard which seems to be a crude humidification device. My two questions are is this an antique humidor or some homemade junk and should I line the inside with cedar from cigar boxes or use it as is with silver painted tin and all? It doesn't seem to have any odors from the paint and it holds a constant 70% as it is.

<B>Paul..........You know....Form is one thing....function
is another. If the blasted device works....it is functional.
But c'mon, yes c'mon....would you feel proud to offer your
friend a cigar from the ugly, oddly designed box? Look...
humidors are by definition lined with wood....silver painted
metal. ....  .. ... ..    . You have a "jerry rig."
Use it...but I would loose it....at least until I could replace it</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>PaulM, I would be very cautious about the paint. Most likely you
have found an antique humidor. Every weekend I go to consignment and antique
stores in search of the perfect cabinet humidor. I have seen dozens of the one
you are describing but never have seen one in which the copper has been painted over.
If I were you I would line the inside with Spanish cedar. The humidification
device you describe is typical of these boxes. You might want to buy a credo to replace the 
existing device. PaulM, you never know who owned that box before you? They may have used it for
a jewelery box and painted over the copper. Try scratching at the pain with your
finger to see if the paint peels away. If it does, I would remove all of the paint.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I have several antique humidores and have found a lot of interesting ones in the antique shops.  Cedar liners aren't as common as you'd think. Two of the ones that I have purchased have a piece of marble in the bottum that sits inside a metal pan,  then there is a wire grille that rests above it where you put the cigars.  One of my favorites is a round humidore that is made of something that looks like cedar with a ceramic disk in the lid for a humidifier.  The cigars stand up in this one.  None of these work very well compared to the ones you would buy today.  The one you have found may not give you very good storage results.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>While walking thru a flea market outside of Buffalo, I found a wooden box in great shape. No one could tell me the type of wood, but it had a perfect silver latch in the front and on the inside was cedar on the sides, but the top and bottom had a piece of white porcelin covering the entire area. No one can tell me for sure if this is an old humidor. Anyone know for sure and about when it was likely made. Thanks.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Agreed, the silver painted interior does make me wonder.  I tried to remove the paint but it doesn't come off easily.  I've lined the bottom and sides with cedar and it seems ok.  I might use it to store some lower end cigars and see how they age in there.  I do know that I have been able to maintain 70%/70% +/-  2% without much effort. All my antique store hunting has just paid off.  I found one antique shop that had about five or six BRAND NEW Reed & Barton humidors of different sizes.  They were all in their original box and had instructions how to prep them from Diamond Crown.  I picked up the largest one they had, it's called "The Concorde".  It retails for $475 at local shops. It didn't come with a credo or gauge but what the heck it only cost $125.  What a deal!!!  I'll still look for antique humidors because I really do enjoy browsing but I LOVE this new 'dor :> </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Saturday (11/16/96) found an old Dunhill!  Oak with glass on
the inside bottom and top.  Key lock but the key was missing.
The humidification device was also gone but it is in beautiful
condition.  Put in a Credo and hygrometer plus my stock of
Montecristos AND I love it.  I will go "treasure hunting" 
more frequently based on what I've read above.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Just found another one today!!  It's about 12 x 6 x 8 and made of Walnut with inlay.  It's lined with spanish cedar and has a metal strip with paper which you soak with 50/50 mix.  It's a little scratched but nothing too bad.  It was advertised as "Walnut inlay box"  but it's clearly a humidor.  Not bad for $25. Not as pretty as the Reed & Barton but it's not bad looking at all.  I think I'm hooked:>
As far as places try flee markets, junk shops, and yard sales.  </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>congrats Paul M on your recent find.. an R&B Diamond Crown Concorde is superb. I have inherited an older walnut humidor ( 10 3/4 x 7 1/2 x 4) from Decatur Industries DECO and i've been having a tough time keeping % near or at 70%. Im running a Credo Rondo and the orig clay strip. What gives? it seems to have a tight seal. should i  a. retool the interior b. put in a CREDO 70 or c. scrap it?  any help would be appreciative Thanks

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>About two years ago I restored a humidor I found in an 
antique shop. Unless the  box has some great antique value
I would look at it as a starting point. Update it with a
Credo and use the best lining material you can get your 
hands on. My antique is now beautiful in an old way but 
modern in its function. Also, before spending the time and
effort, take an honest look at it and decide if it is 
worth it. The beautiful mahogony that mine was constructed
from made it worth it. Sometimes a sow's ear never becomes a 
silk purse.

humidor. It will be able to hold up to 75 cigars. It is made of oak and is very heavy.
I got some Spanish cedar sheets free from my tobacconist and the box is ready
to do its job! Oh! my humidifier is a tape cassette with oasis foam. wondering how
much this humidor cost me? how about $20.00! That's right, tell me I'm not a happy

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>You guys are really uptight over this humidore thing. I like old humidores and had two antique humidores that I picked up over the years. Both are lined with milk glass and one has a porous clay lining in the top. I gave one to my son who put a credo and a electronic humidity indicator in his while I kept the one with the clay top. The clay top was to put water onto to allow for humidification, this works but tends to over humidify. My "Credo" is a baby food jar with a chunk of wet oasis stuck in it and wetted with a soulution of 50% PG and tap water. I bought a chunk of oasis the size of a large brick at the florist supply place for 80 cents and cut a chunk off about 1" X 1" X 2 1/2" and stuck into the baby food jar, works fine. I don't bother with the distilled water because this "Credo" costs me about 10 cents to make. My pharmacist gave me 4 ounces of PG just for asking (nice guy). As to antique humidores, The metal or glass lining was just for keeping moisture in the box. The strip of cardboard was for 
dampening with water to keep the humidity up. These systems worked, and nobody worried to much about ruining their cigars, but of course they wern't paying $15. for an Opus X. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Christian, first wipe down the sides with distilled water and try using a sponge and some 50/50.  If after two days the humidor doesn't get stay within 70% +/- 3% you might have a crack somewhere.  The humidor I found (see above post) is a DECO also.  It has no trouble holding the correct RH.  Give it another shot then it might be time to look for another.  I agree that it is best to take your time and shop around.  Both HAPPY Walmart and Bruce both have made what seems like very functional humidors without spending a lot of money.  While an EXACT 70%RH is not critical it is desired. Bruce makes a good point. </B><P>

At least that's what it looked like, upon opening I discovered a pleasent surprise, the lid of the humidifier reads RUMIDOR, N.Y.,N.Y. pat.# 1.704.908 and is complete with decayed sponge and 2 terra cotta plates. Twisting the lid exposes 6 large holes depending on the amount of turn.  Any further info. or suggestions would be appreciated.  </B><P>

<B>We just knew (actually wrote down) the exact sizes, band descriptions, etc.

Also, in Mexico, women don't hold as much consumer power.. So I felt like they were checking out my backside instead of showing me cigars. I even walked out of one shop and refused to deal with them. I can't imagine alot of them are genuine. I did buy 2 Cohiba V that matched the correct size and the bands looks clean, and they wre delicious! (But I'll never be sure!) Good luck!</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>SR I doubt they were checking out your backside but if the thought
pleases you, so be it. The key in Cuban fakes is the tobacco. It is fairly
easy to determine a fake by inspecting the cigar. The only problem is when
the fake is made with Cuban tobacco.If this is the case, then One must inspect the foot and construction
of the cigar. </B><P>

<B>I first tried a Baccarat Luchadore a few months back, and
liked it.  The wrapper was dipped in gum, giving it a sweet
taste and it was a decent smoke.  They were also inexpensive
relative to the other brands.  I've picked up a few more and
liked them as well.  I even took a box of #1s with me to 
Japan (partly because it was the only brand I could find in
a box at that time).  Most were decent smokes.  Now I'm
fixing to leave for Japan again, and as the departure date
approaches I feel the need to get a box of something that 
I would enjoy.  Well the tobacconist I'm frequenting got some
more of them in, and being the cautious guy that I am, I
bought a Luchadore, two Rothschilds, and a #1 (all of them
Baccarats) to smoke before investing in another box.  I've 
since had the Luchadore and the #1, and these Baccarats are 
not as good as the ones I've had in the past!  I don't know 
if the Baccarat factory is rushing things, or if I should 
pop for a box of something else.  Is consistency too much 
to ask for these days?     </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Yeah, I've asked about it before, and one gentleman told me
of a shop at the Sunshine Bldg in Tokyo.  I'll have five
days in Tokyo if the current schedule holds, but we don't
get much time to play tourist.  Typically we stay at the
Imperial Hotel which is next to the Ginza when we stay in
Tokyo, so I'll look around there.  I find it helps to 
bring a box on these long trips, and I think I'll get a 
box of Upmanns.  What made the Baccarats attractive was 
their price, and their being a decent smoke, but after 
those last few Baccs I'd rather buy a bundle of Matacans.
And that one Matacan I had wasn't bad either.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Joseph- I have smoked a considerable number of Baccarat Polos.
Some of them are very good, while out of the same box others are
terrible. These smokes are very inconsistent and as such in
my book are a risky purchase by the box.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I have smoked approx. 40-50 Baccarats since July.  I found inconsistency in the No.1's and Churchill's, but the Rothschild's have all been consistently good with an easy draw.  During this same period of time I have tried some other cigars, and have now switched over to Double Happiness Raptures (thanks Pauly) and Partagas No.1's (thanks Drew and Obnoxio).  I will always keep some Baccarat Rothschilds around for friends new to smoking...</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Joseph, yes I've tried the Luchadores.  The fun thing about the Baccarats was that they were inexpensive and available in many sizes.  I tried them all except for the Polo and the Platinum.  After trying all of the other sizes, I found the 5x50 Rothschilds was the smoothest draw.  I also experimented with cutting the heads.  At first I tried a straight guillotine cut.  Then I tried a punch.  Then I tried the modified guillotine (rotate cigar against blade).  So far I like the punch best.  I couldn't get a clean cut using the modified guillotine (at the very end of the rotation, the cut wasn't completely aligned).  I am planning on trying a piercer soon.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Well I smoked one of the Bacc Rothschilds last night.  After
two and a half inches I chucked it.  I know what you mean
about them being inexpensive and available, and I'm 
beginning to think it's because they're not as good as
the other brands.  My first impression of these is that one
time these would have been good for everyday smokes, but 
I won't be bringing any with me when I leave next week. </B><P>

<H2>University of TEXAS = BIG 12 Champions </H2>

<P><B>Although I went to Texas A&amp;M, I grew up in Austin. There is a
part of me that cannot help but be happy that the University of Texas has
won the Championship of the Big 12 Conference, and it's only their first
year in the conference. Obnoxio, what was it you said in that e-mail message?
Nebraska will get their chance again, but it will have to be next year.
I guess Nebraska wishes there was still a Southwest Conference. UT HAS
THE BIG 12 BRAGGING RIGHTS!!!!</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>MP, the sun shines on a moles ass every now and
then. I'm saying that is Texas were to play Nebraska again, say the best
two out of three, Nebraska would pull it off. Texas has lost to some lets
say less than desireable opponents this year. I don't believe they should
be the champions but they are and I congradulate them. I give credit when
credit is due and it is due. I would like to see a rematch of Texas and
my almermater Notre Dame. Before Lou resigned. That obviously had a tremendous
effect on the mental stability of the team. James Brown must feel like
a million dollars after his bold statement. He talked the talk and walked
the walk. SO unto you I say in humble fashion Hook'em Horns!!! </B></P>

of three&quot; in my letter wasn't a match between Nebraska and Texas!
It was between Texas and Notre Dame!!!!! See in the first meeting between
these two, ND won with a field goal in the final minutes. A lot of TU,
thats right Texas University, fans say it was luck or a fluke. I would
like to see them rematch. You would only need one more game. The Fighting
Irish would sweep the Horns. As for your sorry ass Aggies. I have nothing
to say except they keep inviting ND to the Cotton Bowl eventhough the Irish
kick there butts evertime. So next time you visit this thread read this
and my other post then read your retort and ask yourself &quot;Do I know
what i'm talking about??&quot; Thanks</B></P>

You check your post. And the next time you respond to me, please know what
the f*** you're talking about. All you have to do is read the second sentece
of your previous post. Where does it mention a two out of three with Notre
Dame? Thanks for the boost.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I think that would have been a mistake, Drew,
for two reasons. First of all, Duncan is a man who knows the value of a
good education, so he wants to complete his studies. Second, he has done
nothing but improved each of these last 3 seasons, and I think there's
room for one more year of improvement. If he went pro last year, he might
not have gotten the respect he deserves due to the multitude of other college
players who went pro. Now, he's going to be the top prospect in the upcoming
NBA draft, no question about it.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Well, you could say that about all college players.
I wish there were some rule keeping them in school all 4 years. If he values
an education, he can come back and finish it anytime. That extra year of
studying (if athletes even do that anymore) really doesn't mean anything
for his basketball career. Yes, his salary will be higher for waiting,
but if he gets hurt..... There will be great players coming out each year.
I would have grabbed the money last year. The odds that he gets hurt and
not drafted are small, but I wouldn't take that chance. To miss out on
millions would be heartbreaking.</B></P>

It is very similar to feeling I had when Oklahoma kicked your butt this

too much of my energy on it, though. The reason I don't, is that fanatics
seem to fills the ranks of the fans. I certainly get tired of just the
kind of responses you gave. First, you want a rematch, then you make grandiose

<B>I LIVE IN ALASKA WHERE WE USE A WOOD STOVE VERY OFTEN.  DURING THE DAYS WHEN WE ARE NOT IN THE HOUSE THE TEMPATURE RANGES BETWEEN 64 AND 68.  AS I UNDERSTAND IT I NEED TO HAVE HUMIDITY AT ABOUT 85%.  I HAVE A CREDO BUT IT WILL NOT GET THE HUMIDITY TO 85, ANY SUGGESTIONS, MAYBE USE TWO CREDOS?

<B>John I know how you feel. Here in the foothills outside of Palm
Springs it can get very cold in the winter. The thing is I love it, after 7 to 8 months
of temps. reaching 130, you can understand why! I keep my house as cold as 
possible in the winter, bust out the down and hit the hard stuff.
What I do is keep my humidors ( box type ) on a top shelf of a cabinent in a room
which recieves the most sun. If temps. drop too low I will throw a heating blanket
over them - (can you believe it). I have tried wrapping a sheep skin blanket over my
humidors but this will not work, at least It didn't for me.
I don't know your situation  but get those stogies next to something warm-
a fireplace, stove, heating lamp?. I would think that you have very dry
winters, so that second credo might be a good idea.

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>John, I have heard of people who store their humidors in a cabinet which they've put a small light bulb.  The heat from the light is enough to warm the temp.  If you're not electrically challenged, you could even hook up the bulb to a thermostat which could control the temp.  Some people worry the light might not be good for the cigars.  In that case, wrap a small amount of tinfoil around the bulb.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Joe, the moisture required to properly humidify cigars is "relative" to 70% at 70 deg. At 64 degrees, you need 86.12%RH to be relative to 70/70. Therefore, more heat / lower RH. There is a nice (better) explanation of this on Smokin' Joe's Site. Look for the link "Cigar Storage/Humidity Requirements". </B><P>

<B>..Arturo,...You are absolutely correct...We have no listings
for Puerto Rico and we definitely should....Perhaps you would 
be so kind as to make some recommendations for us and ask 
some other cigar affecionados on the island to do likewise.  
We would all be the wiser and it would give some of us 
another reason to visit your beautiful island while it's so cold
up north.  You can post your entries in the 'Add to our cigar 
friendly database' section.  Just use the 'State' field for Puerto 
Rico (I know, I know)..and the entry will go into the database OK.
I will make sure that a 'Country' field is added to the new database.
...Thanks for your suggestion....and welcome to the site.</B><P>

<B>I have been looking for alternatives to my favorite full-body cigars: Esplndido Cohibas and Montecristo #2.  I have been favorable impressed by RD Maduro Partagas and H Excaliburs. However, LGC Charlemagne and AF Hemingway Classics fell short of what I expected from them. I would appreciate any good leads in my search for perfect full-body cigars. Thanks.</B><P>

<B>Cohiba's and Monte #2's are a tough act to follow.  These are two world class cigars that have distinctive qualities.  I'll watch this thread and hope that you get some suggestions but if these are your top two smokes that suit your tastes, mine too, I don't think there are any substitutes.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Ram, you must be outside the US.  When you mentioned the Fuente I thought that you might be looking for a Dominican substitute for a Cuban.  I've had both a Bolivar and many Partagas' from Cuba.  I like the Partagas D4, its a Robusto and you may want to try one of these.  On my last trip to Toronto one shop had some Cuban seconds, I don't recall the label it was just printed up Spanish, the one I tried I couldn't finish because it was incredibly strong.  People were really buying them up though.  Rather than commercialize the thread, send me an e-mail and I'll give you the location of the shop, you may call them and get one sent to you for sampling.</B><P>

Also, the Padrons are pretty full bodied (both the regular line and the Aniversario line).

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Other than Cubans, the best smoking, full bodied, rich and complex in flavor cigars around, in my opinion and they're not easy to find either, are the Fuente Don Carlos Robusto, the Fuente Fuente Opus X Line. The No. 2 Robusto and the No. 5 Toro are great. The Padron Anniversario Series, 
are all great cigars, especially the Exclusivo (Robusto).      </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I believe that the 898 originated as a new way to package cigars. 3 rows in the box top row 8, middle row 9, and bottom row 8. This was different then the normal 13 top and 12 bottom boxes.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Here's another one for you:  At one end of a wedge-type cigar cutter is the cutting wedge, itself.  At the other end is a flat blade used for opening cigar boxes.  The flat blade has a little notch cut into it.  What is the notch used for???  You have twenty-five seconds.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Next Question:  This is an easy one, and you "experts" will get it immediately, but if a rookie reads it and learns something,
than we'll have helped someone.  When taking the cello off of a cigar, do you remove it A) like a roll of lifesavors, B) like a newspaper
from a rain protection bag, C) like a banana, D) by gently squeezing the cap of the cigar and shooting it out the end of the cello, or E) "You remove
the cello before you smoke it?"</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I've often wondered about this.  I usually unfold the foot and let it slide out that way.  If I'm cutting a cigar for a customer, I cut the top end of the cello with scissors and slip the head out, cut it, and slide it back in.  I've never had a problem with this method.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Drew, I light up with the cellophane on...saves on butane, and boy, you ought to see the ash.  But I only do this after I've run out of tequila shooters, which, by the bye, enhances the bouquet created by the burning cellophane. Also,  the melting cellophane keeps the cigar from sliding off the ash tray, although it is a little rough on the wrappers.  What do ya think, Drew. Do I win???

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I usually use the same technique as Feex, shooting the cigar

cello and shooting the cigar out head first. I was surprized

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Wait PaulM, where did you learn that you should peel it like a banana?
Peter wins, of course.  Ya'll have heard about the wrapper.  All good cigars have the filler, the binder, and the (cello) wrapper.  Well, the refers to
the cello, of course.  Connecticut Shade are most popular, and are produced by the wonderful
men and women at Dow Chemicals.  They revolutionalized the cooling process (hence the shade).  The people in
Camaroon are catching up too.  The Cubans don't seem to use much cello.  I think this may be part
of the reason they're so popular.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Drew, you must REALLY be taking it easy at work.  You're all over the board. (g)  I make a slit in the cello with a scissors, then peel it away.  Unless, of course I'm feeling lazy, then I squeeze the cigar out of the cello, carefully.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>8 hours a day of email and internet.  I have no work to do.  It's a good thing that I don't work for myself.
Well, back to my second multiple choice question.  I thought that the answer would be C) Peel it like a banana.  If you
tear, bite, or cut the foot end of the cello, and peel it like a banana, you'll soon hit the seem, and it will split as
easy as an over-ripe plantain (for you cuban food lovers).  This removes any possibility of damaging the wrapper.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>well, nameless one, you could remove the cello by soaking the whole cigar
in water, then blow the open end so hard that the cigar shoots out of the closed end.
I would have to say that this is definately a wrong way to do it.  But by your statement, you'd
say that this is correct.  Well, I disagree.  While there is an amount of subjectivity involved, there
are right and wrong ways to do it.  I, as do others, feel that the banana peeling technique is more right than
many other alternatives.</B><P>

The dominican republic and cuba don't even make the top 10, due to the extremely small size of
the countries.  USA is second, India is third.  These were values in 1994.  China produced
roughly three times the tobacco that the US did.  </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>John O was almost right on.  What you do, is this:  You reach into the breast pocket of your custom-tailored tuxedo and remove your $500 Dunhill gold-plated double guillotine cutter, and deftly cut the cigar in half, (never, ever  break a cigar in half, so proletarian, you know).  However, you must be exceedingly careful not to burn the crap out of yourself on the lighted coal.  You can perform this surgery, easily, because a fuente Canones is a generously crafted double corona and readily divides into two cigars. Then, you offer the exquisite lady her choice of cuts, buy her own snifter of 100 y.o. brandy, she invites you back to her luxury apartment for a nightcap and...well, you know.  IT COULD HAPPEN!!! Maybe not to me; after all, I've been married for thirty-two years, but, it could happen. Don't you think...huh?</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>BRRRT!!!  Wrong Answer!!! No Cohibas for you, my Bucko.  It was a trick question with an answer in two parts:  Part one:  He wears jockey shorts, not boxers.  And you would ask, "How did you come by this startling revelation, oh Great Seer of the Cigar Net," and my reply is reflected in part two of the answer:  Ask Hilary, Genifer Flowers, Paula Jones and/or the Arkansas Highway Patrol, not necessarily in that order.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Drew, none of the above.  It was named after Nathan Roth, a New York tobacconist, who, upon learning of the birth of his twin sons, Candela and Maduro, commissioned an obscure cigar maker in Vladivostok to create the cigar to commemorate the event...hence the name "Rothschilds", always spoken in the plural.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Peter, I almost lived your question about sharing the cigar last Saturday. Jazz bar, surrounded by 4 of my best girlfriends at the bar, smoking a Montesino Diplimatico, drinking Perrier-Jouet Flower bottle champagne.. And the similarities end there... First- an ugly goofball guy (he wanted the champagne & cigar!), next- a bragging businessman with his (yeah right)limo waiting outside (He can afford his own), last 2 really cute (maybe old enough to be) college freshmen.. Kept my stash of cigars for myself... Now if it had been one of you guys.. </B><P>

his fantasy will be illegal in California after Dec. 31, 
1997.  No bar will be able to permit smoking of anything
(other than perhaps medicinal marijuana) in this state.
It will be interesting to see how long this law lasts. 
Fortuantely cigar smoking at home is strongly encouraged 
by my wife, so I personally won't be inconvenienced very
much.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Actually, Drew was pretty close to being correct.  Physiologist have determined the a woman's olfactory system is more highly developed than that of a man.  Therefore women have the capacity to discern a broader and keener range of tastes and smells than men.

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Next one:  How did the cigar play a prominent role in Cuba's war of independence from Spain and who was the leader of the rebel movement. Hint: a cigar is named after him.</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by Peter at saitta@msn.com on Friday, January 17 at 05:56 PM EST<p></FONT></TT>
<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>If I recall correctly, the leader of the Cubans in their
war of independence was named Garcia.  American agents 
wished to get secret instructions to him and wrote the
instructions on the inside of a cigar wrapper.  At the
beginning of this century, a famous editorial appeared
entitled "A Message to Garcia".  One of the graduation
requirements from my high school when I was a student was
that everyone had to memorize "A Message to Garcia" and
recite it in public before all the teachers and students.
I have long since forgotten the content of "A Message to
Garcia".  Here's another question along these lines.  What
role did three cigars play at the battle of Antietam in
the Civil War? </B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>You almost got it Tim.  The Cuban revolutionary was Jose Marti, and the date and plan for the general uprising against the Spanish government was smuggled into Cuba wrapped in a cigar.  A line of cigars, carried by JR's is named after him. As far as the battle of Antietem is concerned, one of the Confederate generals, either Longstreet or Jackson,  I can't remember which, had the Order of Battle for the Confederate forces in his cigar case.  He dropped it and it was recovered by two Union soldiers and as a result, the Union army knew the strength and disposition of Confederate forces before the battle.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Where did the term Lonsdale come from, and why?  A)  An aging Duke of Lonsdale (in Wales) wanted a smaller cigar for
his wife, who didn't like to smoke as much as he did,  B)  The president of an English bank, William Lonsdale, wanted a cigar size
that he could finish in his lunch hour, C)  An Austrian, the Earl of Lonsdale, liked a small ring gauge, but wanted a longer smoke
than a corona, D) A scottish soldier was knighted in 1811, Sir Lonsdale, and his epic heroism was embraced by the cigar smoking elite, who
named a size after him, or E)  Franky T. Lonsdale, Jr. a number-runner for the mob, was exiled from the country with 'Lucky' Luciano, and 
resurfaced in the Havana gambling scene, and laid some muscle on the cigar manufacturers to make a cigar in his name.</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by drew at  on Monday, January 20 at 11:42 AM EST<p></FONT></TT>
<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Drew, you can rule out "E".  Franky's real name was really Francisco Lonsadeli`.  He anglicized it when he immigrated to the US.  My Great Uncle Guido knew him well.  They use to knock over poorboxes together down at St. Giusepi's.  Actually, he disdained cigars. He rolled his own Bull Durhams and thought cigar smokers were sissys. Said as much to Al Capone, one time,  at my Great Aunt Filomena's wedding.  Dropped out of sight after that...Great Uncle Guido thought,  perhaps,  to the bottom of the East River.  Hope this narrows the research for you.  Ask me anything, particularly if you don't know the answer yourself.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Sorry that I've been away for so long.  Peter is right about
my Antietam question.  The other night, I read "A Message to
Garcia" for the first time in over 25 years.  Garcia was 
one of Marti's lieutenants.  It was a young American soldier
who brought the message into Cuba, despite great obstacles.
The point of the editorial was that successful men don't
let obstacles, no matter how great, stop them.  I now 
understand why a public recitation of it was a graduation
requirement.  As for Drew's question, C looks correct
except for one detail.  The Earl of Lonsdale was English,
I believe.

The Tobacco Loft on Peachtree has more of the "hard to get" cigars,
but the prices are a little higher and the owner doesn't know a thing
about cigars.  He's just in it for the money.  If you happen to go to
Lenox Square Mall, there is a Tinder Box that is okay as well.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The Cigar Merchant is in Alpharetta.  But, I doubt it will last until Spring.  It's very trendy and in a low traffic area.  I don't see how it can keep it's doors open.  Besides, the AVO is bought there ($8.) was dried out.  It felt ok to the touch, but it completely unraveled!  Unsmokable.  I agree with Drew about the Martini Club, great place, but bring your own stogie!  I like to go to Otto's in Buckhead.  Live jazz and cigars are welcome, but not overdone.  </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Hmm...I was semi-serious, yes.  Three friends and I were considering opening
a restaurant here in town.  If you've been in Atlanta a while, you know how
popular restaurants are.  Anyway, one of my friend's fathers is in the restaurant
business, and was going to help us.  We had most of the capital, but never really
got going.  One of the guys went off to business school last fall, and I'm going
myself in 1998.  I may go to Emory, in part because I love this city.  It's still an
interest of mine, and of my friends.  It seems like the places that can combine good quality,
moderately priced food with a cigar friendly bar do well.  What were your thoughts, Monte?  More
of a Tobacco Shop?  I assume that there is room for one here, as I see the trend continuing.  The tobacco
loft on Peachtree (in the publix shopping center in Buckhead) just opened and is doing well, from what I
can tell.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I was serious, but not finacialy serious.  I'm fresh out of med school (Emory)  where I got my degree to be a Physician Assistant.  Once I start recieving income I thought of opening strickly a cigar shop yet the idea of a restaurant/cigar bar is an interesting concept.  I live in Tucker (hell hole) and there is only one shop close to my place.  Up In Smoke is the name; the selection is lame.  The proprietor of this shop has impecable knowledge of cigars and the cigar buisness.  I always tell him of my idea and he gives me a little info. on the insides and outs of the cigar buisness.  When I first moved to Atlanta I was trying to find Davidoffs because I thought I was that kind of guy.  He told me were to get them then gave a an incredible deal on a box of Macanudo Duke Wellingtons so buy a box or two from him when I run low.  I used to own and run a coffe shop in Denton, Texas near U of North Texas.  It thrived enough to break even.  The reason I mention this is becouse I still own all of the equipment  and have thought of opening one here in ATL.  A coffee/cigar bar doesn't appear to be legitamate among cigar smokers.  Well all that seems down the road for now unless I can talk my parents into lending me the money to start it up which is highly unlikely.  They are both a couple of tight wads.  Well Drew in a word or two it is an interesting concept and if you ever start one up advertise it on this thread so I can check it out.  </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I have a friend who was going to open a new cigar store in Atlanta and went so far as to hire an architect and lease some space.  Unfortunately, he ran into a problem with stocking the shelves.  Ultimately, the store closed before it opened.  He told me that no cigar manufacturer or supplier of any recognition was opening any new accounts.  You may want to check into this if you are serious about the store.  

The second point to the person who originally posted the message -- the Cigar Merchant in Alpharetta is a fantastic place.  I discovered it when I moved here last year from DC.  The staff is knowlegeable, friendly and encourages you to try new smokes.  The shop has a couple of tv's, couches, coffee and chairs. It's a great place to catch a football/basketball game on weekends and forget about work for a while. In my opinion, I would rather shop at a locally run operation than a "chain" like the Tinder Box.  There is a appreciated difference.</B><P>

I went to Dawsonville to play a round of golf at Gold Creek Country Club while I was in town.  They were selling A.F. Canones for $12.00.

<H2>How many cigars are beyond 98 in CA Ranking?</H2>

<P><B>I was wondering how many cigars has surpassed the 98 ranking according
to Cigar Aficionado magazine. Anybody knows?</B></P>

<HR><FORM method=POST action="HowmanycigarsarebeyondinCARanking.pl"><B>The
lists I saw were in a huge book of CA rankings. I personally don't go by
them, as my tastes differ from some of those snobby people that rank the
cigars. But if I do agree that a cigar that they give a 90 will be better
than a cigar they give a 70. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION -- none. the highest
ranking I noticed was a 96, given to a pre-castro cuban. Other cubans fell
in the 90-94 range. The only non-cuban cigars I noticed with a ranking
above a 90 were the HdM Excalibur #1 (one of my favorites) and the frequently
mentioned Opus X that people here love. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Try the Licenciados Toro Natural It's a 6 x 50
CA ranking I think is 93. Great smoke for the money. about $90 per box</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The Cuban Hoyo de Monterrey Double Corona received
a 99 rating a few years ago. That's the only cigar that I recall with certainty
that received a 99. CA once did a rating of some pre-Castro/pre-embargo
Cubans where many high scores were assigned, but I don't recall if there
were any 99s. I do know there has not yet been a 100. I'll look at the
back issues when I go home tonight and see if there are any others.</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Hoyo de Monterey Double Corona was the only one
to score 99. But don't base your smoking experience on ratings. Use them
as a guide. You'll find that if you try smokes with an open mind, you will
be quite pleased to find out that you enjoy some that rate lower (80-90)
and not enjoy others that reached the high 90's. And NEVER judge a smoke
by it's price. </B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Tim is right about the Cuban H. De Mont. receiving
a &quot;99.&quot; In a later tasting, it received a &quot;96.&quot; I have
had about 5 or 6 of these recently and they are great. They are also approx.
$35-$40! I believe the Montecristo &quot;A&quot; received a &quot;96&quot;
once as well. Drew, good comment on the Marvin S. and co. driving up prices.
I have seen it happen to dozens of cigar brands and sizes. Often the prices
have doubled and tripled! You are best off if you find a cigar you like
for a few bucks and hope that Cigar Afic. doesn't find it before you can
stock up. -- MK </B></P>

<H2>The Official Site of The New World Order!</H2>

<P><B>I'm looking for a few good cigar smoking wrestling fans to take over
this site. We will be the New World Order of cigar smokers. We will toss
aside conventional wisdom and rip apart all those in our path. Our topics
will be limited to wrestling and smokes only. I will run a rumor section
from the world of wrestling and provide cigars reviews. Apply today, I'll
announce my gang in a later post. When applying, please tell me your favorite
smokes, wrestlers, matches and other general interests. Only the best will
be in the New World Order,,,,as bad as we wanna be!</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Um, you're wrong. If you want a wrestling thread
or two, that's fine. But if you want to decide who stays, who goes, or
who's allowed in your &quot;gang&quot;, you need your own web page. We
already have a webmaster and we're quiet happy with the job he's doing.</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>That's a cute idea, Nature Boy, but you have to
remember what will ultimately happen. We need to confine our wrestling
to one or two threads and discuss it reasonably in order to get respect.
If you just go into all of the non-wrestling threads and post slogans over
and over, try to destroy other threads, and try to make this an all-wrestling
page, we will very soon be driven out. I know this from experience because
earlier this year some infants tried to completely overrun the site by
posting nonstop &quot;NWO has taken over&quot; messages. They were undignified,
and were very quickly removed by the webmaster. YOu need to keep it all
in perspective and not try to take over. If you want legitimate all-wrestling
discussion, then establish a few maintained threads. But try to stay cool.
When you try to overrun a site like this, or introduce profanity, you disappear
within days, and it's to much work to keep reviving a thread only to have
it axed six hours later. I hope you will heed these words of wisdom.</B></P>

and the Vader rumors are a good indication of how the worm has turned.
I don't think Eric Bischoff is or ever was as dumb or as corrupt as his

now. (uh, is damn OK?)</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Badger - I think Bischoff is a smart man, I just
don't like his snobbish personality. If WCW gets Vader back, and manages
to sign Savage, it would be a big blow to the WWF. On the other hand, I
think the abundance of big name talent will become a problem when everyone
refuses to job. What do ya think?</B></P>

<P>
<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>You're right! Bischoff needs to get some kihone's
to go with his brains and not write any more &quot;no job&quot; contracts.
Then he should tell anybody that doesn't want to job that they won't be
wrestling. When the fellows rant about the tradition of wrestling I think
of guys like Flair and Savage who would go to any length to put on a show,
including putting the other guy over. I think EB missed an opportunity
to take his fed to the next level by resigning the Immoral Hack. Do you
think he could have gone back to WWF?</B></P>

of Kevin Nash? He is definatly clever and funny, but he seems to be hard
to get along with. I've heard several stories about him not wanting to
work with Hogan, Bischoff, the Giant, you name it. I also have read that
he is 38 years old, but he's listed as having just 6 years wrestling experience.
Where was he until age 32?</B></P>

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I just was struck with the greatest idea of my
career: Every member of the WCW, NWO included, will take on the ENTIRE
WWF in a Tournament of Warriors free-for-all. Tag-teaming, thre-way conflict,
as many sportsmen as either side wants in the ring at a time, you name
it. The event would be simulcast on both USA and TNT, and whichever organization
scored the most pins would take home the advertising or possibly pay-per-view
money. It would be huge, the greatest spectacle in history, putting Starcade
and World War Three to shame. No planning, no choreography- meaning the
WWF contingency would wake up to a rude surprise. The only stipulation
other than league rules would be that a WCW or WWF fighter could not attack
someone from his own series. With plenty of beer, and Ted Nugent providing
the music, this would be the eighth wonder of television.</B></P>

<B>I finally have some good back-up for my hate of the Horsemen's
Arn Anderson. After calling Hogan a coward, he forfeited a match
to none other than Jeff Jarrett after a minute in the ring, and was
beaten by Jarrett the week before. This man is an overweight,
no-talent, whining hypocrite.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Cuban Crusader, will you please grow-up or leave this site to
those with comments that won't offend anyone! You use this site
to just chit chat and rarely have advice on cigars! Please if you must remain
at this site keep it on your childish wrestling thread so the rest of us who
are more serious about cigars can have decent dialog.</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by Greggorio at  on Monday, December 16 at 01:01 AM EST<p></FONT></TT>
<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Greggorio- I was genuinely asking. I have a limited knowledge of French and
I understand that in certain parts of Quebec French is the main language in use
and I genuinely wanted to know in case I'm in the area so I
can brush up on my French skills. I am sorry if I offended your
sensibillities; I have a limited knowledge of Quebec and I really
wanted to know. There is no crime in that, now, is there. I was
planning on buying some of your coffees in recognition of your
reputation as a coffee purveyor but now I'm wondering slightly.
As for my wrestling thread, have I been known to dirupt your 
conversations to further pro-wrestling propoganda?
We are genuinely discussing the WCW in an adult and intelligent manner.
Some choose to mock the sport, but I ask you: Who is happier, the
passionate devotees of the WCW or those that criticize it for
no ostensible reason. If my wrestling enthusiasm was preventing
you from conducting discussions, you'd have cause for complaint.
But it isn't. You'll notice it was me that warned Nature Boy
to keep himself within bounds and not disrupt the sight. If you want
to become part of the order of cigar smoking wrestling fans through 
useful info-trading and intelligent discussion, you are welcome to.
If you don't, you are welcome to ignore the NWO thread. As for whether I
have advice on cigars, I do frequently. Check the newly created " Got woman, need cigar "
thread. I don't know as much as some of you longer-time smokers, true. But I do what I can and If
I know something helpful and neglect to share it, shame on me.
I hope you will read this and realize where I really stand, and understand that it was only through
carelessness that I offended anyone. I apologize for any grammatical or spelling mishaps.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I am not a GI Joe man myself. But if a fellow adult were,
I would respect that as his choice, as it doesn't hurt me, does it?
As for the coffee, I do not follow the reasoning that because
I like wrestling as well as cigars that makes me unqualified
to get a coffee sample. I have never to my knowledge insulted
your tastes in cigars whether I agree with them or not, nor
would I mind if you had a reasonable discussion group within
the thread index. For instance, I am not a fan of the University
of texas, but I don't begrudge their fans the right to create the
"Big 12 Champions" thread. If my wrestling thread, or more particularly
me, was going into other threads to encourage disrespect and nonsense, you would have every right
to call the NWO fans "Childish". But we, or at least I, don't, do we?
The NWO controversy earlier in the year was justified; it was obnoxious behaviour.
But I feel that even if you feel wrestling is childish, it is not diisrupting this site.
As for your comment about the GI Joe, I am saddened that after my
reasonable and respectful response, I am still addressed with such
disrespect. If that was the real Greggorio, which I hope it
 was not, then you too sunk to a childish level of taunting there.
I would appreciate it if you considered your hurtful comment
and apologized, as I would do for you. If you are not responsible,a rebuke would be nice to clarify who's whom.</B><P>

<B>On March 14, 1997, as part of a cruise itenerary, my wife and I will be in Santiago, Dominican Republic.  I would very much like to visit a cigar factory, see some rolling, ect. while we are there, (the day before SHE gets to go shopping in St. Thomas, so I should get something!)  Does anyone have any idea how I can make arrangements.. A trip to Fuentes!!!  WOW.  Any direction would be most appreciated.

<HR><!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Webmaster, tried a test post on both the beer

and refreshing the thread twice. This has happened on several other threads.
For example, on Cooking Ducks II. That's why I started Mail Order Mallards
so I could get a post up in response to one of Greggorio's questions. Frankly,
I'm baffled.</B></P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Jeff, all Hoyo De Monterrey "Excaliburs" have the words "limited
edition" on them. This is located on the right side of the band.
The band consists of the brown H.D.M crest with, gold writing/outlines and a creme
color bottom strip. In this strip are the words "Excalibur" and "limited editon."

bought the entire box.  I have several left in my humidor and like them very much.  I still haven't found
the Excalibur #3, which I hear is very good as well.  The #1 lasts for quite some time, so schedule accordingly.  </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I too have tried the #1- this is one helluva $4 stogie!  One of the best cigar values there is at this time.  It may not be quite as good as the more popular expensive cigars (i.e., Opus X, Padron 30th Anniv., etc.) but I would pay $4 for this cigar before paying $10-$20 for these others.  I've heard the Excal. line is not easy to find, but I've seen it around quite often in Indy.  Bet these bargain prices don't last long. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Anyone interested in splitting a box (20) of the Excals
#1 Maduros.  My local shop had some boxes left and I'm
thinking about going back and picking them one up.  I really
don't have the room for ten let alone twenty more LARGE cigars.
They cost a around $80 so it would be about $40 plus $3 
for three-day USPS shipping.

<H2>How typical of dominican cigars are Cuesta Reys?</H2>

<P><B>At the place where I live now cuban cigars are easier to get than
dominican ones. I recently tried a Cuesta Rey 1884 and I didn't like it...
it was too mild for my taste. I was planning to get some Signatures and
Diplomaticos. Now I have second thoughts. Are all dominican cigars so light
in flavor versus cuban ones? </B></P>

<B>Edger, I smoke alot of cuesta rey,s and would recommend you try the #95 maduro or the #1885 maduro it really makes a difference. The maduro wrapper gives it a sweeter and heavier bodied element. Also primo del rey is a good medium body smoke in the maduro wrapper and if you don't mind somthing a little more rustic try Henry Clay.</B><P>

<B>santa was good to me and put a copper lined antique humidor under the tree.  can anyone give me some goood info. about being able to store cigars in it (cedar lining, humidity device and what size or sizes).  it is funtional, but i want to make sure i do everything right.  thanks for you info in advance.  i hope santa was good to everyone else too.</B><P>

<form method=POST action="copperlinedantiquehumidorneedsuggestions.pl">
<B>i forgot to mention that the humidor itself is 12x12x12.  by the looks of the inside, it may be able to store 3-5 boxes of smokes.  my guess is i will need to put a couple of humistats in it.  if this is correct would 2 small round ones work or will i need 2 rectangle ones?</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Bill does your humidor have legs, if so my guess is that it is an antique
smoking stand from the early 1900's. My wife bought one several years before
we were married as part of her bedroom set and was using it for a nightstand!
Mine is coppered lined also, and depending on the size of the cigar boxes can 
hold three or four boxes of smokes. I have a couple of smaller spanish lined
cedar boxes with assorted smokes, plus a couple of unopened boxes. I currently
use a Credo 70 (large rectangle size) which seems to do the trick nicely. Does
humidor have a door or a lid that closes? If it has a door make sure that you 
leave yourself a little extra room around the hinge side with your boxes for a 
snug closure.</B><P>

<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>lb, thanks for the good info.  yes, my humidor does have legs and the person that sold it at the antique store told my wife that it was built in the early 1900's.  we may have the exact same humidor or real close.  mine has a door.  it appears that the credo 70 is the one for me to buy.  one other question, do you keep your cedar boxes with the lids open when in the humidor or do you keep them closed.  please e.mail me, i would be happy to hear from you and get this info.  thanks again for the info. and talk to you soon.</B><P>
<TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Posted by bill at fode@televar.com on Thursday, December 26 at 11:08 PM EST<p></FONT></TT>
<hr>
<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Bill, because I don't want to ruin the boxes by taking the lids off I keep them closed.
The alternative that I am working on is to build custom measured stackable trays, spanish
cedar lined with dividers. This way I can utilize the space more effectively and fit more
cigars in without the need for keeping them in their boxes. This also allows for easier and
more effective access to your smokes. There are tray plans for a humidor by Popular Mechanics
that you can probably use for a guidline if you want to go this route and have the proper tools
and a little know how. The measurements are not going to be the same, but it may save you a few
steps. After using the boxes it is a natural progression, and I wish I had thought of it way 
before I did so I could take advantage of all the wasted space of not having trays instead. Good
luck whichever way you go,and if my plans work I will email you the specs, maaterial list, etc.
as soon as I can get to it.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I have found the Arango Sportsman, in both natural and maduro wrappers, to be a very good smoke for the money.  I prefer the 200 size (about 42-44 ring gauge) over the 100 size (around 38-40 ring gauge).  I have found them for 60-69 cents each.  I don't smoke everyday, but if I did this would be my cigar of choice due to the low cost, and I would save the $5  stogies for the special occasions.  Arturo Fuente also makes a cheap line of cigars for around $1-$1.50 which are very good.  They supposedly burn faster and hotter but have the same tobacco as their more expensive cigars.  I found these to be very good smokes, too, especially for the cost.</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>Speaking of the Montesino Napolean Grande, is it a short filler or a hybrid (sandwich?)?.  It certainly tastes better than most short fillers, including the curly head (IMO) and yet it doesn't really burn or ash like a long filler.  What is it???</B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>I have been through about 60 different cigars over the last year and the Travis Club Senator or the Regalia(my favorite T.C.) is better IMHO, than many of the hand rolled, long filler cigars out there. I keep them right between my Partagas #2's and my Don Tomas S.E. 500's. At 65 cents for a Senator or 50 cents for a Regalia, you can't go wrong.

<B>I just ordered a bungle of La Gloria Cubana Churchills from the factory in Miami.  Why do they ship in a bungle??  In our local shop, they had a "box" of Churchills.  Do they ship boxes to the dealers and bungles to the rest??  Just wondered.  Are the bungles really "seconds"?  90$ seemed too good to be true.  My tobacconist sells them for 8$ a piece. Please, someone with knowledge help me.  Wal-Mart, you should know.</B><P>

<B>When I received their fax with prices for all their various cigars it indicated you could take a $5 discount for bundles instead of boxes. What do you prefer? I just ordered bundles and saved the money. I have plenty of unused boxes around and don't see the need for a $5 box as ordinary as theirs. The local shops have both bundles and boxes. </B><P>

<!-- ADDITIONS --><B>The bundles started to appear right about the same time C.A. gave a
high rating to the L.G.C. Hum? Many tobacconist here in Ca, have had the bundled L.G.C's. Dont worry, you're getting the real deal (not seconds) and
that is the real price, ---- makes you think about that $8.00? To give you an idea of price inflating,
a shop in Orange County was selling the Churchill for $12.00,--under the cigars was a sign stating " lowest price
in the area" ya right! Fuente, isn't that gal at El Credito hard to understand?

<H2>A Question for those who have ordered from JR Tobacco!</H2>

<P><B>I just got backordered on JR for some Signatures and Churchills.
The lady I spoke with said it would be about 4-6 months. Have any of you
had this experience? Will it take 4-6 months or a year. The people I spoke
to at Smokin Joes said that Fuente's took year or longer to get. Anyway,
if anyone else here has ordered Fuente's from JR, I'd love to hear your
experience. Thanks! </B></P>

from him has been the quickest service, and the cigars are not all dried
out. Have patience, those Hemingways are awfully popular.</B></P>

their recording to talk to an actual person. The lady took my name and
other information and said my name would not be on their ordering list
untill two weeks later. Two weeks to the day, I called back. I asked about
a box of Plieades Sirius' and was asked how I wanted them shipped. Two
days later I had the box of cigars. Problems? No problem. Just be patient

with several mail order houses. In fact I started a thread too on this

I had never tried. The Puros Indios its a Torpedo. Very good medium bodied
with excellent manufacture.</B></P>
